31737174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632353,1722378624,"Mt.Gox Creditors Reclaim 59,000 Bitcoin Via Exchanges, More Redistribution Imminent","After over a decade of suspense, creditors of the defunct Mt. Gox Bitcoin (BTC) exchange have finally begun receiving long-awaited payouts this month. Data from research firm Glassnode shows that as of Tuesday, 59,000 of Mt. Gox’s 142,000 BTC had already been distributed to creditors via the Kraken and Bitstamp exchanges, with another 79,600 BTC to follow soon. Muted Selling Pressure Expected? According to a recent report by Glassnode, the total recovered coin volume amounts to over 141,686 BTC, with nearly 59,000 BTC already finding their way to creditors and the remaining sum awaiting distribution. Kraken and Bitstamp have been entrusted as one of the five designated exchanges responsible for managing and disbursing these funds. Kraken has received 49,000 BTC and Bitstamp the initial tranche of 10,000 BTC. Notably, the firm noted that the size of these distributions already surpasses recent significant transactions in the cryptocurrency space, including crypto ETF inflows, issuance to miners, and the massive selling pressure experienced by the German government between June and July. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies Bullish Pattern That Can Send XRP Price To New Highs However, creditors opted to receive BTC rather than fiat currency, which was a new option under the Japanese bankruptcy law, suggesting that many of the creditors remain active in the Bitcoin space, despite the extensive legal process. This active participation may indicate that only a subset of the distributed coins will enter the market for sale, according to Glassnode’s analysis, which may indicate a long-term holding strategy among creditors. This ultimately supports BTC’s price rather than having an impact that could result in further price declines for the largest cryptocurrency on the market. Additionally, an analysis of the spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) metric on Kraken and Bitstamp shows only a marginal uptick in sell-side pressure, suggesting creditors may be more inclined to hold onto their BTC for the long term. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Pile In Also supporting Bitcoin’s price over the past month, which has rebounded nearly 25% after hitting a 6-month low of $53,500 on July 5. Long-term holders of the largest cryptocurrency on the market have been on a buying spree, according to market expert Ali Martinez, who recently revealed that these investors have added over 110,000 BTC to their portfolios. Similarly, the Bitcoin ETF market has had its share of the recent recovery seen in BTC’s price over the past month, with the latest data showing further inflows into the regulated market in the US. According to SoSo Value data, Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw a total of $124 million in new inflows on Monday, although Grayscale’s GBTC ETF saw outflows of about $54 million. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF had the most inflows for the day, with $206 million. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Continues Freefall, Sheds 12% In Last 7 Days – Can It Recover?

31734012,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632267,1722373235,Brace For Impact: Ethereum Whales Send Over $205 Million To Coinbase,"On-chain data suggests that some Ethereum whales might be jumping off the bandwagon amidst the ongoing tug-of-war between bulls and bears. This phenomenon has become increasingly evident as transaction data from whale trackers reveals a significant uptick in whale activity over the past 24 hours. The majority of these transactions are directed towards various crypto exchanges, indicating a possible shift in strategy or sentiment among these large-scale investors. Notably, on-chain transaction alerts from Whale_Alerts show that approximately $205 million worth of ETH has been transferred into crypto exchange Coinbase from unknown wallets within the past 24 hours. Ethereum Whales Send Huge Amounts To Coinbase As noted earlier, transaction alerts from whale transaction tracker Whale_Alerts show that 61,819 ETH were sent to the crypto exchange Coinbase in the past 24 hours from whale wallets. These transactions, collectively worth $205 million at the time of transfer, were made known through the social media platform X. Related Reading: Solana Confirms Upside Breakout With Bullish Pennant – Here’s The Target It is interesting to note that the movement into Coinbase wasn’t made through a lump sum but was made through a series of five transfers, each with an average of 10,290 ETH worth over $34 million. Interestingly, the transfers were made in such a consecutive manner that it might suggest that they were controlled by the same entity. Regardless, the movement of such a significant amount of ETH has ignited attention, as evidenced by comments on the alerts on X. Observers are speculating about the intentions behind these transfers, with most suggesting a potential liquidation. 🚨 🚨 10,291 #ETH (34,116,942 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/nDVnyKT28v — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 29, 2024 🚨 🚨 10,291 #ETH (34,162,130 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/Z5vofQNoso — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 29, 2024 🚨 🚨 10,323 #ETH (34,492,433 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/Z5rp3IHwFe — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 29, 2024 🚨 🚨 10,291 #ETH (34,097,937 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/dUggaEZ0XM — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 29, 2024 🚨 🚨 🚨 20,623 #ETH (68,335,696 USD) transferred from Coinbase Institutional to unknown new wallethttps://t.co/62HNL1iGxi — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 29, 2024 What Does This Mean For ETH? The increase in whale activity comes at a time when Ethereum is experiencing considerable volatility. ETH bulls and bears are currently engaged in a fierce battle for control after the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs. Crypto whales have considerable influence over market dynamics. Their actions are closely monitored by retail traders and analysts. As a result, these substantial Ethereum transfers to Coinbase could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. When large amounts of ETH move to exchanges, it often signals an intention to sell, which may lead to increased selling pressure. This influx of supply could drive down the price of Ethereum in the short term. Related Reading: Technical Indicators Show Strong Bitcoin Bullishness – New ATH On The Horizon? At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,340 and has struggled to maintain a position above a significant resistance level of $3,357. This resistance point represents a formidable order block, which has consistently posed challenges for bullish investors in the past 30 days. The recent substantial transfers of Ethereum to Coinbase likely contributed to the difficulty in overcoming this resistance. Despite this, there is a prevailing bullish sentiment within the trading community, with many traders anticipating initial breakouts above key order blocks around $3,357 and $3,540. In other news, the Ethereum community recently celebrated the cryptocurrency’s 9th birthday. Happy 9th birthday, Ethereum!

Users will soon be able to claim their digital titles via the DMV's application, track and manage them without getting to the office, according to an Avalanche blog post. The time to transfer vehicle titles drops to a few minutes using blockchain rails in the backend from two weeks via the traditional process, a DMV spokesperson said in an email.  Efforts to deploy blockchain tech have mostly focused on financial services with big banks and asset managers putting traditional assets such as bonds, credit and funds on distributed ledgers pursuing speedier transactions, greater transparency and increased efficiency. This is also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA).  DMV's implementation serves as an example that blockchain rails could also bring similar benefits for bureaucratic processes and managing large databases in the public service sector.

On this show, we navigate the current shaping of the crypto markets, providing insights against the broader financial landscape. Whether you're actively trading or simply fascinated by the volatility that is the crypto markets, this show is your compass to understanding what's happened, where we are, and where we're going. Good morning, everyone. Our guest today needs absolutely no introduction from venture capital, or podcasting. He's really done it all. Anthony Pompliano, welcome to Markets Daily. Of course, thanks for being here. So as you know, on this show, we really want to dig into the crypto markets. We want to hear from people who have been successful at navigating the crypto markets. So my first question to you is how you're allocating a portfolio this morning or how you're thinking about allocating a portfolio if you look at what's going on in the crypto markets this morning?  Anthony Pompliano: Thanks so much for having me.  Yeah, so I don't really think just about the crypto market. I think kind of more broadly about finance in general and all asset markets. Our portfolio really is, crypto is a dominant percentage, more than 50%. But, we also have large allocations to Osage venture capital. And then we've got some real estate. And then increasingly, we're doing more and more stuff in the public markets as well. On the crypto side, I would say that, you know, the majority of it is in Bitcoin. It's a position that we've held for a long time. We’ve added to it throughout the years and it's something that we kind of look at as a 20, 30 plus year investment. We don't really trade at all. We don't think about possibly selling based on price levels. It really is just kind of buy, hold a great asset forever and then hopefully I give it to my grandkids. The second biggest position in the portfolio is Solana. That's a relatively new thing. We started putting that position on back around 45, 48 dollars I think last year.and then added to it on the way up pretty consistently. And that's grown substantially as position size and now second largest. And, then I would say that other things in crypto that we're really excited about, we sold a company earlier this year called Reflexivity Research to a publicly traded company called DeFi Technologies. DeFi Technologies does ETPs across Europe for kind of the long tail of crypto assets.  And, they've got a really strong business and seem to be doing pretty well. And so, you know, really just thinking about if crypto is a sector that we want to invest in, how do you get exposure across many different, you know, kind of aspects, both from liquid cryptocurrencies, private companies in terms of venture capital, and then also some of the public companies as well.  JS: You mentioned Sol there, most of the folks who come on this show have their two biggest crypto allocations as Bitcoin and Ether. But you just said you have Sol as your second biggest. I know that you're bullish on Sol. Talk to me a little bit about your investment thesis when it comes to Solana over Ether.  AP: Yeah, I mean, you know my experience with Solana really was we were LPs in Multicoin's Fund I and Multicoin Fund I invested in Solana. I think that they did it at less than a dollar, like a couple of pennies. And so there was this explosive move in the bull market of kind 2020 and 2021. Those guys did a fantastic job, I think, of managing that position, capturing a lot of profits there. And then, you know, when they were giving us kind of in-kind distributions,  I was saying to myself and to my partners, I don't know what this is, right? We literally had spent no time on it, didn't understand it and didn't know what to do with the Solana. Do we hold it? Do we sell it? You where do we go? And so obviously in the bear market, it dropped significantly all the way down to I think $8. And then it started to kind of come back. And, one of the things that was interesting to me as I began to look at, why did it not die? It reminded me a lot of Bitcoin, right? Multiple times. Why did that not die? But second was I started to see the beginning  activity on Solana starting to eat into some of the ether activity or Ethereum activity. And not so much in a game of like Ethereum is not going to be strong or it's not going to see the token price go up, but more so just the mispriced opportunity, right? If you think that both activities are going to go up, Solana's activity may just go up at a faster rate. They may actually eat into some of the market share that Ethereum has for certain things like DEX activity or token launches, et cetera.  And so, if that was to occur, then you could expect the price of the sol token to go up more than the ether token. And that really was, you know, kind of the analysis. And so, you know, as I've shared previously, I sold any of the ether that I personally held kind of around the end of last year, beginning of this year, somewhere, wherever sol was trading at, you know, 70 early $70, $73, something like that. And so far its played out. And you know, I continue to believe that the Solana activity numbers and you know, kind of various macro factors will allow that asset specifically to continue to perform quite attractively. And so we're just holding  JS: Anthony, what's the worst investment you've ever made?  AP: The biggest investment mistakes are definitely investments I didn't make, which is kind of like a dumb answer. But if you look at it from a pure capital that was not captured or capital that was lost, there was a number of different companies that early on I saw and just didn't pull the trigger. I remember working at Facebook and I met with one of the executives at DoorDash. And the company was very small, very early. And, I could have had an opportunity to invest. I didn't do it. And so when you see those things, you kind of learn over time that the very large asymmetric bets, sometimes it is worth just taking it because the risk reward is so skewed. But those definitely are the ones that kind of cost me the most money are just things that I didn't do and should have.  JS: Let's take the DoorDash example for a second. Why didn't you make that investment? Talk me through your analysis… And what it was about DoorDash that made you skip on that investment?  AP: I'd never made any investments before. I was very much in the operator mindset. I was working at Facebook. I was focused on my job. was frankly, if I was going to do anything with them, I probably would have been like, hey, maybe I should go work there, kind of help on the growth team or something like that. But instead, knowing now what I know, I would have been talking to them from an investor standpoint. I would have said, hey, can I put money into this? And so when you see that, part of it is not just evaluating a specific investment, but also what mindset are you in? How many different early stage startups did I talk to the founders, did I even help the founders over the years before I realized, maybe I should also put money into these companies. And so that was a huge unlock for me personally in my career was putting capital to work, not just kind of being helpful, obviously drives a financial return. And then the other thing that I would say is, understanding kind of portfolio construction. There's one thing to say…Hey, I've got a really high conviction in something like Bitcoin. It's probably not going to go to zero. And so maybe I could lose, you know, 10, 20%, 30 % of my money, but it's not like I'm going to lose everything. In venture, you can lose everything. And so really understanding the dynamics of like, well, you have to build a portfolio of these in order to drive an overall return is something that, you know, just took me a while to learn. And then once I understood it, you know, put me in a much better position to allocate capital.  JS: You mentioned just at the top of the show that you plan on holding Bitcoin for 20 or 30 years. We heard from Senator Lamas at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville on the weekend. She put together a proposal for the government to hold Bitcoin for about 20 years to start tackling national debt. I know that you saw those remarks. I know that you've made comments on that. But, just curious to hear your thoughts on what you think of Lummis' plan and holding Bitcoin in the National Reserve to start tackling the $35 trillion worth of debt that this country has.  AP: Yeah, I, you know, I understand what Senator Lummis is saying here. I think it's a very clever idea. I think, you know, whether the United States holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a strategic reserve or as a strategic stockpile, right, actually backing the dollar or not, I think is separate and distinct from kind of the national debt conversation. It's very hard to see a world where the Bitcoin that the United States would hold would actually, you know, make a significant dent in that. You know, if you look at kind of buying 1 million Bitcoin, 68, $70 billion today. If that goes up significantly, let's say 20X, it still doesn't even cover 10 % of the national debt. We actually are growing the debt faster than Bitcoin is growing. And so the debt would continue to expand. But I do think that it's the right mentality. I think that the courage, frankly, that Senator Lummis has to not only do the work, put together the legislation, you know go present it, stake her own kind of social capital on doing something like that is commendable. And so really now that the idea is whether you think it's for national debt or for other purposes, the consensus is forming that people across political aisle want the US government to hold Bitcoin. Then you saw that with some of leading presidential candidates, but also now you're seeing it with senators and congressmen. You're seeing it kind of in the regular constituency, both Republicans, Democrats, independents. They all are interested in this happening. And so we're probably not at the point where that consensus is strong enough for it to happen tomorrow. But I do think within the next five years or so, there's likely to be enough consensus where you're gonna start to see that occurring at some degree on the national level.  JS: You know, we've been talking about the elections for probably every day on this show now. Curious to get your thoughts on what you think a Trump presidency could mean for the crypto industry versus a Harris presidency.  AP: Yeah, I mean, you this is one of those things that there's a lot of narrative and then there's kind of the facts and the data. And if you look at, you know, kind of the current administration, they have made more progress for the crypto industry than any other administration before them. Coinbase went public. We got the Bitcoin ETF and we got the Ether ETF. Those three things probably did more for the crypto industry than, you know, all other things combined previously.  In terms of regulators allowing for certain activity. So although the industry, rightfully so, has seen the current administration as being abrasive, there still was quite a bit of progress that occurred in that abrasive environment. And so, if we get a president, regardless of which president it is, who simply says, hey, we're going to be friendlier, you would expect there to be an explosion of kind of positive developments. Now, what is interesting to go down that thread is  Well, what are the other things that you really want the regulators to do? Right. Maybe it is approve more ETFs. And so you kind of start going down a coin market cap lists or something of ETFs. Maybe there is something around kind of clear guidance for early stage startups, you know, in terms of token launches or the use of tokens. But the list is probably, you know, five things or less that really the regulators specifically can go and do. Now, if you go and then you add Congress, the Senate, even the president.  And, some of the legislation that could be passed. We've seen multiple bills around accounting rules and things like that that aren't necessarily the SEC or the CFTC. That list may expand from five or less to maybe there's like 25 things that could be done. And so I do think the bulk of a lot of the things people want done are actually in the legislative process, not necessarily from the regulators. Although the call three to five things that people want the regulators to do are really, really important as well.  And so really what we're talking about here is a regime shift or a mentality shift, not just around regulation, but also from the political class in general. And if you go around the world, you've seen this happen before. People kind of ignore it, then they fight it, and eventually, the industry wins. And so I think that's what ultimately is going to happen here in the United States is we're kind of coming off of the fighting phase, and we're starting into the winning phase for the industry.  JS: I want to broaden the conversation out and talk about areas outside of the United States. I know you tweeted recently that governments all over the world are probably talking about how Bitcoin might benefit them after the weekend's remarks. But do think that governments are watching what's happening here with the election and starting to think about how their policies might impact crypto innovation there and maybe how they can start holding Bitcoin in their reserves?  AP: I definitely think that governments around the world watch the United States, right, for nothing else than to be informed, but possibly even to copy. And you see this with central banks are a great example. The ECB said for a while, we're not going to raise rates, we're not going to raise rates. And then they sort of raised the rates after the US did it. And so I think that the United States is the leader on the global stage, especially in the financial markets. People look to us for guidance and leadership. And if you are a president somewhere in the world, and you hear that two of the three leading presidential candidates are talking about a strategic stockpile of Bitcoin for the US, you start asking your team, what is our Bitcoin strategy? What should we do? Should we go buy some before them? If they buy that Bitcoin, the price is going to go up. It's going to be more expensive for us to buy it later. And so this global game theory between governments ends up playing out. And I think ultimately presidents around the world are saying to themselves, you know, I'm not going to sit back and just be the follower all the time.  Maybe we should actually be a leader on our own. And so, you know, whether that actually occurs or not remains to be seen. But, you one of the funny things to me is if you are a country and you want to create a strategic stockpile, then you should buy the Bitcoin and then tell people you did it. You should not tell them you're going to buy it and then go buy it because you're, yeah, you're likely to affect the price in a negative way.  JS: Makes sense. How likely do you think it is the US has a strategic stockpile of Bitcoin in the near future?  AP: Well, the United States already has 210,000 Bitcoin give or take in its possession. It's had many more over the years, but their kind of strategy has been to sell that and get cash. And so does the U.S. government hold Bitcoin today? Yes. Is it a strategic stockpile? I don't think that's how they view it. But I do think that, I don't know, over the next 10, 15 years, for sure, the United States will have some Bitcoin on its balance sheet or kind of in a strategic stockpile. I think the question really just becomes, how aggressive are we in that?  And then also what is possible, you know, obviously RFK came out and said that the United States should buy 4 million Bitcoin. I don't think that's mathematically possible given how illiquid the market is, the trend of that illiquidity, and then also the amount of capital that would be needed in order to buy that Bitcoin over, you know, call it a 15, 20 year period. It just would become, you know, very difficult to see a world where we could spend that much money to do it. And so it's more likely that, you know, it's a smaller number but it's something that I definitely think will occur at some point.  JS: It's interesting you bring up the fact that you don't think that's mathematically possible. And it brings me to this question. Do you think that the politicians are talking about Bitcoin to get the attention of the industry with no...real plan to act to the drastic measures that they are speaking about. Because like you said, in a lot of these cases, it's not mathematically possible or it doesn't actually make sense to address the massive growing number of debt in the country.  AP: Yeah, mean, four million is probably not possible. One million probably is, right? So we're still talking directionally the same thing. It's just that the magnitude or the size ends up being a little bit different. On top of that, look, politicians are politicians, right? And part of what they are supposed to do is they are supposed to represent the will of the people. One of the things that most people get kind of incorrect is that they're like, I'm trying to evaluate the politician based on what they believe. Well, actually the politicians supposed to represent what we believe as the people and so you know the negative view of that is they're pandering they're basically saying what we, you know, they think we want to hear and then they're going to get an office do whatever they want. The positive view of it is no, they're listening to their constituency and their constituency is telling them, I want you to be pro-Bitcoin. So the smart ones are saying I'm pro- Bitcoin. so, you know, regardless, yes, their campaign promises, promises is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. And so do they have to fulfill the promises? Not necessarily. But I do think that there's a lot of people who are going to go into the ballot box and they're going to say, well, I have two candidates that I'm voting for three candidates that I'm going to evaluate the promises of today.  And one of them is promising me something I like and the other is promising me something I don't like regardless of what they're going to do. I can only evaluate the promises today. And so obviously I'm going to go for the person who's promising me a positive thing. And so it's this weird thing where, you know, people always get hung up on like, the politician do what they promised? Well, you you should expect that they probably aren't going to do a hundred percent of what they promised. And, one of the things I always point to is how many presidents have talked about, you know, releasing some sort of information.  The JFK assassination files, I think Trump had said, hey, I'm going to release this information, gets in the office, doesn't do it. And from people I know that were kind of close to the administration, he basically learned new information and then decided against it. And so if that is true and that's how it played out, well, we don't know what that information is. And so how do we evaluate? Maybe if we had that information, we'd also agree not to release it. And so it becomes this weird dynamic where constituents and the population want to critique politicians, but we don't have all the information they have. And so that doesn't mean we should trust them, right? We should be actually be very kind of skeptical of the promises they make and the things that they say they're going to do. But I do think that also sometimes we should understand, you know, if we had all of the information, we actually may make the same decisions, which is kind of a little bit weird, given how I think much disdain most people have for kind of political class.  JS: I think those are all great points to make ahead of the election in November now. I know we only have a few minutes left and I really have been waiting to ask you this question because I know you're a former army sergeant and it's not uncommon to come across former military who are now founders or operating at high levels in venture capital. And I was curious to get your thoughts on what you think it is about people with military experience that makes them such successful founders and CEOs.  AP: Well, I mean, you the military does a fantastic job, I think, breaking people down and then rebuilding them to be one leaders, but also to thrive in kind of chaotic, uncertain environments. Right. And if you think of the stakes when they're doing that training. It tends to be life or death. And so when you kind of take that and bring it to something like the business world, you need leadership. You need to be able to understand and be resilient and thrive in that uncertain environment. But the stakes are much lower. And so I think that people have been exposed to some of the extreme stresses of military or kind combat deployments. They end up actually thriving even more in a much more relaxed environment of the business world where the stress is kind of a different type of stress.  And so, you know, it I think is a very natural progression because at the end of the day, business is just leading people to accomplish something. And there's a lot of similarities to what the military is doing in the same way.  JS: When you're looking at businesses to invest in, do you look at the founders and the experiences they've had in the past? Maybe it's not military experience, but do you look for extraordinary experiences in founders when you're thinking about investing in their companies?  AP: We're looking for winners and winning can come in many different forms. But when you're evaluating a founder, you want to find someone who is going to be able to get the job done. In that, depending on the industry, depending on the stage of the company, depending on a lot of the competitive components to what they're doing, can be very, very different. Sometimes you need somebody who is very type A personality, somebody who has a long track record of success. But then other times, you actually need somebody who is much more kind of introverted, much younger, much more technical, and frankly, is too naive to understand what they're trying to do is possible. And so really understanding, what is the task at hand and what is the type of person who's most likely to be successful here. It's a case by case scenario.  JS: All right, we got one minute left. got to ask you, I've asked you what your worst investment you ever made was. What's the best?  AP: Probably investing in my family. you know, if, I kept the scorecard of all the financial investments, you know, I probably would, would be pretty proud of that. But frankly, all of the financial investments don't stack up to, kind of just investing in, you know, human relationships and, making sure that you're happy every day. And, you know, if you can remember that, all of the investing is just a game that we play on the internet. It's a lot easier to not get too excited when things are going well and not get too down when things aren't going well.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,"Jennifer Sanasie, Melissa Montañez",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/30/anthony-pompliano-bitcoin-will-be-on-us-balance-sheet-in-next-10-15-years-and-investing-in-solana-for-less-than-a-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31ca6f437b81910af6e1ba36ef18af29a8d3dcc3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The plan proposes establishing a ""Bitcoin Purchase Program"" of up to 200,000 BTC a year over a five-year period.  U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis's plan for a new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would finance purchases of the cryptocurrency partly by revaluing gold certificates held by the Federal Reserve System, according to a draft of the legislation obtained by CoinDesk.  Lummis, a Wyoming Republican who is known for her Bitcoin-friendly policy stance, announced her intention to propose the reserve on Saturday at the Bitcoin Nashville conference. She came onstage just minutes after former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee in this year's presidential race, delivered a speech on blockchain policy before the cheering room, filled to its 8,500-person capacity.  Read More: The U.S. Government May Begin Hoarding Bitcoin, But How and Why?  Trump, during this speech, endorsed using the U.S. government's existing bitcoin holdings – primarily obtained through forfeitures and seizures related to criminal cases – to form the ""core"" of a new ""strategic national bitcoin stockpile.""  According to the draft bill, under the working short title of ""Bitcoin Act of 2024,"" the Treasury secretary would ""establish a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin storage facilities distributed across the U.S.,"" selecting the locations for the vaults ""based on a comprehensive risk assessment, prioritizing geographic diversity, security and accessibility.""  The Treasury secretary would establish a ""Bitcoin Purchase Program"" of up to 200,000 BTC a year over a five-year period, for a total of 1 million, according to the draft. The bitcoin would be held for at least 20 years and could only be disposed of for the purpose of paying off federal debt. After that, no more than 10% of the assets could be sold during any two-year period.  The bitcoin purchases would be financed through a few methods, describe in the draft bill as ""offsetting the cost of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.""  The plan calls for the setting aside of $6 billion from any net earnings remitted by Federal Reserve to the Treasury from fiscal years 2025 through 2029, and it would reduce the discretionary surplus funds of Federal Reserve banks to $2.4 billion from $6.825 billion, the level that's currently stipulated in the Federal Reserve Act.  Revaluing the Fed's gold  There's also the revaluation of Federal Reserve banks' gold certificates to reflect their fair market value.  Under the plan, within six months of enactment of the legislation, Federal Reserve banks would tender all of their oustanding gold certificates to the Treasury secretary. Within 90 days after that, the Treasury secretary would issue ""new gold certificates to the Federal Reserve banks that reflect the fair market value price of the gold.""  The Federal Reserve banks would then ""remit the difference in cash value between the old and new certificates"" to the Treasury secretary.  Read More: Anthony Pompliano: Bitcoin Will Be on U.S. Balance Sheet in 'Next 10, 15 Years'  As of July 24, Federal Reserve banks held ""gold stock"" valued at $11 billion, according to the central bank's most recent balance sheet update.  That valuation might be based on the official U.S. book value of $42.22 per troy ounce, which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York uses to value its gold.  But the market value of the gold is more than 50 times higher, with front-month futures contracts on the yellow metal trading around $2,400, based on MarketWatch pricing.

Although prices retraced yesterday, with the July 29 bar closing with a long upper wick pointing to weakness, ETH holders are upbeat, expecting gains above $4,000. Roughly 30% Of All ETH Staked, Validators Stand At Over 1 Million As Ethereum rejects lower lows and cements its place at second in the market cap leaderboard, other developments could spark demand in the coming sessions. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Continues Freefall, Sheds 12% In Last 7 Days – Can It Recover? Taking to X, analyst Leon Waidmann noted that a record 28% of all ETH in circulation has been locked, an all-time high. According to CryptoQuant data, as of July 29, 33.3 million ETH were locked. Parallel data from Beaconcha.in reveals that there are over one million validators. At the same time, over 33.6 million ETH have been staked. Additionally, of all the validators helping secure and process transactions, each operating node has locked 32.06 ETH on average. Holders Pulling ETH From Exchanges, Demand From Spot Ethereum ETF Issuers While more ETH continues to be staked, on-chain data also reveals that holders are concurrently pulling more coins from leading exchanges. As of July 30, CryptoQuant data shows that all crypto exchanges held just 16.6 million ETH. It is down from the 32.5 million under their control three years ago in July 2021. Usually, the more ETH is pulled from exchanges, the more confident holders are. Through Binance or Coinbase, users can easily swap tokens for other assets, including Bitcoin or stablecoins. Given this, that they are moving their coins away from these platforms means either they are keen on holding or engaging in other ecosystem activities like decentralized finance (DeFi) via portals like Maker or even staking for an annual yield. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes $63,000: Key Indicators Signal Further Decline – Time To Sell? The combination of ETH moving from exchanges and holders choosing to stake makes the coin more scarce.

42390696,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5i0b,1722367386,"Making Bitcoin a Strategic Reserve Asset Contradicts 'Freedom From Government' Narrative, Says WSJ","Former president Donald Trump's alleged plan to make bitcoin a strategic reserve asset doesn't align with crypto's values, the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal wrote.  Trump said at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville last week that bitcoin stands for freedom and independence from the government, among other things, but that view doesn't align with how he would use bitcoin if he gets elected in November, the WSJ wrote.  The former president and current Republican nominee for this year’s presidential election caused chatter in the crypto industry earlier this month after several reports said he would announce those plans at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville last weekend.  He did – partially – but he also told attendees that bitcoin stands for “freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control.”  But his views and plans don’t match up, the WSJ wrote.  “Freedom from government isn’t what he’s proposing,” the op-ed states. “He wants all future bitcoin to be made in America, which is a limit on freedom and would require a much bigger electric grid since bitcoin mining is energy intensive.”  The editorial board also criticized his alleged plans to make the cryptocurrency a “strategic reserve asset,” which it claims is based on a proposal by Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.)  According to the planned legislation, which Lummis announced at the conference, bitcoin could help hedge against rising inflation and foster the United States’ growth in the global financial system while also securing the U.S. dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency.  “She says the government could reduce the national debt by investing in bitcoin,” the WSJ argued. “[...] If crypto currencies really are a libertarian vehicle to invest free from political vagaries, then they should trade on their own without government help.”  Trump’s “sketchy plan” to make Lummis’ bill a reality if he indeed takes office in January echoes the many contradictions of the billionaire’s MAGA platform while also clashing with much of what crypto stands for, the op-ed said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/30/making-bitcoin-a-strategic-reserve-asset-contradicts-freedom-from-government-narrative-says-wsj,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e489bd1541dfe13f1b2b4e867c5245738c7f9eb8-7781x5187.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390701,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5iQF,1722365860,"Coinbase Earnings Hurt by Low Volume But Trump Could be Wild Card, Analysts Say","Analysts expect Coinbase's (COIN) earnings to take a hit in the second-quarter as trading volume slowed down from the prior months.  Estimates collected by FactSet predict overall revenue dropped to $1.37 billion while earnings-per-share stood at $0.94.  U.S. election shaping up to be an important catalyst for the stock, one analyst said.  Analysts expect a significant drop in Coinbase’s (COIN) second quarter earnings compared to the first quarter, as trading volume and transaction revenue lowered across the industry.  The crypto exchange reports earnings after the bell on Thursday with estimates collected by FactSet predicting overall revenue dropping to $1.37 billion from $1.64 billion in the previous quarter. Still, on year-over-year basis, this would be a 94% increase.  Earnings-per-share are estimated to land at $0.94 versus the whopping $4.40 in the first quarter but $0.46 from a year ago.  “May was a positive month for the crypto ecosystem amid the U.S. Ether spot ETFs approval, however, we saw markets contract in both April and June, muddling the quarter’s aggregate performance,” analysts at J.P. Morgan wrote.  JPM, which has a neutral rating and price target of $171 by the end of the year on COIN, sees earnings-per-shares at $0.30 with revenue of $1.36 billion.  Analysts at Barclays echoed the sentiment. “Crypto market activity spiked in March but has reversed since, and Street exchange volume and revenue estimates look too high.” The British bank expects $1.432 billion in revenue and $1.79 earnings-per-share for the second quarter and adjusted its price target down 4% to $196 for the end of this year. Barclays rates COIN as an underweight.  To back its predictions, Barclays looked at retail trading data from online broker Robinhood (HOOD) which publishes monthly metrics for its platform and typically correlates with trading on Coinbase. According to the data, trading activity softened in the first two months of this quarter and the firm’s crypto retail trading volumes declined 35% from the first quarter.  Based on those numbers, Barclays expects Coinbase’s retail volumes to have dripped roughly 30%. A slow down for Coinbase may also indicate how Robinhood's earnings will shape up when it reports on Aug. 7.  However, the investment banking firm Oppenheimer (PT: $282, outperform ) added a bit of optimism, saying that the upcoming election could act as a positive catalyst for the stock. ""Since our meetings with legislators in May, our thesis has been that Coinbase would benefit the most in our coverage if former President Donald Trump is re-elected. Recent events including Trump's continuing to speak in Bitcoin conferences in-person only increase our confidence,"" the firm's analyst wrote.  In fact, former president Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance might have tied the entire digital asset market to the outcome of the presidential election. The political undertone became even more apparent when Trump delivered his speech recently at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in front of a cheering audience. In it, his promises to the community included firing SEC chair Gary Gensler and unveiling his plans to make BTC the national reserve if he is elected.

The firm predicted that Coinbase generated revenue of $20 million in the second quarter, down from $32 million in the prior quarter.  JP Morgan (PT: $181) analysts also said that activity on Base networked mellowed in the second quarter. Although they pointed out that profitability increased exponentially after the Ethereum’s Dencun Upgrade in March which lowered the cost of activity on the network's Layer-2 chains, including Base.

42390713,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5qc1,1722364593,Russia Legalizes Crypto Mining and Brings an Experimental Regime,"Russia has passed one law legalizing cryptocurrency mining from November 1, 2024.  A second experimental law allowing the central bank to authorize selected companies to conduct cross-border settlements and exchange trading in digital currency was also passed.  Russia's lower house of the Federal Assembly, known as the State Duma, has passed two crypto-related laws on Tuesday, a Russia based policy expert told CoinDesk and Ria Novosti, Russia's state-owned domestic news agency reported.  The first law fully legalizes cryptocurrency mining in Russia from Nov. 1, 2024. Legal entities and individual entrepreneurs registered with the Ministry of Digital Development can engage in mining, while those who are not registered can only operate mining rigs if they do not exceed energy consumption limits, Ria Novosti reported.  Oversight over mining activities will be spread between different institutions with the Bank of Russia seemingly having overriding powers.  The cabinet of ministers will independently establish a scope of requirements for activities of the mining infrastructure operators. Other requirements, including for mining pool participants, will be approved by the Russian government in agreement with the Bank of Russia, the report said.  Miners will also need to provide information to the government-authorized body about the digital currency obtained as a result of mining.  The authorized body and the central bank will have the right to introduce a ban or restriction on transactions with digital currency to maintain Russia's monetary stability.  This law also brings into effect a ban on advertising cryptocurrencies and offering them to an unlimited number of people.  The second law, which comes into effect on Sept. 1, 2024, is a special experimental regime which hands the Bank of Russia powers to allow authorized companies to conduct cross-border settlements and exchange trading in digital currency.  Companies, exchanges and crypto entities will need to apply to the central bank to become part of this experimental regime, said Anti Danilevski, founder and CEO of Kick Ecosystem.  ""The Bank of Russia will be able to conduct not one, but three experiments from September 1 of this year: on the use of cryptocurrency for settlements in foreign trade, on the conduct of exchange trading in cryptocurrency, and on the creation of an electronic platform for operations with cryptocurrency based on the NPS,"" a separate Ria Novosti report said.

31731438,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632239,1722362446,Dogecoin & Other Memecoins Seeing Less Interest Than Bitcoin: Data,"Data shows social media users are currently not paying much attention to memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) as compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and other top caps. Bitcoin & Other Layer 1 Top Caps Getting All The Investor Focus Right Now According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, social media users are showing increased focus on the top layer 1 assets as compared to memecoin and other sectors. The indicator of relevance here is the “Social Dominance,” which is based on another metric called the Social Volume. The Social Volume basically tells us about the amount of discussion that any given topic or term is receiving on the major social media platforms. The indicator makes this measurement by counting up all posts/threads/messages that make at least one mention of the keyword. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready For $0.3? Analysts Bullish On DOGE Price Breakout Attempt The reason that the indicator doesn’t simply count up the mentions themselves is so that just a few posts with a large amount of mentions can’t skew the value by themselves. When the Social Volume spikes, it means the users across social media are talking about the term and not just niche circles. Now, the Social Dominance, the actual indicator of interest here, keeps track of the percentage of the combined Social Volume of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap that a given coin or group of coins is occupying right now. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Social Dominance for four segments of the sector over the past month: As displayed in the graph, the Social Dominance of the top 6 layer 1 assets has recently been the highest in the sector. “Layer 1” networks refer to those blockchains that handle their own security and aren’t built on top of another network. The networks that are built on these primary chains are titled Layer 2. Some of the top layer 1 coins are Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). While these layer 1 coins are enjoying a high dominance of discussions in the sector now, this wasn’t the case just earlier in the month. Back then, the other segments of the sector had been getting the focus instead. From the chart, it’s visible that the top layer 2 coins, like Polygon (MATIC) and the top meme coins, like Dogecoin, have been receiving notable talk on social media. While this does mean that investors aren’t interested in assets like Dogecoin right now, the fact that the focus is on Bitcoin and other top caps could actually be a bullish development for the sector as a whole. Related Reading: Minimal Bitcoin On-Chain Resistance Ahead: Price Set For New ATH? “Crypto’s consistent rises occur most often when there is a focus on top caps (a sign of caution) rather than more speculative assets (a sign of greed),” explains Santiment.

42390724,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5rbZ,1722360417,"The U.S. Government May Begin Hoarding Bitcoin, But How and Why?","Legislation has been proposed for the United States government to stock up a pile of bitcoin for a strategic reserve, starting with seized bitcoin the government already holds.  Many have questions: What’s the legality of keeping the seized bitcoin? How is holding bitcoin going to decrease the deficit? Why does the U.S. government need to have a bitcoin reserve?  President Donald Trump’s appearance at the Bitcoin Conference has come and gone and, if you missed it, what transpired was a combo campaign stump and crypto speech. (You can read a partial transcript of the speech here.)  CoinDesk reporters who were at the conference and at the speech published reflections: Here in pictures on the entire conference by Brad Keoun, and here for the quickflash story after Trump’s speech by Team CoinDesk.  As for me, I wasn’t there, but I kept my eye on the weekend’s proceedings. In my view (and many others), the main theme from this year’s bitcoin conference was politics. This is quite the divergence from 2022 when I took the theme to be open-source technology.  By far the leading “political” item everyone seems to be talking about is that the U.S. government could soon begin to build a strategic reserve of bitcoin. At the conference, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) announced she is working on a bill that would set aside the country's existing holdings of more than 200,000 bitcoins and add to it until the U.S. builds to a million bitcoins. As for these many billions of U.S. dollars of bitcoins, the government “would be required to hold onto the Bitcoin for 20 years, the only thing it could be used to pay for during that time period is paying down our country’s national debt.”  And based on his Saturday speech, Trump is on board too! On-stage he said, “And so, as the final part of my plan today, I am announcing that if I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration … to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future ... This will serve, in effect, as the core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile.”  “Most of the bitcoin currently held by the [government] was obtained through law enforcement action. You know that. They took it from you. Let's take that guy's life. Let's take his family, his house, his bitcoin. We'll turn it into bitcoin. It's been taken away from you, because that's where we're going now. That's where this country is going to – fascist regime. And so I will take steps to transform that vast wealth into a permanent national asset to benefit all Americans …”  Well that’s certainly something. Naturally we all have questions. Like: “How?,” “What?” and “Why?”  These questions will be answered, definitively, in time (one hopes). But for now, I have three questions and/or thoughts top of my mind.  How, what, and why  First, I have a question about the bitcoin the U.S. government holds. They can’t just take the bitcoin it seized and keep it for itself à la civil forfeiture, can they? Especially since we know for a fact that roughly 95,000 of those bitcoins belong to people who had it stolen from them by criminals. Sure, the U.S. government has custody of 200,000 bitcoins, but is it really the U.S. government’s (actually, yes, since bitcoin is a bearer asset, it sort of is the U.S. government’s bitcoin, there’s a lesson in there about self-custody)? Is Sen. Lummis going to go in front of the legislature and say: “Hey, remember all those bitcoins that were stolen that we stole back when we caught the bad guys? It’s ours now. We’ll keep it.” I can’t imagine that going over well. So from the get, we have an issue of provenance.  Second, if this bill becomes policy, this is the U.S. government going long on bitcoin and that’s definitely… weird. Somewhat complicating matters, Trump said during his speech: “The federal government almost has 210,000 bitcoin or 1% total supply that will ever exist. But for too long our government has violated the cardinal rule that every bitcoiner knows by heart: Never sell your bitcoin.”  Obviously a line from a speech is not the same as codified law, so maybe the U.S. government will sell through parts of its stock of bitcoin. We’ll see. And not to be overly negative, but Lummis’s plan says the U.S. government won’t be able to sell its bitcoin stash for 20 years, except to pay off national debt. If you thought the overhang of the potential sale of returned Mt. Gox coins was bad for bitcoin’s price, then imagine a million government bitcoins (that’s more than $65 billion) which might be sold at the drop of a hat to pay down the national deficit. Or slowly over the course of a year. Bloodbath.  Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly: Why? Why does the United States need a reserve of bitcoin? When I think of “U.S. government reserve,” I think of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) which is an emergency stockpile of petroleum maintained by the Department of Energy (DOE) and released into the market whenever petroleum is expensive or scarce for whatever reason. And the DOE maintains the SPR for a good reason: If all the petroleum in the world disappeared right this second the entire world would fall apart. Now just think, if bitcoin disappeared, would the entire world fall apart?  I mean, yes, I’d be out of a job and I’d probably lose a lot of money, but the entire world? And I love Bitcoin, I do, but is this necessary? What’s the point?  In fairness, the U.S. government does hold a huge reserve of gold, ~20% of all gold in the world, if presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is to be believed, who in his bitcoin conference speech the day before President Trump called for a four million bitcoin reserve (four times as much as the Lummis bill!) to match the massive share of supply in bitcoin as it does with gold. And since bitcoin is supposed to be digital gold, what’s the difference?  The difference lies in that gold has been money for longer than bitcoin (and the dollar even) and, once upon a time, the dollar was backed by gold, so the U.S. government had to have gold. And it still holds a lot of gold.  Anyway, I hope more clarity comes, because I’m not quite buying this yet, and I look forward to seeing our unanswered questions answered.  In the meantime, I will lift the closing words from Trump’s 2024 Bitcoin Conference speech: “Have a good time with your bitcoin and your crypto and everything else that you're playing with.”  We will, President Trump. We will.

42390722,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5rgh,1722360023,Women in Crypto Earn More Than Men,"Pantera Capital recently conducted the largest compensation survey in crypto, with 502 general survey participants. When we got the results we discovered something surprising: crypto, unlike almost every other industry we know of, pays women more than men.  This finding is a bright spot for an industry that struggles with its mainstream public perception. At non-crypto companies in the U.S., a woman generally earns 84 cents for every dollar a man earns. In crypto, women earn about 15% more than men based on median base salaries, translating to $1.15 for every dollar a man makes.  Looking specifically at occupational groups, the “Producers and Directors” group within the entertainment industry is the only other field where women earn higher pay than men. While other advanced degree professions are approaching equal pay, the reality is that even within the Web2 tech industry, men still outearn women by a notable margin.  Numerous economic studies have been conducted to identify the factors underlying the non-crypto wage gap. Likely explanations include gender bias in hiring, intra-household division of labor and selection into lower paying industries. While more research needs to be conducted into the underlying factors explaining the reversed wage gap in crypto, our data suggests that experience plays an important role.  Women in crypto tend to be more experienced and often in mid-level to senior positions, with over five years of experience in similar roles. In contrast, a larger proportion of men occupy entry-level positions.  But even controlling for experience, women still out-earn men in crypto. The authors suggest that a plausible explanation consistent with the data is that in crypto, women are “lindy.” To be lindy is to have overcome some hurdle which predicts your future success. This idea implies that women who have overcome hurdles in the crypto industry possess unobservable qualities like resilience and high competence, which, combined with their time in the industry, result in higher pay.  Another theory is that men in crypto are underpaid compared to women. This theory seems less likely as it would suggest a higher overall number of women in crypto, drawn to the better pay, which we do not observe. We would also expect to see many more early-career women in crypto seeking high pay, but again their presence is minimal, making this theory a poor fit for our data.  Lastly, the idea that women are more risk-averse and that crypto is a risky career is plausible but does not align well with the data either. Typically, people’s risk tolerance decreases over time, suggesting fewer experienced women in such a volatile field. However, the data shows a significant presence of women with substantial experience in the industry, making it unclear why there would be such a pronounced effect based on experience levels alone.  The reversed wage gap in the crypto industry may suggest that it offers better opportunities for women than traditional fields. While it's important to recognize that women will likely continue to face obstacles in this industry, the relatively fair wages in crypto indicate a potential move towards greater gender equity. This marks a progressive trend in this fairly new field, offering hope for a more balanced future.

42390706,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5qCN,1722358103,WazirX Co-Founder Nischal Shetty Says All Options Are on the Table for Fund Recovery,"WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty told CoinDesk the exchange has asked other exchanges for help after it suffered a $230 million hack – worth nearly 45% of customer funds – earlier this month, without naming any entities.  Shetty said he could not disclose how much INR (Indian rupees) WazirX held on its books because that could ""open up a new attack vector for someone right now.""  Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX’s co-founder Nischal Shetty told CoinDesk that outreach efforts to different exchanges ""are going to be crucial,"" as it remains open to ""everything that is possible to help solve this situation.""  WazirX is effectively closed after the exchange stopped trading and withdrawals after the hack on July 18.  Shetty said his exchange would learn from past hacks in one of his first interviews since WazirX lost $230 million earlier this month, saying he hoped other industry players would step in to help relieve his customers' losses.  In the past few days, Shetty’s WazirX faced industry and customer heat for a user survey on the next steps, which it clarified was not legally binding, an on-going blame-game with custody provider Liminal over whose system was breached, and the tough question of when the exchange would open to trading again.  On several questions, Shetty declined to comment citing legal, confidentiality or ongoing investigation obligations.  Opinion Poll  Customers and industry colleagues, including at least three co-founders of rival cryptocurrency exchanges, criticized WazirX’s ""Withdrawal Management Programme: Opinion Poll,"" which the exchange revealed over the weekend.  The opinion poll by WazirX gave customers two choices – access 55% of their funds without withdrawals and get first priority for when potential recovery funds come through or access 55% of their funds with withdrawals with second priority to potential recovery proceeds.  Given the $230 million hacked amount was 45% of the customer funds, the company is only able to give access to the remaining 55% of funds to its customers. If customers choose option A they will get access to trade 55% of their funds but won’t be able to withdraw and will get first priority on recovered funds over those customers whose funds were not among the stolen funds.  Option B gives customers the choice to get access to 55% of their funds with withdrawals but if funds were recovered they would be second in line to get those funds behind customers whose funds were not stolen.  Shetty said the exchange is seeking community consensus and that ""no unilateral decision"" would be taken regarding its proposals. Shetty insisted that the poll was just to gather customer feedback and not to make any decisions. ""That's why it's called a poll … we can't have a poll and then say this is decided,"" he said, adding that the company was not going to move forward with its recovery plan without proper consent.  ""This is a narrative being spread across to scare people,"" Shetty said. ""We are fighting so many things. We thought we'll put this out for our customers. Unfortunately, it's been twisted. From the first instance, we said it was not legally binding.""  The opinion poll did have a disclaimer that the survey was not legally binding.  The $230 million in stolen funds, accounted for nearly 45% of WazirX’s user funds. ""We've always had one is to one banking, meaning if we have to open we'll have to make sure it is only with the assets that are collateral,"" Shetty said.  The July 27 poll was described by the exchange as a ""socialized loss strategy to distribute the impact equitably among all users.""  ""We will have to rally on the community to decide the way forward,"" Shetty said. ""We are only trying to give more options to the community but we need some time. We are trying to see what other ways we can fill the hole faster.""  Steps WazirX is taking  Shetty said the exchange can only learn from previous hacks and there can only be two outcomes. The poll was one step to determine what direction should be taken because one way is to take this the judicial proceeding way which ""takes years and years"" but the second is to resume operations with what you have and then fill it up later,"" he said. That way there might be a short-term effect, but in the long term, ""we can resolve this."" Shetty doubled down on his claim that the exchange will not take any steps without community consensus.  The co-founder said, ""we are trying everything and anything that helps with the recovery of the stolen funds. We launched a bounty program too.""  WazirX is running two parallel phases – immediate revival, which helps unlock what is collateralized to the customers, and finding ways to fill the gap, he said.  The outreach to other exchanges and projects requires WazirX to keep engaging and some percentage of those entities have responded, he said.  ""The outreach to different exchanges is going to be crucial. If we get something positive, someone who steps in to help the customers. And it can be in many ways,"" he said. ""For example, we reached out to all 200 project teams because they also have these emergency funds. They'll have some way to maybe crowdsource some of these gaps. This is a large gap to fill in a few weeks. But it may be faster with lesser impact if we can figure out how to fill 10%, 20% or 40% of that gap.""  ""The timeline [for when to make a decision] is what we are trying to come up with,"" Shetty said.  Shetty also said that several different Indian and international authorities had been reaching out for help but refused to divulge names. WazirX has already filed a police complaint in Mumbai and reported the incident to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).  India’s CERT asked WazirX some ""pointed questions,"" Shetty said. He added he believes that's a sign the entity is investigating the hack. A person familiar with the matter, but unauthorized to speak, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was also in touch with the exchange.  ""FBI usually gets after any such situation because it doesn't want funds to get to North Korea,"" the person said. The FBI has issued statements about similar incidents in the past involving North Korea.  Shetty refused to comment on a report which said India's Enforcement Directorate (ED) put nearly $1.1 million in seized crypto assets in a wallet with WazirX in January, months before the July hack.  Binance and WazirX  WazirX declined to comment on whether a takeover by any other company could be included in the options on the table seeking help.  ""We have reached out to several partners and several exchanges for help,"" Shetty said. Asked if Binance was among those exchanges, Shetty said ""We are bound by confidentiality.""  Binance and Zanmai Labs, the Singapore-based parent of WazirX, have been embroiled in a public spat around the ownership of the Indian exchange since 2022. The internal dispute became public in August 2022 when Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted Binance didn't control WazirX, resulting in WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty hitting back later.  Since then, the entities have been involved in ""private discussions"" to work out their ownership issue.  Asked if those talks had been impacted by the hack, Shetty said ""I'm not legally allowed to speak about it because of our ongoing dispute (with Binance).""  A person familiar with the matter said a takeover by Binance or any other entity cannot be ruled out in the interest of salvaging the situation and helping customers, conditional on legal requirements.  A Binance spokesperson did not directly respond to CoinDesk’s question about whether Binance was considering buying WazirX out or taking over, but said ""We have been in communication with the WazirX team since July 18 to support their incident response efforts.""  INR  Shetty said he could not disclose how much INR (Indian rupees) WazirX held on its books because that could ""open up a new attack vector for someone right now.""  He also cited a lack of regulatory clarity as the reason why WazirX currently does not allow crypto withdrawals.  ""Right now if one person deposits even 10,000 rupees ($120) and then they withdraw that crypto but then after one or two months someone takes a claim to that 10,000 saying this was fraudulently taken from my account by that other person then what happens? Our entire bank account gets frozen. So this is more of a challenge from a regulatory clarity point of view, and a banking thing.""

Shiba Inu (SHIB), once a beacon of hope for meme coin enthusiasts, is currently navigating through turbulent waters. This instability has led many investors to seek more promising alternatives, with Mpeppe (MPEPE) emerging as a popular choice. Shiba Inu’s Recent Performance Shiba Inu (SHIB), once a darling of the crypto community, has been facing some challenges. The live price of Shiba Inu is $0.000017 per SHIB/USD, with a market cap of $9.86 billion USD and a 24-hour trading volume of $206.88 million USD. Despite these impressive figures, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down 2.78% in the last 24 hours, highlighting the volatility and inconsistency in its performance. No Token Burn Activity A significant factor contributing to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent performance issues is the lack of token burn activity in the past 24 hours, marking a 100% decrease. However, on a weekly basis, the SHIB burn rate increased by 71.56%, with 128,452,453 Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens burned, highlighting efforts to boost token scarcity. Despite these efforts, the immediate impact on market sentiment remains muted. Mixed Trading Signals Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) market dynamics are also influenced by varied trading signals. Platforms like Coinbase and Binance have seen strong buy activity, while OKX and Bullish have experienced dominant sell-offs. This mixed trading activity indicates that while some traders are taking positions, others are cashing out, leading to a lack of clear direction for Shiba Inu (SHIB). Community Efforts and Future Prospects The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community has been proactive in enhancing the token’s value. A notable effort is the ongoing campaign to have Binance burn 1% of trading fees, which has seen substantial support. Additionally, the Shibarium blockchain platform for Shiba Inu (SHIB) has made significant progress, with nearly 6 million blocks created, underscoring continued development and activity within the ecosystem. Despite these efforts, the inconsistent token burn activity and mixed trading signals have led to growing concerns among investors, prompting many to explore other opportunities. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A New Contender In contrast to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent struggles, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly gaining traction. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe is trading at $0.00107 USDT, with almost 60% of the tokens already sold. This rapid uptake highlights the growing excitement and investor confidence in Mpeppe’s potential. The Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) Mpeppe (MPEPE) sets itself apart from other meme coins by offering real utility. Its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms provides tangible value to users, making it more than just a speculative asset. This unique combination of fun and functionality is attracting a diverse range of investors looking for high returns. High Return Potential Crypto analysts are optimistic about Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) potential. The early investment opportunity presents a chance for substantial gains, with some experts predicting a 300x increase. This forecast is driven by Mpeppe’s innovative approach, strong community support, and the significant interest it has garnered during its presale phase. Why Investors Are Switching Given Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent performance issues, many investors are exploring alternatives that offer better prospects for returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an attractive option due to its unique value proposition and high return potential. The token’s rapid presale success indicates strong investor confidence and suggests that Mpeppe is well-positioned for significant growth. The Smart Contract Address for Mpeppe (MPEPE) For those interested in investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE), the smart contract address is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B. Ensuring the correct contract address is crucial to avoid scams and secure your investment. Conclusion As Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles with inconsistent gains and mixed trading signals, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a promising alternative for investors seeking high returns. With its unique combination of utility and fun, Mpeppe offers a compelling investment opportunity in the current crypto landscape. As always, conducting thorough research and considering the risks before investing in any cryptocurrency is essential.

31730794,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632242,1722357013,Research Firm Predicts Bitcoin Game Theory In Global Adoption Race,"In an analysis released on Monday, ASXN, an emerging crypto research firm, outlines the dynamics of global Bitcoin adoption through the lens of game theory. The report titled “The Game Theory of Bitcoin Adoption Among Nations” provides an examination of how nations can leverage mathematical game theory to strategically adopt Bitcoin. The report follows on the heels of Donald Trump’s announcement at the Bitcoin 2024 conference that he’ll convert all BTC’s owned by the US government through enforcement actions into a “strategic Bitcoin stockpile”. Bitcoin Game Theory Explained The report begins by framing BTC adoption within the broader context of game theory, a discipline that evaluates the strategic decisions made by individuals or entities under conditions of uncertainty and competing interests. According to ASXN, “Game theory provides a structured framework to predict the outcomes of nation-level strategies in adopting digital currencies, taking into account not only the economic benefits and technological advancements but also the potential geopolitical shifts.” Related Reading: Minimal Bitcoin On-Chain Resistance Ahead: Price Set For New ATH? According to the concept of ‘First Mover Advantage’, early adoption of BTC can position nations advantageously on several fronts. The report states, “Nations acting as first movers in the Bitcoin arena may set precedents in legal and regulatory frameworks, attract global crypto enterprises, and secure a significant share of the blockchain innovation landscape.” However, it contrasts these advantages with the pitfalls of premature regulatory frameworks and the volatility of Bitcoin’s market value, which could pose substantial risks to national economies. The report adds, “Once a few influential nations adopt Bitcoin, others will follow suit to avoid being left behind – creating a bandwagon effect. This effect is driven by both the returns to adoption as well as the risks of non adoption. This is when the Bitcoin adoption cycle enters the steepest part of the s-curve.” The ‘Payoff Matrix’—a fundamental tool in game theory—is applied by ASXN to dissect the decision-making process of countries considering Bitcoin adoption for nations. ASXN elaborates on how this matrix helps countries assess the potential returns and risks associated with various strategic choices. “Each nation faces a unique matrix based on its economic structure, political climate, and market dynamics. The optimal strategy, while generally skewing towards adoption due to the projected global ascendancy of cryptocurrencies, must still be tailored to individual national circumstances,” the report elaborates. Furthermore, the report also introduces the concept of the ‘Best Reaction Function’ in the context of Bitcoin adoption, explaining how nations develop strategies by anticipating the decisions of others. “A nation’s strategy is influenced not only by its direct gains from adopting Bitcoin but also by the expected actions of other nations, which might alter the global economic and technological landscape,” the report states. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Cycle Likely To Go On Till Mid-2025: CryptoQuant CEO The researchers add how the bandwagon effect could play out; “The logic plays out something like – Nation 1 assesses the cost benefit trade off and decides on adoption. Nation 1 realizes that all other nations are also going to choose adoption, Nation 1 concluded that, given that all nations will choose adoption, they should increase adoption speed so as not to lose competitive edge. Slowly, then all at once.” ASXN uses several real-world applications to illustrate the theoretical concepts discussed. The case of El Salvador is examined in depth, showcasing how its early adoption has influenced other nations’ perceptions and strategies towards Bitcoin. The analysis extends to how Wisconsin’s pension fund investment in Bitcoin ETFs reflects a broader trend of sub-national entities assessing cryptocurrency as a viable component of their financial strategies, and the substantial commitment by MicroStrategy is highlighted as a corporate parallel to national strategies. Looking forward, the report discusses the potential future trajectories of Bitcoin adoption, influenced by both technological advancements and evolving geopolitical dynamics. It specifically addresses Robert Kennedy Jr.’s proposal at Bitcoin Nashville 2024 to acquire 550 BTC daily until the US amasses 4 million BTC, which represents 19% of the total available BTC supply. This approach aims to reflect the proportion of global gold reserves that the US currently maintains in comparison to other countries. And the Bitcoin game theory is already playing out. “Whilst the ideas Trump presented at Bitcoin Nashville may or may not happen, the simple fact he publicly acknowledged Bitcoin & it’s properties is a win & we are already seeing early signs of the effects of this,” the researchers conclude. They refer to Johnny Ng, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, who has been advocating for the incorporation of Bitcoin into the city’s financial reserves following Trump’s announcement. At press time, BTC traded at $66,660.

31730792,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632354,1722356541,Be Bullish With Cardano and Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Receive Massive Gains,"Are you ready to ride the wave of the next big crypto boom? If so, then it’s time to pay attention to Cardano (ADA) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). These two tokens are not just making headlines; they are creating real opportunities for massive gains. Let’s dive into why now is the perfect time to be bullish on Cardano (ADA) and Mpeppe. The Cardano (ADA) Surge: ETF Hopes and Hardfork Anticipation Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.411165 USD with a market cap of $14.76 billion USD. It has shown a modest increase of 0.62% in the last 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of $305.26 million USD. But the excitement around Cardano isn’t just about these numbers. ADA-ETF Speculation Recently, the Cardano (ADA) community has been buzzing with speculation about the possibility of an ADA-ETF. This speculation was sparked by a social media post from TapTools asking if an ADA ETF could be next, following the approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, responded with a humorous yet hopeful GIF, hinting at the potential for such a development. The approval of an ADA-ETF could significantly boost Cardano’s market presence, as it did for Bitcoin and Ethereum. This potential for an ETF is driving optimism and could lead to a price rally, especially as the community rallies behind the idea.

31730789,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632349,1722356192,Analyst Believe Cardano and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Will Skyrocket 100% and Dominate The Market,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors and analysts alike are turning their attention to promising tokens that could lead the next wave of growth. Among these tokens, Cardano (ADA) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are gaining significant traction. Analysts predict that both of these cryptocurrencies could skyrocket by 100%, dominating the market in the coming months. Cardano (ADA): Preparing for a Major Leap Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.411165 USD, with a market cap of $14.76 billion USD. The 24-hour trading volume stands at $305.26 million USD, with Cardano (ADA) showing a positive change of 0.62% in the last 24 hours. These numbers underscore the growing interest and confidence in Cardano’s potential. Recent Developments in Cardano (ADA) The Cardano (ADA) network is on the brink of a major upgrade with the upcoming Chang-Hardfork. This hardfork is part of the transition to the Voltaire era, which aims to introduce decentralized network governance. The latest version of the Node Validator software, Node 9.1.0, has been released, paving the way for this significant update. This new version not only fixes some bugs but also requires the use of the Conway Genesis file in the mainnet, enabling the Chang-Hardfork. As of now, 11% of validators have upgraded to the new Node, with the hardfork set to proceed once 70% of validators have made the switch. This upgrade is expected to bring about a “significant transformation” in the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, marking the installation of core elements for decentralized governance. Cardano’s Path to Full Decentralization Cardano’s (ADA) roadmap outlines an ambitious plan for achieving full decentralization. The Chang-Hardfork will establish on-chain governance mechanisms, including a constitutional committee and delegated representatives who will vote on behalf of individual Cardano (ADA) investors. This marks a significant shift from the current governance model, moving towards a more community-driven approach. The last major update, the Vasil-Hardfork in September 2022, enhanced block creation speed and improved smart contract performance. The upcoming Chang-Hardfork is expected to further solidify Cardano’s position as a leading blockchain platform by enabling more robust and decentralized governance. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Rising Star in the Crypto Space While Cardano (ADA) is making headlines with its upcoming upgrades, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly gaining traction during its presale stage. Currently trading at $0.00107 USDT, Mpeppe has already sold almost 60% of its tokens, reflecting strong investor interest and confidence in its potential. The Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) Mpeppe (MPEPE) distinguishes itself from other meme coins by offering tangible utility through its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms. This combination of functionality and entertainment provides real value to users, making it more than just a speculative asset. Analysts are bullish on Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) prospects, predicting a potential 100% increase. This optimistic outlook is driven by Mpeppe’s innovative approach, strong community support, and significant interest during its presale phase. Early investors are excited about the substantial gains they could achieve as Mpeppe continues to gain traction in the market. Smart Contract Address for Mpeppe (MPEPE) For those interested in investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE), the smart contract address is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B. Ensuring the correct contract address is crucial to avoid scams and secure your investment. Conclusion With the cryptocurrency market poised for potential growth, Cardano (ADA) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are emerging as strong contenders for investors seeking high returns. Cardano’s upcoming Chang-Hardfork and transition to decentralized governance position it for significant growth. Meanwhile, Mpeppe’s innovative blend of DeFi and gaming, coupled with strong presale performance, makes it an attractive investment option. As analysts predict a 100% surge for both tokens, investors are closely watching these developments. Adding Cardano (ADA) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) to your portfolio could be a strategic move to capitalize on their expected market dominance in the near future.

42390716,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5rH3,1722355999,"Key Interest Rate Decisions Coming This Week From Fed, BOJ, BOE","Three major central banks are holding policy meetings this week and the results from each are anticipated to be at least somewhat different.  The first decision is set to come Wednesday (Tuesday evening in the U.S.) from the Bank of Japan and analysts are split on whether the BOJ will either raise its policy rate from the current 0%-0.1% or send a signal that a rate hike is soon to come. What's known is that inflation in Japan has been above the bank's 2% target for some time and the yen – though rallying of late – continues to hover near multi-decade lows versus the U.S. dollar.  The WSJ also reported that the BOJ believes tighter monetary policy could boost sluggish consumption in Japan as higher rates would further buoy the yen and ease the prices of key imports like gasoline and food.  Next up will the decision by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon (U.S. hours). While virtually no one sees the Fed as cutting the fed funds rate for the first time since 2020, nearly all anticipate the U.S. central bank as indicating its expectation that it will trim rates at its next meeting in mid-September.  Indeed, current rate cut odds for September are at 100%, according to CME FedWatch, with a 12% chance the Fed trims by 50 basis points instead of the customary 25.  Early Thursday afternoon in the U.K. will bring the Bank of England's policy decision and both economists and rate markets are split roughly 50/50 on whether that central bank will ease policy for the first time in several years. What's more certain is that even if the BOE does cut rates, it's likely to indicate a very cautious approach, i.e. indicating to markets that a string of easings should not be yet expected.  What's it mean for bitcoin?  Barring a surprise such as, for instance, the Fed indicating that a September rate cut is not yet a sure thing, bitcoin {{BTC}} prices may not be affected that much by the central bank news this week.  Longer term, though, it appears that at least a modest series of rate cuts across all major central banks except the BOJ are the new norm. In addition to developments at the Fed and BOE, the European Central Bank trimmed its policy rate earlier this summer and the Bank of Canada has cut twice in the past few months.  All things being equal, easier monetary policy tends to be good for risk assets such as bitcoin. Markets do tend to anticipate though, and while bitcoin's 56% year-to-date rally is commonly mostly attributed to demand from the U.S.-based spot ETFs, at least some of that move may have come on the expectation that Western monetary policy was about to enter an easing cycle after a multi-year tightening trend.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/30/key-interest-rate-decisions-coming-this-week-from-fed-boj-boe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d60f31a11ceb664423a02cbb7f43591d2f03f7f-2000x1335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
31730673,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632346,1722355862,Here’s Why There Are Green Candles Around For Pepecoin and Mpeppe (MPEPE),"Have you noticed the green candles lighting up for Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) recently? The crypto market is buzzing with excitement as these two tokens show promising trends amid the current market conditions. Let’s delve into why these meme coins are generating so much interest and what recent developments are fueling their upward momentum. Pepecoin (PEPE): A Beacon of Profitability Pepecoin (PEPE) has been making waves in the cryptocurrency market, capturing the attention of both new and seasoned investors. Currently priced at $3.782249, Pepecoin (PEPE) has seen a 2.77% increase in the last 24 hours, bringing its market cap to a robust $437.80 million USD. What’s particularly intriguing about Pepecoin is that over 78% of its investors are currently in profit. According to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, less than 10% of Pepecoin (PEPE) holders would incur a loss if they sold their tokens at the current price. This high profitability rate is astonishing, especially considering that Pepecoin is currently trading 30% below its all-time high (ATH). Despite a recent decline in network activity—with active addresses dropping by 17.5% and new addresses decreasing by 6%—Pepecoin’s (PEPE) overall network has grown by almost 100,000 addresses in the past four months. This suggests a strong and growing interest in the token, even amid fluctuations in market activity. Moreover, whale investors play a significant role in Pepecoin’s (PEPE) market dynamics, with 12 whale addresses controlling nearly 49% of the total supply. This dominance by large holders underscores the confidence among big investors in Pepecoin’s long-term potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Contender in the Meme Coin Arena While Pepecoin (PEPE) is enjoying substantial profitability, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a formidable contender in the meme coin space. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is trading at $0.00107 USDT, with almost 60% of the tokens already sold. This rapid uptake reflects growing investor confidence and excitement about Mpeppe’s potential. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its blend of fun and utility. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms, offering tangible value to its users. This unique combination makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) more than just a speculative asset; it provides real utility, attracting a diverse range of investors seeking high returns. Analysts are bullish on Mpeppe’s potential, predicting a significant rally that could see its value increase by up to 600%. The Influence of Market Dynamics The recent performance of both Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe is a testament to the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. While traditional metrics like network activity and whale dominance play a role, the strong community support and innovative utility of these tokens are crucial factors driving their success. Pepecoin’s (PEPE) robust profitability and Mpeppe’s rapid presale success indicate that investors are increasingly looking for tokens that offer both potential returns and practical value. The high level of whale control in Pepecoin’s (PEPE) supply highlights the confidence of large investors in the token’s future. Similarly, the significant interest in Mpeppe during its presale phase underscores the growing recognition of its innovative approach to integrating DeFi and gaming. These factors collectively contribute to the bullish sentiment surrounding these tokens. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is witnessing exciting developments with Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) leading the charge. The impressive profitability of Pepecoin (PEPE) and the promising potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE) are drawing significant attention from investors. As these tokens continue to perform well amidst the current market conditions, they exemplify the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of the crypto landscape.

31730671,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632335,1722355491,Shiba Inu Investors Gravitate Towards New Gambling Token At $0.00107 Set To Explode,"Are Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors looking for the next big thing? The rise of a new gambling token, Mpeppe (MPEPE), priced at $0.00107, is drawing significant attention from the crypto community. With the potential for explosive growth, many Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are shifting their focus to this promising new asset. Shiba Inu’s NVT Ratio: A Warning Sign? The Shiba Inu (SHIB) network value to transactions (NVT) ratio has seen a drastic increase, indicating a possible price correction. According to data from Glassnode, SHIB’s NVT ratio is currently outpacing the meme coin’s price, presenting a bearish outlook. This metric suggests that while SHIB is currently in an uptrend, it may soon face significant resistance on its journey to $0.00003. In addition to the NVT ratio, data from IntoTheBlock reveals a reduced correlation between Shiba Inu and Bitcoin. Previously, SHIB had a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin, with a correlation coefficient over 0.9. However, this figure has now dropped to 0.52, indicating a lesser degree of correlation and increasing the risk of sell-offs. Shiba Inu’s Mixed Signals Despite the bearish NVT ratio, other metrics paint a more optimistic picture for Shiba Inu. Large transactions involving Shiba Inu (SHIB) have increased, suggesting that whales might be accumulating the token in anticipation of higher prices. In the last seven days, there has been a notable increase in large transactions, with 365.69 billion SHIB traded in the last 24 hours alone. This activity could help sustain SHIB’s current uptrend and potentially avert a price correction. However, with only about 51% of Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders currently in the money, the risk of significant sell-offs remains high as the remaining 49% look to break even. This mixed sentiment among Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors has led many to explore new opportunities, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a strong contender. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Rising Star in the Crypto Space In stark contrast to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining traction rapidly. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe is trading at $0.00107 USDT, with nearly 60% of the tokens already sold. This rapid uptake reflects growing investor confidence and excitement about Mpeppe’s potential. The Unique Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) Mpeppe (MPEPE) sets itself apart from other meme coins by offering tangible utility. Its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms provides real value to users, making it more than just a speculative asset. This blend of entertainment and practicality is attracting a diverse range of investors seeking high returns. High Return Potential Crypto analysts are bullish on Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) potential, with some predicting a 300x increase. This forecast is driven by Mpeppe’s innovative approach, strong community support, and the significant interest it has garnered during its presale phase. Early investors are optimistic about the substantial gains they could achieve. Why Investors Are Switching Given Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) recent performance issues, many investors are looking for alternatives that promise better returns.

""After careful consideration, DraftKings has decided to discontinue Reignmakers and our NFT Marketplace, effective immediately, due to recent legal developments. This decision was not made lightly, and we believe it is the right course of action,"" the email said.  Weeks ago, a federal judge allowed a class action lawsuit against DraftKings to proceed after finding plaintiffs ""plausibly pled"" DraftKings' NFTs were unregistered securities, according to Westlaw.  DraftKings entered the NFT business in mid-2021 after noticing its ""golden"" customers were embracing digital collectibles from NBA Top Shot and other projects, co-founder Matt Kalish said last year in a podcast from Ark Invest.  Built around an in-house marketplace, DraftKings' NFT business ""let us play in this space that could become, in the next couple of decades, gigantic,"" Kalish said on the podcast. The company hired blockchain engineers, built its tech atop Polygon network, and started with a Tom Brady-themed collection that quickly sold out.  Though collectors' appetite for plain Jane NFTs had fizzled by 2022, DraftKings stuck with web3 via Reignmakers: a fantasy sports game powered by NFTs. On the Ark podcast Kalish said it captured all the things DraftKings customers loved, from day-trading to fantasy gaming.  ""We were really looking to build the best utility-driven, NFT product out there, and we saw some really great momentum"" in the first few months, Kalish said on the podcast. Its internal sales figures convinced DraftKings to expand from Football to UFC and PGA.  This year, DraftKings started getting hit with class action lawsuits alleging its NFT sales violated securities laws, a charge other sports-themed NFT companies had also grappled with. In June, NBA Top Shot settled its own legal snafu with a $4 million payout.  The class action against DraftKings appears to be headed to trial, according to court records.  As part of the NFT shutdown DraftKings is offering buyouts to Reignmakers players, the email said. NFT collectors will still be able to access and transfer their collections.  ""It's important for all companies wading into the NFT and collectibles space to be buttoned up legally or else you risk an outcome like DraftKings,"" said Joel Belfer, who runs the Mint Condition blog on sports collectibles.

42390708,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5qRl,1722353704,"BitClout Founder Charged With Wire Fraud, Civil Securities Charge","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice charged the founder of crypto social media platform BitClout with wire fraud and the sale of unregistered securities.  According to court documents, Nader Al-Naji – known pseudonymously as “Diamondhands” – raised approximately $257 million from the sale of BitClout’s native token, BTCLT. Al-Naji led investors to believe that the money would be used to pay him and other BitClout employees, but instead spent “more than $7 million of investor funds on personal expenditures” including renting a mansion in Beverly Hills and giving family members “extravagant cash gifts,” an SEC press release said Tuesday.  Al-Naji was arrested Saturday and presented to a magistrate judge in California on Monday, the DOJ said.  The SEC has accused Al-Naji of taking steps to make BitClout seem like a decentralized project with “no company behind it…just coins and code.” In addition to using a pseudonym, the SEC’s complaint pointed out that Al-Naji “allegedly secured a letter from a prominent law firm opining, based on his mischaracterizations of the nature of his project, that BTCLT were not likely to be deemed securities under federal law.”  “As alleged in our complaint, Al-Naji attempted to evade the federal securities laws and defraud the investing public, mistakenly believing that ‘being ""fake"" decentralized generally confuses regulators and deters them from going after you,’” said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement in a press release. “He is obviously wrong: as we have shown time and again, and as reflected in the SEC’s detailed allegations here, we are guided by economic realities, not cosmetic labels. The dedicated staff of the SEC uncovered Al-Naji’s lies and will now hold him accountable for misleading investors.”  Several members of Al-Naji’s family, including his wife and mother, are named as relief defendants for the investor funds transferred to them by Al-Naji in the SEC’s lawsuit.  Parallel criminal charges have been filed against Al-Naji by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Al-Naji has been charged with one count of wire fraud for the BitClout scheme, a charge which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted.  BitClout controversy  BitClout, which launched in early 2021, was promoted as a proof-of-work blockchain designed to run – and monetize – social media.  From the beginning, the project was controversial. Big names in the crypto space had profiles created for them without their consent, which included scraping and copying their Twitter profiles onto the BitClout site.  Shortly after BitClout’s rollout, law firm Anderson Kill, which has a prominent crypto practice, sent Al-Naji a cease-and-desist letter claiming that the project’s usage of social media users’ likenesses without their permission violated California’s Civil Code section 3344, which protects an individual's right to profit from the commercial value of his or her own identity and is established throughout the U.S. in both statute and common law.  Critics also suggested that the BitClout model had a built-in incentive for “canceling” users. One blockchain researcher told CoinDesk in a 2021 interview that “people are incentivized to cancel people. All you have to do is open a short position and then try to mangle someone’s reputation.”  In addition to identity and reputational concerns, critics were also dismayed by the financial realities of the project – in order to do anything with their BitClout profiles, users needed to trade bitcoin for BTCLT. But because there was no way to trade BTCLT back to BTC on BitClout’s site, their money was essentially stuck on the platform.  According to an interview with Al-Naji in 2021, investors in the project included Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Capital, TQ Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Winklevoss Capital, Arrington Capital, Polychain, Pantera, Digital Currency Group, Huobi, Variant and more.

Bitcoin's value, driven by investor confidence, could surge with government backing. The dizzy heights of $100k could be in sight, but there needs to be a convincing breakout and a rally might be more tempered compared to previous ones. A mildly bearish case would see BTC fall back from the current level. Hardcore bears are expecting a new crypto winter to kick off with a fall below $40,000. Trump is backing bitcoin. If he wins in November, it seems he will put policies in place that will be a 180-degree turn away from the crypto-killing attitudes of the Democrat administration. You can’t really blame the government for hating private sector money; after all, the private sector is way more innovative and creative than any state sector, and having private enterprise competing against a key government monopoly will prove contentious. If bitcoin becomes a strategic asset, it doesn’t mean it will replace the paper dollar, and if bitcoin is to be ‘digital gold’ for the US government, it will circulate no more as money than gold does. So, bitcoin and the dollar can co-exist, and it is good to recall Gresham’s law: Bad money drives out good. As such, it’s dollars in the pocket and bitcoin in the vault, an outcome no Bitcoin Maxi would argue with. Bitcoin relies on belief in the same way as a green slip of paper with $20 printed on it does, and, for millions of people, belief in bitcoin is strong. So, if the US government does lay in piles of BTC, it will not harm crypto at all. The credibility of such an action, plus the mopping up of large amounts, will undoubtedly push the price. Bitcoin has reflected this Trump endorsement already in a rally toward the top of its current sideways trading range. It is best to get bullish when prices fall and bearish when they rise. This way it is more likely you will buy near the bottom and sell near the top rather than the other way around, where you buy tops and sell bottoms. So here we are again approaching the top of the trend that bitcoin has been in for months. Unless you are a ‘hold bitcoin forever’ type, you will be hoping for the following events. ADVFN Why not? Let’s not forget what bears think, so here is a chart with Bull and Bear expectations drawn on. ADVFN You can certainly see that we are likely to get near the top of the current range and if the recent past is anything to go on, bitcoin will flounce back down again to $60,000. However, I have to say, there is a solid chance for the long-awaited breakout. Firstly, a Trump pump has legs if he continues to lead the polls. Then there is - in the market itself - the sort of calm in the crypto news flow that suggests the market is naturally bullish, not artificially pumped by boosters exulting crypto at every turn. To go to the dreamed-of heights of $100K-plus, there will need to be a breakout of a convincing nature; well through the top of the box it’s been penned into, say $76000 or higher. Alternately, a mildly bearish expectation would see a fallback from the current level continuing the gentle droop we have seen building since the initial high, with hardcore bears expecting a new crypto winter to kick off with a fall below $40,000. Yet, the halving grinds on, and this should ultimately be the dynamic to force bitcoin higher. I’m not a fan of this kind of attritional market. The bitcoin market is not the fun of old, where sudden massive verticals carried huge capital gains. This sluggishness is inevitable now that bitcoin is such a heavy asset, with no more miraculous moons ahead. I still hold all my Ethereum, so I must be a bull, but I’m certainly far from the raging bull of old. It will take new technical developments for crypto plus Trump in the White House to bring back that old magic, but they are both in the realm of probabilities rather than certainty. The market knows this, which is why it is hesitating at these levels. I feel I can say, if bitcoin breaks $80,000, it will break $100,000. This might be a profitable tip if it comes to pass, but it’s a long way from the sort of outcomes that we saw in 2017 and 2021.

31730150,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632229,1722351612,Analyst Identifies Bullish Pattern That Can Send XRP Price To New Highs,"Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has identified a bullish pattern that can send the XRP price to new highs. This comes amid the growing increase in the investors’ bullish sentiment towards the XRP token. Bull Pennant Pattern Forms On XRP’s Chart Mikybull Crypto stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP has formed a bull pennant continuation pattern on the daily chart. The analyst added that the “breakout will be massive,” with XRP set to rise above $1 based on the chart he shared. Mikybull Crypto seemed really confident that XRP would rise to such heights, as he claimed that this bullish pattern “rarely fails.” Related Reading: Donald Trump Reveals Plans For US Government’s 213,239 Bitcoin If Elected A bull pennant is a technical indicator that signals the continuation of an uptrend after a period of consolidation. Mikybull Crypto had previously mentioned that XRP was going to have a cool-off period after hitting the first short-term target of $0.58. Indeed, XRP is currently experiencing a consolidation period, having hovered around the $0.60 range for the past few weeks. However, the formation of the bull pennant pattern suggests that XRP is well-primed to continue its bull rally and move to $1. A rise to $1 will be significant for XRP, considering that it will be the first time that the crypto token has hit this price market since 2021. XRP failed to hit this price mark even when Judge Analisa Torres declared that the crypto token wasn’t a security last year. Meanwhile, Mikybull Crypto has suggested that XRP’s rise to $1 is just the beginning of the massive heights the crypto token will reach in this bull run. The analyst stated that XRP would surprise many doubters in this market cycle while also predicting that the coin could replicate its 2017 and rise to as high as $4 if a similar price movement eventually occurs. Confirmation Of XRP Price Replicating 2017 Rally Mikybull Crypto also recently affirmed his prediction that XRP would replicate its 2017 rally when the token enjoyed a price gain of over 61,000% in 280 days. In an X post, he stated that XRP is displaying “significant technical signs” that occurred in 2017 and led to these massive gains afterward. He added that historically, the chart always precedes the news, meaning that XRP is well set up for that catalyst that could spark such a run. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Charts Bitcoin Course To New $77,604 All-Time High A conclusion to the long-running legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is believed to be one factor that could spark such a parabolic rally for XRP. The case is expected to end soon enough, with the only thing remaining is a ruling from Judge Torres on the appropriate remedies to be awarded against Ripple. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.59, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42390709,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5qMd,1722347069,Circle Said to Be Trading Around $5B Valuation Ahead of Planned IPO: Sources,"Circle stock is said to be trading around a $5 billion valuation for the company ahead of its planned listing.  The firm reached a valuation of about $9 billion in 2022 when it first tried to go public via a failed SPAC deal.  Circle Internet Financial’s privately held stock is trading in the secondary market at a price implying a $5 billion to $5.25 billion valuation for the stablecoin issuer ahead of a planned initial public offering, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  The issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, is allowing some trading of its shares in the secondary market ahead of the planned IPO, two of the people said, but on a case-by-case basis and only in specific situations.  The sellers are said to be early-stage investors who are divesting for liquidity reasons or Circle employees, one of the people said. Employees are often given the chance to monetize stock options they hold before a company goes public. The company is not allowing trades below a $5 billion valuation, two of the people said.  Circle didn’t respond to numerous requests for comment before publication time. The Coinbase-backed firm's valuation reached about $9 billion in 2022, when it tried to go public through a deal with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called Concord Acquisition Corp.  The companies announced the mutual termination of the proposed combination in December 2022 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) didn't grant approval for the tie-up in time, and following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX a month earlier and the onslaught of the crypto winter.  Investors need not fret about the difference between the 2022 valuation and the figure that's implied by the secondary-market trades, one of the people said.  The secondary market is very depressed because there are many investors who need to raise cash and so will sell at any price, they added. A secondary market is where investors buy and sell securities, such as stocks and bonds, that have already been issued.  In a January report entitled “State of the USDC Economy,” Circle said the number of USDC wallets with at least $10 had jumped 59% in the previous year to about 2.7 million. The number of transactions in 2023 had reached 595 million through the end of November.  Circle filed to sell shares to the public for the first time in January of this year. The company filed a confidential draft S-1 document with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the planned offering had not been determined, the filing said. The exact timing of the planned IPO is also not known.  Circle intends to make the U.S. its new legal home ahead of the planned IPO, Bloomberg reported in May. The company filed paperwork to move from its current domicile in Ireland.

31727456,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632243,1722346257,"Bitcoin Eyes $63,000: Key Indicators Signal Further Decline – Time To Sell?","Bitcoin (BTC) is currently experiencing increasing bearish pressure, with technical indicators suggesting a potential decline toward the $63,316 mark. This price drop is driven by factors such as weakening momentum and decreasing trading volume. As Bitcoin targets the $63,316 mark, Investors and analysts are closely monitoring this development, as it may indicate further declines and set the stage for BTC to test lower support levels. This article analyzes Bitcoin’s current price movements and technical indicators signaling a potential further decline for the cryptocurrency focusing on the 4-hour and the 1-day chart. Bitcoin currently has a market capitalization exceeding $1.3 trillion and a trading volume surpassing $39 billion. As of the time of writing, its price was down by 3.81%, trading around $66,814 over the last 24 hours. During this period, the asset’s market cap has decreased by 3.84%, while its trading volume has surged by 70.25%. Technical Analysis: Key Bearish Indicators On the 4-hour chart, the price of BTC looks bearish as it is currently dropping towards the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). It can also be observed here that Bitcoin’s price has printed multiple bearish candlesticks as it approaches the $63,316 support level. The Composite Trend Oscillator on the 4-hour chart further indicates a bearish trend, as both signal lines have fallen below the indicator’s SMA and are heading toward the zero level. If the price continues to decline as the indicator suggests, it could drop below the 100-day SMA, potentially reaching the $63,316 mark. A closer examination of BTC’s movement on the 1-day chart shows that the failure to break above the 1-day trendline has led to a significant price drop toward the 100-day SMA and the $63,316 support level. This has resulted in Bitcoin successfully printing a bearish candlestick in the previous day’s trading. Additionally, the 1-Day composite trend oscillator indicates a potential bearish decline, as the signal line is currently attempting to cross below the indicator’s SMA. If this crossover is successful, it could lead to further losses for the crypto asset. Recovery Or Further Decline For Bitcoin? Should the digital asset’s price fall below the 100-day SMA and the $63,316 mark, it may continue to drop to test the $60,152 support level. When this level is breached, BTC may experience more price drops toward the $53,541 support range and possibly other levels below. However, given that Bitcoin fails to decline further as predicted and turns to move upward, it will begin to move toward the $71,909 resistance level. It could move even higher to challenge the $73,811 resistance point if it breaks above $71,909 and possibly moves on to create a new all-high.

42390719,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5rBv,1722344400,"Blackbird, Web3 Startup From Resy Co-Founder, Wants Diners to Pay for Meals in Crypto","Blackbird Labs, the restaurant loyalty platform founded by Resy and Eater co-founder Ben Leventhal, announced the launch of Blackbird Pay, a system that will allow participating restaurants to accept payment in cryptocurrency.  Blackbird, backed by American Express and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), raised more than $24 million last year amid a wider mania around Web3. The initial pitch for the platform – available in New York, San Francisco and Charleston – was to provide diners with a way to earn rewards and exclusive perks from some of their favorite restaurants.  For the notoriously finicky restaurant business, the platform aimed to drive traffic and deliver new streams of revenue.  The new payments platform expands on Blackbird's mission by allowing consumers to pay for their meals using the $FLY cryptocurrency. The tokens can be earned as loyalty points for dining at participating restaurants or purchased in the Blackbird app using Coinbase's popular USDC stablecoin.  The restaurants may also have an incentive to participate, since they could avoid merchant card fees.  ""Lower than typical credit card fees, which can be as high as 3.75%, restaurants on the Blackbird Pay network pay a flat fee of 2% per transaction, saving them money on every transaction,"" Blackbird Labs explained in a statement shared with CoinDesk. ""At the same time, Blackbird Pay enhances diners’ end of meal experience by enabling them to skip the dreaded ‘Let’s get the check’ moment and enjoy the magic of paying their check in-app at any point; so, they can leave whenever they’re ready, just like having an old-school house account.""  It's all powered by the new Blackbird Mainnet, a layer-3 blockchain based on top of Coinbase's Base chain. Base, a so-called layer-2 network, offers users a fast and cheap option for transacting on the popular Ethereum blockchain.  Blackbird's co-founder, Leventhal, has spent two decades in the restaurant industry and previously founded Resy, the reservation platform, and Eater, a major food-focused media outlet.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Leventhal described restaurants as a ""humongous industry made up of tiny players."" Unlike airlines and hotels, which are dominated by large players, restaurants ""don't have leverage individually,"" said Leventhal, which is why they are so rarely profitable.  Read more: Blackbird, Crypto Restaurant App, Raises $24M in Funding Led by A16z  ""For me, the best restaurants are not necessarily the ones with four stars, but the ones where you walk in and you just immediately understand you're in exactly the right place, and there's no place better for you to be at that moment,"" said Leventhal. ""As good as they are at all that, they're just terrible in terms of managing profitably.""  ""It's impossible to predictably grow revenue, and they're paying a lot of fees for a lot of things on the technology side. In particular, the fees that they pay for processing are incredibly high,"" Leventhal continued. ""That's where Blackbird comes in. We are endeavoring to build a platform in partnership with the restaurant industry that's focused on rewards and payments, and we think those are the levers to really creating massively improved operating margins and massively improved strategy.""",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | USDC,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/30/blackbird-web3-startup-from-resy-co-founder-wants-diners-to-pay-for-meals-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54a1fd343cf6d795300d048a17f9d022b2381e63-2766x1840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42390714,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5qrP,1722344400,"Polychain, Lightspeed Lead $7M Fundraise for Math Olympian's Blockchain-Based AI Platform","Hyperbolic, one of the newer contenders in the race to apply blockchain tech to artificial intelligence, has raised $7 million in a seed funding round led by Polychain Capital and Lightspeed Faction.  The AI boom has strained the global supply chain for graphics processing units (GPUs) and other hardware used to train AI models. Surging hardware prices have squeezed all but the best-resourced AI outfits, making it difficult for startups and researchers to access AI alongside Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Google and Meta.  Hyperbolic's blockchain-based cloud platform aims to make AI hardware affordable for a wider swath of builders.  Read more: Math Olympian in Shadow of John Nash Tries to Solve Blockchain, AI Trust Dilemma  ""Currently, AI companies are reportedly spending over 80% of their capital on compute resources, without a cost-effective solution on the market, and causing an industry-wide bottleneck due to cost and distribution challenges,"" Hyperbolic explained in a statement shared with CoinDesk. ""Hyperbolic’s solution addresses this issue by creating a scalable system to aggregate global GPU compute and leveraging blockchain technology to ensure their network of nodes operates in a verifiable and secure manner.""  Hyperbolic's first product will be an AI inference service that allows builders to use state-of-the-art AI models ""at a fraction of the cost,"" according to the company. (After an AI model is trained, it makes ""inferences"" based on user requests, such as when ChatGPT responds to user queries.)  In the long term, the firm plans to build a ""GPU marketplace"" that offers developers and researchers cheaper access to cloud computing hardware for training their own AI models.  The seed round included participation from Chapter One, LongHash, Bankless Ventures, Republic Digital, Nomad Capital, CoinSummer Labs and Third Earth Capital. It also included angel investors like Balaji Srinivasan, NEAR's Illia Polosukhin and Polygon's Sandeep Nailwal.  Hyperbolic enters a growing category of startups raising big bucks to build at the intersection of AI and crypto.  Eventually, Hyperbolic co-founder Jasper Zhang thinks blockchain projects like his own can be used for more than just addressing AI accessibility hurdles. The pitch from Zhang – a mathematics olympiad winner in China and Russia with a doctorate degree from the University of California, Berkeley – isn't dissimilar from that of other crypto founders who hypothesize a radical new future where blockchains transform how AI is built and monetized.  ""There will be a lot of other applications building on Hyperbolic,"" he said in an interview with CoinDesk.

Router Protocol, a project built using Cosmos blockchain technology, said Tuesday that it launched the main network of a new blockchain designed for ""chain abstraction"" – a concept embraced by many protocols with the aim of making the user experience of blockchains more seamless, especially when it comes to cross-chain transactions.  By taking the complex technicalities away, users don’t even need to recognize that they are using a specific blockchain. It's been championed by ecosystems like NEAR, which recently released “chain signatures” as part of their roadmap to completely embrace chain abstraction. Other ecosystems that have embraced chain abstraction are Arcana and Socket.  To make the new Router Chain more seamless in cross-chain interactions, it will focus on reducing “the development barriers and streamlining the development of dApps that can seamlessly interact with multiple blockchains and aggregate liquidity from any chain,” according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.  In addition to Router Chain, the team is also launching a token-bridging solution “that will offer increased security to Cosmos chains,” and “chains in the Cosmos ecosystem will be able to leverage the security of Ethereum and Bitcoin networks, reducing the inflation required to maintain security and making them more robust.”  In January, the Router team launched Nitro, the first cross-chain bridge built on the Router Chain.  “Router is transitioning from being just a bridge to overall interoperability ecosystem, and Router Chain part of that,” said Ramani Ramachandran, founder and CEO of Router Protocol, in an interview with CoinDesk. “Router Chain is at the core of that transformation.”",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | SPONSORED | NEAR,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/30/router-launches-mainnet-as-more-projects-abstract-away-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed62906dda5a6a787108371fb6ea47cbb8fe50f5-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Bitcoin On Fire: 20% Surge In 3 Weeks Teases Record-Breaking Potential Despite this, the platform is maintaining its momentum. A new upgrade proposal might improve developer and user experience on the platform, further onboarding new users and developers to use Avalanche. The Gist Of ACP-77 ACP-77 is the newly announced major proposal made by the Avalanche Foundation to simplify the system for developers, enhancing the flexibility of launching subnets on-chain. Avalanche subnets act like layer-1 blockchains, with the subnets using the mainnet as a bridge between subnet to subnet. According to the proposal, the current system of launching subnets on-chain limits developers. With a minimum 2,000 AVAX stake needed by subnet validators, the financial barrier filters devs with little to no funding, driving innovation downward. Thus, ACP-77 proposes to remove the financial barrier along with the required mainnet validation for subnet validators. This means developers won’t be hampered by a huge upfront financial commitment along with the technically difficult task of validating the mainnet. This means more time on the drawing board, effectively encouraging developers to have a more finished product upon the launch of their subnet. It will also help with enhancing the decentralization of the platform. Upon approval of the proposal, subnets will be granted more autonomy in terms of certain settings that they would like to be implemented. In exchange for the removal of the mainnet validation, subnet validators will instead validate the P-chain (platform chain). This will ease resource use, making resource allocation more efficient. The proposal will have an overall positive impact on the platform. Lowering costs and resource requirements for developers will help bring in new devs to build on Avalanche, enhancing the platform for users.

However, the bulls have a major advantage on this position. Although the market has corrected itself to a more sustainable level, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are in the position to burst upward pulling the market along with them.

42390720,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5rWR,1722341205,First Mover Americas: BTC Slides as U.S. Government-Linked Selling Pressure Looms,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin has inched toward $66,000, paring all gains from last week, with sentiment dented as a significant amount of the asset was moved from U.S. government-linked wallets, raising concerns of looming selling pressure among traders. BTC lost as much as 5%, before slightly recovering, in the past 24 hours as the U.S. Marshals Service shifted $2 billion worth of BTC to two new wallets. Tracking service Arkham estimated that at least one of the wallets was likely to be a custodial service. Bitcoin was trading around $66,550 at the time of writing, a drop of 4.3% from 24 hours ago. The wider crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, is 3.5% lower.  Spot ether ETFs saw negative net flows in their first week as massive outflows from the incumbent Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) overwhelmed interest in the competing products. The equivalent bitcoin funds, which debuted in January, raked in $1 billion in net inflows during the first four days, even as they too suffered sizable outflows from a previously existing Grayscale fund. Overall, the spot ETH ETFs lost $340 million in net outflows with more than $1.5 billion exiting from the Grayscale Trust, according to Farside Investors. Ether has outperformed the wider digital asset market following Monday's slide. ETH is priced at $3,330, a drop of 1.67% compared with the CD20's 3.5%.  Donald Trump's crypto pledges may mean the near-term bitcoin price is tied to the likely outcome of November's presidential election, investment bank Jefferies said. Trump promised to maintain a strategic bitcoin reserve and never sell the government’s seized bitcoin (BTC) at BTC 2024 in Nashville on Saturday. “His overtures to the industry to install crypto-friendly regulators may have the effect of near-term BTC price being tied to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election,” analysts Jonathan Petersen and Joe Dickstein wrote. Jefferies notes that Trump pledged to pick crypto-friendly regulators, to create a crypto industry presidential advisory council, and to make the country the “crypto capital of the planet.”  Trending Posts  Dogecoin Pup Owner’s New Shiba Inu Ends Up in NEIRO Memecoin Drama  SEC Intends to Amend Complaint Against Third Party Tokens (Like SOL) in Binance Case  Trump's Talk of Bitcoin Reserve for the U.S. Leaves Industry Waiting for More Details",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | SHIB,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/30/first-mover-americas-btc-slides-as-us-government-linked-selling-pressure-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fe1ac8170d39007c7c6b3dfd65a66d486f8f9e1-782x517.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Faibik, Bitcoin is poised to test once more the crucial $70,000 resistance level. Historically a major barrier, this level seems to be becoming simpler with every test that comes around. Faibik says this declining resistance suggests a potential upward breakthrough shown as a broadening wedge. A spreading wedge technical chart pattern suggests that the price of an asset could be poised to break out. A breakthrough is looking more plausible as Bitcoin approaches the $70,000 barrier level. According to Faibik, should Bitcoin be able to pass this obstacle, by August it might be valued beyond $80,000. This hopeful forecast is based on the trend of declining resistance, which generally indicates an approaching breakout and consequent price rise.

Although the price of the alpha coin is now 31% below the projection for the next month, short-term indicators show a positive trend that may cause the price to rise.

Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF tracks the 10 most highly valued cryptocurrencies but is heavily weighted towards Bitcoin and Ethereum. Despite a discount to NAV, high expenses and a lack of actual diversification make the BITW fund less competitive in the crypto ETF space. This year has been fruitful in terms of new cryptocurrency ETFs. However, there's still a niche that remains free: exchange-traded funds representing a diversified mix of cryptocurrencies. Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF (BITW), incepted way back in 2017, is an attempt to address the lack of such funds. I like the concept of the fund, though there are serious caveats that may affect an investor's decision to buy the fund's shares. If you're comfortable with the fund's features, risks, and limitations, then it's a decent investment vehicle to own with strong YTD performance. I give the BITW fund a ""Hold"" rating. BITW Fund Overview According to the fund's description , the BITW fund seeks to track an index comprised of the 10 most highly valued cryptocurrencies, screened and monitored for certain risks, weighted by market capitalization, and rebalanced monthly. Such a concept sounds awesome, but if we look at the fund's holdings , the first caveat becomes obvious: unbalanced sizing of the fund's crypto positions. Bitwise As you can see from the picture above, 91% (!) of the fund consists of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The rest eight cryptocurrencies share a negligible 9% of the fund's holdings. Given the overwhelmingly dominant weight of the fund's performance with Bitcoin and Ethereum, these are the only cryptocurrencies that are worth discussing in the context of the BITW fund. With the existing crypto ETFs, you can easily replicate 91% of the BITW fund by buying iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), which give you liquid exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum accordingly. With a presumably upcoming Solana ETF, you'll be able to replicate 95.36% of the BITW holdings. And here comes the next red flag: expenses. In 2017, when the fund was incepted, crypto was still an oddity for tech geeks, and an expense ratio of 2.5% looked justified for an alternative asset. It's no secret that new BTC-ETFs and ETH-ETFs have fees around 0-0.25%, making the BITW look completely uncompetitive. Nonetheless, there's something else we need to take into consideration: the NAV discount. Value To Grab Or A Value Trap? There's a specific feature of the BITW fund that attracts investors: a huge discount of the fund's share price to the value of assets it is currently holding. The fund states that the fund's net asset value (NAV) stands at $51.87, while the share price of the BITW is $35.96. Simply put, BITW's share price is roughly 30% lower than the net value of its assets. In my opinion, lower liquidity, high expense ratio, and fading exclusivity of the fund amid new crypto ETF issuances in one way or another may contribute to the NAV discount we observe today. Another reason for a discount may be the fact that the BITW fund doesn't have a proper listing on a stock exchange, trading solely in the OTC market. So far, the BITW fund performs slightly better than the most popular BTC ETF, IBIT. TradingView However, I don't see catalysts that could drive the BITW much closer to its actual NAV. Thus, in my view, it's a bold assumption to expect that the NAV discount can close anytime soon, if ever. To conclude, holding the BITW shares gives mostly the same performance as a mix of BTC and ETH ETFs, and you pay a higher expense ratio for a chance that at some point in the future, the NAV discount will be eliminated. The Bottom Line While the BITW looks like an obvious buy considering the fund's valuation discount to its NAV, I'd argue that this discount is not entirely unfounded. Again, crypto is all about hype, and ""legacy"" funds like the BITW that fail to offer cheap, liquid, and convenient exposure to crypto may ultimately lag behind.

It will also experiment to ensure that the ""singleness of money"" is maintained with stablecoins and tokenized deposits.  The Bank of England said it's planning a series of experiments with distributed ledger technology (DLT) and wholesale central bank digital currencies (wCBDC) to keep abreast of changes in the payments landscape and assess the opportunities and risks of developments in financial technology.  The rise of cryptocurrencies and the DLT that underpins them has prompted central banks across the globe to see how they can interact with both. Many are working separately, together or through the Bank for International Settlements – the umbrella organization for the world's central banks – on projects to explore the impact of developing technology on the world's monetary systems. The BOE, for example, is part of the BIS' Project Agora looking at testing exchanging tokenized commercial bank deposits and central bank money in multiple currencies on a single platform among seven banks.  One way that central bank money can interact with distributed ledger platforms is so-called synchronization, the report said. That's when an asset is transferred from one platform to another – possibly including one based on DLT – with the cash leg of the transaction on the bank's Real Time Gross Settlement ledger.  “Confidence in money and payments is fundamental to the Bank’s responsibility for monetary and financial stability,"" Governor Andrew Bailey said in the introduction to a discussion paper on Tuesday. ""As innovation in this space continues, our role must also evolve, to support a robust and dynamic U.K. economy.""  Wholesale CBDCs, digital tokens issued by central banks that are used only by institutions, could help interactions with programmable platforms, the discussion paper noted.  ""Our programme of experiments would be grounded in a set of policy outcomes which we seek from innovations in wholesale central bank money,"" the bank said in the paper. ""The programme would cover both wCBDC and synchronisation, as well as the relative merits of these two approaches.""  The bank said it will work with the Treasury, Payments Systems Regulator and the Financial Conduct Authority to also ensure the singleness of money is maintained even when stablecoins are involved. That is, making sure all forms of money – cash, bank deposits and so on – are interchangeable with each other.  In the discussion paper, the bank said it will carry out a series of experiments to ensure that the singleness of money is maintained between stablecoins and tokenized deposits, which are deposit claims represented on programmable platforms.  ""We should consider applying new tokenization technology to conventional money, rather than in the crypto asset markets where they were first employed,"" Sarah Breeden, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, wrote on Tuesday in the Financial Times.

Once again, the Bitcoin open interest has set a new record and this could spell doom for the digital asset, even if just in the short-term. Bitcoin Open Interest Sets New Record In an interesting turn of events, the Bitcoin open interest has now risen to a new all-time high. After hitting a record high of $39.03 billion back in May, the open interest had declined for a while, even dropping below $30 billion back in May. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised To Break $4,000 As Price Tests Crucial Levels; Analyst Following this, the Bitcoin open interest fluctuated for a few months, taking the price along with it for the ride. However, with the recovery in the market, the open interest has been rising once again, exploding to new highs as the BTC price shot for $70,000. On Monday, the Bitcoin open interest saw a notable surge, rising a whopping $1.5 billion in a single day. This translated to a 5.94% rise in the 24-hour period, according to data from Coinglasss and pushed the open interest above $39.5 billion, the highest on record s far. The major surges in open interest came from exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, and OKX, all of which saw an average of an 8% increase in the Bitcoin open interest. For example, the Binance Bitcoin futures open interest made a new all-time high of $9.05 billion. Implications Of A New OI ATH The Bitcoin open interest reaching a new all-time high is indicative of increased interest as traders begin taking various positions in the cryptocurrency. However, in the past, when the open interest has reached new record highs, it has carried implications for the market.

Back in March, when the Bitcoin open interest reached an ATH, it indicated the top of the market, with the open interest falling over the next few months and the BTC price falling as well. Following the March ATH, the Bitcoin price saw a 20% drawdown less than two months later. If this trend holds, then the recent ATH could be the signal for a decline. By Monday, the Bitcoin price had already started responding, falling from $70,000 to below $67,000 in a matter of hours before recovering. A continuation of this downtrend could easily send the Bitcoin price falling more than 10% from here again and reaching below $60,000.

Jefferies said bitcoin mining profitability following the halving is better than feared at the start of the year.  Larger bitcoin miners are still in growth mode, the bank said.  With multiple politicians, both Republican and Democrat, and former president Donald Trump in attendance at the Bitcoin Nashville conference last week, there was a political undertone to the crypto event, investment bank Jefferies said in a research report on Monday.  “His overtures to the industry to install crypto-friendly regulators may have the effect of near-term BTC price being tied to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election,” analysts Jonathan Petersen and Joe Dickstein wrote.  Latest News:U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to Be Funded Partly by Revaluing Fed's Gold, Draft Bill Shows  Trump promised to maintain a strategic bitcoin reserve and never sell the government’s seized bitcoin {{BTC}}, he said in his Nashville speech.  Jefferies notes that Trump pledged to pick crypto-friendly regulators, to create a crypto industry presidential advisory council, and to make the country the “crypto capital of the planet.”  This positive shift in Trump’s policy towards crypto is very recent, the bank noted, but it could impact the price of bitcoin in the near term, depending on who wins the election in November.  With bitcoin having gained about 5% since the halving in April, and the network hashrate dropping a total of 8% in May and June, the “profitability of mining is modestly better than feared at the beginning of the year,” the authors wrote, with mining revenue per exahash down 40%-45% instead of 50%.  Read More: The U.S. Government May Begin Hoarding Bitcoin, But How and Why?  Jefferies notes that the larger bitcoin miners are still in growth mode, and have orders in place to materially expand their installed hashrate. Hashrate is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  The bitcoin mining consolidation phase is here, the report said, with CleanSpark (CLSK) recently agreeing to acquire GRIID (GRDI) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) making a public offer for Bitfarm (BITF), which was subsequently rejected.  Comments from mining firm management teams suggest that there will likely be more M&A in the sector, “with access to power as far more valuable than the mining fleets,” the report added.

According to data tracked by Nansen, on-chain growth is booming for Optimism. The platform’s growth as the self-named “Superchain” on Ethereum is working as active addresses continue to ramp up along with transactions, indicating chain-wide usage across its different constituent chains. The platform has also announced several events that potentially impacted this on-chain growth. Optimism is hosting a chain-wise hackathon tomorrow, July 31, contributing to this sudden increase in active addresses on the platform. This should offset any shift in investor confidence as it paints Optimism positively: a platform worthy of development with the support of a growing community. 🟡⚪️Superhack is a Superchain wide hackathon. 🔵🔴 Sign up and check out bounties from teams like @worldcoin @base @modenetwork @Celo and more!

Although confidence in the platform and token is still high, some things have to happen to OP to see green once more. Bulls Should Wait For The Perfect Timing As of writing, OP bulls have a perfect and stable platform for a rocket upwards, and it should be noted that $1.694 is the long-term support level for this movement. Related Reading: All-Time Highs Ahead? Dogwifhat (WIF) Poised For Big Growth — Analyst However, its high correlation with Ethereum leaves much to be desired. Bitcoin and Ethereum move in sync, meaning if one experiences pain, the other drops too. OP’s indirect correlation with Bitcoin will have a big impact on how the token moves soon. With the current market correction, investors and traders should lower their expectations of a breakout in the coming days. However, the strong support on $1.694 gives bulls a stable platform to launch upward. Should the bulls lose this position, expect more pain within the coming days or weeks. But if the level is held strongly $2.331 will be the target level for the bulls.

Humpy and the Golden Boys have signaled they will accept a counter-proposal to build a yield-bearing protocol similar to goldCOMP that will be controlled by the Compound DAO.  A move to create a new yield-bearing protocol called goldCOMP by a large group of COMP holders, the native token of the Compoud lending protocol, has been called off, and the market is reacting positively.  COMP added 5.6% to $51.27 after the proposal's backers, a whale named Humpy and a group of COMP holders known as the Golden Boys, agreed to cancel their proposal and vote for an alternative that involves creating a staking product that will be controlled by the CompoundDAO decentralized autonomous organization.  The goldCOMP proposal, which critics are calling a governance attack, involved coordinated efforts to push a resolution through the DAO to allocate $24 million in COMP tokens to create a yield-bearing protocol intended to provide passive income. It was unpopular with many large stakeholders in the Compound ecosystem, including Wintermute, owing to allegations of vote manipulation by the proposers, concerns about the centralization of control and potential risks of mismanaging the $24 million COMP treasury funds.  Now, the crisis has been averted.  Instead, Humpy and the collective have agreed to a counter-proposal that will create a staking product that distributes 30% of existing and new market reserves annually to staked COMP holders, proportional to their stake.  The new staked product will be controlled by the Compound DAO – directly addressing a concern many had that Humpy and the Golden Boys would have outsized control – and will be audited by a designated security partner appointed by Compound and continually audited by the DAO's Market Risk Manager.  This is all contingent on Humpy formally withdrawing Proposal 289, which passed, that allocated COMP tokens into a trust to create goldCOMP. Humpy did not withdraw the offer by the initial deadline, but said in forum posts that he ""fully approves"" the idea.",POSITIVE,COMP,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | MARKET | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/30/comp-token-rises-as-whale-backs-down-on-supposed-governance-attack-on-compound,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/356c89a6b7bc505018a34dfff3457eb42119ad4c-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390707,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5qHV,1722328549,Dogecoin Pup Owner’s New Shiba Inu Ends Up in NEIRO Memecoin Drama,"Kabosu's owner announced her new Shiba Inu dog, Neiro, on X, sparking the creation of numerous NEIRO tokens on Solana.  Two prominent NEIRO tokens emerged, with the most popular initially amassing a $100 million market cap but seeing a sell-off later as communities started to argue among each other on which was the actual NEIRO token.  The trading frenzy propelled Solana's on-chain volumes to surpass Ethereum's, with the NEIRO deployer profiting $5.4 million from the token's popularity.  Neiro's actual owner has distanced herself from the drama and cautioned users to be on the lookout for ""token scams.""  Little did Kabosu’s owner know what was in store when she took to X on Sunday to announce her new Shiba Inu pet, Neiro.  Kabosu was the pet dog whose photo birthed the dogecoin {{DOGE}} memecoin and, subsequently, the $37 billion dog-themed memecoin sector that includes shiba inu (SHIB), floki (FLOKI) and others. Kabosu passed away in May at the age of 17, leaving a legacy that includes a statue and a memecoin worth $18 billion.  But @Kabosumama, the X account of Kabosu's human owner, adopted a ten-year-old Shiba Inu dog named Neiro last week, calling her a “new family member.”  Initial replies to that announcement were filled with support for the new pet, but it soon turned into a shill fest as people quickly launched tokens on Solana using Neiro’s liking.  Hundreds of Neiro, or Neiro-themed tokens, were issued on Solana token generator Pump Fun, with one quickly running to tens of millions in market capitalization. Later, some traders discovered that while the token at a $100 million capitalization was the most popular, another one was actually the first one to exist – shifting dynamics and causing a brief sell-off.  The discovery resulted in traders quickly allocating capital to or trading both tokens, resulting in two Solana tokens themed after Neiro—both amassing a cumulative trading volume of $340 million.  Such trading behavior pushed Solana to the forefront of total blockchain activity on Monday, with on-chain volumes surpassing those of Ethereum, the usual leader. DefiLlama data shows that Solana racked up $1.8 billion in trading volumes each on Sunday and Monday, while Ethereum did under $1 billion.  As such, the price pump for the NEIRO deemed more popular pocketed its deployer at least $5.4 million in profits, on-chain analysis tool Bubblemaps said in an X post. The deployer bought up a large chunk of the initial supply shortly after the token went live using several wallets, and sold as it went viral.  Both NEIRO tokens are actively traded and listed on exchanges as of Tuesday. Each community crowns itself as the real one and aims to replicate Dogecoin’s success.  However, as far as Neiro’s owner @Kabosumama is concerned, none of the tokens are legitimate.  “I see many tokens related to Kabosu and Neiro. To clarify, I do not endorse any crypto project except @ownthedog $dog because they own the original Doge photo and IP,” she said in an X post. “They are committed to doing only good every day, charitable works, and Doge culture.”  “Please watch out for token scams.”",NEUTRAL,DOGE | SHIB,DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/30/dogecoin-pup-owners-new-shiba-inu-ends-up-in-neiro-memecoin-drama,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac62b6355bc79fe10527046707255f903b2969b8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390705,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd5q7F,1722324909,SEC Intends to Amend Complaint in Binance Case,"CORRECTION (July 30, 2024, 21:50 UTC): Corrects details to note that the SEC did not say how it intended to amend its complaint or that it intended to drop allegations tied to third-party tokens.  The SEC intends to amend its complaint against Binance, including with respect to the 'Third Party Crypto Asset Securities,"" it said in a court filing.  This likely means that the Judge won't have to decide whether 10 tokens such as Solana and Matic are unregistered securities or not just yet.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be amending its ongoing lawsuit against Binance and related entities after a court hearing earlier this month where attorneys raised questions about whether a ruling in the case might affect allegations about certain tokens, according to a court filing early Tuesday morning.  According to the filing, the SEC has already informed the defendants, Binance and affiliated entities (namely Binance.US and founder Changpeng Zhao), that it ""intends to seek leave to amend its complaint, including with respect to the 'Third Party Crypto Asset Securities'... ""obviating the need for the Court to issue a ruling as to the sufficiency of the allegations as to those tokens at this time.""  The issue of third party tokens came to a head in a hearing on July 9 when attorneys for Binance said they interpreted Judge Amy Berman Jackson's June 28 ruling on Binance's motion to dismiss the SEC's case as moving third-party tokens out of the case, CoinDesk reported earlier. The Judge made it clear that this was not her intention.  Third-party tokens are digital assets issued by various companies apart from Binance, that were listed by the crypto exchange. The 10 tokens named in the complaint are SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS and COTI. The SEC alleged that these tokens are unregistered securities.  Tuesday's filing was a court ordered joint response to the positions of both sides on how to proceed further. It was expected that the judge would review what role third-party tokens may play in the SEC's ongoing case against Binance. The SEC did not share further details about how its amended complaint may address the token issue.  This development has resulted in the defense wanting to see the amended complaint before allowing the process of discovery.  ""Until defendants have a set of proposed amended allegations in front of them, it is premature and unreasonable for the SEC to expect them to agree to conduct merits discovery for claims on which the SEC may soon seek leave to amend its allegations,"" the filing said.

31722117,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632180,1722324614,XRP Price Poised For ‘Ultimate Breakout’ With $18 Price Target: Crypto Analyst,"Crypto analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) has updated his 108,000 followers on X about the XRP/USD market outlook with a 3-monthly chart. In his latest analysis, he points to an imminent major price movement before the end of this quarter, in other words by the end of September. XRP Price On The Verge Of Ultimate Breakout The chart shared by Dark Defender illustrates a symmetrical triangle pattern, a typical continuation formation where converging support and resistance lines suggest decreasing market volatility and potential for a significant breakout. This pattern is formed by the convergence of a downward-sloping resistance line and an upward-sloping support line. In XRP’s case, the candles are compressing toward the apex of the triangle, suggesting that volatility is decreasing as the market consensus builds strength. This setup is crucial as it implies that the price could make a substantial move once it breaks out of the triangle, either upward or downward. Related Reading: Shiba Inu, XRP Forming Bullish Divergence, Analytics Firm Reveals The chart labels the downward sloping trendline as ‘Ultimate Resistance’. This line represents a psychological or historically significant price level that XRP has struggled to surpass in previous rallies. On the contrary, the upwards trending line marks the ‘Ultimate Support’. Notably, the XRP price has already dipped below this support line in July, but managed to find support at the 23.60% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.3917. The XRP is now heading north. At the time the chart was created, the price was already slightly above the trend line. However, this does not mean anything yet; a candle close at the end of the quarter, on September 30, 2024, will be the ultimate challenge. If the XRP price closes above the trendline, the way would be clear for Dark Defender’s extremely bullish price targets. Price Targets The 70.20% mark at $0.6649 is posited as an immediate resistance in an upward journey. A breach above this point could confirm the bullish sentiment. Moreover, it could validate the “ultimate breakout” from the multi-year trend. Related Reading: Wall Street Expert Sees 20x Potential In Ripple Via XRP And IPO The 100.00% level at $0.9327 represents a full retracement of previous decline which started in July last year after the summary judgment in the Ripple vs. the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case was made. Further extending into bullish territory, the 161.80% level at $1.8817 offers a mid-range target for a post-breakout rally, suggesting a substantial upside potential if the momentum continues. According to the Dark Defender’s analysis, the 261.80% level at $5.8579 outlines a more aggressive bullish outlook, marking a scenario where market fundamentals and investor sentiment align to drive prices significantly higher. Finally, the 361.80% level at $18.2364 represents the ‘ultimate breakout’ target, a highly optimistic projection that would require a major shift in market dynamics, potentially driven by impactful macro economic trends and the news from the Ripple and XRP ecosystem. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5989.

The slide came after the U.S. government moved $2 billion worth of bitcoin, raising concerns of potential selling pressure.  Solana's SOL led major losses, dropping by 6%, reversing Monday's gains, while Ether showed relative strength despite recent outflows from newly-launched spot ETH ETFs.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} inched toward the $66,000 level early Tuesday to pare all gains from last week as sentiment was dented as a significant amount of the asset was moved from U.S. government-linked wallets, instilling fears of looming selling pressure among traders.  BTC lost as much as 5%, before slightly recovering, in the past 24 hours as the U.S. Marshals Service shifted $2 billion worth of BTC to two new wallets. Tracking service Arkham estimated that at least one of these wallets was likely to be a custodial service.  Solana’s SOL led losses among majors with a 6% dump, reversing Monday gains. Token prices surged as memecoin trading heated up on the network over the weekend, with on-chain trading volumes surging over Ethereum, the usual leader.  Other majors showed similar losses amid the bitcoin decline. Cardano’s ADA lost 5%, dogecoin {{DOGE}} and BNB Chain’s BNB fell 4%, while XRP lost 3%.  Ether showed relative strength with a 1% decline, despite the newly-launched spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seeing $97 million in net outflows on Monday, their fourth-straight day.  Analysts Warn of Losses  Market observers said macroeconomic decisions, as well as the lack of newer catalysts, could serve as market headwinds, pushing down prices in the near term.  “The market received a boost last week with anticipation of Trump’s speech at the Nashville Conference, where he was expected to mention BTC as a strategic reserve asset,” Alice Liu, research lead at CoinMarketCap, told CoinDesk in an email.  On Saturday, Republican candidate Donald Trump, during a speech at the annual Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, promised to fire SEC head Gary Gensler and create a strategic Bitcoin reserve if elected.  He also said he would be a ""pro-Bitcoin"" president and would not allow any of the 213,239 BTC seized by authorities and held in US government wallets to be sold. According to Trump, the US will become the world's cryptocurrency capital.  However, Liu said optimism peaked on the 27th and led to a “sell the news” phase, adding that “there is no new sauce of optimism in the market now.”  Liu further cautioned that interest rate decisions from three central banks – the Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England – on Wednesday and Thursday could further increase volatility in the crypto market.",NEGATIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/30/bitcoin-slides-to-66k-in-wake-of-silk-road-btc-movements-solanas-sol-leads-majors-losses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cad5b53baea3ac82b8ae5222f20cfad2805d6b57-1278x719.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31720146,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632155,1722319231,$25 Million Drained From Compound (COMP) Treasury In Latest Governance Exploit Incident,"The Compound Finance (COMP) treasury has been drained of $25 million in a recent governance attack, raising alarms about the state of decentralized governance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Compound DAO Hijacked According to researcher DeFi Ignas, the attack began with an initial proposal to grant 92,000 COMP tokens, submitted without prior discussion on the Compound DAO forum. Despite “glaring red flags” identified by the project’s security advisor, Michael Lewellen, the warning received minimal engagement from the community, with only a few voices, such as MonetSupply and Wintermute, raising concerns. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s NVT Ratio Sees Drastic Increase, Is A Rise To $0.00003 Still Possible? But the story took an even more troubling turn when Humpy returned with a third proposal, this time requesting 499,000 COMP tokens – a 5.4x increase from the initial 92,000. Interestingly, this proposal sailed through, with only 57 addresses casting their votes. Who Is Humpy, And How Did He Amass Such Outsized Influence? According to DeFi researcher StableScarab, Humpy is a major player across multiple DeFi protocols, adeptly exploiting incentive designs to accumulate vast amounts of governance tokens. His tactics allowed him to gain significant control over Balancer, an Ethereum-based automated market maker in 2022, and now he has set his sights on Compound. The researcher highlights that this incident unveils a critical issue in DeFi governance: “the illusion of decentralization.” While Compound decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is touted as a decentralized decision-making body, the reality, in the words of StableScarab, is that a mere 20 addresses typically participate in governance votes. The researchers claim that even when contentious proposals are put forth, the broader community remains largely indifferent, seemingly unaware or unconcerned with the implications. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Cycle Likely To Go On Till Mid-2025: CryptoQuant CEO Moreover, the Compound team itself appears disengaged, with the official @compoundfinance X account going silent at the time of writing, hours after the incident. This raises questions about the true nature of the protocol’s governance structure, as it seems Gauntlet, a paid advisor, effectively runs the DAO. StableScrab further noted: Humpy’s influence goes beyond governance. He has his own token, @Gold_On_Chain, for his ‘Golden Boys’ community. After today’s Compound event, $GOLD’s value doubled as speculators bet on Humpy’s ability to continue finding “highly profitable” governance/farming strategies. On the other hand, the Compound’s native token COMP has retraced over 1% in the last 24 hours and over 7% in the past week alone in the wake of the latest deemed governance exploit. Additionally, this has further exacerbated the token’s ongoing downtrend since the 2021 bull run, which saw the token hit an all-time high of $910 in May of that year, and is currently down nearly 95% from that level. It remains to be seen what communications the Compound team will issue to investors and what other findings will come to light in the wake of the exploit.

Almost All Bitcoin Investors Are Back In The Green With Latest Recovery According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, resistance looks light in the price ranges ahead. In on-chain analysis, the strength of support and resistance levels is based on the number of investors who last bought their coins at them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Cycle Likely To Go On Till Mid-2025: CryptoQuant CEO The chart below shows what the cost basis distribution on the Bitcoin network looked like at the time of the analytics firm’s post. In the graph, the size of the dot corresponds to the addresses that purchased their coins inside the corresponding range. As is apparent, when IntoTheBlock shared the data, the price ranges ahead all had small dots, while those below had big ones. This suggested that few investors left in the market had their cost basis higher than the spot price. That is, there weren’t many holders in loss left anymore. Since then, however, BTC has seen some pullback into the first of the big circles. Nonetheless, at the current price, most holders should still be in the green. To any investor, their cost basis is naturally an important level, and they may be more likely to make a move when a retest of it happens. Investors in loss may look forward to such a retest to exit at their break-even to escape away with their initial investment. A few investors selling at their break-even isn’t of any consequence to the entire market, but if a large amount of them share their cost basis inside a narrow range, then perhaps a reaction large enough to cause fluctuations in the price can emerge. This is why the strength of support and resistance price levels is related to the number of investors who have their cost basis in on-chain analysis. As investors in loss may react to a retest of their cost basis by selling, large red dots can be potential sources of resistance. However, BTC has no significant obstacles left, so the price could be set to travel to higher levels. As investors in loss react by selling, those in profit can look at the retest of their acquisition level as an opportunity to buy more instead. Thus, green dots can be support centers for the cryptocurrency. As BTC has fallen to one of these green dots, it’s possible the coin can use the cushion to spear ahead at the relatively light red ranges. Related Reading: Shiba Inu, XRP Forming Bullish Divergence, Analytics Firm Reveals Something to keep in mind, however, is that while there may not be many investors desperate to exit at their break-even, there is also a different obstacle BTC could face: profit-taking. With an extreme majority of investors in profits, many would likely become tempted to harvest some of their gains as the coin surges toward a new ATH. It remains to be seen whether demand would be able to absorb this potential selloff.

There is a major bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5945 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.6120 resistance zone. XRP Price Consolidates Above Key Support XRP price made a couple of attempts to gain strength above $0.6120 and $0.6150. However, the bulls failed to gain strength for a close above $0.6150. There was a bearish reaction, and the price retested the $0.5950 support. A low is formed at $0.5957 and the price is now consolidating, like Ethereum. There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5945 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.

The first major resistance is near the $0.6060 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6091 swing high to the $0.5957 low. The next key resistance could be $0.6120. A clear move above the $0.6120 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6150 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.6200 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6350 resistance in the near term. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.6120 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

CONY utilizes synthetic call options to generate income from exposure to Coinbase. The dividend wheel strategy can be used to repurpose CONY's distributions into other areas of the portfolio, offsetting potential downside risk and tax implications. CONY may benefit from the effects of Bitcoin's halving event that took place earlier in 2024. The underlying exposure is linked to COIN, and COIN has historically tracked BTC's price. Overview I strongly believe that we are in one of the absolute best times in modern history to be an income focused investor. There is such an abundance of different high-yielding funds across all asset classes, like REITs, closed end funds, business development companies, and now option-based ETFs. YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) offers investors a massive 96.5% yield, according to YieldMax's website. YieldMax has launched a plethora of these high-yielding funds over the last twelve months, and CONY is my strongest conviction fund out of them all. YieldMax I believe that there is both upside price potential as well as huge income potential that can be captured over the next twelve months. My assumption ties to the underlying asset structure that CONY is linked too, as well as the current outlook surrounding Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). I know the relevance of crypto may turn some of you away, but I ask you to stick with me here, as I will try to make this as straightforward as possible. CONY has a very recent inception, dating back to August 2023. Despite the short history, we can see that CONY's price has failed to show any growth, amounting to a negative return of 1.2%. However, when including the massive distributions since inception, the total return sits above 116%, far outpacing the total return and price movement of the S&P 500 ( SPY ). Data by YCharts COIN has a total annual fund operating expense of 1.01% and is actively advised by Tidal Investments and sub-advised by ZEGA Financial. The fund's primary objective is to seek current income. The fund does this by implementing an option strategy. As a result, the large majority of these YieldMax funds all have the similar problem of a decreasing share price over time. This issue can be attributed to the high distribution rate which gets deducted from the fund's NAV. For example, I recently covered YieldMax Ultra Option Income ETF ( ULTY ) and the price is down over 35% for the year. I pulled some of YieldMax's other funds as a point of reference. Data by YCharts Structure & Downside According to the fund's prospectus , CONY is an actively managed ETF that seeks current income off of its exposure to Coinbase Global ( COIN ). COIN is arguably one of the most popular cryptocurrency marketplaces at the moment. CONY strategically uses synthetic call options to generate income from the indirect exposure to COIN. The term synthetic here indicates that CONY doesn't actual hold the underlying asset COIN as part of their portfolio. However, CONY can still generate high levels of income by selling call options to earn premiums against the price movement of coin. A downside of the option strategy is that the upside is effectively capped. Due to the at-the-money option structure, the price upside is limited at whatever the strike price is. As a brief explanation, let's imagine that CONY sets a strike price of $250 on the underlying stock of COIN, which currently trades at $242 per share. If the price appreciates to $260 per share, the option would execute at the $250 price and CONY's upside would be capped here. This means that CONY holders would miss out on the additional upside which the underlying COIN stock experienced. However, there are no downside caps here and CONY would experience the full impact of COIN falling in share price. This makes timing buys very important with a fund like this. Looking through the full prospectus , I located a very handy breakdown of the different types of option strategies that the fund may use. The use of call and put options are implemented here on maturity targets ranging between one and six months. CONY Prospectus Short-Term Bull Case Even though CONY doesn't actually hold common shares of COIN within the fund, it can still benefit from its upward price movement. However, I strongly believe that we are yet to see the upside of the prior catalyst within the crypto market: the Bitcoin halving . Just to provide a short summary, the Bitcoin halving event occurs every four years within the Bitcoin network. The significance of this event is that the reward supply essentially gets cut in half for the miners who contribute to new blocks. The goal of this process is to effectively reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are created so that the total supply of Bitcoins is limited to twenty-one million. Since this process limits the supply, it acts as a deflationary measure relying on the principles of scarcity. As the supply slowly becomes more limited over time, this assumption is that this will lead to increasing prices and demand. To help paint a picture, this is similar to the same concept that plays out with housing: as the supply decreases, demand typically increases alongside the value of homes. The data clearly tells us that this is the trend with Bitcoin following every instance of a halving event over the last decade. Bitbo Charts Taking a look at the chart above, we can see each halving indicated by the green vertical lines in 2013, 2016, 2020, and 2024. As described, we can see that shortly after every single halving event, the price quickly moved to the upside. While we can't always rely on past events to carry into the future, this trend has never been disrupted, and it backed by basic economic principles of supply and demand. As we can see, the most recent halving even happened this year in 2024 and the price of Bitcoin has yet to take off to the upside. While I cannot provide any specific predictions on how high Bitcoin will go, I do think that CONY will be a unique vehicle to benefit from the rise. Not only will we capture some price appreciate, but we would also get paid some high income while we wait. I would strongly recommend reading VanEck's in-depth article that dives into some long-term valuation estimates for Bitcoin. The most recent source that I could locate suggests that Coinbase owns about $25B in Bitcoin. As a result of the exposure, the price of COIN has naturally followed the general price trend of Bitcoin. As seen from the graph below, the price movement history looks almost identical. Therefore, it isn't too unusual to expect COIN's stock price to shoot up alongside Bitcoin's price once the halving effect kicks in. After all, we've already seen COIN's stock price increase over 100% on a one-year timeline, so huge price swings aren't exactly unusual for the company. Data by YCharts Additionally, another reference point on the outlook of Bitcoin's price would be consistent price movements during election years. US Presidential elections are upcoming at the end of 2024 and may have some correlation with the prior spikes in price for Bitcoin. It could just be the halving events tend to align with election years. However, presidential elections typically add increased levels of volatility and uncertainty in the markets. Investors are very reactive, and perhaps money will flow out of the US markets and into alternative assets such as crypto. We can see each election year market by the red bars below. Either during or shortly after the completion of an election year, the price of Bitcoin tends to appreciate as well. Grayscale However, we can also see that after the huge spikes in price, there are typically large retractions that follow. As a result, I titled this section as a short term bull case because it can be difficult to determine how long the theoretical price run would last. Since CONY essentially caps the upside potential while still sharing all the downside risk, I will aim to avoid holding my CONY position through huge price declines. Therefore, I want to emphasize that the buy rating issued here is conditional with the goal to lock in gains eventually. This is not a buy, hold, and forget type of investment. Data by YCharts Additionally, CONY is trading near its all-time lows while these potential catalysts start to align. I think that if you were to start a position in CONY, now would be the most opportune time in the fund's history. This goes back to the basic saying of 'buy low and sell high'. Dividend Strategy The massive distribution yield over 96% is certainly real and is backed by looking at the previous distributions. One of the appeals of CONY and other YieldMax funds is that the distributions are issued to shareholders on a monthly basis. The most recent distribution was $1.5732 per share and was issued in the first week of July. The distribution for August has not been declared yet, but I expect it to be announced between the 3rd and 5th of next month. We can see that the distribution amounts vary month to month, and this is because the distribution amount is determined by the implied volatility. Volatility has a huge effect on the distribution rate because when volatility is high, management can capture higher premiums on the options. This also ties to my bull case, as I expect that the distribution totals may actually rise through the end of the year. With the US Presidential elections on the horizon, I expect the implied volatility to be elevated. After all, it's already been a crazy warm up the election season with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump followed by Joe Biden dropping out of the race. YieldMaxETFs As previously mentioned, I am not approaching this with a typical buy and hold method. Since there is a strong relation to such a volatile asset like Bitcoin, I do not want to stomach the potential large drops in price. Since I don't plan on maintaining a long-term position, I do not reinvest any of the distributions I receive from CONY. I implement a strategy that I like to call the dividend wheel method. This means that the distributions received from CONY are collected and repurposed to other areas of my portfolio that may offer more opportune chances to grow my wealth. For instance, I've recently taken some of these high-yielding distributions and dumped them into the REIT sector, which I believe to be severely undervalued. This way, I am taking the income from a higher risk investment like CONY, and redirecting those funds into another asset class that isn't as volatile or reactive to huge price swings. Since the distributions roll in on a monthly basis, it gives a greater sense of flexibility on how we can repurpose these funds. However, this is just the strategy that I follow, and your outlook may be completely different. I also follow this strategy because I do anticipate that the price of CONY will ultimately trend downward over a long period of time. This is due to the inherent flaw of these option-based ETFs that cap the upside but maintain exposure to all the downside. Over time, this will lead to a deteriorating price that can only be offset by continued reinvestment and additional capital investments. Most importantly, it is worth mentioning that the distributions received from an option ETF like CONY are typically classified as ordinary dividends. Ordinary dividends are taxed at the most unfavorable rates when compared against the qualified dividends you'd received from a traditional dividend paying stock. While this could be offset in a tax advantaged account like an IRA, I would suggest carefully measuring how much of a tax burden CONY will cause you. A $10,000 investment would yield you over $9,000 in dividend income. This could catch unknowing investors surprised when good old Uncle Sam asks for his cut around tax time. Risk I want to put emphasis on the fact that this style of high-income investing involves higher levels of risk. Not only is the underlying synthetic option strategy risky due to the capped upside and varying distribution amounts, but the link to a highly reactive and volatile asset class like crypto enhances the risk. Bitcoin and Coinbase have seen huge price swings in both directions, and this leaves CONY vulnerable to a large price downside if things go south. If I am wrong about the effect that the halving event may have, CONY's price could ultimately fall to the downside as the market piles out of crypto. Since the distributions are variable and tied to a volatile asset class, I would suggest that retired investors that are looking for reliable and predictable sources of income look elsewhere. There is a large downside risk here that can destroy principal over a very short period of time. While this hasn't happened to CONY, I would like to reference YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF ( TSLY ) that has experienced a massive 47% price downside is a one-year time frame. Let this serve as a parallel example of what can possibly happen to CONY's price if the price of both Bitcoin and Coinbase fall. Data by YCharts Additionally, the high levels of income here could create a large tax burden for investors that hold this fund in a regular taxable account. This tax burden may catch some investors off guard and cause an uncomfortable tax situation. Lastly, CONY is not diversified and is linked to one primary stock. To unlock some of YieldMax's other funds such as YieldMax Universe Fund of Option Income ETF ( YMAX ), there are not a diverse range of holdings here that can mitigate downside price loss. Takeaway In conclusion, I am issuing a strong buy rating on CONY as I believe that we may see increased upside due to the Bitcoin halving as well as higher levels of volatility due to US Presidential elections on the horizon. The massive dividend yield helps introduce a dividend wheel strategy that can super speed your portfolio income. The high distributions can be strategically utilized to help increase weight in underserved areas of your portfolio or areas that may present attractive opportunities for growth. The price currently trades near all-time lows, and now would be the most opportune time to initiate a position.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4707840-cony-high-income-play-on-bitcoin-speculation?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31715056.jpeg

31714714,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632107,1722310204,"Ethereum’s Breakout Moment: Here’s Why ETH Could Skyrocket to $15,000 Soon","Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has started showing signs of a bullish trajectory. Particularly, according to insights from CoinSignals, a prominent crypto analysis platform, Ethereum is poised for a significant price rally. The platform suggests that Ethereum could see its value rise to between $12,000 and $15,000 shortly. This forecast is based on positive market trends and strong fundamental performance indicators supporting a sustained value increase. Related Reading: Ethereum To Match Bitcoin’s Strength and Surge? Indicators Turn Green ETH Fundamental Strengths CoinSignals’ optimism is backed by several key factors that differentiate ETH from its peers, notably Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which experiences a sell-pressure of around 450 BTC daily, Ethereum, on the other hand, enjoys a much lower sell-pressure, according to CoinSignals. This lowered pressure is instrumental for Ethereum, resulting in more sustainable and potentially explosive growth. In addition, the platform points out that Ethereum is becoming more popular due to its significant participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Perhaps the most bullish figure for Ethereum’s price growth comes from one of its strong indicators: ETH staked. According to data from Coinbase, roughly 27.65% of the total supply of Ethereum is currently staked. The past 24 hours alone saw a nearly 4% increase in staked tokens. Notably, not only does this staking activity indicate confidence in the future of Ethereum, but it also helps drive its deflationary economics even further by decreasing the available supply. Data from Ultrasoundmoney shows that since the ETH merge took place in September 2022, the available supply has plunged significantly, with nearly 300,000 ETH erased from circulation. Moreover, real-world asset tokenization – a sector sparking interest in numerous institutional investors – is still largely dominated by Ethereum, CoinSignals mentioned. #ETH Blow Off Top Target : $12k – $15k 🚀 – Almost 30% of Supply is Staked. – No Daily Selling Pressure like BTC (450 BTC Day) – Deflationary Asset. – All Narratives Born on ETH. – Leader of RWA and Tokenization. Our Recent Avg Buying Price : $2900 pic.twitter.com/S2HO3lrzR1 — Coin Signals (@CoinSignals_) July 29, 2024 Major players, such as BlackRock, are expressing interest in the tokenization market, specifically those platforms that lead initiatives, such as Ethereum. The platform’s inherent capabilities make it an ideal foundation for DeFi projects and RWA initiatives experiencing rapid growth and innovation. Ethereum Market Sentiment In the past 24 hours, ETH has seen a mixture of bulls and bears in its price performance. Following a rise to $3,395 in the earlier hours of Monday, the asset faced a noticeable retracement, falling back to $3,253 before now stabilizing at $3,293, at the time of writing up by nearly 1%. Notably, not only is CoinSignals predicting a bullish future for ETH, but other notable analysts in the crypto community are also doing the same.

A close above the $68,500 resistance might spark bullish moves. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $70,000 resistance. More Losses In BTC?

31712736,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632094,1722306657,"Ethereum Poised To Break $4,000 As Price Tests Crucial Levels; Analyst","Ethereum appears poised for a significant breakout above the highly anticipated $4,000 price threshold. Despite this potential, the cryptocurrency has recently fallen short of the expectations of many enthusiasts and retail traders. The much-hyped launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs, rather than sparking a rally, turned into a classic “sell-the-news” event, leading to disappointment in the market. However, according to a crypto analyst, the overall sentiment around Ethereum remains fundamentally positive. This optimism is largely held up by some bullish investors who continue to hold up the cryptocurrency and its stability at a crucial support level of $3,200. Ethereum Set For A Breakout In a Tradingview post, crypto analyst RLinda delves into some compelling analysis concerning Ethereum’s current performance. On the price side of things, Ethereum corrected by a massive 11.5% in just two days after the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs on July 23. Although it has since recovered some of these losses, Ethereum is still in this corrective phase bounded by tests of key zones of interest around the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level and also testing the 200-day moving average (MA-200). Related Reading: Technical Indicators Show Strong Bitcoin Bullishness – New ATH On The Horizon? RLinda’s analysis highlights that this corrective test of the MA-200 prompted a significant breakdown below the critical support level of $3,200, with Ethereum’s price bottoming out at $3,115 on July 25. However, this dip below $3,200 proved to be a false breakdown, as it triggered a strong influx of buyers who successfully prevented further declines. To sustain the broader bullish momentum, RLinda emphasizes the importance of bulls maintaining Ethereum’s price above the $3,200 support level. If they succeed, it could pave the way for a renewed bullish rally, potentially driving the price to break through key resistance levels and target the $4,000 to $4,900 range. “The main task of the bulls is to keep the defense above the zone of interest at $3200. Further it remains to wait for resistance retest with the purpose of its breakthrough and further bull run to $4000 – $4500 – $4900,” the analyst said. Achieving this bullish resurgence would require Ethereum to overcome significant resistance around $3,357 and $3,540, which are identified as strong order blocks. Current Price Action At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,370, having rebounded by 4.78% from a low of $3,219 in the past 24 hours. This recovery places the cryptocurrency just above RLinda’s first resistance level of $3,357. Related Reading: Donald Trump Reveals Plans For US Government’s 213,239 Bitcoin If Elected Ethereum’s trajectory could unfold in one of two ways. The cryptocurrency might continue its upward momentum and test the next significant resistance at $3,540. Successfully surpassing this level could pave the way for a breakthrough above the order block, signaling further bullish potential up until $4,900. On the other hand, Ethereum could face a reversal, potentially dropping back below $3,300. This would suggest a retest of lower support levels and a possible extension of the consolidation phase.

Analysts Bullish On DOGE Price Breakout Attempt,"Over the weekend, Dogecoin (DOGE) soared 11% after the general market performance. The price surge led the dog-themed token to retest key resistance levels, which fueled a bullish prediction by crypto analysts. Investors also shared a positive sentiment following Elon Musk’s recent comments regarding cryptocurrencies and the largest memecoin by market capitalization. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Fire: 20% Surge In 3 Weeks Teases Record-Breaking Potential Dogecoin Attempts To Break Above Key Level During the past week, market watchers have revealed their bullish predictions for the largest memecoin by market cap. Daan Crypto Trades revealed that DOGE was “showing some strength” after trading above the daily 200 MA/EMA last week and testing a multi-month diagonal trendline. DOGE attempted to break out of the downtrend line again after trading above the $0.134 resistance level in the early hours of Monday. To Daan, Dogecoin’s price could see “higher over the next couple of weeks” if it holds on to the $0.13 area. Similarly, analyst Crypto Poseidon pointed out that DOGE’s “daily ema50-200 started to squeeze into each other again.” Per the analyst, this will lead to an expansion above the previous yearly high of $0.22. Poseidon added, “$0.3 on the horizon, dog lovers.” Amid the market recovery, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed on Thursday that Dogecoin was playing the same pattern it has displayed before. According to this pattern, DOGE consolidates in a descending triangle. During the consolidation, the memecoin historically sees a 140%-230% rally before retracing around 60%. Per the analyst, DOGE investors should “just wait” as the memecoin enters the bull run after the retrace. As of this writing, Dogecoin is hovering between the $0.129 and $0.130 price range, a 0.5% drop in the last 24 hours. However, this performance represents a 7.6% and 5.3% price surge in the biweekly and monthly timeframes. Elon Musk Won’t Promote Crypto But Has ‘Soft Spot’ For DOGE On Sunday, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk joined The X Takeover event hosted by the Tesla Owners Silicon Valley club. Musk made a special virtual guest appearance to discuss his insights on technology, space exploration, sustainability, and cryptocurrencies. During his appearance, the CEO clarified he would not promote crypto, but might address them jokingly in the future. He also stated he doesn’t have a negative opinion about cryptocurrencies despite his refusal to endorse them. Musk explained that certain crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), have merit in his eyes, but investors won’t see him pumping them. However, the billionaire added that he got a fondness for Dogecoin due to his liking of dogs and memes. I’m not going to be promoting crypto—at most, in a joking way. If you see me pumping crypto, it’s not me. I do think there’s merit in Bitcoin and maybe some other cryptos, and I’ve sort of got a soft spot for Dogecoin because I like dogs and memes. The DOGE community had a mixed reaction to Musk’s remarks. Some investors consider the comments bad news for Dogecoin and its holders as it meant he no longer supported the memecoin’s adoption. “I guess putting Doge on the Moon is not a real thing he’s considering anymore,” one reply read. Others believe his crypto stance clarification was necessary as some would “think he said he’s against crypto which is not true.” Additionally, many investors considered that his liking for DOGE was bullish for the memecoin.

Analysts are now eyeing the potential for an extended super-cycle, with market expert Doctor Profit suggesting that the recent rally could begin a significant uptrend with plenty of room to run. Bitcoin Price Projections According to a recent report by Doctor Profit, the current price action is the first phase of this potential super cycle, noting that during the 2021 bull run, he had accurately predicted Bitcoin’s crash to around $18,000, followed by the capitulation event triggered by the FTX collapse, where it hit $15,400. “At this point, I posted that I am going all in with the 2021 bull market gains back into the market at prices between $16,000 and $18,000,” Doctor Profit stated. “This bottom price is historically significant and unlikely to be revisited.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price (DOGE) Eyes Impressive Gains: Will It Break Through? The analyst further explained the various phases of the current market cycle, highlighting the “pre-bull” phase characterized by resistance at $38,500, which needed to be breached to enter the second pre-bull phase. Doctor Profit believes that this phase was driven by significant buying activity from Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Justin Sun, and Bitfinex whales, as well as the filing of the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by BlackRock in June 2023. The “Golden Bull” phase, as seen in the chart above, followed the approval of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF and saw the entry of traditional financial players into the crypto market, leaving the $48,000 to $74,000 range as one of the most crucial support levels that will be defended during the upcoming bull market, according to the analyst. “This region of golden bull will mark, or be very close to the Bitcoin bottom for the incoming bear market,” Doctor Profit explained. “Again, this region is BlackRock investors’ entry, and at all cost they will defend it during this bull market.” Considering these levels that could support BTC’s price in the coming months, Doctor Profit’s technical analysis points out that the initial target for this super cycle is set at the $86,000 threshold, with projections ranging between $110,000 and $120,000 in a conservative scenario. However, Doctor Profit noted that in the most optimistic scenario, the Bitcoin price could soar between $180,000 and $220,000 if the price surges above $70,000 and consolidates above this milestone. Investor Confidence Peaks Adding to the bullish sentiment, a recent report by CoinShares showed that Bitcoin has seen healthy inflows of $519 million in the past week, bringing its month-to-date inflows to $3.6 billion and year-to-date inflows to a record $19 billion. The firm noted that this surge in inflows and investor confidence could be attributed to the potential use of BTC by the US government as a strategic reserve asset following Donald Trump’s speech on Saturday, as well as the increased likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September 2024.

As reported by our sister site Bitcoinist, former US President Donald Trump reiterated his plans to create a national Bitcoin stash and turn the cryptocurrency into a strategic reserve asset for the US dollar. Trump also promised that the US government would retain ownership of all BTC in custody rather than participate in a market sell-off that could ultimately affect price action and potential upward movement. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $68,800, registering price gains of 1.3% and 2.3% in the 24-hour and 7-day time frames, respectively.
