42381036,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93JCx,1531778413,CFTC Says Buyer Beware in New ICO Advisory,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has issued an advisory on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto-assets, warning would-be buyers to do their homework before investing.  Its ""Customer Advisory: Use Caution When Buying Digital Coins or Tokens"" mirrors, in some ways, words of caution that have come out of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That agency's most famous warning to date is, perhaps, its fake ""HoweyCoin"" ICO website, which humorously warned investors about the risk involved in token sales, particularly those that offer outsized returns.  And while the SEC has focused on the side of crypto-assets that may run afoul of securities law – with some synergies between the two sides taking place – the CFTC appears to be moving to clarify where such assets may be considered the types of financial products it regulates.  The agency noted that ""digital tokens and coins can also be derivatives or commodities, depending on how they are structured."" Back in 2015, the CFTC first said that it considers cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to be commodities, and today's missive indicates that some of the crypto-assets coming out in the market today could fall under the agency's purview.  To date, much of the CFTC's public-facing work in this area has been focused on targeting fraud within the U.S.  The agency has filed several civil lawsuits since the start of the year, and the CFTC is reportedly involved in an ongoing probe into cryptocurrency market manipulation.

42381040,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93JBh,1531771246,Congress Is Now Holding Two Crypto Hearings This Wednesday,"Congress is set to hold not one but two separate hearings related to cryptocurrencies on Wednesday.  Last week, CoinDesk reported that the House Committee on Financial Services will gather this week to discuss the subject, with this particular hearing honing in on the question of crypto as a new form of money. A memo published since that news first broke notably states that members will examine ""the extent to which the U.S. government should consider cryptocurrencies as money and the potential domestic and global uses for cryptocurrencies.""  That same day, the House Agriculture Committee will hold a hearing entitled ""Cryptocurrencies: Oversight of New Assets in the Digital Age."" In a statement, chairman Michael Conaway explained that the hearing seeks to ""shed light on the promise of digital assets and the regulatory challenges facing this new asset class.""  It's a noteworthy statement, declaring that at least some in the U.S. national legislature hold the view that cryptocurrencies constitute a new kind of asset.  ""Our committee has a deep interest in promoting strong markets for commodities of all types, including those emerging through new technology,"" Conaway added.  Together, the hearings represent a double-header of sorts, and CoinDesk has confirmed both hearings will be live-streamed from Capitol Hill, Washington, DC. The Agriculture Committee hearing will take place at 10 a.m. EST while the Financial Services Committee's hearing will occur at 2 p.m. EST.  According to the Financial Services Committee memo, the witnesses set to appear are: Dr. Rodney Garratt of University of California Santa Barbara; Dr. Norbert Michel of the Heritage Foundation's Center for Data Analysis; Dr. Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; and Mr. Alex Pollock, a senior fellow for the R Street Institute.

42381024,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Iwb,1531771232,The Kodak KashMiner's Flashy Debut Ends In Failure,"The much-publicized partnership that would have resulted in digital media brand Kodak's name appearing on a series of bitcoin miners is no more.  Revealed in January at the CES tech show in Las Vegas, the Kodak KashMiner boasted a two-year income projection of $9,000 and required an up-front payment of roughly one-third of that amount. The product debuted around the same time that Kodak inked a still-in-progress partnership that will see its name attached to a cryptocurrency.  Critics accused Kodak of using the KashMiner as a short-term stock boost, with some even calling the product a ""Kodak-branded cryptocurrency folly"" for its unrealistic claims. According to the BBC, the brand licensee for Kodak LED lighting products known as Spotlite USA had originally intended to label and rent out the KashMiner for consumers but ultimately ""the venture was never officially licensed and no devices had ever been installed.""  The news comes as somewhat of a shock given that a representative for Spotlite told the BBC at the time of unveiling that hundreds KashMiners were to ""arrive shortly"" and add to the 80 already in possession – all in order to meet demand coming from interested miners.  Now, according to Spotlite's CEO, Halston Mikail, the project never got off the ground in the first place.  Mikail told the news service:  ""While you saw units at CES from our licensee Spotlite, the KashMiner is not a Kodak brand licensed product. Units were not installed at our headquarters.""  He also reportedly added the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission put to halt the plan and effectively prevented the Kodak KashMiners from being rented out as originally intended.  Instead, Mikail told the BBC the company would focus on growing its own private mining operations in-house.

42381041,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93JHz,1531768554,Bitcoin's Road Back to $7K (And the Chart Hurdles In the Way),"Having defended $6,000 last week, bitcoin (BTC) appears to be building momentum for a price rise, but nearby technical hurdles still present a formidable challenge.  At press time, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,689 on Bitfinex and looks to be gaining steam for another test of $6,838. As such, the level is shaping up to be a make-or-break mark, one that could reveal if a classic trend reversal pattern, known as the inverse head-and-shoulders, will take effect.  Indeed, a close above that level would amount to a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open doors for a rally to $7,900 (a target measured by adding the distance from the resistance to the recent low with the break-out level).  So, while the bulls may feel emboldened by a possible inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, they are cautioned against being too ambitious. The area between $7,000 - $7,100 hosts more relevant technical hurdles that need to be penetrated in order to prove the bull case.  Obstacle #1: 0.236 Fibonacci Retracement and Inverse Head-and-Shoulders Neckline  Bitcoin has failed to absorb offers (supply) around $6,850 several times since June 11th, establishing it as a key technical hurdle. (Traders use a tool called the Fibonacci retracement to identify support and resistance levels).  Interestingly, the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement from May high of $9,900 happens to be in the same area, according to Bitfinex Exchange.        While bulls would have liked to breach resistance on an earlier attempt, the consistent rejection is allowing for an inverse head and shoulders reversal pattern to take form.  A convincing break would confirm the inverse head and shoulder reversal, shifting short-term trend into bullish favor.  Bitcoin would then likely attack long-term trendline resistance located at $7,050, as seen in the chart below.  Obstacle #2: Long-Term Downtrend Resistance  It's no secret that bitcoin has been in a commanding bear grip since reaching its all-time high of $19,891 in December of 2017, a picture painted by the long-term downtrend line seen in the chart below.  If the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern takes form, the trendline of resistance would likely be tested in the following hours or days.  For a comparable view in bitcoin history, the infamous 2014 bear market formed a similar market structure:  The market finally rebounded after a break and finding support on the downtrend line on Aug. 25, 2015.  A convincing break and close above of the current downtrend would carry strong bullish implications surely to shift the intermediate term trend into bullish favor - opening the doors for a move to $7,900 (as per inverse head-and-shoulders measured height method).  A rejection from the trendline would likely give an edge back to the bears.  Outlier: An ETF rejection  Looking down the line, August will be a month every cryptocurrency investor pays close attention to, as the SEC will make a decision regarding the recent CBOE ETF proposal.  An approval would be a historic event, as it would open the doors for much awaited institutional investment - a potential inflow of funds bitcoin has never seen before. With that said, another ETF rejection could be just enough of a momentum killer to return bitcoin's trend into bearish hands.

42381032,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93J5P,1531760408,Court Approves Alleged Bitcoin Money Launder's Extradition to France,"A Russian national accused of laundering billions of dollars on the now-defunct crypto exchange BTC-e could soon be extradited to France following a court decision.  Since his arrest last summer, Alexander Vinnik has been at the center of a legal tug-of-war between the governments of Russia, the U.S. and, more recently, France, all of which are seeking to extradite him.  Vinnik, who has maintained no wrongdoing from all charges, had been awaiting a decision from Greek authorities on which country he would ultimately be sent to, though in the past he had expressed a preference for extradition to Russia.  According to the Associated Press, the Greek courts decided Friday that Vinnik would be sent to France in light of accusations of his involvement in cyber attacks against some 100 French nationals. The decision drew swift criticism from the Russian government in wake of the expulsion of two Russian diplomats from Greece just a day prior related to tensions over the entry of Macedonia into the NATO military alliance.  Ilias Spyrliadis, Vinnik's defense attorney, was reported by the Washington Post as saying that Vinnik will appeal the decision and continue to maintain his innocence from all criminal charges.  Indeed, this is not the first appeal Vinnik has made before Greek authorities, pushing back on the green light offered last December that would have effectively extradited Vinnik to the U.S.  The U.S. government claims Vinnik was the ""operator"" of BTC-e and utilized the platform to launder some $4 billion over the course of six years. Levying a $110 million fine against the exchange and a $12 million penalty against the Russian national himself, Vinnik would face up to 55 years in prison if convicted in the U.S.  Paris image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/07/16/court-approves-alleged-bitcoin-money-launders-extradition-to-france,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3b3b0aff4b290e12170fc56bd2fa809d995f790-1000x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""The Trade Finance Platform is a blockchain project initiated by 7 banks in Hong Kong. The project has been facilitated by the HKMA and is targeted for launch by September 2018,"" the authority told CoinDesk via email.  According to a report from the Financial Times on Monday, the HKMA's blockchain platform has 21 banks participating as participating nodes, including HSBC and Standard Chartered.  The project has been public since early in 2017, when reports indicated several banks had completed a test for the trade finance platform, alongside the HKMA, in an effort to bring transparency to data sharing across financial institutions. Participants at the time included the HKMA, Bank of China, Bank of East Asia, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, with consulting firm Deloitte as a facilitator for the project.  ""The aims of the platform are to reduce frauds related to trade finance and double financing, and therefore lead to increased credit availability and lowered financing costs in the long run. This may in turn help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access to trade financing,"" the HKMA explained today.  Aside from the founding banks, other institutions have also indicated interest in the platform, according to the email, and the HKMA expects more banks to gradually join in the future.  When and if it goes live, the HKMA project will be one of the first live blockchain trade finance platforms backed by a government institution. Earlier this month, a group of European banks also announced that a trade finance blockchain platform dubbed We.Trade, built with help from technology giant IBM, is also live.  Meanwhile, the HKMA is also working with its counterpart in Singapore to develop a blockchain-based trade finance network to settle cross-border transactions.

The exchange announced last Friday that the new fund will be backing a group of selected token funds to further invest in blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. The funds selected will all be accredited sponsors, it added.  During an initial phase, it will allocate 100 million of its own FT tokens – worth around $24 million at press time – to fund the project. However, instead of providing the amount from its own reserves, FCoin said the the capital will come from a buyback of tokens on the secondary market.  The move accompanies FCoin's addition of a new ""FT trading zone,"" also announced on Friday, which includes trading pairs between FT and other tokens.  FCoin stated that only projects that have raised over 3 million FT through the fund of funds and have been recommended by at least two sponsors will be eligible for listing in the new trading section.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, FCoin saw soaring trading volumes after launch due to the adoption of a new business model called ""trans-fee mining,"" which reimburses users' transaction fees with the exchange's FT tokens.  While the model has drawn industry criticism over its long-term sustainability, CoinMarketCap data shows the platform recorded some $3.8 billion in trading volume over the last 24 hours.  That said, FCoin's plan to buy back its tokens from the secondary market also follows a continuous decline in the price of the FT token, which has plunged by around 80 percent over a month, from $1.25 on June 13 to around $0.24 at press time.

According to a Financial News London report on Monday, the New York-based asset manager has now set up a working group to look into ways it can ""take advantage"" of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, as well as to monitor what rivals are doing in the space.  Citing sources close to the matter, the article says that the working group is comprised of different divisions from within BlackRock, and may be looking at the possibility of a bitcoin ETF.  Soon after the news broke, bitcoin's price rose sharply from $6,360 to $6,646 in just two hours – a gain of over $280.  The company's CEO Larry Fink confirmed to Reuters that BlackRock does indeed have a working group and that bitcoin is part of its scope for study. However, while he said, ""We are a big student of blockchain,"" Fink added that he doesn't see ""huge demand for cryptocurrencies.""  Fink has made mixed comments about the cryptocurrency in the past, saying in October 2017 that he was a ""big believer"" in bitcoin, though he also also cautioned that it is ""an index for money laundering.""  Since then, in February, the firm has said it envisions a wider role for cryptocurrencies in the future, and that blockchain has promise despite some obstacles.  As reported by CoinDesk, global chief investment strategist Richard Turnill said at the time in a company report:  ""We see cryptocurrencies potentially becoming more widely used in the future as the market matures. Yet for now we believe they should only be considered by those who can stomach potentially complete losses. Similarly, blockchain needs to overcome significant hurdles to reach its promising future.""

42381017,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93H15,1531742434,"​​Market Mania Is Unavoidable, But Crypto Must Get Past It","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      The financial bubbles of 17th and 18th century Europe are favorite references for those, among both believers and detractors, who warn of the excesses in crypto-asset markets.  The events of those times long past capture the same problems of information asymmetry and irrational speculation that leave many seasoned observers concerned about this moment. The South Sea Bubble, the Mississippi Bubble, and Tulip Mania were all examples of how, during money-crazed manias, unscrupulous entrepreneurs and early investors exploit their privileged access to information to do great harm to an ill-informed investing public. This, at its essence, describes the risk inherent in initial coin offerings (ICOs).  But the historical context behind those centuries-ago events is also important: they were a direct, almost unavoidable side effect of the invention at that same time of limited liability companies, stock markets and derivatives, some of the most game-changing financial innovations of all time.  On the one hand, these inventions – spearheaded by the Dutch – created vast new opportunities for a growing middle class to engage in wild, ill-conceived speculation. But on the other, they unlocked a giant, previously unavailable pool of collective capital, offering a much more efficient way for entrepreneurs to fund their ventures.  Vast worldwide enterprises were launched on the back of these new money-raising tools. They gave us the global capitalist economy we now take for granted.  This context is important because everything that looks like investor mania in cryptoland today – the 2017 bubble in token prices, the scam coins, the vaporware, the 10-figure ICO raises without a line of code written – might similarly be viewed as the unpleasant but unavoidable side effect of a major technological transformation.  If crypto-assets, smart contracts and blockchain technology fulfill their potential to decentralize the economy, the change they promise could be just as profound, if not more, as that sparked by those inventions during the Dutch renaissance. This technology represents a radical re-imagining of record-keeping, fundraising, organizational design and of money itself.  At times like this, you just can't stop the unsavory, get-rich-quick types.  Tech lures speculation  As I've noted elsewhere, if you examine moments through history when a new, general-purpose technology upended the economic order, they were almost always accompanied by periods of intensified financial speculation.  It was the case with railroads, with electricity and, of course, with the rise of the internet in the late nineties. The Venezuelan economist Carlota Perez has even argued that the social phenomena of bubbles and speculation are necessary elements in how societies fund and build the infrastructure upon which transformative technologies become entrenched in the economy.  But the opposite causal relationship does not necessarily hold true.  Tracing every moment of hype and speculation that has been associated with a new technology will not at all find that it's always associated with the successful deployment of a powerful new technology. History is rife with supposedly ""revolutionary"" ideas that captured people's imaginations but weren't ultimately deployed in a widespread, society-altering way.  The past 50 years are full of them: the Segway, Google Glass, Betamax, the Concorde, to name a few. Note: all of these were impressive technologies and some have gone on to be important components of subsequent inventions. But for various reasons – the cost of production, marketing, fashion, etc. – they never took off in a way that matched the hype.  Gambling as a service  I was thinking about all this as I read about Augur's impressive launch of its prediction market. In one day, its ethereum-based decentralized application processed $400,000 in bets on everything from U.S. elections to the World Cup.  The question to me is whether the initial enthusiasm for decentralized prediction markets – in which contracts can be written for payouts between parties on the outcome of any particular event – will go beyond human beings' natural proclivity to gamble and ultimately deliver on Augur's real promise to society: a crowd-sourced, market-based forecasting system and an incentive, reputation token model for rewarding honesty.  In this case, the market Augur is developing literally requires speculation to function. Gambling is not just a byproduct; it is integral to its success. But just because people want to bet in this way does not mean that the price discovery around their predictions will be widely used by society at large to process and value information about occurrences that matter. Only time will tell on that one.  You could ask similar questions about other sectors of the crypto industry that attract significant speculation but also represent potentially powerful, cutting-edge ideas. While I'm convinced that the underlying concepts of incentivized consensus, cryptographically secured distributed ledgers, digital assets, and decentralized exchange will succeed in some form, I see no guarantees yet that any of the various manifestations of those ideas – including bitcoin – will necessarily survive and make an impact on the world.  So, let's ask these questions:  Are ICOs just enabling scammers and founders of doomed-to-failure projects to get rich on the greater fool theory of bubble-nomics? Or is this truly the killer app of blockchain technology, the one that emancipates capital from Silicon Valley gatekeepers and creates a global market for ideas?  Was the recent enthusiasm for Cryptokitties a fad, a crypto Beanie Babies moment, or will it go down as the vital use case that proves the value of digital scarcity and fosters markets in which producers of unique creative works can monetize them  Will bitcoin be forever viewed as a fanatic passion of ""To the Moon"" HODLers or can it truly be the foundation of a new global reserve asset and payments platform?  These and others like them are vital questions to answer if we are to ensure that blockchain technology's vast potential plays out to the benefit of matters to society at large.  Value to society  Answering these questions comes down to how the technology itself is integrated into the wider economy.  That notion itself can refer as much to a new type of market as any other kind of technology. (The early Dutch stock markets offer a good analogy here for Augur's prediction markets – organizational technologies in their own right.) Regardless, there still has to be broad-based value to society if the technology (and the market it supports) is to survive and prosper.  Here the history of Europe's early capital markets is again valuable. The fallout from the disastrous South Sea Bubble didn't kill the idea of public capital markets for funding new ventures, but it did bring order and societal interest into play. These came in the form of new rules from governments on who could issue public stock and how. From that evolved the entrenched, regulated stock exchanges and related asset markets that we use today.  This is not at all to say that government regulation must be the answer to crypto's aspirations to go mainstream – the very concept of a censorship-resistant system tends to run counter to it. But it does mean that those of us involved in developing this technology should encourage protocols, best practices, standards and norms of behavior that have at their core the interests of society at large.  History suggests that naysayers like Nouriel Roubini who scoff at the hype and speculation in crypto communities could be blind to the major transformational moment that underpins it. But it equally offers a warning to crypto enthusiasts: don't get lost in the hype; create something that lasts; build something that matters to everyone.

42381016,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Gzp,1531738223,G20 Watchdog Releases Framework for 'Vigilant' Crypto Monitoring,"The Financial Stability Board (FSB), an organization focused on analyzing and making recommendations to the G20 on global financial systems, has presented a framework for monitoring cryptocurrency assets.  It notably lists several metrics that the FSB will use to keep an eye on the developing crypto markets and ""should help to identify and mitigate risks to consumer and investor protection, market integrity, and potentially to financial stability.""  The standardized framework was published along with a report on Monday and has been submitted to the G20 nations' financial ministers and central bank governors.  According to the document, the FSB's monitoring efforts will focus on crypto assets' price volatility, the size and growth of initial coin offerings (ICOs), crypto's wider use in payments and institutional exposure, as well as the market's volatility when compared to gold, currencies and equities.  The FSB – which is led by Bank of England governor Mark Carney – will also periodically compile qualitative reports to gather intelligence for market confidence, the report says.  The organization further sets out the reasoning behind the framework, saying:  ""While the FSB believes that crypto-assets do not pose a material risk to global financial stability at this time it recognizes the need for vigilant monitoring in light of the speed of market developments.""  The report indicated that, apart from the FSB, other international regulatory organizations too are stepping up their efforts in monitoring specific areas of the cryptocurrency industry.  For instance, International Organization of Securities Commissions, a global regulatory body made of securities watchdogs, is developing its own framework in an effort to help member countries better analyze the impacts of domestic and foreign ICOs on investors.  Meanwhile, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is gathering data on its member banks' direct and indirect exposure to cryptocurrency in an effort to quantify the potential impact of the technology.  The FSB report comes as the result of the G20 meeting in March this year, at which there were calls for global regulation of cryptocurrencies. As previously reported by CoinDesk, member countries agreed at the time that initial recommendations were required over what data should be used to monitor the crypto space, and set July as a deadline.

42381019,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93H3b,1531731626,Bitcoin Eyes Bull Reversal As Volumes Spike From 36-Week Lows,"Bitcoin is eyeing change of fortunes above $6,800, having convincingly scaled a key moving average hurdle earlier today.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at a six-day high of $6,600 on Bitfinex - up 3.44 percent on the day.  The cryptocurrency remained bid over the weekend and rose to $6,400 as expected despite low investor participation. For instance, prices rose above $6,300 on Saturday, but trading volumes fell to $2.92 billion, the lowest level since November 7, according to CoinMarketCap.  However, the solid move above the 20-day moving average (MA) resistance of $6,400 seen today is backed by a pick-up in trading volume.  As of writing, 24-hour trading volume stands at $4.64 billion - up more than 50 percent from the 36-week lows seen on Saturday. Thus, rally looks sustainable and could be extended further towards $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance).  Daily chart        BTC's recovery from $6,080 (Thursday's low) and a rally to $6,600 has created a higher low (bullish setup) on the chart.  The relative strength index (RSI) is also biased toward the bulls (above 50.00).  So, prices look set to test the key resistance at $6,838 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance). Essentially, BTC is now creating the right shoulders of the inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern.  Still, there is merit in being cautious as the cryptocurrency looks overbought as per the short duration charts.  4-hour chart  The relative strength index (RSI) is at the highest level since April 24, meaning the cryptocurrency is at its most overbought in nearly three months.  Hence, a break above $6,838 might remain elusive for another 24-hours or could be short-lived for the time being.  View  BTC's corrective rally has gathered pace and prices could rise to $6,838 (neckline resistance) in the next day or two.  A close (as per UTC) above $6,838 would confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and would open the doors to $7,920 (target as per the measured height method).  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $6,400 (20-day MA) would kill the odds of BTC rising to $6,838.  A break below $5,755 (June 24 low) would revive the bearish view.

42381014,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93Gw3,1531728012,Sex Workers Have Serious Issues With a Crypto-Powered 'Uber for Escorts',"""Too pimp-like and not safe to use.""  That's how one sex worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described the cryptocurrency platform PinkDate, for which she was invited to test the service but refused.  Describing itself as the ""Uber of escorting,"" PinkDate is one of several sex industry startups launching a crypto-fueled booking app funded by an initial coin offering (ICO). The platform, currently in a closed beta, aims to match sex workers with clients (just as Uber does for drivers and passengers). Except instead of credit cards, clients would pay for services with bitcoin or monero.  The team has raised more than $1 million through the sale, and a dozen escorts are registered to use the app, according to Sarah Stevens, PinkDate's former president.  However, experts familiar with the complexities of sex work identified a litany of issues unique to this project, from exploitative fees to a lack of sex worker representation in the project's leadership.  Not least of all, PinkDate is asking for a lot of trust.  First, the project's founders are anonymous and their locations are unknown.  A PinkDate spokesman who gave only a first name, Roger, told CoinDesk, ""PinkDate is not registered as a legal entity. We are extra-jurisdictional and operate anonymously.""  But while that setup may seem to be in line with the cypherpunk ethos that gave rise to cryptocurrency, PinkDate also requires the escorts using its platform to have active Twitter accounts and hand over copies of their government-issued ID.  This arguably creates an asymmetric relationship – the sex workers, who risk arrest or social ostracism if they were to be outed, are being asked to trust operators whom they know nothing about.  Screening and compliance  Another way in which escorts might have to trust PinkDate's shadowy founders is with client screening to weed out abusive customers.  While the platform will also ask clients to provide identification, sex workers worry PinkDate isn't devoting enough resources to cross-reference these IDs with industry blacklist databases.  Roger said all client information will be provided to the escort as well, although escorts felt this assurance was dubious based on a lack of responsiveness related to product launch delays and technical errors.  Another escort, who also requested anonymity, said the team has not been communicative with sex workers who signed up to use the app.  ""They clearly don't care about the girls on the site. None of us got emails explaining what's going on,"" she said, referring to such delays.  Asked about concerns that a blacklisted or abusive client could use the service, Roger said, ""We are going to finalize an arrangement with a commercial database that specifically deals with adult-oriented projects."" But he provided no further specifics.  All this might be acceptable to some in the profession if PinkDate still had a sex worker on staff, but Stevens was the only one and PinkDate publicly severed ties with her last month.  In a statement, PinkDate cited SETA/FOSTA, a U.S. law criminalizing internet services or users that ""enable"" prostitution, as its reason for parting ways with Stevens.  However, Stevens told CoinDesk part of the reason behind the split was her concerns about PinkDate's business model.  One such concern is compliance with financial regulations. Unlike the utility token offered by SpankChain, which will be used strictly as that platform's internal currency for tipping erotic performers, PinkDate's site explicitly says the token it's selling in the ICO just represents equity in the company, for which holders will receive dividends. (Within the PinkDate ecosystem, clients pay escorts in bitcoin or monero, and the platform takes a cut.)  But while labeling your ICO a share offering is usually considered erring on the side of caution in a regulatory environment where few jurisdictions recognize utility tokens as a legitimate category, PinkDate is unabashedly pushing the envelope.  ""They do zero know-your-customer and anti-money laundering [checks],"" Stevens said, referring to the screening of token-buyers. ""Since they're not a legal entity, this is not even a security token offering.""  Roger acknowledged that it does not vet token buyers. ""Anyone can buy PinkDate Token Shares. There is no screening process,"" he told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""We are selling unregistered securities for a company that's building a global escorting platform.""  Even beyond its plans for unlawful operations in North America, PinkDate's escort onboarding process would fail compliance standards in many jurisdictions around the world where prostitution is legalized since most require routine health screenings and PinkDate does not.  Robin Attig, CEO of the rival crypto startup Lovr, told CoinDesk that escorting platforms which don't require medical checkups and sufficient client screening are ""highly illegal"" in jurisdictions where escorting itself is legal, such as Germany, where his firm is based.  Revenue models  Another concern expressed by sex workers is that PinkDate would take a large cut of escorts' earnings on the platform while offering them little in return in the way of support services.  PinkDate will process bitcoin and monero payments from clients, then charge individual escorts up to 20 percent.  By contrast, Lovr doesn't charge escorts for sessions booked through its platform, which also processes cryptocurrency payments. Instead, it will earn revenue through advertising and possibly fiat exchange services through a German bank. Escorts will be able to freely cash out crypto if they choose.  ""That's just fair,"" Attig said. ""We want to make it possible to have peer-to-peer payments. If we take a lot from their [earnings], we're a middleman again.""  SpankChain charges erotic performers 5 percent of their earnings on its platform, a much lower rate, and it offers legal support and marketing campaigns.  Outside of crypto and blockchain projects, many centralized escorting platforms charge as much as 40 percent of an escort's earnings. In exchange, these companies often offer marketing opportunities like photo shoots, advertising campaigns to attract new clients, and sometimes even transportation, safe locations to work, or legal support.  PinkDate, by contrast, is currently vague on the incentives it will provide.  ""We are always open to ideas on what escorts would like as far as additional benefits or services that adds value to their business,"" Roger told CoinDesk. ""This could include photo shoots, launch parties or other events, etc; part of an initial marketing ramp-up that will be required.""  But Stevens said she isn't confident the PinkDate team will be able to deliver on any escort support services. She even went so far as to allege the application itself still doesn't work properly.  ""They just wanted to make money off the backs of escorts ... making promises they can't keep,"" Stevens said.  The ICO is set to conclude this month, but it's unclear when the platform will launch.  ""We have already received many applications to start using PinkDate from both Canada and the U.S.,"" Roger told CoinDesk.

The Thailand Bond Market Association (TBMA) said it has received the green light from Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission to develop a private blockchain that will be only accessible for parties in the bond market, such as registered issuers, investors and depository organizations.  According to a news report from Bangkok Post on Monday, the TBMA said the development process will be divided into three stages and will start next month. The orgnization further explained it will first create a blockchain-based platform for listing and sharing bond information, such as interest rates in a distributed manner.  During the second phase, the platform will add in new features to enable bond deposits, which is estimated to take nine months for completion, the report said. The TBMA indicated it will eventually develop what it calls a ""bond coin"" on top of the blockchain platform in the next 12 months to tokenize assets for speedier clearing and settlement.  Chaitat Prachuabdee, executive vice president of the TBMA, said the new infrastructure is expected to improve the transparency of corporate bond information and could potentially shorten the transaction time from the current 7–10 days to just 1–3 days.  The effort follows news that Thailand's national stock exchange has built a blockchain platform it hopes will widen access to capital funds for domestic startups and enhance the efficiency of Thailand's equity market.  Blockchain is increasingly being eyed and adopted in the securities markets as a solution for improving settlement systems.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Switzerland's primary stock exchange also released a plan for building a digital asset exchange in order to tokenize and transact traditional securities.  Meanwhile, a group of industry stakeholders including Nasdaq has developed a blockchain platform to transfer collateral to central counterparties when trading securities.  Perhaps most notably, though, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is planning to replace its CHESS clearing and settlement system with a distributed ledger-based alternative in 2020.

42381010,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93GoV,1531713617,Schnorr Is Looking Poised to Become Bitcoin's Biggest Change Since SegWit,"Schnorr is coming...  In fact, the bitcoin upgrade arguably took its most significant step yet toward implementation last week when influential developer Pieter Wuille unveiled a draft outlining its technical makeup. With the release, the idea, one that's been in the works by bitcoin developers for years, is one step closer to improving the scaling and privacy of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency.  Effectively, this sets up Schnorr as the next big change to bitcoin, meaning it will be the largest code change since Segregated Witness (SegWit), a pivotal bug fix that prompted a drawn-out battle in the bitcoin community last year before ultimately being adopted.  At a technical level, adding support for Schnorr, a digital signature scheme, would give bitcoin users a new way to generate the cryptographic keys they need to used to store and send bitcoin. By doing so, it also paves the way for a number of exciting benefits, including tackling privacy and scalability, arguably two of bitcoin's most worrisome problems.  ""It is a building block for a variety of improvements,"" Wuille told CoinDesk, adding there are even some further-out improvements that haven't gotten a lot of attention quite yet. And while Wuille hopes the change will ultimately be adopted, he added it's ""ultimately up to the users"" if they want to adopt it - as was the case with SegWit.  Co-authored by several top bitcoin developers, including the likes of Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau and Gregory Maxwell, the technical, math-ridden proposal outlines the exact signature scheme that could be coded in bitcoin.  And while it's far from that final goal, it's a necessary piece.  Blockstream engineer and co-author Jonas Nick told CoinDesk:  ""Standardizing Schnorr for bitcoin is a big step towards using it in bitcoin.""  A way forward  For one, the BIP draft helps to avoid future confusion by proposing a standard that ensures that all developers and merchants eventually implement the Schnorr signature code in the same way.  Though the full description can be read in the highly-technical BIP, the main idea is it describes the math necessary to produce Schnorr signatures, offering an alternative to Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), the sole algorithm used to produce keys and verify transactions in bitcoin today.  Schnorr will have one thing in common with the signature scheme it seeks to crowd out, though. If plan is accepted, it will use the same mathematical ""curve"" that ECDSA uses to produce the keys, called ""secp256k1.""  It's a lot of tricky math, so it's no surprise the release sparked technical discussion on the bitcoin developer mailing list.  But nothing major has come up so far and developers are optimistic, especially since one of Schnorr's key benefits is that, unlike ECDSA, Schnorr's security can actually be proved mathematically.  While Schnorr offers a number of improvements on its own, developers are also excited that it will also pave the way for a range of changes that can be built on top of it, such new privacy techniques.  Right now, it's obvious when users send so-called ""multi-sig transactions,"" which are a more advanced type of transaction where more than one person is required to sign off on a transaction, because of bitcoin's public ledger. But Schnorr pave the way for a technique that will make these transactions look the same as every other transaction.  Nick noted Schnorr will also lead these advanced transactions will be cheaper as well, an important improvement since transactions can grow very expensive in times of congestion.  And it seems like new tech built on top of Schnorr are being proposed on a regular basis.  ""Due to the wealth of new discoveries lately I believe these technologies should be developed in a step-by-step basis, and my focus for a first step is just Schnorr and Taproot,"" Wuille said, referring to the bitcoin improvement ""Taproot"" proposed earlier this year by another influential bitcoin developer Greg Maxwell to further improve bitcoin's privacy.  Less detractors?  That said, there's still a ways to go - Schnorr's a massive project with many moving pieces.  While this BIP proposes a standard for developers to chime in on, Nick noted there's also a code implementation that's been in the works for ages, putting much of what's in the BIP draft into practice.  Plus, once developers fight it out until they decide there are no longer any outstanding problems, developers need to come up with a way to actually add it to bitcoin, among other things.  ""The specifics for how to deploy it in bitcoin are still being actively discussed,"" Nick said.  Having been through a few so-called ""consensus"" changes in his years as a bitcoin developer, Wuille gave a particularly long list of things to do.  ""Like any consensus change, it will be a long process involving fully fleshing out a draft for integration, publishing it, gathering comments from the technical community and ecosystem, writing implementations of both consensus rules and integration in wallet software, proposing a deployment plan, and if all goes well, get it activated,"" he said.  In the email where he introduced the BIP, he added that if the BIP is ""accepted"" by the broader bitcoin community ""we'll work on more production-ready reference implementations and tests.""  Not to mention, there's another potential stumbling block on everyone's minds.  Schnorr is a particularly big upgrade. Although changes are being made to bitcoin's most-used client every day, with code contributions coming from a diverse group of contributors stationed around the world, Schnorr is a rarer type of change, since it affects the most important rules in bitcoin.  SegWit was the last code change ""consensus"" change made to bitcoin, sparking a debate so big, those who disagreed with the change split off and created their own cryptocurrency with SegWit removed.  The most enthusiastic SegWit supporters even made hats to express their support for the code change. Blockchain consultant Francis Pouliot joked that similar advocacy hats should be made in advance of Schnorr, in case a similar vicious debate breaks out.  He's not the only developer mulling this possibility.  ""It looks for now there are less detractors than there was for SegWit,"" developer Riccardo Casatta said, though adding he's not taking any chances:  ""You cannot say how things​ will go and as always, it is better to be patient.""

In a patent application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office last week, American Express Travel Related Services describes using a ""blockchain-based system"" in order to receive ""payment confirmation including a transaction amount and a merchant identifier.""  The concept is aimed at adding to what AmEx calls the ""limited"" number of options for generating quality evidence that payments happen between merchants and their customers ""beyond a receipt or ticket.  AmEx's patent highlights the tech's role in retaining ""transaction data, contract data, proof-of-payment data, identification data, and/or other information as desired,"" with the idea being that a blockchain network – possibly a public one – would serve as an extra layer of proof for transactions that take place on AmEx's network.  As a result, the potential applications of such a system are quite varied, the company contends.  American Express says that data can be used to ""unlock a hotel, rental or shared economy property door using the card (e.g., that was used for the payment) to look up proof of payment on a blockchain."" Moreover, ""the system may be leveraged to provide ticketless access to venues (e.g., movie theater, sports event, concert, etc.) to a customer,"" and so forth.  While the decision on whether this blockchain system will be hosted on a private, public or consortium network is up for grabs, the application does highlight how ""public networks may leverage the cumulative computing power of the network to improve security.""  This patent application by American Express is the latest in a series that have been launched as early as October of last year when the same branch of the company filed for a different patent related to customer rewards.
