42429282,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx7Ph,1530135308,But Why? Crypto Looks for Answers As Facebook Eases Ad Ban,"It hasn't been a great year so far for Facebook, the social media giant that was once the most popular online platform among America's youth.  While roughly half of teens in the U.S. still use Facebook, according to a survey published by the Pew Research Center this year, the company hasn't been receiving much love recently in light of ongoing controversy about data collection and privacy.  Indeed, though it was the publicly stated goal of CEO Mark Zuckerberg to meet the issues surrounding user privacy and data collection head-on and make 2018 ""a serious year of self-improvement,"" one that would restore faith in the promise that ""technology would be a decentralizing force,"" both the company and its CEO seem stuck in a persisting cloud of scandal.  Which is why when Facebook recently announced a change in their advertising policy that would effectively lift a ban imposed back in January over cryptocurrency-related products and services, some social media observers were quick to interpret this change of heart as a financially motivated act.  However, in the eyes of one Reddit user who works in online advertising, Facebook's decision is nothing out of the ordinary.  In fact, it is ""totally normal behavior from any major ad platform. Something new comes up, it all gets shut down, and after some more exploration: ad platform allows people back in,"" they wrote.  And looking back on the original announcement published on January 30 by Rob Leathern, Facebook's product management director, Facebook isn't exactly doing a 180-degree turn by updating their policies.  The big picture  The point of the ban at its outset in January was to prohibit ads that ""promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency.""  Binary options, often called all-or-nothing options, as well as initial coin offerings (ICOs), are still forbidden from being advertised on the company's platform.  Moreover, for the part of the ban that has been lifted, namely on cryptocurrency products and services, a separate application process will screen interested parties and assess eligibility for advertising on Facebook based on ""licenses they have obtained, whether they are traded on a public stock exchange, and other relevant public background on their business.""  Leathern emphasized in the post announcing the partial lifting of the crypto ban that, given the application process, ""not everyone who wants to advertise will be able to do so.""  Facebook's cautious approach is one that has been echoed by other major sites, such as Twitter and Google, among others, who continue to prohibit the advertisements of cryptocurrency-related products and services.  Yet, even the partial change of heart by Facebook on this matter has been taken by certain crypto enthusiasts as a sure sign of the growing popularity of the industry that will soon win over other major players.  Rumour has it  As might be expected, Tuesday's announcement got the speculation wheel spinning as well.  Specifically, Facebook's ad policy change was seen as a signal regarding its own plans around blockchain, sparking renewed conversation about a suspected in-house cryptocurrency or token.  The rumor first began shortly after David Marcus, the company's vice president for its Messenger app division and former president of PayPal, said in a Facebook post he would be ""setting up a small group to explore how to best leverage blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.""  Three days later on May 11, Cheddar published an article titled ""Facebook Plans to Create Its Own Cryptocurrency"" claiming that the company would explore ""the creation of its own cryptocurrency"" as confirmed by people ""familiar"" with the company's plans.  In addition, other rumors circulating the web have posited that Facebook has plans to buy Coinbase, the largest U.S. based cryptocurrency change by trade volume, in which Marcus sits as a member in their board of directors.  Nevertheless, these rumors remain – just that – rumors.  And ever since the creation of Facebook's blockchain research team in May, there has yet to be any official statements outlining what, exactly, they are working on.

42429271,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx75h,1530120643,Block.One CTO: Arbitrator Controversy Damaged EOS Community,"The CTO of the company that developed the protocol behind the EOS network has called for a much-reduced role for the controversial dispute arbitrator that has monopolized the attention of the EOS community in recent days and drawn significant outside criticism.  ""My official opinion on disputes regarding stolen keys is that no action should be taken,"" Dan Larimer wrote in an EOS Telegram channel Tuesday in reference to the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF). ""The producers should campaign on using some of their pay for donations to make the victim whole.""  Larimer was referring to a recent order issued by the arbitrator, which required the EOS network's block producers – the 21 validators who maintain the blockchain in a way analogous to bitcoin's miners – to freeze 27 accounts that had been compromised by hackers or scammers.  ECAF's action attracted significant criticism: on the one hand, from observers who felt the order violated the principle that cryptocurrency payments should not be subject to censorship; on the other, from EOS network participants who felt that ECAF's processes were haphazard and unprofessional.  When a fake order claiming to be issued by ECAF circulated over the weekend, a top block producer refused to acknowledge such orders until the process had been reformed.  ""Bottom line,"" Larimer wrote Tuesday, ""damage to community from ECAF is greater than funds we hope to restore to users.""  It's not clear whether he was calling for ECAF to be eliminated entirely or for its role to be limited. He cautioned against allowing ECAF to become ""a regulatory body of undefined and unpredictable power.""  On the other hand, he indicated that he still sees some place for arbitration on the EOS network.  ""Arbitration should be limited to correction of intent of code,"" he wrote, adding: ""Freezing should be limited to code not function at intent.""  He said he would publish a blog post detailing his thoughts on Wednesday. (Update: shortly after this article was published, Larimer posted a blog entitled ""The 'Intent of Code' is Law."")  Governance pains  Larimer's comments echoed a persistent thread of criticism in EOS social media forums: that governance – a central part of the network's ethos and reason for existing – should all happen on the blockchain, rather than through ad hoc methods like screen grabs of PDFs shared on Telegram (such haphazard communication made it difficult to immediately discredit the fake ECAF order issued over the weekend).  ""All governance by smart contract,"" Larimer wrote. He continued (asterisks in the original):  ""*if it can be solved by tech, then it should be solved by tech*""  For the most part, Larimer's comments were well-received. Many participants in the chat complained about ECAF: its sloppy methods, its outsized power and the way it distracts from what they see as EOS' world-changing potential.  Some users pushed back on Larimer's proposals, however. ""The ability to recover stolen funds and not have to worry about hackers was a big selling point"" of EOS, one wrote. ""It's not possible without ECAF.""  Sam Sapoznick, the arbitrator who signed the (authentic) order freezing 27 addresses that had been compromised by bad actors, made a different argument: that Larimer's involvement in such discussions was inappropriate, whatever he was proposing.  ""You may be making overtures in a direction which could sabotage the entire project by undermining or completely dissolving the so-far reasonably-well-respected thesis that the main-net is independent of B1's [Block.one's] control and influence,"" he wrote.  That independence has been a defining feature of EOS. Block.one designed the network, but did not launch it, turning the code over to the community instead. That decision meant the launch process, completed just a couple of weeks ago, was chaotic at times.

According to Kik, a limited number of users will be able to earn kin tokens in the Kin Marketplace Beta by taking quizzes, working on tutorials and answering polls, according to a press release. These tokens can, in turn, be used to purchase premium themes for the Kik app.  Kik is also rolling out free customization tools, including themes, for the app in response to user feedback, the company announced.  Product manager Laura Newton wrote in a release that Kik ""wanted to build Kin into [the] products that people already use on a daily basis."" As such, custom options for its app felt like ""the perfect option"" given the demand.  She went on to say:  ""Real consumer use of cryptocurrency doesn't exist today, because the technology has yet to be adapted in daily life. We've built Kin into products that Kik users already use and have layered this experience in a simple and seamless way. Kin will continue to be a pillar of Kik's product strategy, and we will deepen the functionality of Kin in Kik, providing other partners with a clear example of how to launch their own Kin economy in their apps.""  The marketplace will feature the first transaction run on kin's blockchain, she said. Users included in the test can access the marketplace through the app.  Kin notably operates on its own blockchain, which it forked off the stellar mainnet earlier this year. The Kin Foundation announced it would be able to offer zero-fee transactions by using its own unique network, the company told CoinDesk.

42429285,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx7Lh,1530112554,Risk Flight? Bitcoin Dominance Hits 9-Week High,"Bitcoin's share of the cryptocurrency market hit a 2.5-month high today – a sign that investors are likely switching their money from alternatives into the industry's most widely traded asset.  As tracked by CoinMarketCap, the gauge rose to 42.74 percent earlier on Wednesday, the highest level since April 14, and was last seen a tad lower at 42.5 percent.  The Dominance Index is an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the leading cryptocurrency. So, a rising dominance rate essentially means the demand for bitcoin is greater than the demand for other innovations.  A flow toward bitcoin is usually seen at the start of the bull run, as it's a common route for fiat money to enter the cryptocurrency market.  For instance, BTC's dominance rate rose from 38 percent to 66.5 percent in the six months to December 2017 – a time in which the cryptocurrency rallied from $1,760 to $20,000. However, it also tends to rise during periods of risk aversion – when investors move out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and then possibly on to fiat currency.  And it's the latter scenario that we likely are witnessing currently. In the last seven weeks, BTC has crashed from $9,990 to $5,755 and still, the BTC dominance rate has gone from 35.78 percent to 42.75 percent.  So, the writing on the wall is clear: right now, a lot of investors prefer cash over any of the cryptocurrencies, bitcoin included.  If prices start to rally along with the BTC dominance rate, however, it could mean the crypto markets have bottomed out, finally finding a floor after months of decline.

Speaking at Zcon0, zcash's first ever conference in Montreal, Tuesday, project founder and the CEO of the Zcash Company Zooko Wilcox discussed the company's informal roadmap for the next two-year period.  Presented mere hours after the first mandatory upgrade of the software powering the cryptocurrency, the keynote set a precedent for the day's discussion, in which, through a series of lectures and workshops, the community sought to define the values and challenges that would guide the privacy-focussed blockchain into the future.  ""We have already succeeded on a technical level, but we have not succeeded on a usability and adoption level, so that's the priority you'll see,"" Wilcox said.  Dealing with topics such as increased privacy, security, usability and decentralization, the roadmap was published on the company's official blog Tuesday. However, speaking at the conference, Wilcox emphasized that the plan is not yet final, but is due to be published as a more formal commitment in August.  ""This roadmap that we published for the company is an invitation to conversation,"" Wilcox said, ""If you believe that the company should prioritize something else instead, or if you feel you can contribute in a specific way, this is the time to begin that conversation.""  With presentations from cryptography researcher Mary Maller on traceability concerns in zcash, and discussion of zcash's usability challenges by UX researcher Linda Naeun Lee, several topics of the day touched on a critical note.  But as research builds toward scalability and transitioning the blockchain into privacy by default, zcash is reaching the stage where it can fully confront these issues.  ""I think so far we focused a lot on base-level safety, but if it's not usable and low adoption that has limited impact, and we are starting to turn our attention to usability and adoption,"" Nathan Wilcox, CTO of the Zcash Company, said.  Speaking to the audience, Wilcox concluded:  ""We want to have a clear feedback loop between innovation and protocol design so that the two evolve together.""  Privacy and usability  Toward that end, several presentations broke down what Sapling, the network's upcoming hard fork, will do for the network.  Currently planned for October this year, the protocol upgrade is said to substantially improve the scalability of private transactions on the blockchain, to the point where the anonymous transactions that comprise the protocol will be ubiquitous.  ""Sapling is effectively the same construction [as before] but much more efficient, bring proving times down to a second or two,"" Matthew Green, a founding scientist at zcash, said.  In an in-depth presentation on the upgrade, zcash engineer Sean Bowe outlined these performance enhancements. Following the upgrade, shielded transactions are small enough that they can be performed on a mobile phone, Bowe said, and there's ways to make them function on hardware wallets as well.  It's notable because at the time of writing, zcash is lacking in wallet software, consisting only of Linux or Windows tooling that is capable of sending shielded transactions.  ""It requires a very highly motivated person with specific needs to be motivated to use zcash,"" UX researcher Linda Naeun Lee told the audience, ""I have a MA in computer security from Berkley and I was still confused.""  Lee also warned that users need to be better informed about the difference between the transparent and shielded transactions on zcash. ""Hey you know what thing that zcash does that do other coin does?"" she quipped, ""You think you're using it, but you're not.""  And it's notable considering, as detailed by Maller, transparent transactions on the zcash blockchain can damage the privacy of shielded addresses as well.  As such, much of the discussion circulated on the necessity, and challenges, involved in removing the possibility of transparent transactions from the network, or ""privacy by default"".  While there's challenges to transitioning to a fully private system, and plenty of tooling that needs to be constructed as well, now that zcash has built the basis of the protocol developers have time to research these kinds of more substantial changes.  ""I love fancy crypto, I also just want to take out my phone and make anonymous transactions,"" Matthew Green summarized.  As the day broke up into workshop sessions, a group of stakeholders from the mining landscape sat together to discuss the cryptocurrency's attitude to ASICs, a type of highly efficient mining hardware that has been the cause of tension in the community.  Featuring GPU miners, ASIC miners, representatives from ASIC manufacturers Bitmain, Innosilicon and Obelisk, as well as the Zcash Company and the Zcash Foundation, the workshop resolved to commit to a timeline for the issue.  ""If you chose not to decide you still have made a choice. You can make this change, or you can publically state we have chosen not to make a change,"" a workshop participant said.  For example, if the Zcash Company takes action to remove ASICs from the network, this would need to be decided quickly, participants collectively stated.  Depending on the complexity of the change, the soonest action that can be taking is ""roughly April next year,"" Wilcox said in the workshop.  Such a change would be a simple tweak to the proof-of-work algorithm in order to drive ASICs off the network. However, participants warned that by that point, ASICs are likely to comprise the majority, and zcash could risk damaging its security by changing the algorithm.  Wilcox also proposed longer term research into a hybrid proof-of-work algorithm, where the issuance would be split between both factions, GPU and ASIC miners, respectfully.  ""The general idea is to appeal to both camps,"" Wilcox said.  However, participants warned that such an endeavour could complexify the protocol and come with unknown security risks. Plus, as it is a substantial developer undertaking, it would extract from other priorities of the Zcash Company.  Other solutions, such as a longer term ASIC-resistant algorithm, trusted partnership with hardware manufacturers, and a push toward open-source hardware design, were discussed.  ""We haven't figured it out yet,"" Wilcox said in the workshop.  However, members of the Zcash Company said that a decision needs to be reached prior to the Sapling upgrade in October, in order to allow developers ample time to prepare for changes, if any are required.  ""Ideally, we need to reach a consensus before Sapling. We need an 8-month lead up,"" zcash developer Daira Hopwood said.  And other, more experimental discussion that was held throughout the day as well.  For example, speaking in a lecture, Matthew Green spoke about implementing novel scaling solutions, such as payment channels, and even transitioning to different zero-knowledge proof systems in the future.  Proof-of-stake, a more ecological form of consensus, was also discussed, as many participants in the mining workshop agreeing that proof-of-work is not sustainable long term.  Plus, there's other ways in which zcash can self-articulate.  ""Why are we using just cash? We could build smart contract systems, all kind of things that are well beyond what we're doing today,"" Green said.  Still, as well as the various technical challenges: easy-to-use wallets often come with privacy trade-offs, and there's plenty of tooling that needs to be created before zcash can transition into a fully private system, shadowing the presentations was the challenges such changes pose for governance.  Led by the Zcash Foundation, an independent entity that offloads some of the decision-making power from the Zcash Company, zcon0 is the first steps toward a more decentralized governance structure. Day three of the conference, for example, is entirely devoting to community and governance questions.  And it's notable considering the degree of change which zcash will endure in the years to come.  For example, Wilcox noted in his keynote, the ""founders fee,"" from which, he told the audience, he receives 0.9% of monthly ZEC issuances, is set to run dry in two years.  After this, the total of 20% allocated to zcash development will cease, and the community will need to coordinate on how to fund development going forward.  ""Sustainability is a critical question that the community has to decide for itself,"" Wilcox said, ""The question is, how should the development of zcash be funded after the funding ends in two years?""  Wilcox also urged that while the Overwinter and Sapling upgrades were ""no brainers,"" going forward, other changes to the protocol are likely to be less well received.  Wilcox concluded:  ""If zcash is to satisfy its mission, the community will have to make many decisions that are vigorously opposed by a faction, possibly by a large faction. That's my belief. So the process of coordinating and deciding that is the most important question.""

The company has now filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for approval of the change of ownership to become a registered broker-dealer.  Ultimately, Uphold hopes to offer security tokens, fractional equities and other exchange services under the supervision of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and FINRA, as part of its new securities platform.  Uphold's general counsel, Ben Sherwin, explained the move to CoinDesk, saying: ""We've acquired a New York-based broker-dealer to expand our product base and offer more digital assets to our users.""  If approved, the acquisition would allow Uphold to begin offering regulated products to its customers.  Sherwin said:  ""You file with FINRA to become a broker-dealer and that broker-dealer status allows us to engage in activities that we wouldn't be able to without that license. It also aligns with our mission of transparency and trust because we're submitting to the regulation that is appropriate and responsive to what the regulators are saying.""  Uphold later plans to file to become an alternative trading system (ATS) with the SEC, he added.  While JNK and Uphold will operate as two distinct companies until the merger is complete, Uphold intends to bring JNK's employees in to help with Uphold's expansion plans.  ""JNK is an ... organization with a 25-year history of being in the financial markets. They're quality people and good operators ... running a broker-dealer requires a certain amount of expertise and the quality of the people there gives us a leg up,"" Sherwin said.  The flow of expertise will go the other way too, as Uphold intends to help JNK start offering cryptocurrency research products, on top of the reports it already offers looking at a variety of industries.  ""From a process standpoint, they have license and we're hoping to expand their license,"" Sherwin said. ""So we benefit from their institutional reach and they benefit from our consumer reach.""

42429243,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwzhh,1530097244,Korean Watchdog Tightens Rules on Crypto Exchange Bank Accounts,"South Korea's financial regulator has amended the anti-money laundering rules that apply to cryptocurrency exchanges in the country, requiring domestic banks to tighten up monitoring of related bank accounts.  According to an announcement from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) on Wednesday, the amendment – which will initially be in effect for a year – means domestic banks who provide services to crypto exchanges must now monitor all the accounts held by an exchange.  Typically an exchange has several accounts with a bank – such as, for example, a depositing account that holds traders' funds on the platform, as well as an operating account that stores the exchange's own assets.  However, the FSC explained that its recent inspections at three institutions – Nonghyup Bank, KB Kookmin Bank and KEB Hana Bank – found that some exchanges had moved assets from investors' depositing account to their own operating accounts.  In doing so, the exchanges, according to a report from CoinDesk Korea, had directly violated guidelines requiring exchanges to keep investors' assets separate from their own.  Since banks currently only monitor investors' depositing accounts at crypto exchanges, the FSC fears the absence of wider account scrutiny may increase the possibility of exchanges laundering money or evading taxes by using their operating accounts to buy cryptocurrencies from foreign exchanges.  As a result, the amendment will require banks to keeep an eye out for transactions in which exchanges move assets to or from foreign exchanges. In cases where suspicious transactions come to light, the information must be shared with the FSC.  The new rules marks the FSC's latest tightening of anti-money laundering controls at crypto exchanges. Back in January, the watchdog issued an order that all trading platforms must implement real-name verification, outlawing anonymous trading in the country.

42429256,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx03h,1530093653,"Bitcoin Price Risks Another Fall Below $6K, Charts Say","After a drop yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) risks another move below $6,000 in the next 24 hours, but it will still likely fare better than other cryptocurrencies.  On Tuesday, bitcoin closed (as per UTC) below the immediate support of $6,108 (June 13 low), pouring cold water over the prospects of a corrective rally above a major technical hurdle at $6,425 (April 1 low).  The failure to capitalize on early signs of short-term bullish reversal has shifted risk in favor of a break below the $6,000 mark (February low).  Even if a drop in prices is seen, bitcoin could still outperform other cryptocurrencies, as a break below $6,000 could trigger risk aversion in the markets, forcing investors to venture out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin.  At press time, BTC is trading at $6,100 on Bitfinex – down 2.25 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  BTC was expected to scale April 1 low of 6,425 this week, courtesy of the bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) and bullish price-money flow index (MFI) divergence and the long-legged doji. Instead, it created another lower high (bearish pattern) on the chart as it fell from $6,341 (June 25 high) to $6,020 (today's low).  Further, BTC closed (as per UTC) below the immediate support of $6,108 (June 13 low) yesterday, putting the focus back on the broader bearish outlook, as indicated by the falling channel and downward sloping Bollinger Bands (+2,-2 standard deviation on the 20-day moving average).  So, BTC could drop below $6,000 in the next 24 hours. On the downside, immediate support is lined up at $5,755 (Sunday's doji candle low) and $5,717 (lower Bollinger Band).  Should prices take a positive turn, immediate resistance is located at $6,341 (June 25 high) and $6,560 (20-day MA).  Risk aversion  Clearly, BTC chart is biased to the bears, however, other cryptocurrencies will likely post bigger losses, as indicated by a bearish breakdown in ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) exchange rate.  The fiat money tends to flow into cryptocurrency markets via major assets like BTC and is then rotated into alternative cryptocurrencies once the bitcoin valuations look overstretched. Further, the rotation of money from bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies is usually a sign the investors are eager to take more risk (a ""risk-on"" market).  On the contrary, rotation of money out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into major assets like BTC happens when investors turn risk-averse (""risk-off"" market).  As most alternative cryptocurrencies are built on the ethereum blockchain, the ETH/BTC serves as a good indicator of risk-on/risk-off sentiment, i.e. rising ETH/BTC means risk-on and falling ETH/BTC means risk-off.  Accordingly, the bearish breakdown seen in the chart below indicates that risk aversion will likely increase in the short-run and the alternative cryptocurrencies will post bigger drops than bitcoin.  ETH/BTC daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bittrex) shows a bearish Bollinger Band breakdown and a downside break of the trading range.  So, ETH/BTC could be heading lower towards 0.0655BTC (Aug. 15, 2017 low).  View  BTC could drop below $6,000 (February low) and could test immediate support of $5,755 and $5,711.  A daily close below $5,755 (Sunday's Doji candle low) would open the doors to $5,090 (rising wedge breakdown target).

42429244,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwzjh,1530091811,Huobi Pro Exchange to Suspend Crypto Trading in Japan,"Cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Pro is to cease offering trading services to investors living in Japan starting from next month.  According to a news report from Coinpost, the exchange announced the news in an email sent to investors in Japan on Wednesday, stating it will remove the Japanese option from its homepage and suspends trading services from July 2.  In a response to a CoinDesk enquiry, Huobi Pro – currently the third largest exchange in the world by 24-hour trading volume – confirmed the news, but has yet to provide further details such as the plan for users' asset withdrawals.  As suggested in the Coinpost report, Huobi Pro made the decision to withdraw Japan-based services because is not registered with the Financial Services Agency (FSA), Japan's financial watchdog, as mandated under a money transaction law introduced in 2016. It is not currently clear if the exchange has been contacted by the FSA over the issue.  Earlier this year, Huobi Pro indicated it was partnering SBI Virtual Currency – the licensed exchange backed by Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings – to launch a regulated platform in Japan. However, the plan was notably scrapped by SBI Virtual Currency back in March.  According to web traffic tracking site Alexa, currently 13.3 percent of the visitors on Huobi Pro come from Japan. The company would not indicate to CoinDesk when asked if it is considering filing a registration application with the FSA as a next step.  In March, Binance, currently the second largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, notably received a warning from the FSA stating that, as a foreign entity, it was offering trading services to Japanese residents without a license. Binance confirmed at the time that its legal team was in dialogue with the agency.

42429237,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwzXh,1530090014,The EOS Arbitrator Problem: A Crypto Governance Breakdown Explained,"""They have to figure their own shit out.""  Those were the harsh words of one of EOS' top ""block producers"" – the network participants in charge of maintaining the blockchain – on Monday as the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency attracted public ridicule for its current state of confusion.  As told to CoinDesk by Kevin Rose, co-founder and head of strategy at EOS New York, the statement could reflect the broader snags the software has faced since release, but this comment was focused specifically on the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF).  So far, it seems many both inside and outside the EOS community aren't clear what ECAF, the main body tasked with resolving disputes between token holders on the network, is and what control it has over transactions.  That's largely because ECAF's role and duties were discussed back and forth over months of forum discussions, but clear methods and processes don't seem to have been decided on. It's become apparent over the past few days that this mess of information now needs to be organized and clearly communicated to the community.  Stepping back, all this turbulence began on June 17, just three days after the network's launch, when the network's top block producers unanimously intervened to stop seven addresses from making transactions. That decision was retroactively endorsed by an ECAF order (the arbitrator had initially refused to rule on the issue).  Then on June 22, an order made the rounds that ECAF wanted to freeze 27 more accounts, to which ""the logic and reasoning ... will be posted at a later date."" On June 24, another order was seemingly issued, demanding that tokens be revoked from some addresses.  That order, however, turned out to be a fake.  With all the mayhem, EOS New York made a big decision. Until it can be reasonably certain about their authenticity, the block producer wrote on Sunday, it will ignore ECAF decisions – or decisions that appear to be ECAF decisions.  ""We cannot with confidence execute any statement claiming to be an ECAF opinion,"" the organization said, adding:  ""We will resume normal processing once communications can be established on-chain such that they can be audited by both EOS New York and the community.""  Adding to that, Rose pointed to what he called a ""rampant misunderstanding about what arbitration is"" on the EOS network. According to him, ECAF needs improved processes, more transparency and ultimately, competition.  Roshan Abraham of EOS Authority, another top block producer, agreed that ECAF's processes are flawed. Meanwhile, EOS Telegram chats are abuzz with complaints, speculation and unanswered questions about the arbitrator.  The judge and the bailiff  Still, these folks are supposed to be held to predictable and rational governance rules, those within the EOS ""constitution,"" although that ruleset is still at an early stage.  And that seems to be somewhat at the heart of the issues.  After the fake order to revoke tokens from some addresses, Rose told CoinDesk, ""I woke up to a scanned PDF on Twitter claiming to move property and I spent the next 45 minutes trying to figure out if it was real.""  He continued:  ""I don't have time to do that, that's not secure, that's not how professionals work.""  Rather than having to ""spend its time analyzing the merits and evidence of a case,"" Rose said, a block producer should be able to leave the arbitration to ""somebody who is trained to do that"" – an arbitrator who can ""just tell us what to do."" In other words, he said, block producers should be like courtroom bailiffs.  ""He's not going to do anything unless the judge is asking him to take someone away … it doesn't make him stupid, that's his job,"" he said.  So far, though, such credulousness on the part of block producers has been impossible, given the quality of ECAF's efforts. Its decisions are not stored in any one repository but passed around social media as screenshots of PDFs signed by hand.  ECAF has a website, but ""you'd think it was some shady shell company,"" said Rose.  And that could lead to misinformation – if not outright scams, like the fake order displays – which thrives in such a crypto environment.  The situation is especially embarrassing for EOS, though, which has attempted to reject most cryptocurrencies' state of borderline anarchy: EOS has erected quasi-official institutions, governed by quasi-legal structures, laid out in a written constitution.  Not about centralization  It's important to note, though, that Rose himself, EOS New York and other block producers are not upset about alleged centralization, which is what caused an uproar among the broader cryptocurrency community.  All of these events – and in particular ECAF's promise to explain ""at a later date"" – led critics, mostly from outside EOS, to call block producers a ""junta"" and a ""cartel,"" ""bankers"" and ""centralized."" ECAF, with its use of flowery legalese, was compared to ""kids"" playing pretend, while the EOS network as a whole was accused of conducting ""consensus by conference call.""  But the idea that uncensorable transactions are the ultimate goal of cryptocurrencies – settled doctrine in many circles – is met with skepticism or outright rejection in debates among EOS block producers. Instead, EOS supporters want a blockchain that's fast and cheap, but also has the governance structure in place to make decisions that are in the best interest of the user.  That's why EOS was built on delegated proof-of-stake (dPOS), which allows for a certain number of organizations to validate the blockchain, instead of incorporating a proof-of-work mining system (like bitcoin has, for instance).  Whereas anyone (with the correct hardware) can be a miner on proof-of-work blockchains, EOS' 21 block producers are being constantly voted into and out of those roles by users of the network staking tokens – a vote is held every two minutes.  At the time of writing, there were 370 block producer candidates vying for the 21 slots.  Rather than centralization, EOS New York – consistently one of these top 21 block producers – said it has chosen to disregard ECAF decisions because the way they are issued is ""haphazard, opaque, and without a process.""  ""The world is watching,"" Rose told CoinDesk.  As for ECAF's belated explanation for why it ordered 27 accounts to be frozen, Rose found it satisfactory. These were, he said, verifiable owners freezing their own accounts because they feared ""imminent property theft"" due to phishing, hacking and scams.  Improving the process  Still, it appears the conversation around how to clean up the messy arbitration process is now moving in a productive direction.  Sam Sapoznick, who signed the ECAF order sent out on June 22, said he does not speak officially for ECAF, but wrote on Telegram that the arbitrator ""is working on a sensible draft proposal to address the outstanding issues.""  And in a post on June 24, EOS New York outlined specific proposals for on-chain communication by arbitrators, governed by smart contracts.  Plus, EOS Argentina (ranked 22nd at the time of writing) recently rolled out an EOS-based application for signing and time-stamping documents on the blockchain, pointedly inviting ECAF to use it. Other block producers are deciding that from now on ECAF requests must be published through a ""trusted source"" and not just on social media.  EOS Authority's position, for instance, Abraham told CoinDesk, is that all orders ""must be published through a trusted source such as the EOS blockchain or electronically signed by ECAF."" Plus, he added, ""All evidence and reasoning should also be published with all cases.""  But until any particular technical fix is adopted, Rose expressed worry that the community would continue to flail until it corrected ""rampant confusion"" about the roles of various stakeholders and the role of arbitration more generally.  First of all, he said, ""ECAF isn't making these decisions; the arbitrator with his or her name on the paper is making the decisions."" For the time being, he, added, these arbitrators are simply volunteers.  And even though ECAF does not (or should not) have any power outside of its role as a forum for qualified arbitrators, Rose said, it should also face competition in a system of ""free-market justice.""  He explained, ""If you are an arbitrator and you'd like to arbitrate disputes on chain for EOS, you can do that. You as a private person – two people just need to consent to you as the arbitrator.""  It's difficult to say whether this system is a description of arbitration in EOS as it is today, or rather as Rose would like it to be. For now, it seems, the entire process is up in the air.  The most up-to-date documentation on the rules governing EOS arbitration is buried in a forum. And even that, for now, is just a proposal, whereby it's unclear what rules are actually in effect.  For these rules, or anything having to with EOS' constitution, to be finalized, there needs to be a system for conducting token holder referendums, and that process is also still in progress.  The governance-focused EOS network was born without a governance process, and as Rose put it:  ""That's like your arms not being there when you're born.""

According to an announcement published by the Department of Justice for the District of Maryland on Tuesday, the prosecutors indicted two men, Ryan Farace and Robert Swain, both residents of the state who allegedly manufactured drugs and distributed them through darkweb marketplaces.  The accused were further alleged to have collected proceeds from drug sales in bitcoin between November 2013 and June 2017, which were seized by law enforcements.

Dance parties, rap shows, puppy parades – you name it, Dogecon had it.  And, perhaps more importantly, what this untraditional gathering of the crypto community didn't have was pretty striking considering the circumstances: a panic over falling crypto prices.  Indeed, as Matt Condon put it on Twitter, ""radical positivity"" was the name of the day at Dogecon.  The four-day celebratory conferencehttp://dogecon.fun/ about ""the social layer of crypto culture"" took place in Vancouver, British Columbia. Built around the cryptocurrency with a Shiba Inu at its heart, the conference received overwhelmingly positive reviews both from attendees and those who watched from the virtual sidelines.  Even the sponsorshttp://dogecon.fun/mainpages/sponsors of the event were largely unabashed on social media:  With over 200 participants having attended Dogecon Vancouver, its success – amplified by crypto Twitter – arguably brought a breath of fresh air to a community that, in recent weeks, has been bogged down with concerning news of hacks, bearish market trends and cryptocurrency forks.  As one enthusiast asked (perhaps rhetorically):  The coin behind Dogecon  The event may perhaps be proof of at least one thing: the near-zealous commitment the project still attracts, with recent charts showing that dogecoin transactions frequently outnumber those of bitcoin cash, the fourth most popular cryptocurrency in the world (by comparison, dogecoin is 40th by market capitalization, according to CoinMarket Cap).  So why the attraction? Dogecoin was always more about its community than challenging its crypto-cousin bitcoin, save for its vastly expanded token supply, faster block-times and viral memes. And the cryptocurrency inarguably suffered a blow in the wake of well-publicized scams like Moolah and the pump-and-dump schemes of Wolong.  Indeed, when the dogecoin first launched, it almost immediately attracted a following friendlier to newcomers in the crypto space than the ""overly serious"" bitcoin community.  Perhaps that's SmileyGnome's (likely rhetorical) point – that events like Dogecon seek to offer an alternative to the toxicity on display in the crypto-community on an all-too-often basis.  Or, at the very least, it's an opportunity to praise Lord Doge.

42429246,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwzlh,1530064819,Japan's Finance Minister Balks at Changing Crypto Tax Rules,"Japan's top financial official is cautious about the idea of his nation changing how it taxes gains from cryptocurrencies.  During a meeting with the budget committee of the Upper House on June 25, Senator Kenji Fukimaki asked whether Japan's tax policy on cryptocurrency profits could be changed from its current ""miscellaneous income"" classification to ""separate declared taxation,"" Reuters reported. Taro Aso, the deputy prime minister and minister of finance, said he was cautious about making such a change.  Aso explained that, in his view, it was ""doubtful"" that the general public would understand such a change. He cited the ""international nature"" of cryptocurrency as one reason why Japanese residents might dislike a change in tax classification. The finance minister also said he was unsure about the ""tax fairness"" of implementing such a change.  At present, profits earned by investors in cryptocurrency can be taxed between 15 and 55 percent, due to the miscellaneous income rules, according to Bloomberg. Stock profits, which are treated more like separate declared taxes, are taxed at roughly 20 percent in the country.  While the finance official has doubts about cryptocurrency taxation, he still expressed support for blockchain technology in general, saying they have uses apart from cryptocurrencies.
