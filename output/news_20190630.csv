42382245,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r17Z,1561896026,Bridging the Gap Between Bitcoin and Global Regulators,"Shin'ichiro Matsuo is a research professor and the director of B-TED research center at Georgetown University. He is also a co-founder of the BSafe.network, a global blockchain research test network used by 31 universities.      Since 2015, when bitcoin became an issue for regulators like the state of New York, the regulation of cryptocurrency (the G20 now calls it as a crypto asset) has been discussed in many places, mainly at bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  However, Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency has changed the landscape, ensuring a massive number of debates on regulation are likely ahead. To be sure, these debates will be about the size of companies specializing in internet technologies more than they are about technology architecture.  Yet, throughout the history of crypto asset and blockchain, regulators have been considered an enemy, even as most governments have sought new financial innovations based on the blockchain.  The main issue is, we still don't have proper communication channels among stakeholders in this ecosystem. Regulators don't have a functional language to talk with open-source engineers. Open-source engineers sometimes do not want to speak with regulators.  Business entities wish to use new and immature technologies by avoiding frictions with regulation. Citizens need transparency to business entities, but there are no standard criteria to ensure transparency of business. Generally (and I hope) regulators don't want to discourage innovation, and open-source engineers don't want to facilitate crimes. The goals of both are almost the same.  But, to make the situation more productive, we need to solve this communication problem. That is now beginning to happen.  Historical discussion at the G20  On June 8 and 9 of this year, the G20's financial ministers and central bank governors met in Fukuoka, Japan, bringing together a group of 20 governments that discuss issues related to economics.  The FSB, FATF and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) are the organizations which form regulations under G20 leadership. Before the G20 financial track, the FSB published an insightful report titled ""Decentralized financial technologies: Report on financial stability, regulatory and governance implications.""  This report emphasized the importance of multi-stakeholder discussions, and that regulations and laws are not an 100 percent perfect tool for forming a healthy ecosystem. It concluded contributions from all stakeholders, including open-source engineers, are essential.  On June 8, the G20 held ""G20 High-level Seminar on Financial Innovation Our Future in the Digital Age"" to discuss the issue of multi-stakeholder governance.  This was indeed the genesis block of discussions by different stakeholders, including Klas Knott, the vice-chair of FSB, Brad Karr, managing director of IIF (a world group of established banks), Adam Back, the famous cryptographer, Shinichiro Matsuo (myself) who represents neutral academia views, and Jun Murai (moderator), the famous “Internet Samurai” who developed the first-ever inter-university internet communications network in Japan.  Knott firstly explained the FSB report and the views of his fellow regulators, including their regulatory goals. Karr went on to discuss many potential applications of decentralized finance, including financial inclusion. Back explained how blockchain technology is an excellent tool to achieve regulatory goals.  I discussed how multi-stakeholder discussion would facilitate healthy permissionless innovations in decentralized finance. We further agreed that the multi-stakeholder discussion is essential for decentralized finance to be made real.  As a result of this seminar and G20 discussion, the following historical sentence was written in the official communique.  ""We welcome the FSB report on decentralized financial technologies, and the possible implications for financial stability, regulation and governance, and how regulators can enhance the dialogue with a wider group of stakeholders.""  What multi-stakeholder governance means  In general, governments tend to keep their right to control everything. The internet, which creates a global space of communication, was the first challenge to this order. Here, ""global"" is different from ""international,"" because it is independent from the nation.  The internet is also one of the most successful cases of multi-stakeholder governance.  Even in the case of the internet, the government tried to be the only entity of governance, but the effort failed; governments are one of the stakeholders of Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).  This structure is an excellent foundation that facilitates a huge amount of permissionless innovation, but is also compliant with regulations. A similar situation will happen in finance, and this is the reason why the FSB and G20 are working toward the communique, through the involvement of multi-stakeholders might imply reducing their power of governance.  Here, stakeholders include open-source developers, regulators, business entities, consumers and academia, who are all seeking to solve the current chaos in terms of regulation and innovation in finance. I think it is good to start with have common understandings of regulatory goals; they are financial stability, consumer protection and preventing crimes.  Multi-stakeholder discussion on these goals will create healthier governance than regulation.  Academia facilitates the dialogue  Unfortunately, communications among stakeholders are not sufficient at this moment. However, we need more calm dialogue based on shared understandings and based on academically reviewed pieces of evidence.  One piece of good news is there are several existing initiatives which facilitate discussions among stakeholders. The Scaling Bitcoin workshop was established in 2015 to create a forum for technology discussions led by academics. Likewise, regulators today discuss their work with academics and economists.  This in mind, I believe academia can serve as a good trust anchor and neutral foundation to connect all stakeholder in one place.  A group of universities (currently 31 universities from 14 countries) called BSafe.network has started a new initiative to facilitate multi-stakeholder discussions based on its global neutrality. Right after the G20 financial track meeting, BSafe.network held a multi-stakeholder workshop ""G20 meets G-20"" with the University of British Columbia. It was the first event of a preliminary series of multi-stakeholder discussions.  A similar workshop, ""Decentralized Financial Architecture Workshop,"" will be co-located with Scaling Bitcoin 2019 Tel-Aviv, and we hope to see real engagement between regulators and bitcoin engineers.  Observing the current debates on Facebook's Libra, I conclude we need more moderated and academia-backed discussions to make innovations healthier. The fact is, the Libra Association does not explain how their architecture achieves regulatory goals. Common understandings on regulatory goals and architecture among all stakeholders are essential to start a regulation discussion.  This is a good test case to apply the multi-stakeholder governance.  It may be more difficult than the case of internet governance to establish a formal body for multi-stakeholder discussion on finance. It might take more than a year. However, I believe the historical message triggered by the G20 and a series of workshops will open the door to a new era of a healthy blockchain ecosystem.

42382236,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r0yl,1561888850,Monero and Zcash Conferences Showcase Their Differences (And Links),"Last weekend, two privacy coin conferences heralded the future of cryptocurrency governance: the hybrid startup model versus grassroots experimentation.  Over 200 people gathered in Croatia for Zcon1, organized by the nonprofit Zcash Foundation, while roughly 75 attendees gathered in Denver for the first Monero Konferenco. These two privacy coins are fundamentally different in a variety of ways – which was clearly on display at their respective events.  Zcon1 had a gala dinner with a seaside backdrop and programming that displayed close relations between companies like Facebook and the zcash-centric startup Electronic Coin Company (ECC), as evidenced by Libra being widely discussed with team members in attendance.  The quintessential funding source that distinguishes zcash, called the founder's reward, became the center of passionate debates during Zcon1.  This funding source is the crux of the distinction between zcash and projects like monero or bitcoin.  Zcash was designed to automatically siphon off a portion of miners’ profits for creators, including ECC CEO Zooko Wilcox. So far, this funding has been donated to create the independent Zcash Foundation, and support ECC contributions to protocol development, marketing campaigns, exchange listings and corporate partnerships.  This automated distribution was scheduled to end in 2020, but Wilcox said last Sunday he would support a “community” decision to extend that funding source. He warned that otherwise ECC might be forced to seek revenue by focusing on other projects and services.  Zcash Foundation Director Josh Cincinnati told CoinDesk the non-profit has enough runway to continue operations for at least another three years. However, in a forum post, Cincinnati also warned the non-profit shouldn’t become a single gateway for funding distribution.  The amount of trust zcash users place in the asset’s founders and their various organizations is the primary criticism levied against zcash. Paul Shapiro, CEO of the crypto wallet startup MyMonero, told CoinDesk he’s not convinced that zcash upholds the same cypherpunk ideals as monero.  “Basically you have collective decisions instead of individual, autonomous participation,” Shapiro said. “There’s been perhaps not enough discussion about the potential conflicts of interest in the [zcash] governance model.”  While the simultaneous monero conference was much smaller and slightly more focused on code than governance, there was significant overlap. On Sunday, both conferences hosted a joint panel via webcam where speakers and moderators discussed the future of government surveillance and privacy tech.  The future of privacy coins may rely on such cross-pollination, but only if these disparate groups can learn to work together.  Shared zk-SNARKs  One of the speakers from the joint panel, Monero Research Lab contributor Sarang Noether, told CoinDesk he doesn’t see privacy coin development as a “zero-sum game.”  Indeed, the Zcash Foundation donated almost 20 percent of the funding for the Monero Konferenco. This donation, and the joint privacy-tech panel, could be seen as a harbinger of cooperation between these seemingly rival projects.  Cincinnati told CoinDesk he hopes to see much more collaborative programming, research and mutual funding in the future.  “In my view, there is a lot more about what connects these communities than what divides us,” Cincinnati said.  Both projects want to use cryptographic techniques for zero-knowledge proofs, in particular, a variant called zk-SNARKs. However, as with any open-source project, there are always trade-offs.  Monero relies on ring signatures, which mix small groups of transactions to help obfuscate individuals. This isn’t ideal because the best way to get lost in a crowd is for the crowd to be much bigger than ring signatures can offer.  Meanwhile, the zcash setup gave the founders data often called “toxic waste,” because the founding participants could theoretically exploit the software that determines what makes a zcash transaction valid. Peter Todd, an independent blockchain consultant who helped establish this system, has since been an adamant critic of this model.  In short, zcash fans prefer the hybrid startup model for these experiments and monero fans prefer a completely grassroots model as they tinker with ring signatures and research trustless zk-SNARK replacements.  “Monero researchers and the Zcash Foundation have a good working relationship. As for how the foundation began and where they’re going, I can’t really speak to that,” Noether said. “One of the written or unwritten rules of monero is you shouldn’t have to trust someone.”  Shapiro added:  “If certain people are dictating large aspects of the direction of the cryptocurrency project then it raises the question: What is the difference between that and fiat money?”  Different strokes  Stepping back, the long-standing beef between monero and zcash fans is the Biggie vs. Tupac divide of the cryptocurrency world.  For example, former ECC consultant Andrew Miller, and current president of the Zcash Foundation, co-authored a paper in 2017 about a vulnerability in monero’s anonymity system. Subsequent Twitter feuds revealed monero fans, like entrepreneur Riccardo “Fluffypony” Spagni, were upset by how the publication was handled.  Spagni, Noether and Shapiro all told CoinDesk there are ample opportunities for cooperative research. Yet so far most mutually beneficial work is conducted independently, in part because the source of funding remains a point of contention.  Wilcox told CoinDesk the zcash ecosystem will continue to move toward “more decentralization, but not too far and not too fast.” After all, this hybrid structure enabled funding for fast growth compared to other blockchains, including the incumbent monero.  “I believe something not too centralized and not too decentralized is what’s best for now,” Wilcox said. “Things like education, promoting adoption worldwide, talking with regulators, that’s the stuff that I think a certain amount of centralization and decentralization are both right.”  Some fans of both projects see the benefits of that collective approach.  Zaki Manian, head of research at the Cosmos-centric startup Tendermint, told CoinDesk this model has more in common with bitcoin than some critics care to admit.  “I am a big proponent of chain sovereignty, and a big point of chain sovereignty is that the stakeholders in the chain should be able to act collectively in their own interests,” Manian said.  For example, Manian pointed out the wealthy benefactors behind Chaincode Labs fund a significant portion of the work that goes into Bitcoin Core. He added:  “Ultimately, I would prefer if protocol evolution was mostly funded by the consent of token holders rather than by investors.”  Researchers on all sides acknowledged their favorite crypto would require significant updates in order to deserve the title “privacy coin.” Perhaps the joint conference panel, and Zcash Foundation grants for independent research, could inspire such cooperation across party lines.  “They’re all moving in the same direction,” Wilcox said about zk-SNARKs. “We’re both trying to find something that has both the larger privacy set and no toxic waste.”  Zcash image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | XMR | ZEC | RESEARCH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/30/monero-and-zcash-conferences-showcase-their-differences-and-links,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d5b38f9cf7ea8e1a59353d666184398e27cee66-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
