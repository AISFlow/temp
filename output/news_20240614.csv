29488197,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624712,1718406008,Dogecoin Sees Monumental Surge In Transactions As Whales Spend $129 Million,"Dogecoin is currently at a critical price junction that might determine its price trajectory in the short term. Although the meme coin has witnessed a significant price drop in the past seven days, recent whale activity suggests that the tide might change soon. Notably, large holders of DOGE have been taking advantage of the price drop to accumulate millions of DOGE. Per data from Santiment, an on-chain analytics platform, addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million Dogecoins have collectively accumulated more than $129 million worth of DOGE in the past seven days. Dogecoin Whales Accumulate DOGE According to the on-chain data from Santiment, whales have increased their accumulation in the past week despite the price decline for the meme coin. Remarkably, these whale addresses have bought over 900 million tokens in seven days, suggesting their faith in DOGE despite the price downturn. Related Reading: Solana On-Chain Indicators Suggests A Return Of Bullish Sentiment, Is It Time To Buy SOL? Consequently, on-chain data shows the number of coins owned by this cohort of traders has increased by approximately 5% to a collective 18 billion tokens. A look at the chart above reveals that the collective holdings of these whale wallets have generally been on an uptick since the last week of March. During periods of price increases, the accumulation has typically exhibited an upward tendency and remained stable during periods of price drops. However, the recent accumulation is different because it comes alongside a corresponding price decrease, showing a different strategy from the whale wallets. Interestingly, similar data from IntoTheBlock suggests a similar increase in activity on DOGE alongside the whale accumulation. This uptick in activity saw around 9.29 billion DOGE tokens traded in the past 24 hours. Additionally, 1,500 transactions were concluded in the past 24 hours, implying traders are actively exchanging DOGE. How Whale Transactions Impact DOGE Price Considering its meme coin status, Dogecoin is highly influenced by sentiment among traders and particularly huge investors. These big investors, known as “whales” in crypto lingo, can have a significant impact on Dogecoin’s price when they move their funds around. Their buying activity triggers bullish momentum by pumping up demand, which drives the price higher as other traders follow their lead. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 35% Jump For Bitcoin In Next Step Of ‘Magic Bands’ Interestingly, this recent whale accumulation comes as a much-needed catalyst for bullish momentum. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1428 and has been down by 11.29% in the past seven days. However, this decline seems to be slowing down, with DOGE only registering a 0.6% loss in the past 24 hours. According to a crypto analyst, this spiral towards $0.14 is forming an important generational bottom for DOGE.

29486531,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624749,1718402431,MATIC Price Tests 8-Month Support As Polygon Unveils New Governance Hub,"Polygon’s native token, MATIC, has experienced a notable disparity compared to the broader cryptocurrency market. Unlike the top cryptocurrencies that have posted double-digit gains year-to-date, MATIC has failed to post positive performance across all time frames since the 2021 bull run. Adding to the concern, MATIC’s price has recorded losses amounting to 16.5% over the past seven days. This downward trend has prompted the token to test a crucial macro support level, raising questions about its future trajectory. Amid these developments, Polygon has announced a strategic partnership with Aragon, a developer of decentralized autonomous organizations, to introduce a “governance hub” for the Polygon community. Simplified Governance Hub For Polygon? According to a recent blog post by the Layer 2 solution protocol, the governance hub is “designed to empower” users and builders, allowing them to influence the core development of Polygon’s technology. The hub will reportedly be developed in phases in collaboration with Aragon to ensure that community feedback is incorporated to create a decentralized platform that aligns with community values. Related Reading: Solana Empty Glasses: BEER Coin Fizzles 70% In Alleged Rug Pull The governance hub will feature a unified interface for “two essential pillars” of Polygon’s governance: protocol and system smart contract governance. The hub seeks to increase transparency and encourage greater community participation in protocol governance. As for system smart contract governance, it introduces an upgraded framework that prioritizes structured decision-making processes while maintaining transparency and safety. In addition, Aragon will leverage its expertise to build the Polygon Governance Hub using Aragon OSx. This tool enables the construction of customized on-chain governance solutions that can be adapted over time through a modular plugin-based architecture. Polygon stated in its announcement: Polygon, and all related network architecture, needs flexible, transparent, and future-proof governance mechanisms and tooling. The Polygon Governance Hub is central to achieving this. MATIC Market Capitalization Drops Dramatically Despite the developers’ focus on community governance within the Polygon ecosystem, key metrics indicate a consistent decline in the MATIC token’s price over the past year. For instance, the token’s market capitalization has experienced a significant drop, plummeting nearly 50% in just three months. In March, it was valued at $9.9 billion, whereas it is currently valued at $5.6 billion. This decline suggests a potential capital shift towards other large-cap tokens or profit-taking activities. Furthermore, MATIC’s trading volume has also seen a notable decrease of approximately 18% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. The trading volume now stands at a mere $293 million. Moreover, MATIC has witnessed a substantial 80% decline from its all-time high of $2.92 in December 2021. Related Reading: Red Alert For Polkadot (DOT): Double-Digit Drop Sparks Investor Fears Presently, the token faces a critical test at an 8-month support level, as depicted in the MATIC/USD daily chart below, with its current trading price at $0.5982. Should the price continue to decline without a significant catalyst to drive an upward trend and price recovery, attention should be paid to the next support level at $0.5700. The future trajectory of the MATIC price remains uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether further downside movement is in store or if a bounce at the current support level will materialize, offering potential opportunities for bullish investors.

42408061,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga90uB,1718401866,South Africa Re-Elects Cyril Ramaphosa of the ANC as President,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa of the African National Congress (ANC) party was re-elected on Friday, and will lead the country's first multi-party coalition government.  The ANC managed to secure only 159 seats in this the election, short of the 200 seats required for a majority. After days of back-and-forth discussion, they announced the formation of a fragile coalition government – dubbed the government of national unity – with theirbiggest opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance, as well as the Inkatha Freedom Party and the smaller Patriotic Alliance.  The ANC has ruled the country for 30 years since the end of apartheid in 1994. This election gives the ANC at least another five years to rule the country, though the party will not be ruling with the strong majority it once had. In the previous parliament it had 230 seats.  The election results are not expected to have a significant impact on South Africa's burgeoning crypto industry. The country's top regulator, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority, recently set up a licensing regime for crypto, making it one of the first African nations to do so. The country recently started licensing digital asset firms, and crypto companies Luno, Zignaly, and VALR were among the first to get a license in April. In 2022, the country included crypto providers in its Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act so it could regulate digital assets as financial products.  The nation's Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group is also expected to examine use cases for stablecoins, consider a policy and regulatory response this year, and explore the implications of tokenization.  South Africa also started consulting on a directive in April that would include crypto in the country’s Travel Rules. The rules will take effect once they are put in the gazette. The directive requires virtual asset service providers to transmit information on wallets and passports when making transfers.  Many nations around the world are implementing the Financial Action Task Force's travel rule, which requires nations to share information on crypto transactions and curb money laundering.

Prosecutors say Thomas Pavey, 38, of Florida, and Raheim Hamilton, 28, of Virginia, owned and operated Empire Market from 2018 to 2020. During the period Empire Market operated, prosecutors say the pair processed $430 million in transactions on the site, which allowed users to anonymously purchase illegal goods and services.

All transactions were made with cryptocurrency. Empire Market shut down in August 2020.  Pavey and Hamilton were already in custody for separate charges – prosecutors had previously charged the pair with allegedly selling counterfeit currency on another darknet market, AlphaBay, which shut down in 2017.  The new charges against Pavey and Hamilton include conspiring to engage in drug trafficking, computer fraud, access device fraud, counterfeiting, and money laundering. According to the DOJ’s press release, the charges against both men are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison.

As sellers press on, reversing all gains posted from May 20, on-chain data points to a bullish picture. Ethereum HODLers Scoop 298,000 ETH In 24 Hours Taking to X, one analyst notes a spike in ETH demand, especially from permanent holders. Most likely, these permanent holders are institutions with deeper pockets and are willing to hang on. Unlike retailers, these entities can often choose to hold for longer and won’t be shaken out by market volatility. Citing CryptoQuant data, the analyst said these permanent holders, according to records, are responsible for the second-highest daily purchase. On June 12, when prices briefly rose, they bought a staggering 298,000 ETH. Impressively, this figure just falls short of the all-time high of 317,000 ETH purchased on September 11, 2023. In light of this, despite the wave of lower lows clear in the daily chart, the surge in demand points to strong bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Solana Empty Glasses: BEER Coin Fizzles 70% In Alleged Rug Pull Also, considering the amount of ETH scooped from the markets, it could signal that institutions, possibly hedge funds or billionaires, are beginning to position themselves in the market. They appear to be taking advantage of the lower prices. At press time, there is weakness in Ethereum, evident in the daily chart. Even with the bounce on June 12, bulls didn’t completely reverse losses of June 11. The dip on June 13 means sellers are back in the equation, and prices could align toward the conspicuous June 11 bar. From the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, $3,700 is emerging as a resistance level. After the breakout on June 7, ETH has been free-falling to spot rates, actively filling the May 20 gap. If the dump continues, it is likely that ETH, even with all the optimism across the crypto scene, will once more re-test $3,300. Spot ETFs To Begin Trading This Summer: Gensler Whether prices will recover from current levels or slip towards $3,300 remains to be seen. Overall, the market is upbeat, according to comments from Gary Gensler, the chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

These large withdrawals has caused the ETH balances on centralized exchanges to fall to their lowest level since 2016. 336,000 ETH Withdrawn From Exchanges Crypto analyst Ash Crypto took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal a notable change in the amount of ETH that is being held on centralized exchanges currently. Notably, there has been a marked increase in the withdrawals of small and large investors alike, leading to the highest withdrawal trend of 2024 so far. Related Reading: DOGE To The Moon: This Dogecoin Metric Just Turned Bullish For The First Time Since 2020 The report focuses on the withdrawals from the Coinbase exchange, which is the largest crypto exchange in the United States. The uptick in the withdrawal trend saw a whopping 336,000 ETH withdrawn from the exchange’s wallets in just 48 hours. This translates to the highest withdrawal trend from the exchange so far this year. However, Coinbase wasn’t the only crypto exchange hit hard by the Ethereum withdrawals as the cumulative exchange addresses saw their ETH balances fall drastically. As the on-chain tracker Santiment revealed in a report, the total ETH held on centralized exchange wallets has fallen 8.6% in the last two weeks alone. These withdrawals have greatly impacted the exchange balances, causing them to fall to their lowest point in 8 years. This means that the last time that the exchange balances were this low was back in 2016, which is three bull markets ago. Will This Propel Ethereum Price To $10,000? Naturally, the withdrawal of Ethereum from exchanges is bullish given that this is a trend that suggests investors are choosing to hold their Ethereum coins rather than sell them. If coins were moving the other direction and being deposited on exchanges instead, it would’ve been bearish for the price as it meant that investors were looking to offload their holdings for profit.

Presently, the ETH price is still closely following the Bitcoin trend. It has recovered above $3,500 once more after initially falling below this support level on Thursday.

42408056,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga90de,1718391870,Mass Adoption Would Ruin Crypto. Keep It a Niche,"Crypto would be better off remaining a niche.  The greatest crisis in crypto so far has been, undoubtedly, the rapid decline and tremendous fall of FTX. At the time of the collapse of what turned out to be Sam Bankman-Fried’s personal piggy bank, it was the third-largest crypto exchange. Its demise caused shockwaves across the industry, bringing down not just prices but a litany of companies.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  At the time, in late 2022, it was unclear if crypto as a concept would ever recover – the blatant fraud of what was, up to then, among the most consumer-savvy and trusted crypto companies appeared to confirm the widespread assumption that all of this was just artifice covering up fraud.  Today, things are looking up, though there remains a pervasive fear that the industry is repeating old mistakes and bound for another comeuppance. For veteran crypto investors and observers, this is and always has been normal: ever since the bitcoin {{BTC}} market crash of 2014, following the failure of Mt. Gox, and subsequent rebound, the cyclical nature of the market has been an accepted part of life.  But isn’t it odd that this maturing industry has normalized these boom-and-bust cycles? It seems to me that mass adoption for any blockchain or consumer application is contingent upon the price of its token – or the industry itself – not always being at risk of imminent collapse.  See also: You Want Crypto Regulation? I’ll Give You Crypto Regulation | Opinion  And that’s the thing. To a large extent, the biggest problem with growing crypto is the growth of crypto. This whiplash between euphoria when the markets surge and despair when it shrinks, every four years or so, is a result of crypto’s pursuit of mass adoption.  Crass adoption  The process is clear, a textbook case of economist Robert Shiller’s “irrational exuberance.” Promises of reinventing everything from money to the internet itself spark interest. People buy into the dream of decentralization (or, for many, the promise of a fast buck). Popularity drives prices up, which reflexively drives them up further as more and more people invest – until something breaks.  Almost always, the things that fail are the things that blockchains were built to mitigate or replace. And these things, almost always, were built to make crypto palatable and/or easy-to-use. It’s not an uncommon opinion that “the masses” likely won’t self-custody. But without self-custody, what’s even the point of something like Bitcoin?  “The risk of growing adoption is that new entrants aren’t aware of Bitcoin’s core principles: decentralization, self-custody, hard money, etc. If new entrants don’t learn, understand, and espouse these core beliefs, the features that make them reality may not remain in the protocols over time,” said Alex Thorn, the head of firmwide research at investment bank Galaxy Digital.  See also: An Ode to LocalBitcoins | Opinion  Adoption means following the law (which is often at odds with crypto's values) and creating easy-to-use sign-ins and on-ramps (which can be compromised). There is a tension – if not direct competition – between the aims of decentralization and mass adoption. Grow crypto too big, and you risk destroying what it is actually useful for. “Simply becoming folded into the dominant financial system ends up ceding a lot of the opportunities that matter with this tech,” said Nathan Schnieder, professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder and author of “Governable Spaces.”  It’s a point echoed by University College Dublin lecturer Paul Dylan-Ennis, who said “crypto is a subculture that cannot accept it is a subculture. Most of our troubles stem from how talk of 'onboarding the next billion' causes us to decay our values.”  There all along  There is a certain irony that developers, founders and investors have spent 15 years and billions of dollars searching for a “killer app” for blockchain, and yet it already has one.  Satoshi Nakamoto, and those who actually walk in his footsteps, have built digital bearer instruments that can be used any which way and cannot (easily) be taken from you.  That’s it. That’s the whole point of crypto.  That’s why, while almost no one pays for coffee with bitcoin, many use the privacy coin monero {{XMR}} to buy this or that on the darkweb. If you look at how crypto is actually used to connect with the real economy, you’ll see it's essentially in niche areas. These include black or gray markets, stablecoin remittance corridors and hobbyist pursuits.  Mind you, these are huge markets. But today, as in other periods where it seems like crypto is right on the cusp of breaking through, this usage pales in comparison to the speculative use of crypto, where capital goes in, jumps around from coin to coin or protocol to protocol and causes the number to go up – essentially creating a circular economy.  And that’s fine. Gambling is a use case to a certain extent. But if people want crypto to be used productively, developers, founders and investors should be building for people who have an actual need for censorship-resistant money and tools. Almost by definition, that’s a limited audience.  This is just my opinion. Many disagree.  Other views  Molly White, author of crypto-critical news services Web3IsGoingGreat and “Citation Needed,” argues that crypto is already mainstream. “There are individual projects that are still small and niche, but with Brian Armstrong and Sam Bankman-Fried rubbing elbows in Congress, and BlackRock and Fidelity launching bitcoin ETFs, I think that ship has probably sailed,” she said in a direct message.  Privacy advocate, educator and monero superuser SethforPrivacy sees things differently., The “unfortunate reality is that most people don't yet realize the need for Bitcoin nor are they willing to take on that much personal responsibility, and as such we must focus our efforts on improving Bitcoin for those who do realize the need today,"" he said.  See also: In Defense of Meme Coins | Opinion  There’s also an argument that decentralization is precisely the reason crypto will go global, so to speak.  “The ONLY thing that makes Bitcoin’s global ascension possible is its most cypherpunk attribute: that it is owned by no one, and operated by the users, not states or corporations,"" said Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation.  However, it’s not exactly clear what the masses want. Ethereum advocate Emmanuel Awosika, for instance, admits that “while we believe *everyone* wants privacy, censorship-resistance and protection against nation-state attacks, some people are fine with a product that solves a problem and has good UX.”  While not everyone needs, let alone wants, privacy, censorship resistance and maximum decentralization, Awosika added, “We should explore getting crypto in the hands of as many people as possible.""  Likewise, Roko Mijic, of “Roko’s basilisk” fame, argued that it’s actually scale that gives decentralized tools any power, which is observably true in that Bitcoin is difficult to attack because it has miners spread across the world. “You can't resist censorship from inside a small-scale crypto network because the government will just bring down the whole network,” Mijic said.  Justin Ehrenhofer, founder of Moonstone Research in Chicago, echoed this sentiment, pointing out that a currency is only useful if it is widely accepted, and so “cypherpunks should focus on building systems that appeal to outsiders.” However, he did add that “with wide-scale adoption” there has been a degradation in the spirit of crypto, given that the average user stores their wealth in custodial exchanges.

29481594,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624588,1718391618,"Dogecoin Plunges 11%, But This On-Chain Cushion Could End Decline","Dogecoin has observed a plummet of 11% over the past week, but this decline may not continue further, as DOGE is now just above a major on-chain support block. Dogecoin Is Now Just Above A Major On-Chain Demand Zone According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, DOGE is currently above a zone of significant on-chain demand. In on-chain analysis, “demand zones” refer to price ranges in which many investors buy their coins. Related Reading: Solana Set For “A Major 53% Price Move,” Analyst Reveals Why These zones are determined using blockchain data; the average price at which an address receives deposits is considered its cost basis. Below is a chart showing how the Dogecoin price levels near the current one are based on how many addresses share their cost basis with them. In the graph, the size of the dots corresponds to the number of addresses that acquired their coins within the respective range. It would appear that the $0.096 to $0.139 range currently looks to be the largest Dogecoin price range in terms of this metric. More specifically, 409,330 addresses acquired a total of 45 billion DOGE inside this range. Now, what’s the relevance of this demand zone, or any other one, for that matter? Generally, the cost basis is an important level for any investor, so they may be more prone to show some reaction when the spot price of the cryptocurrency retests it. A few investors showing this reaction would naturally not be relevant for the broader market. Still, if many of them share their cost basis inside the same narrow range, then a retest could produce a large reaction for the price to feel its effects. The demand zone around the average price of $0.115 had many addresses acquire their coins there, so its retest could be significant for the memecoin. As the current Dogecoin price is above this range, these investors who bought inside the range would be sitting on some profits. Historically, such demand zones below the price have acted as points of support for the cryptocurrency. This is because investor psychology tends to work out, so these holders who were in profits before the retest may believe the price would go up again so they could decide to buy more of the asset. On the other hand, investors in the red before the retest can fuel the cryptocurrency’s resistance as they sell in fear that the price will fall again. “On the upside, DOGE may face resistance around the $0.16 level, where 20 billion DOGE is presently held at a loss,” notes IntoTheBlock. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Stagnant Despite ETF Inflows? Report Answers It remains to be seen whether the on-chain demand zone below would help stop the memecoin’s decline if its price drops enough to retest it.

This newfound interest, coupled with strong activity data from blockchain analytics platform DappRadar, fuels speculation of a potential price explosion. Some analysts are predicting a meteoric rise to $16, despite recent dips. However, beneath the bullish bravado lies a layer of technical analysis and short-term volatility that warrants a closer look. Related Reading: Ethereum Longs Crushed! Who Got Burned In The $62 Million Fire Sale? Decoding NEAR’s Google Surge The recent surge in Google searches for NEAR is undeniable. This newfound interest can be interpreted in two ways. Optimists see it as a sign of growing recognition and potential mainstream adoption. They point to NEAR’s strong fundamentals – its developer-friendly architecture, focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), and active ecosystem with popular DApps like Kai-Ching and Hot Wallet. heh, sorry kiddos. looks like NEAR is number one in Google Search trends. another huge W. try it for yourself. 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 literally too ez 🥱 pic.twitter.com/eYKWZM0iWK — NEAR Protocol (@NEARProtocol) June 5, 2024 According to DappRadar, NEAR’s protocol boasts high transaction volume, reflecting strong network activity. Additionally, DappRadar highlights NEAR’s promising DeFi presence with a healthy total value locked (TVL) within its DeFi applications. This combination positions NEAR as a contender in the evolving blockchain landscape, attracting both retail and institutional investors. However, skeptics caution against overhyping Google Trends. They argue that search volume doesn’t always translate to long-term price appreciation. It’s possible that the surge is a fleeting fad, fueled by short-term marketing campaigns or even social media influencers. They point to the current price dip as evidence of this disconnect between online buzz and actual market movement. Can Technical Analysis Steer NEAR To $16? Crypto analyst More Crypto Online has thrown down the gauntlet, presenting a bullish case for NEAR based on the Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci retracement levels. The theory suggests that market prices follow predictable wave patterns, and the current price action places NEAR in the potential “second wave” of a five-wave sequence. This, according to More Crypto Online, paves the way for a significant “third wave” with a target price of $16. $NEAR: The price is still holding above the relevant support level at $4.97. As long as this support level holds, it is plausible to watch for a third wave from here, which should send the price to $16+. However, we need more upside momentum.#NearProtocol #NEAR pic.twitter.com/azsWbQTMKG — More Crypto Online (@Morecryptoonl) June 12, 2024 While this analysis offers an interesting roadmap, it’s crucial to acknowledge the limitations of technical analysis. These models are based on historical price movements, and the future market can be notoriously unpredictable. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ownership Trends: Short-Term Spike As ETFs Gain Popularity – Report Can The Coin Maintain Its Bullish Balance? The key to NEAR’s potential surge lies in the crucial support level of $4.97. If the price stays above this point, it bolsters the bullish outlook and potentially triggers the anticipated third wave. A successful third wave could propel NEAR to significant price targets, initially around $10.5 and potentially reaching even higher.

One such niche gaining traction is the PolitiFi token sector, which blends political engagement with the dynamic world of crypto. Among these tokens, MAGA VP ($MVP) stands out, capturing the interest of both political enthusiasts and crypto investors. Understanding PolitiFi Tokens PolitiFi tokens are designed to integrate political themes and movements into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering unique opportunities for engagement and investment. These tokens often align with specific political ideologies or figures, creating a community-driven platform that supports political campaigns, movements, and causes. Beyond Hype: Real-World Utilities and Engagement While some might view PolitiFi tokens as just another trend, they offer more than just hype. They provide tangible utilities and foster deeper political engagement through various innovative features: Donation Mechanisms: PolitiFi tokens can directly support political campaigns. For instance, tokens like MAGA VP facilitate donations to the Trump campaign, linking political support with financial contributions. Voting Applications: MAGA VP has developed a Voting DApp, allowing token holders to participate in selecting Trump’s Vice Presidential pick. This not only engages the community in the political process but also rewards participants, fostering a sense of involvement and incentivizing engagement. The Unique Appeal of PolitiFi Tokens PolitiFi tokens represent a genuine movement and support base, distinguishing themselves from tokens that primarily gain traction through hype and memes: Community Engagement: The deep attachment to the political cause ensures a highly engaged and active community. This engagement goes beyond financial speculation, as members feel part of a larger movement, driving real-world political action and support.

The analyst suggested that the flagship crypto has yet to reach its full potential in this market cycle and that more price surges lie ahead for the crypto token. Not Yet Time For A Bitcoin Blowoff Top TechDev remarked in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Bitcoin blowoff tops only happen after the four-week Chaikin money flow (CMF) breaks a line he highlighted on the accompanying chart. His analysis suggests that Bitcoin is still bound to make a parabolic move to the upside before it experiences a significant decline. Related Reading: Solana On-Chain Indicators Suggests A Return Of Bullish Sentiment, Is It Time To Buy SOL? Blowoff tops are a chart pattern that shows the rapid increase in an asset’s price followed by a sharp drop in its price. TechDev’s chart showed that something similar happened in the previous bull cycles, with Bitcoin enjoying a parabolic uptrend for about a year before its price dropped sharply. Similarly, based on TechDev’s chart, Bitcoin is again set to enjoy a parabolic uptrend from now to sometime in 2025 before it reaches its market top and begins to decline significantly. In another X post, the analyst suggested that the time has almost for Bitcoin to enjoy its next leg up. As crypto analyst Rekt Capital claimed, this next move to the upside will take Bitcoin into the ‘parabolic uptrend’ phase of this market cycle. Interestingly, this breakout for Bitcoin could happen sooner than expected, with TechDev claiming that in 18 days, Bitcoin will have a chance at a breakout that it has only seen once in its entire history. From a chart he shared, TechDev hinted at Bitcoin rising to as high as $190,000 in this bull run. It is also worth mentioning that crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently predicted that a Bitcoin breakout is imminent. He said Bitcoin would “absolutely giga send” in seven to ten days and rise to as high as $100,000 when this move happens. Bitcoin’s Breakout May Still Take A While Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently stated that Bitcoin’s breakout from this Re-Accumulation range would occur in September 2024 if history repeats itself. The crypto analyst claimed that Bitcoin’s struggle to break out from this Re-Accumulation range is “beneficial for the overall cycle.” Related Reading: DOGE To The Moon: This Dogecoin Metric Just Turned Bullish For The First Time Since 2020 He noted that Bitcoin has never broken out this early in the post-halving period. Rekt Capital remarked that a Bitcoin breakout this early means that this cycle would be accelerated and that the bull market would be shorter than usual. As such, he believes that this lengthy consolidation is helping Bitcoin’s price resynchronize with historical halving cycles so that the market can experience a “normal and usual bull run.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,900, down almost 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

29473432,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624610,1718375451,DOGE On The Move: Rebound To End 1-Day Bearish Move?,"Despite the dominant bearish trend in the market, the well-known meme-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is making an effort to recover. This unanticipated upward trend occurs even though sentiment and general market conditions are still primarily negative. Traders and investors are keeping a careful eye on the situation as DOGE attempts to make up some lost ground, trying to decipher what this possible turnaround might mean. Several factors could be driving this attempt at recovery, including market reactions to news events, changes in investor sentiment, or technical indicators signaling oversold conditions. However, the question remains: can DOGE sustain this rebound and reverse the bearish trend, or is this merely a temporary uptick before further declines? This introduction delves into the dynamics behind DOGE’s current price action and explores what investors might expect in the near future. As of this writing, DOGE has a market capitalization of over $20 billion, a trading volume of over $715 million, and a price increase of 1.33%, trading at around $0.14297 over the past 24 hours. The market capitalization and trading volume of DOGE has experienced a decline of 0.73% and 43.92%, respectively. DOGE Upswing Analyzed While the price of DOGE is currently trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), an analysis of the price movement on the 4-hour chart shows that DOGE is attempting an upswing by dropping bullish candlesticks. Also, given that the 4-hour composite trend oscillator indicator’s signal line has crossed above the SMA and is moving towards the zero line, it supports the previous assertion that the price of DOGE may increase. On the 1-day chart, DOGE’s price is attempting a bullish move by developing a bullish candlestick while trading below the 1-day SMA. What this indicates is that DOGE’s price may move upward and at some point, it might start to decline again. The signal line and SMA of the composite trend oscillator indicator on the 1-day chart have made a cross and are attempting a drop below the zero line. This supports the above claim that at some point DOGE’s price might begin to drop again. Bullish Or Bearish Trajectory? If this upswing continues, the price of DOGE will advance towards the $0.14911 resistance level, despite DOGE’s continued pessimistic outlook. DOGE might climb higher to challenge the resistance level of $0.16490 if it breaks above the $0.14911 level. Should there be a break above the previously indicated level, the crypto asset may turn bullish. There is a tendency that DOGE’s price will begin to decline toward the $0.13580 support level if it fails to break above the $0.14911 level. The crypto asset will decline further to challenge the $0.12014 support level in the event of a break below the $0.13580 level and even other levels after that.

Drake indicated on June 6 that he had placed the bets on crypto casino Stake using bitcoin {{BTC}} by posting the betting slips on Instagram, accompanied by a message: ""Dallas cause I'm a Texan. Oilers are self explanatory. Picks in are @stake.""  It's worth pointing out that Drake has had partnerships with Stake in the past, so he may have an incentive to post about his bets on the platform, even if they don't pay off. Stake partnered with Drake in 2022 in a deal that the singer described as ""inevitable."" Stake made $2.6 billion in revenue in the same year.  Drake stood to win $1.025 million and $1.375 million if the Oilers and Mavericks managed to win their respective series, according to the betting slips. To date, no NBA team has ever managed to win a series in the playoffs or finals after being down three games with no wins.  Drake won’t have to wait long to know the outcome of both bets; tipoff for game 4 of the NBA Finals is Friday whilst the Oilers play Saturday. Both teams need to avoid defeat to extend the series.  The 37-year-old is no stranger to losing bitcoin by betting on sports. He also placed a $615,000 bet on Francis Ngannou to beat Anthony Joshua in a boxing bout in March; Joshua ended up winning by knockout in the second round.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/14/drake-on-brink-of-1m-bitcoin-loss-as-nhl-and-nba-bets-go-sour,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f49120f049e52b74ccd191a82e42210997a707bc-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A flicker of optimism about DOT remains despite the general bearish outlook, as technical analysis points to a potential price turnaround in the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Longs Crushed! Who Got Burned In The $62 Million Fire Sale? Falling Wedge Hints At Bullish Breakout Technical analysts are a breed known for their fascination with squiggly lines and cryptic patterns. However, for some Polkadot investors, these lines might hold the key to future gains. Enter the “falling wedge,” a bullish reversal pattern identified by prominent analyst WorldOfCharts on DOT’s 12-hour timeframe. $Dot Forming Falling Wedge Incase Of Successful Breakout Expecting Move Towards 11-12$ In Coming Days #crypto #Dot #Polkadot pic.twitter.com/VymXK89QN0 — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) June 12, 2024 This pattern, characterized by converging downward trend lines, suggests a weakening of the downward momentum, potentially leading to a price surge upwards. The point of convergence for these lines acts as a critical juncture, where a successful breakout could propel DOT’s price towards the much-desired $11-12 range. DOT Price At A Glance Polkadot (DOT) currently holds the 14th rank in the cryptocurrency market. With a circulating supply of approximately $10.87 billion DOT and a market cap of 1.44 billion DOT, its value has increased by $0.06 in the past 24 hours. Over the last 7 days, DOT has risen by 16%, reflecting strong upward momentum and potential for investment. In the past month, DOT has seen a 1.83% increase, adding $0.14 to its value, indicating a promising outlook for potential future growth as a stable asset in the cryptocurrency market. Fibonacci Retracement: A Golden Opportunity? Another analyst throws their hat into the bullish ring, identifying a potential trade opportunity for DOT. LongtermX, who is known for their Fibonacci-focused predictions, highlights a possible 44% upswing for DOT, targeting the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at roughly $9.50. This level represents a significant resistance point, but if DOT can break free from its current price range, it could signal a significant shift in momentum. Beyond The Charts It’s important to remember that Polkadot’s potential extends beyond the realm of technical indicators and price predictions. As the “King of Interoperability,” Polkadot boasts a unique architecture that allows different blockchains to communicate seamlessly. This interoperability is a game-changer in the fragmented world of blockchain technology, potentially enabling the creation of a truly interconnected Web3 ecosystem.

CEO exit and takeover attempt by rival Riot create uncertainty in leadership and future direction. Given the recent halving of BTC in April, we'll also want to see what that suggests for financial results going forward. When I last covered Bitfarms ( BITF ), I noted that it had a lot going for it among Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners but that it needed positive free cash flow. Q1 results also turned out very good, but with the exodus of its CEO Geoff Murphy, takeover attempts by its rival, and weakened production after the halving, there's a lot going on, too much for me to feel good about buying, and so I've maintained my Hold rating. Recap During my last thesis, I highlighted it had a lot going for it: Positive operating cash flows (unlike other miners) Low-cost electrical expenses No debt Declining share dilution Tailwinds from election of Milei in Argentina I also noted some downsides: Negative free cash flow The hash rate arms race over time Potential for unfavorable BTC prices post halving I ultimately waited for the situation to develop more, and it has! Let's start by looking at Q1 results. Q1 Results So Q1 2024 had a great milestone. They finally had a period of positive free cash flow. Cash Flow Statement (Q1 2024 Financial Report) Kind of. Looking there, we see that operating cash flows were $18.2M, on top of $3.9M of capex. That would normally be considered free cash flow, but an interesting item appears down there, with $74M also spent on ""equipment and construction prepayments. Their quarterly report (pg. 24) explains it: During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company placed a firm purchase order for 35,888 Bitmain T21 Miners (the ''Purchase Order'') totaling $95,462 with deliveries scheduled from March 2024 to May 2024 and made a non-refundable deposit of $9,464. In addition, the Company secured a purchase option for an additional 28,000 Bitmain T21 Miners (the ''Purchase Option'') totaling $74,480 and made a non-refundable deposit of $7,448. This Purchase Option gives the Company the right, exercisable until December 31, 2024, but not the obligation, to purchase, up to 28,000 additional Bitmain T21 Miners. Back in Q4 2023, that had already broken ground by buy the first ever BTC miner call option. With 2023's capex total $73.7M, it looks like they used the option to go ahead and lock in a price for 2024's payments? Why? During the earnings call , management explained this a bit. Chief Mining Officer Ben Gagnon said: We analyzed over six years of purchase history for every miner...What we found is that the most important factor for determining a good miner investment is timing, as timing ultimately determined costs...in November 2023 with Bitcoin around $37,000 and the halving just months away...We secured some of the lowest prices seen in years and negotiated a miner option, an industry first. We moved quickly and launched our fleet upgrade plan, and in March followed up with even more miner purchases, purchasing nearly an additional 24,000 of the best-performing machines on the market with competitive pricing. It seems that management really believes it can control its miner costs with these moves, thereby keeping capex down in the long term. It will ultimately depend on if they get to exercise these miner calls at favorable prices, but it does seem like the company is making headway to free cash flow, with its high OCF and strategy for capex. Q1 2024 Company Presentation Operationally, Q1 showed the company make great strides in its hash rate growth, doing so at a faster rate than the whole market. As I mentioned last time, this is key in being able to mine BTC at a faster rate. Q1 2024 Company Presentation They also enjoyed margin improvement, benefiting from rising BTC prices and their own efficiencies. These advantages helped to drive the strong operating cash flows. CEO Exit and Takeover Target Former CEO Geoff Murphy announced plans to depart in March, shortly after my first article. The initial announcement was calmer. Murphy left sooner than expected on May 10, after initiating legal proceedings against Bitfarms in a $27M suit. Obviously, that has potential to be expensive for the company at a time where it needs to preserve cash flow, on top of damaging to their brand and reputation. As if that weren't the only power struggle, Riot ( RIOT ), their competitor, attempted a takeover of the company. In late May , they acquired over 9% of the company and offered to buy the whole entity for $950M, which Bitfarms flatly refused. BITF Recent Price History (Seeking Alpha) These events show Riot clearly pouncing on the recent drop in BITF's price. The offer caused a turnaround in the share's movement, but Riot wasn't done. Just this week, Riot executed Plan B , steadily increasing its position to 12%. This prompted a threat by Bitfarms to sell more shares and dilute Riot, if they increased their stake to 15%. This also makes Riot the largest shareholder, and they can use their clout to influence the structure of the Board of Directors. With Murphy gone, Chairman Bonta serving as Interim CEO, and this takeover attempt, I think the future leadership of Bitfarms is in question. Riot's new stake is concerning because they are a far-less effective operator. I covered them back in January , and considering how much poorer they do, I don't see what positive impact they could have here. Moreover, if they continue to have financial issues, they too would be vulnerable to a takeover, and Bitfarms is exposed to that risk now that Riot has a position in them. I think investors will need to watch these upcoming events carefully. An investment in BITF right now is not to be made lightly. Don't Forget Q2 One of the concerns I have is how much cash from operations will continue to be what it was in Q1, now that the latest BTC halving event has passed, as of April, which would not show in Q1 results. BTC 6M Price History (Seeking Alpha) The price of BTC has not moved much. While improved hash rates suggest they can handle the halving better, half the rewards for the same work means the Q1 margin improvement is going to be lost. For May, the company already reported significantly less BTC production, something I warned in my first coverage. We will need to see the material impact to cash flows before we can properly assess. Valuation While there's long-term potential in BITF, we've yet to see if their capex will be managed well enough to produce their first year of free cash flow. Even if it turns positive, it's a $1 billion valuation on what may only be tens of millions in FCF. Whatever growth or discount rates one wants to use, it would take an unprecedented spike in the price of BTC to make this market cap attractive . Muddled by mutual threats of takeovers and dilution, individual shares look even worse. $2.81 might be fair but suggests no margin of safety, in my eyes. It's a valuation that assumes more good news than bad. Conclusion Good operating results in Q1 were counterbalanced by the loss of an effective CEO, turned litigious, which created new legal and financial risks for BITF. On top of that, their strength has drawn the unwanted attention of Riot, a less effective, but larger operator, whose intentions are unclear and whose influence may undermine Bitfarms' more effective model (if we just go by financial results). Management's efforts to prevent a takeover, with a threat of dilution, would also affect other shareholders as collateral damage.

In just two quarters, Coinbase’s transaction revenue has risen nearly 275% due to accelerating growth in retail trading volume. Analyst estimates also point to a difficult growth landscape for the two in 2025 and 2026, with revenue growth expected to decelerate to reside in the low single-digit range. By the Tech Insider Network Team We said to our free readers in late January following the SEC's approval of nearly one dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs that it was ""widely expected that this approval and subsequent widespread access for institutions and retail investors will shape up to be one of the most bullish fundamental moments in Bitcoin's history."" At the time, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was trading for less than $40,000. Now, Bitcoin has repeatedly pushed above the $70,000 mark, and we updated our Bitcoin game plan and price targets to $106K to $190K in late April as Bitcoin pulled back below $60,000. While Bitcoin and the spot BTC ETFs have clearly seen strong investor appetite since the approval in the beginning of the year - for example, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) reached $10 billion in AUM in less than seven weeks as it went on to notch 71 consecutive days of net inflows. IBIT now has more than $23 billion in AUM, or 305,067 BTC, more than doubling in three months. Alongside strong initial adoption of the new ETF class, we're also seeing major crypto exchanges and platforms benefit, with Coinbase and Robinhood both seeing crypto trading volumes and transaction revenues surge. This may cause investors to believe that Coinbase and Robinhood are clear beneficiaries, yet we foresee trouble for HOOD specifically. Our firm excels at using technical analysis to manage high beta positions, which is why our Bitcoin entries and exits have greatly outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy, as we previously detailed here . Not only are the technicals flashing on Robinhood but the fundamentals show concentration risk in Dogecoin, one of the riskiest coins on the market. We spell out what it could mean for our readers, and why Robinhood is (yet again) a risk to both investors and crypto holders. Coinbase Says Crypto Volatility Ticked Up in Q1 After reaching the lowest levels since 2016 in Q3 last year, crypto volatility has begun to increase, with Coinbase noting that an internal measurement of crypto asset volatility rose "" sharply, but remained well below all-time high levels."" Coinbase measures volatility based on intraday returns of a volume-weighted basket of all assets listed on our trading platform [which] are used to compute the basket's intraday volatility which is then scaled to a daily window. These daily volatility values are then averaged over the applicable time period as needed ."" Coinbase Alongside this rise in crypto volatility towards the 5% range, Coinbase noted a surge in the crypto market cap, which "" reached a 52-week high of approximately $2.8 trillion in Q1."" This also returned to the peak levels seen in Q3 and Q4 2021, which coincided with both Coinbase's and Robinhood's record high transaction revenues and trading volumes. Coinbase said that while it cannot identify a specific singular driver of this increase in crypto market cap through Q1, it pointed to "" a variety of factors, such as the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs which experienced over $11 billion in net inflows so far in 2024."" While we saw the pace of inflows slow to a crawl through April and May, June so far has seen inflows top the $500 million mark once again, recording the second highest daily net inflow since the start of the year at more than $886 million. The Block Crypto market cap has stayed relatively flat this quarter so far compared to Q1, last reaching $2.68 trillion on June 11, just 7% below its peak of $2.89 trillion in early March. This was aided by the SEC's initial approval of 8 Ethereum ETFs in late May and a 20% rise in ETH - another possible volatility-spurring event. Overall, Q1 saw very favorable conditions for Coinbase and Robinhood to accelerate trading volume growth and transaction revenue generation with an increase in volatility along with rising crypto prices, and these conditions look to have persisted through much of Q2 so far, albeit with a slowdown in net inflows to BTC ETFs early in the quarter. Coinbase, Robinhood Trading Volumes Accelerating Significantly Both Coinbase and Robinhood reported significant accelerations in trading volumes in Q1, with participation from both retail and institutional investors increasing. Coinbase reported total trading volume of $312 billion, a 103% QoQ increase from $154 billion in Q4, and a 312% increase from Q3's low of $76 billion. Growth was driven by both retail and institutional customers, though as Coinbase's largest and primary customer group, institutions drove a lion's share (83%) of the dollar increase in trading volume. Coinbase Institutional trading volume of $256 billion represented a 105% QoQ increase, or $131 billion, reaching the highest level since Q1 2022. Retail trading volume rose 93% QoQ to $56 billion in Q1, more than 5x higher than Q3's $11 billion. Bitcoin was the primary driver of the QoQ increase in trading volume, with Bitcoin's volume rising from below $48 billion in Q4 to $103 billion in Q1. Robinhood's crypto trading volume growth outpaced Coinbase's in Q1, though at a much smaller base due to the lack of institutional investors on the platform. Robinhood reported 224% YoY and 181% QoQ growth in crypto trading volume to $36 billion, or 429% higher than Q3's $6.8 billion. This growth was driven primarily by a surge in volume in March, where Robinhood reported $23.6 billion in volume, a 263% MoM increase. Robinhood Robinhood also has shared April and May's crypto trading volume metrics , reporting trading volume of $10.1 billion in April, a (57%) MoM decline but a 173% YoY increase. May's crypto trading volume slipped (30%) MoM to $7.1 billion; this still represented a strong 238% YoY increase. We're seeing one primary asset driving this growth in Q1 and this sequential MoM weakness through Q2, which raises one red flag for the durability of transaction revenue growth moving forward. Coinbase, Robinhood's Transaction Revenues Surging As a result of the rapid acceleration in crypto trading volumes across Coinbase and Robinhood, the two are seeing transaction revenues surge. In Robinhood's case, crypto is now becoming a much larger part of transaction revenues and thus overall revenues. Coinbase reported transaction revenue of $1.08 billion in Q1, including $56 million of Base and payment related revenue. This represented YoY growth of 187% and QoQ growth of 103%, an acceleration from Q4's 64% YoY and 83% QoQ growth. In just two quarters, Coinbase's transaction revenue has risen nearly 275% due to accelerating growth in retail trading volume. Coinbase Retail (consumer) transaction revenue increased 184% YoY and 99% QoQ; in dollar terms, revenue increased nearly $470 million from last quarter on a $27 billion increase in volume. Institutional transaction revenue approached levels last seen in Q4 2021, reaching $85.4 million in Q1. Revenue from this cohort has increased $71 million over the last two quarters, as trading volume surged nearly $200 billion. Coinbase shared some light on Q2's outlook, saying that ""in April, we generated over $300 million of total transaction revenue and expect Q2 subscription and services revenue to be within a range of $525-$600 million, assuming crypto asset prices stay in the range we have seen year to date."" Extrapolating this across May and June suggests Q2's total transaction revenues are set to decline sequentially, by approximately (10%) to (15%). This highlights two major facets of Coinbase's model - while institutions drive a majority of volume on the platform, the transaction fees are a tiny fraction of what retail pays, meaning that strong growth in institutional volume will barely be felt on the top line. It also highlights that despite increasing fee-based competition from both Robinhood and ETFs, Coinbase is driving revenues higher on smaller volumes than it had seen in 2021. This means that if crypto adoption and volatility brings trading volumes near peak 2021's levels, revenue is likely to easily exceed those historical peaks. However, transaction revenue growth may have peaked for the short term, given April's results and trends seen in Robinhood. For Robinhood, crypto is but one of the many investing products offered on the platform alongside equities and options, with options historically serving as the largest driver of transaction revenue. Crypto transaction revenue was $126 million in Q1, an increase of 232% YoY and 193% QoQ. Compared to Q3 2023, it's an increase of nearly 448%. Robinhood Robinhood Has Nearly as Much Doge as Bitcoin = High Risk Crypto transaction revenue now accounts for 38% of Robinhood's total transaction revenue, up from 22% last quarter and 12% in Q3. This was crypto's highest share of transaction revenue since Q2 2021, where it drove 52% on elevated interest and extreme trading volume in Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), which accounted for 62% of crypto trading volume in the quarter . Dogecoin remains a critical piece of Robinhood's crypto business and a likely driver of recent growth alongside Bitcoin - safeguarded customer assets of Dogecoin increased 122% QoQ to $7.37 billion, or 28% of total safeguarded crypto assets. For comparison, safeguarded Bitcoin assets rose just 68% QoQ to $10.31 billion. It's likely that a majority of March's $23.6 billion in crypto trading volume can be traced back to Dogecoin, with the same going for April and May. March saw extreme volatility in Dogecoin's price as it topped $0.20, with daily volumes regularly topping 3 billion, and reaching as high as over 12 billion, whereas in January and February daily volume rarely surpassed 2 billion. Daily volume remained elevated in April as Robinhood reported more than $10 billion in crypto trading volume, while Doge's volume has dipped in May where Robinhood's crypto volume declined (30%) MoM. CoinMarketCap This raises a question of how durable transaction revenue growth is, assuming crypto trading volumes decline (30%) QoQ in Q2 on fading volume in Dogecoin, and plateau in Q3. Trading volumes are continuing to slip MoM, as seen in April and May's results, providing a headwind to transaction revenue growth as this elevated volatility in Dogecoin dissipates. Robinhood received a Wells Notice in early May regarding crypto tokens listed on the platform, though it is not clear exactly which tokens the SEC is targeting in the notice. Robinhood CFO Jason Warnick explained in Q1's earnings call that it is business as usual for Robinhood Crypto. We're, of course, disappointed to have received the notice. As you know, we've operated our crypto business in good faith. We've been very conservative in our approach in terms of coins listed and services offered. And we're a highly regulated company and have applied the same legal and compliance standards we use for our brokerage to the way we run our crypto business. So, it's disappointing to see more regulation by enforcement here."" At the same time, Robinhood is working on expanding its crypto presence globally, buying BitStamp for $200 million. Robinhood's High Concentration Risk in Dogecoin As a reminder, Dogecoin contributed 62% of Robinhood's revenue in the previous crypto run-up, which did not end well for investors as the high concentration contributed to the stock losing 90% of its value as Dogecoin's hype and price faded shortly after Robinhood's IPO. We can clearly see how Doge's price and volatility are correlated to Robinhood's trading volume and transaction revenue growth. Doge's price surged to the pennies in Q1 2021 on more than 850 billion in volume, with Robinhood reporting nearly $88 billion in trading volume. Q2 2021 saw Doge's price surge above $0.70 on extreme volatility with volume of 680 billion, driving Robinhood's Q2 2021 trading volume up to $233 billion, a 3x QoQ increase. Transaction revenues soared from $12 million in Q4 2020 to $233 million in Q2 2021, a remarkable growth rate in just two quarters. However, this quickly faded to $51 million in Q3 2021 as Dogecoin's volatility and volume faded quickly. Trading volume declined steadily hand-in-hand with Doge through 2023 - October 2022's pop in Doge drove a 16% MoM increase in Robinhood's trading volume from $15.5 billion to $18 billion, which quickly dropped to below $15 billion in November and continued its trend of declining consistently. Doge's recent increase again has correlated with increased volumes and transaction revenues for Robinhood in the first quarter, but has led to declining trading volumes and likely transaction revenue for Q2. CoinMarketCap Robinhood Analysts seemed to poke about Robinhood's heavy concentration and reliance on Doge in Q1's call, though management's response was very vague. Q, Brian Bertram Bedell (Deutsche Bank): ""Maybe just staying on the crypto theme, maybe for Jason, if you can talk about just the nature of the surge in crypto volumes in March. And I think you said April was at $10 billion. I appreciate, of course, this is very volatile class, but maybe if you can just talk about what you're seeing that drove that heavy activity in March and whether you think we could see spikes like that again?"" A, Vladimir Tenev (CEO): ""…Our crypto activity does track the broader market. And I don't really want to get into prognosticating what the crypto market is going to do. That's obviously a difficult thing for anyone to do. It's a global market. … But the goal is also to diversify the business so that we're less reliant on volumes anywhere in any one category to drive business results."" While management vaguely pointed to the broader market as a driver of growth, the comments about diversifying away from one asset again hints at Dogecoin being a primary driver of trading volume and transaction revenue growth, further supported by safeguarded assets more than doubling QoQ. This heavy reliance on a memecoin raises risks for durable crypto revenue growth outside of Dogecoin, and we have seen cases where companies with heavy customer concentration have failed to deliver for investors. For example, AI lending platform Upstart, which has faced significant macro headwinds recently, had significant customer concentration , with two customers combining for more than 80% of revenue in both 2020 and 2021. Prior to the first rate hike in March 2022 and before feeling the effects of the challenging macro in Q2 2022, Upstart had lost more than two-thirds of its value. Forward Growth Rates Are Low Despite strong growth in Q1, both Coinbase and Robinhood's forward revenue growth rates are forecast to slow to a crawl, with sequential growth barely visible, if at all, with minimal single digit growth forecast for 2025 and 2026. Seeking Alpha For Q2, Coinbase is estimated to see revenue decline almost (15%) QoQ, likely driven by softer transaction revenues. Sequential growth is limited through Q1 2025, with revenues estimated to hover around $1.4 billion. Robinhood is in a similar camp, with it estimated to see just $1 million in sequential growth in Q2 before a (6%) sequential decline in Q3. On an annual view, revenue growth for the two is expected to slow dramatically in FY25 and FY26. Robinhood is estimated to report more than 28% revenue growth this year, but in 2025, growth is expected to decelerate 23 percentage points to just 5.3%. Coinbase's revenue deceleration is much more severe, with estimated revenue growth of 81.1% in 2024 projected to decelerate to below 1% growth in 2025. Seeking Alpha This rapid revenue deceleration to the single-digits is expected to persist, with Robinhood forecast to see just 3% revenue growth in 2026, while Coinbase's revenue is expected to decline more than (2%) YoY, pointing to a revenue plateau in the $5.5 to $5.6 billion range. Technical Analysis: Coinbase COIN is in an uptrend that appears to be incomplete. It has been tied to Bitcoin's uptrend, which is even more clearly incomplete. This means that COIN could be setting up for a buying opportunity on the next drop. The larger pattern in play is a diagonal. This is a 5 wave pattern that is characterized by lots of overlap, big swings in both directions, and tends to obey a trend channel. If this is playing out, then Coin base is setting up for a sharp drop into the $185 - $140 region. This drop will be the final swing lower, which will complete wave 4 of 5. We can see a drop as low as $113 and still maintain the diagonal pattern; however, below this level and the odds start favoring that a major top was already struck in March of this year. If we are accurate, like Bitcoin, this dip would be another buying opportunity in an on-going uptrend. The final 5th wave would be generally targeting the $300 - $400 region, if confirmed. This is assuming we hold $113. Author's analysis Robinhood HOOD's chart is not in a healthy position. Note the drop from all-time-highs. This is a direct drop that best resembles a 5 wave pattern. What has followed is an overlapping and messy bounce, which resembles a correction within a larger trend. If this is a developing downtrend, then the initial 5 wave drop is the A wave, the messy bounce is the B wave, which is setting up for a C wave drop, which I would expect to be about the same length as the A wave drop. The final move higher is also quite telling. The last leg of a corrective bounce is always a 5 wave push against the larger trend. You can clearly see 5 waves in place, which takes us into the ideal topping zone for this move. In order for HOOD to start invalidating this setup, we really need to see a strong move above $48.10. On the other hand, if HOOD is in the larger downtrend pattern, then the final leg lower will be a C wave. These are always 5 wave patterns, which appears to be vertical moves. If we see a vertical, 5 wave drop from any high, followed by a messy bounce in the opposite direction, we will have strong confirmation that HOOD is setting up for a larger drop. This is not one we would play from the long side based on what the technical are telling us. Author's analysis Conclusion: Coinbase and Robinhood capitalized on increased crypto volatility in Q1 as crypto prices rose following the approval of spot BTC ETFs in January. Trading volume and transaction revenue growth was stellar for both in the first quarter, but Robinhood's monthly metrics reflect weak MoM growth through Q2 so far, as Dogecoin volume and volatility subsides. Robinhood is overdependent on Dogecoin as a primary driver of crypto trading volume and thus crypto transaction revenue, and with crypto accounting for 20% of overall revenue, it's not something to ignore. Robinhood's exposure to Dogecoin is unusual, and also a risk most investors probably aren't aware of. When you couple these fundamental headwinds with the troubling chart, it seems there could be more trouble for HOOD on the horizon. This is not a stock we would play on the long side. As Bitcoin continues to play out the ongoing bull cycle, we expect COIN to follow. The next high discussed in this writeup is where we will start getting cautious with both Bitcoin and COIN, as both charts suggest an incomplete uptrend. That being said, this drop in COIN appears to be a buying opportunity, as long as the critical support holds that we discussed. Coinbase's April numbers also hint at a possible monthly deceleration to start the quarter. Overall, Q2 is showing signs of decreased trading activity, a headwind to growth, which is expected to be minimal on a sequential basis through the rest of the year. This is certainly showing up in the charts, which suggests more trouble for HOOD is on the horizon. Analyst estimates also point to a difficult growth landscape for the two in 2025 and 2026, with revenue growth expected to decelerate to reside in the low single-digit range. Crypto revenue and key metric growth has been strong off a low base in late 2023 for the two, but revenue is expected to plateau through 2025 and 2026, a challenging thesis for growth investors. This lines up with what the charts are suggesting in the crypto space. As Bitcoin continues to play out its larger uptrend, we expect COIN to follow. The next larger high is where we will start getting cautious with both Bitcoin and HOOD. Until then, this appears to be a buying opportunity, as long as the critical support hold that we discussed.

Despite the bad debt and liquidations, Egorov said he remains committed to ensuring that all users can withdraw their deposits and is focused on making Curve Finance's lending/borrowing products the safest in the industry.  The exploit of UwU Lend on Monday put in motion a series of events that led to Thursday’s multimillion liquidations on DeFi lending giant Curve, representatives for its founder Michael Egorov told CoinDesk over Telegram messages on Friday.  Egorov’s $100 million in loans taken from various protocols using Curve’s CRV tokens started to automatically liquidate on Thursday, sending the token down as much as 30% before it briefly recovered.  The catalyst for the bad debt and liquidations has been traced back to UwU Lend, a crypto protocol that allows users to burrow, lend, and stake tokens.  “On April 15 they (UwU Lend) deployed vulnerable code for new (sUSDe) markets, and those markets are not isolated, so the whole platform takes the risk,” Egorov said. “UwU was hacked, and the hacker, as a part of cash-out play, deposited CRVs taken from UwU to lend.curve.fi (LlamaLend) and disappeared with the funds, leaving his debt in the system.”  UwU Lend lost $20 million on Monday after being hit by a flash loan attack and another $3.7 million on Thursday in a separate attack. As of Friday, it is offering a bounty reward of $5 million to catch the attackers.  In an X post, Egorov estimated bad debt in a particular CRV lending pool at $10 million. While this market is fully isolated from other lending pools, depositors in the CRV could not withdraw their funds as long as the bad debt existed.  However, Egorov said that the situation could help bolster Curve’s security measures and loan mechanisms and could create a better service for users in the coming months.  “Yesterday the system was tested in unthinkable conditions,” Egorov said. “We have a lot to process, but most importantly we have all the information on how to make the safest and the most resilient lending/borrowing ever existed.”  “I am dedicated to ensuring that all users can withdraw their deposits without any hassle. I always think that Curve Finance is my priority, and the most important is our community,” he added.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin wavered near $67,000 early Friday as the crypto market consolidated. BTC is stuck in a sideways channel after previous attempts for rallies earlier this week fizzled out. In a sign of diminishing investor confidence, U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds suffered $226 million of net outflows on Thursday. Fidelity's FBTC led the outflows with only BlackRock's IBIT recording positive, albeit minor, inflows. BTC declined 1.3% over the past 24 hours, while the broader crypto market was also down nearly 1%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).  Bitcoin will hit $1 million within 10 years, brokerage company Bernstein said while setting a massive price target for MicroStrategy. BTC, the largest and oldest crypto asset, could reach a cycle-high of $200,000 by 2025 en route to the 2033 forecast. The firm also initiated coverage for Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR), the biggest corporate owner of bitcoin, setting a price target of $2,890 per share with an outperform rating. That would translate to an almost 100% rally for the stock, which closed Thursday at $1,480.  Former Goldman Sachs executive Connie Shoemaker joined the board of directors of crypto custody firm Anchorage Digital. The company is the only crypto bank chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the U.S. In a Thursday announcement, the company said the addition was part of an effort to “meet rising institutional demand for safe, secure and federally regulated digital asset infrastructure.” Shoemaker was Goldman Sachs’ global head of strategy during the 2008 global financial crisis overseeing the growth of Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), and later served as chief administrative officer.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the seven-day change in open interest (OI)-adjusted cumulative volume delta (CVD) in futures tied to the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market value.  TRX is the only coin to have seen a positive CVD, a sign of new inflows into the market.  A positive CVD means more buyers are in action, while a negative print implies there are more sellers.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Taiwan Crypto Advocacy Body Becomes Formally Active With 24 Entities  U.S. Judge Signs Off on $4.5B Terraform-Do Kwon Settlement With SEC  More Central Banks Are Exploring a CBDC, BIS Survey Finds",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Krisztian Sandor, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/14/first-mover-bitcoin-struggles-near-67000-as-cryptos-lag-behind-stocks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ddec4a3d44aa6506f892018b7b5a678b3511e4c8-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29468729,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624593,1718366457,"Financial Giant AllianceBernstein Predicts Bitcoin At $1 Million, Here’s When","In an analysis released Thursday, leading global investment firm AllianceBernstein with assets under management worth $725 billion significantly elevated its price target for Bitcoin, predicting the premier cryptocurrency will reach $1 million by 2033. This bullish outlook is underscored by a new wave of adoption via US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by heavyweight asset managers including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. Bitcoin’s Path To $1 Million In 2033 Analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra from Bernstein outline a detailed scenario where they expect the assets under management in Bitcoin-related ETFs to escalate to about $190 billion by 2025, a substantial leap from the current $60 billion. The report states, “We believe that the US regulated ETFs were the watershed moment for crypto that brought in structural demand from traditional pools of capital.” They highlighted the considerable impact of these funds, which have already funneled approximately $15 billion in net new flows into the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck: Here Are 2 Things That Must Happen For BTC To Break $72,000 The report extrapolates that by 2025, Bitcoin ETFs will represent about 7% of all Bitcoins in circulation, and by 2033, this figure could rise to around 15% of the total Bitcoin supply. This significant uptick in institutional interest and investment is poised to play a critical role in driving Bitcoin’s price upward. A critical aspect of Bernstein’s analysis is the effect of Bitcoin’s supply mechanics, particularly the halving events. The most recent halving in April cut the block reward for miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively halving the daily new supply from 900 BTC to 450 BTC. According to Chhugani and Sapra, “The halving presents a unique circumstance, where natural Bitcoin sell-pressure from miners declines by half (or even more, as they inventory more in anticipation), while new catalysts for bitcoin demand arise, leading to exponential price moves.” Historically, after halving events, BTC has experienced significant price rallies. The analysts draw on past cycles for context: in 2017, Bitcoin surged to approximately five times its marginal cost of production, then bottomed at 0.8 times in the following year. A similar pattern was observed in the 2021 cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price’s Path To $300,000 Cleared By Massive Bullish Pattern, Says Analyst For the 2024-27 cycle, they project a more conservative yet substantial increase to 1.5 times Bitcoin’s marginal cost of production, translating to a predicted mid-cycle high of $200,000 by mid-2025. In the following cycle, Bernstein expects the Bitcoin price to reach half a million US dollars by 2029, before breaking the $1 million mark four years later. Outlook For MicroStrategy In tandem with their Bitcoin outlook, Bernstein also initiated coverage on MicroStrategy with an outperform rating, targeting a price of $2,890 for the stock by the end of 2025. MicroStrategy has become notable for its BTC acquisition strategy, now holding 214,400 BTC, or 1.1% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply, valued at approximately $14.5 billion. MicroStrategy’s aggressive acquisition of Bitcoin, funded through convertible notes—a form of long-term debt that converts into stock under specific conditions—demonstrates a robust investment strategy which the analysts believe offers “limited liquidation risk” due to the already profitable nature of their holdings based on today’s Bitcoin prices. They foresee MicroStrategy’s holdings increasing to 1.5% of the Bitcoin supply by 2025. At press time, BTC traded at $66,946.

Bitcoin prices have surpassed their 2021 peak and are now around $70,000, and technology/artificial intelligence has revitalized interest in riskier growth assets. The potential spot ether ETF launch is exciting news for both the crypto and the ETF world, but ETF investors interested in crypto have several decisions to make. Some may love crypto and some may hate it, but cryptocurrencies have undeniably shaken up the financial markets. That excitement has spread into the ETF world, which marked a perfect union between cryptocurrency (the new digital frontier) and ETFs (which are typically on the edge of innovation). The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs seemed like a major milestone in this saga. But excitement did not die down after the launch, and talk about spot ether ETFs have kept the momentum going. Many (including myself) believed the spot ether approval would receive relatively little attention. But the current environment has led to continued enthusiasm. Bitcoin prices have surpassed their 2021 peak and are now around $70,000, Roaring Kitty is back, and technology/artificial intelligence has revitalized interest in riskier growth assets. Interest does not always lead to investment. But investors may be ready for something new and exciting. Here's a rundown on spot ether ETFs and what investors need to consider before investing. Spot ether ETFs supported by excitement surrounding cryptocurrency Crypto has had its highs and lows, and the crypto ETF market has also experienced the same. In 2021, interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies coincided with the launch of several crypto equity ETFs, and eventually bitcoin futures ETFs. At the time, this was the closest to spot bitcoin ETF investors could get in the U.S. But hope for potential approval was weak given Grayscale's issues with the SEC. Soon after, in late 2022 and early 2023, crypto ETF market excitement died down along with the price of bitcoin. Several crypto ETFs announced closures, and it had been several months since the launch. Finally, in August, bitcoin excitement returned around the time Grayscale won its case against the SEC. From here, there was a whirlwind of ""good news."" That included the launch of ether futures ETFs in October 2023 and the long-awaited spot bitcoin ETFs launch in January 2024. Thoughts about spot ether ETF approval were mixed. But the SEC approved 19b-4 proposals for eight spot ether ETFs on May 23, 2024. These are expected to launch within weeks to months. (But assuming a similar timeline as spot bitcoin ETFs, likely within the next 90 days.) Most of the same issuers with spot bitcoin ETFs are launching spot ether ETFs Ether ETFs have not officially launched, but after the launch, there could be nine (or more) choices. Like their spot bitcoin counterparts, the greatest differentiating factor will likely be fees. Most of the issuers that launched spot bitcoin ETFs are also in line to launch spot ether ETFs. So, fees could be similar for each spot bitcoin's spot ether counterpart. Assuming most issuers will have fees within the same range, large well-known issuers like iShares and Fidelity may dominate once again. And that's not because of scale, but because these larger name brands create an illusion of safety. That's especially so when investing in a higher-risk asset. Even after five months, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) continue to gather significant interest. On a 1M basis, IBIT ranks 11th and FBTC ranks 15th in flows among 3,566 U.S. ETFs. On a YTD basis, IBIT ranks second (after VOO) and FBTC ranks 6th. While their products were less popular, crypto-focused issuers also benefited from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. They could still see some interest in the spot ether ETF battle. Bitwise, for example, has been very active in the crypto space, with several crypto ETFs, including the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ). Notably, ARK will not be involved in the spot ether space after being active in the crypto space (particularly with crypto equity ETFs) and launching its spot bitcoin product, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) with its partner, 21Shares. 21Shares, which has also been very active in the crypto community, is continuing its plans to launch its spot ether product. Also notable, ProShares - which is best known for launching the first bitcoin futures ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) and the first inverse bitcoin futures ETF, the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITI ) - filed their S-1 for a spot ether ETF on June 11, 2024. While ProShares earned an impressive reputation in the crypto futures ETF market, it did not launch a spot bitcoin product. Many investors may choose bitcoin over ether, but some may want both With spot bitcoin ETFs, we often mention a specific type of retail investor interested in bitcoin who doesn't want to invest directly. ETFs open up a way for these investors to access bitcoin easily in their brokerage accounts. They can do so through well-established entities like BlackRock and Fidelity. These investors are typically interested in bitcoin for several reasons: 1) diversifier and inflation hedge; 2) digital disruption; and 3) exciting returns. If all three of these are found in both bitcoin and ether, most retail investors would not necessarily want to invest in both ether and bitcoin. Although correlations have recently diverged, correlations are still relatively high between the two. That means investors may not have diversification as a reason to invest in both. But that doesn't necessarily mean ether or ether ETFs don't have a place in investor portfolios. Ether and bitcoin have two very different use cases. Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created as an alternative to fiat currency, offering an escape from mainstream financial institutions. Ether, also a digital currency, powers the Ethereum network, which serves as a platform for applications like stablecoins, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and other decentralized applications (dApps). So while bitcoin is more mainstream, ether could potentially have more growth opportunities as its applications grow. No staking in spot ether ETFs is not a surprise Spot ether ETFs don't allow staking, which isn't a big surprise. That is because staking is similar to features offered by securities like receiving interest or dividends. The SEC already had lawsuits with Kraken and Coinbase over this issue. But exchange-traded products in other countries offer ether staking products, so it isn't unheard of outside of the U.S. Canada, which was ahead of the U.S. with its spot bitcoin ETFs, has approved ether ETFs that include staking. 3iQ offers staking in both the 3iQ Ether Staking ETF ((ETHQ)) and the Ether Fund (QETH). Currently, Coinbase's reward for staking ether is 2.7% APY. That's not enough for investors to use ether solely as an income investment. They can get higher income from less risky investments like dividend ETFs, money market funds, or even high-yield savings accounts. But that does give another reason for investors to choose a direct investment in ether over an ETF. So investors interested in ether must decide if additional yield from staking outweighs the ease of accessing ether through an ETF. Bottom line: The potential spot ether ETF launch is exciting news for both the crypto and the ETF world. But ETF investors interested in crypto have several decisions to make: 1) whether the benefits of investing in a spot ether ETF outweigh the benefits of direct investment (e.g., staking); 2) whether an investment in spot ether ETFs could complement an investment in spot bitcoin ETFs or be useful on its own; and 3) how to pick which specific spot ether ETF to invest in.

The FIRS revised the charges so that only Binance, through its local representative, is named.  Nigeria took Binance and its executives to court to answer to money laundering and tax evasion charges after detaining its executives.  Tax charges brought by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) of Nigeria against Binance executives Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla have been dropped.  The FIRS agreed to revise the charges so that only the crypto exchange, through its local representative, is named. Gambaryan, who is now sick, will no longer need to appear in court for the FIRS case and Binance is now the sole defendant. The two executives remain named in a money-laundering case brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.  Binance has been trying to convince Nigerian authorities that Gambaryan does not have decision making powers in the firm, so should not have to represent it in court and should be released. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were detained in February while the country investigated the exchange. Anjarwalla escaped shortly after. Nigeria later took the executives and Binance to court for money laundering and tax evasion charges.  ""This goes to show that both Tigran and Nadeem are not decision makers at Binance, and should never have been detained and charged,"" a family spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Friday. Gambaryan is head of financial crime compliance at Binance; Anjarwalla was a director for the company's Africa operations.  The next hearing in the money-laundering case is scheduled for June 19 ""where the application for an order for the enforcement of fundamental rights will be heard,"" the statement said. The trial is due to resume on June 20. Gambaryan is still detained at Kuje prison.  ""In order for Tigran to be allowed to go home to his family, we are hopeful that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) will take similar steps,"" a Binance spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""Tigran has been detained for 110 days, and his physical health is deteriorating, including a recent malaria and pneumonia diagnosis. Binance is committed to continuing to work with the Nigerian government to resolve this.""  Worsening Conditions  On May 23, Gambaryan collapsed in court from malaria, the statement by the family spokesperson said. Since then, the ""conditions have worsened and Tigran now has pneumonia.""  Despite a court order by Justice Emeka Nwite to take the executive to hospital, the prison authorities took 11 days to take him for a brief check-up and the results of this have not yet been released to his family, the spokesperson said.  ""We really need the U.S. government to intervene more forcefully for the immediate release of an innocent American citizen,"" Tigran's wife Yuki Gambaryan said in the statement. ""This has gone on too long and Tigran's life is at risk.""  Neither the Federal Inland Revenue Service nor the Supreme Court of Nigeria had responded to a request for comment by publication time.

""There's a new wave of dollar strength and demand for equities. Risk asset demand is gradually diminishing, forming a sequence of declining intraday highs for bitcoin,"" shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a Friday email to CoinDesk.  ""Bitcoin continues to test the strength of the 50-day moving average, but it doesn't find enough reason to dive lower. Such persistent testing of the lows sets the bears up for quick success with their next target at $60,000,"" he added.  Miners, or entities that supply extensive computing resources to keep the bitcoin network running, may be among the selling groups, some observers said.  ""Bitcoin's upper potential may be limited due to miners' cash demand,"" shared analysts from Japanese crypto exchange bitBank in an email. ""Since May, bitcoin miners' net position–BTC inflow - BTC outflow–has been gradually declining, suggesting their operation has become tight after the Bitcoin network went through halving in April.""  ""The increasing net BTC outflows from miners do not necessarily put pressure on the price of bitcoin. However, prices tend to stagnate,"" analysts added.  On-chain data cited by CryptoQuant in a Wednesday report showed an increase in the transfer of BTC from mining pools to exchanges – which reached a two-month high on June 9. Selling via professional over-the-counter desks also spiked to the largest daily volume since late March, the firm said.  Bitcoin jumped from $68,000 to $70,000 on Wednesday as May's U.S. CPI came in cooler than expected. However, the price quickly retraced the gains on Thursday after agencies at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced their rate cut forecast for this year from three times to only once.  Major tokens such as BNB Chain's BNB, XRP and Solana's SOL are down more than 10% since Monday, while riskier meme coins such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) have lost 15%.  Such moves came amid continual outflows in U.S.-listed spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have seen a net $500 million leave the 11 products since Monday. This marks their worst week since the end of April when they lost $1.2 billion over six days.  Bitcoin has also seemingly decoupled from the technology index Nasdaq, deviating from its usually positive correlation with this index, which is heavy on technology stocks.  Meanwhile, some market observers said that ether ""looks worse"" than bitcoin in terms of short-term sentiment.  ""Looking at the technicals, both Bitcoin and Ethereum look bearish, but ETH looks worse than BTC,"" Rachel Lin, CEO and co-founder of SynFutures, said in a Telegram message. Unless ETH reclaims the $3,700 level soon, we might see more downside in the coming days and weeks.  ""For BTC, $67,000 remains the crucial level,"" Lin said, adding the long-term outlook remains bullish in her view.",NEGATIVE,BTC | SHIB,BTC | MARKET | MINING | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/14/bitcoin-traders-see-short-term-bearish-target-at-60k-as-miners-pare-holdings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7bd3143c1db79881218d247f8e2d6c37d47379a4-4272x2403.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The building blocks of the industry association were put in place by nine members last year with government approval in 2024 setting the stage for the first formal meeting held on Thursday.  Taiwan's crypto advocacy body, the Taiwan Virtual Asset Service Provider Association, was formally established with a founding meeting of 24 cryptocurrency-related entities, according to an announcement on X and a blog post by the XREX blockchain firm.  The body will aim to act as a bridge as the private sector and the government work together to supervise the industry. Its first task will be to formulate a self-regulation code that covers industry classification, listing and delisting, consumer protection, risk control, transaction monitoring and advertising solicitation, according to the blog post.  The preparations for the establishment of the association began in September, when nine entities came together to kickstart the process.  Taiwan's Interior Ministry approved the formation of the body in line with the law in March 2024 and the founding meeting was held on Thursday. BitoPro founder and CEO Titan Cheng will be the chair and XREX Chief Revenue Officer Winston Hsiao will be the vice chair.  Taiwan has taken steps to introduce legislation to regulate the crypto sector after the FTX scandal forced it to change its earlier fairly hands-off stance.

29465218,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624557,1718360108,Solana Empty Glasses: BEER Coin Fizzles 70% In Alleged Rug Pull,"The Solana blockchain has revealed a sobering story, adding to the turbulence in the bubbly world of memecoins, such as BEER. The coin rose to prominence in recent weeks, experienced a dramatic price swing, and raising concerns about the inherent volatility and risks associated with these internet-driven tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ownership Trends: Short-Term Spike As ETFs Gain Popularity – Report Whales And Rug Pulls: A Recipe For Disaster BEER’s wild ride began with a classic memecoin scenario: a surge in popularity fueled by online hype and community buzz. However, this exuberance masked a lurking danger – the outsized influence of large token holders, often nicknamed “whales.” When several whales decided to cash out, their massive sell orders triggered a domino effect. The price of BEER plummeted a staggering 70% in a matter of hours, pulling the token’s price down from around $0.0003 to $0.0001. Fears of a “rug pull” – a scenario where developers create a memecoin, inflate its price through marketing, and then vanish with investor funds – ran rampant. While the BEER team vehemently denied any wrongdoing, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of memecoins to manipulation by large holders. 🚨 LATEST: Someone sold $10 million worth of Solana Memecoin $BEER (@beercoinmeme), causing its price to drop by 70%. pic.twitter.com/22H5cM5wFq — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) June 13, 2024 Unlike established cryptocurrencies with diverse ownership structures, memecoins often have a high concentration of tokens held by a small group of individuals. This creates an environment where a few whales can significantly impact the price, leading to extreme volatility. BEER Weathers The Storm, But Questions Remain Fortunately for some BEER holders, the token price staged a partial recovery after the initial selloff. However, the damage was done. The incident served as a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with memecoin trading. BEER currently sits nearly 40% lower than its pre-crash price, currently trading at $$0.00026, with a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the horizon. The question of who triggered the sell-off remains unanswered, with the BEER team pointing fingers at presale investors. BEERUSDT trading at $0.00028 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Solana’s Memecoin Boom: A Double-Edged Sword The BEER episode also sheds light on the double-edged sword of Solana’s burgeoning memecoin scene. Solana, known for its faster transaction speeds compared to Ethereum, has become a breeding ground for memecoin developers. Related Reading: Ethereum Longs Crushed! Who Got Burned In The $62 Million Fire Sale? The ease of launching tokens on Solana has attracted a wave of new projects, but it has also led to a potential oversaturation of the market.

42417906,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc00z,1718358829,Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With Nasdaq,"Bitcoin lost 6% in one week even as Nasdaq climbed to an all-time high.  Crypto-specific factors like profit-taking by holders and increased selling by miners seem to be holding back the BTC price.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has declined over 6% in seven days, deviating from its usually positive correlation with the equity market's tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index.  While the popular narrative blames bitcoin's slide on the Federal Reserve's decision to signal just one U.S. interest-rate cut for the rest of the year, technology stocks extended gains after Wednesday's decision, indicating crypto-specific factors may be stopping BTC from keeping pace with the Nasdaq.  ""When a market continues to sell off at a specific level, it has less to do with events, narratives, or fundamentals. Instead, a large seller perceives prices to be overvalued at that level,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said. ""The November 2021 all-time high of nearly 70,000 is a level where long-term holders are willing to sell their Bitcoins, as they are the most likely candidates to cash out.""  Earlier this week, a wallet that had been inactive since 2018 moved 8,000 BTC worth over $500 million to crypto exchange Binance. A move from a wallet to an exchange is often a signal of an impending sale. The wallet reportedly acquired the BTC at less than $4,000.  Data tracked by analytics firm CryptoQuant show that the number of BTC inactive for at least 12 months and two years has declined, a sign of holders have taken profits as the bitcoin price holds near record highs.  ""Addresses with supply inactive for 1 and 2 years have been selling since around price hit record high. This is offsetting accumulation by longer-term holders (+3-year),"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email on Wednesday.  According to Thielen, 1.8 million BTC have not moved for over a decade, potentially including the 1.1 million BTC mined by Satoshi himself. ""This is why we would also expect that most of the Mt. Gox holders will convert their BTC into fiat once they take possession of their BTC in October/November 2024,"" Thielen noted.  Mt. Gox, a crypto exchange that imploded due to a hack in 2014, is gearing toward distributing 142,000 bitcoin (BTC) worth roughly $9.5 billion and 143,000 bitcoin cash (BCH) worth $73 million to creditors, CoinDesk reported in April. A distribution could pose a substantial overhang on digital asset prices. The trustees of the defunct exchange last year set an Oct. 31, 2024 deadline to reimburse creditors.  Another reason for BTC's price weakness could be increased selling by miners, or those responsible for making coins. Miners receive BTC as a reward for approving blocks on the blockchain and additional revenue from user transaction fees.  Listed miner Marathon Digital (MARA) has sold 1,400 bitcoin worth $98 million this month. According to CryptoQuant, miners sold at least 1,200 BTC on June 10 via the over-the-counter desks, the highest single-day volume in over two months.  The hashrate, or the computing power dedicated to the Bitcoin blockchain, has declined from 622 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 599 EH/s this month.

Related Reading: Bitwise Forecasts $20 Trillion Boost To Global GDP From Crypto And AI By 2030 STORM Partners has also partnered with integration companies to drive innovation within the Lightningbox ecosystem. These integration partners have committed significant internal resources and technological expertise to the program, amounting to substantial support in the mid-six figures. Notable early contributors include stablecoin issuer Circle (USDC), cybersecurity provider Hacken, MultiversX’s infrastructure, and law firm Walder Wyss. Lightningbox aims to transform ideas into reality through a four-phase development process. Starting with brainstorming and workshops, the initiative progresses through observation and improvements, industry and community feedback, and concludes with testing and private launch campaigns. Decentral House’s Web3-focused Corporate Innovation Day served as the platform for the announcement, bringing together industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and representatives from global brands such as eBay, UNHCR, Hublot, BBVA, and UNICEF. As mentioned, prominent blockchain projects such as Cardano, Mina Protocol, MultiversX, and Hedera were also represented, underscoring the importance of the event and Switzerland’s willingness to promote crypto and blockchain adoption. Geneva As A Global Blockchain Hub? Sheraz Ahmed, Managing Partner of STORM Partners, was enthusiastic about the announcement. He highlighted the need to strengthen the blockchain industry by providing a hub for “bright minds and disruptive projects” in the decentralized applications (dApps) space. It was also announced that STORM Partners will be located at Decentral House in Geneva, considered the epicenter of a large ecosystem that fosters community, collaboration, and the growth of blockchain technology. Ahmed, who is also the founder of Decentral House, said: Geneva has a rich history of innovation and global institutions; it is the ideal place to fuel this digital transformation. Local organizations that strive for global impact, such as the World Economic Forum, the United Nations, and many private banks, make Geneva the perfect location to steer and amplify the growth of blockchain worldwide Related Reading: VC Firm Paradigm Secures $850 Million For Crypto Projects In Latest Fundraise The launch event witnessed the participation of esteemed speakers who praised the Lightningbox initiative.

MicroStrategy initiated as outperform with a $2,890 price target at Bernstein.  The software company's long-term convertible debt strategy means it has time to benefit from bitcoin upside with limited liquidation risk to the crypto on its balance sheet, the report said.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} is likely to hit $1 million by 2033 and reach a cycle-high of $200,000 by 2025, Bernstein said as it initiated coverage of software developer MicroStrategy, the biggest corporate owner of the largest cryptocurrency, with an outperform rating.  MicroStrategy now owns 1.1% of the global supply of the world’s largest cryptocurrency, worth about $14.5 billion, having transformed itself from a small software company in the space of four years, the broker said in a research report on Thursday.  Bernstein initiated coverage of the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company with a $2,890 price target. The shares closed at around $1,484 on Thursday. The Nasdaq-listed firm currently holds 214,400 bitcoin. It began buying the cryptocurrency in 2020, adopting it as a reserve asset.  The company’s founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, “has become synonymous with brand bitcoin and has positioned MSTR as a leading bitcoin company, attracting at-scale capital (both debt and equity) for an active bitcoin acquisition strategy,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  Microstrategy positions itself as an “active leveraged bitcoin strategy versus passive spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs),” the report said, noting that over the last four years the company’s active strategy has produced a higher bitcoin per equity share.  The broker's BTC price forecast is driven by the unprecedented demand from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and because supply of the cryptocurrency is constrained. Bernstein now estimates that bitcoin could reach $500,000 by 2029. The 2025 estimate was raised from $150,000.  MicroStrategy’s long-term convertible debt strategy means it has enough time to benefit from potential bitcoin upside with limited liquidation risk to the cryptocurrency on its balance sheet, the report added.

During the podcast, hosted by Tony Edwards, Hoskinson discussed various outreach efforts made to Musk’s companies, including offers of free work to combat bot issues on the platform formerly known as Twitter, now X. Hoskinson Denies Rumors Of A Partnership With Musk Hoskinson detailed several attempts by his team to connect with Musk’s companies, particularly X (formerly Twitter), where they proposed solutions to combat prevalent issues like fake accounts and bots. “We’ve reached out numerous times to try to engage with various people at X, even offering to do free work with verified tweets or other things just because it’s so bad right now with bots and these other things, and it’s just always silent,” Hoskinson lamented. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano Price Will Rally 370% To $2, Here’s The Timeline Despite these efforts, he confirmed that Musk has never discussed Cardano or any potential collaboration personally. “I even know Kimbal Musk and I’ve talked to him on several occasions never once has [Elon] mentioned Cardano or me or anything,” he added. The founder’s comments served to quash rumors that had suggested potential uses of Cardano’s technologies, like the Midnight sidechain, in Musk’s high-profile companies such as SpaceX or Tesla. The speculative excitement around such a high-caliber partnership had been a point of discussion among investors and enthusiasts, given Musk’s known interest in cryptocurrency and his impactful endorsements of Dogecoin. Despite sharing mutual friends and professional connections such as podcaster Lex Friedman, Hoskinson expressed confusion and a bit of melancholy over the lack of engagement from Musk. “We share mutual friendships so I don’t know why we haven’t been able to square that circle […] maybe he’s got some people in his social circle that don’t like me and so he’s got some intel that I’m a bad person to work with or maybe it’s just he wants to do his own thing,” Hoskinson speculated. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Headed For Reversal? Analyst Eyes $0.50 As Turning Point Addressing Musk’s enigmatic persona and unpredictable business moves, Hoskinson noted, “He’s a magical guy. So it’s really like a sphinx hard to understand his motivations and understand why he does what he does. Why does he have this bizarre fetish for Dogecoin? Is it that he owns 20% of the supply…don’t know with a guy like that that’s the magic of Elon Musk.” Cardano Bears Remain In Control The ADA price saw a decrease of 2.2% over the last 24 hours, a dip that coincides with a broader downtrend in the altcoin market. Trading volume for ADA decreased also significantly, falling 22% to $357 million over the same period. The ADA price has consistently traded below the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which has acted as a key resistance level since mid-March. While there was a brief period where ADA surpassed this threshold, it eventually faced strong resistance at the 200-day EMA and was unable to sustain its upward momentum. As such, the 20-day EMA, currently at $0.445, is a critical near-term resistance level. Surpassing this barrier could signal a potential shift in market sentiment, paving the way for a rally towards the 200-day EMA at $0.494. A decisive break above this longer-term EMA could firmly establish a bullish trend for ADA.

DOGE failed to continue higher and started a fresh decline below $0.1450 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.1420 support level and the 100-hourly simple moving average.

Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $0.1425 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair.

The bulls are now protecting the $0.140 support zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1337 swing low to the $0.1505 high. If there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $0.1420 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1450 level.

Analyst Predicts Over 50% Surge For SOL If This Key Support Holds,"As the cryptocurrency market experiences its typical ebb and flow, Solana (SOL) draws particular attention from analysts who anticipate significant movements in its price. Currently, Solana is trading just below $150, but recent analyses suggest a potential for a substantial increase. Related Reading: Solana’s Tough Climb: SOL Price Struggles to Find Solid Ground Solana Eyes Major Surge As Key Technical Patterns Emerges According to well-known crypto analyst Ali, Solana would surge higher by 53%, with Ali pointing to an ascending triangle pattern that could be a sign of a coming bull rally. This pattern is usually bullish, indicating that Solana could see significant gains if it can keep its momentum going and break above this upper resistance level. On Solana’s chart, Ali recommends watching $143 support and $178 resistance in the short term. Such levels are important in defining the short-term direction of the asset in the market. #Solana is set for a major 53% price move! Keep an eye on the $143 support and $178 resistance levels to gauge the direction of the $SOL trend. pic.twitter.com/SB9tJ6D02u — Ali (@ali_charts) June 12, 2024 The support could turn resistance and vice versa. If the price holds from the support or breaks past the resistance, this would trigger the anticipated bullish price action. Ali said such a breakout from those technical levels could spur more than 50% higher in Solana’s market value, aligning with how other assets have behaved with similar patterns seen previously. Currently trading just above $146, Solana has experienced a 7.6% drop, adding to a nearly 20% loss from the previous week. A prominent crypto analyst commented on this trend, suggesting that Solana will likely continue experiencing fluctuations between $185 and $120, indicating a prolonged consolidation phase. This stabilization is viewed as a natural correction following its recent significant rally. The analyst remains optimistic about the future, “expecting bigger things later.” $SOL: I think SOL is just going to keep chopping around personally between $185 and $120. It’s a big range overall but I think we just continue to see a prolonged period of consolidation. It’s healthy to see this after that huge run to be honest, expecting bigger things later pic.twitter.com/aGNtVnBgDP — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) June 12, 2024 Network Activity Fuels Optimism The optimism for Solana’s price increase is not solely based on technical analyses. NewsBTC has recently cited on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, which shows that daily active addresses on Solana increased by about 1.1 million on the 11th of June. This type of high level of network activity usually foreshadows price increases since it suggests an increased use case and actual adoption by users. The cultural impact on Solana’s market position is also noteworthy. So far, not only investors have eyed the network, but also celebs – Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, Caitlyn Jenner, and Andrew Tate have all hit the platform, among others.

The study by analyst Juan Leon highlights the potential magnitude of this synergy, which is expected to surpass current expectations. The annual Consensus conference in Austin further underscored the significance of this trend, with industry experts discussing its wide-ranging implications, from tokenization and regulation to monetary policy and Bitcoin ETFs. Convergence Of AI And Crypto According to Bitwise’s analyst, the AI boom led by companies like Nvidia has propelled the market cap of the world’s leading AI chip producer above $3 trillion, making it the second-largest public company globally. However, Leon contends that this boom has created “an unprecedented shortage” of data centers, AI chips, and electricity access as the race for AI supremacy intensifies. AI companies are turning to Bitcoin miners, who possess the necessary resources—powerful chips, top cooling systems, and supporting infrastructure—to process and store vast amounts of data to address this issue. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Headed For Reversal? Analyst Eyes $0.50 As Turning Point The report further highlights recent developments, such as CoreWeave’s offer to acquire Core Scientific and their subsequent partnership, exemplify the growing collaboration between miners and AI providers. For the analyst, the convergence of AI and cryptocurrency opens up longer-term prospects that warrant attention. One such area is information validation, where the accessibility, transparency, and immutability of public blockchains can counter potential AI abuses. Startups like Attestiv leverage blockchain technology to create digital fingerprints for videos, enabling verification of their authenticity and combating the prevalence of “deep fakes.” This application can extend to validating research, government communications, and more, offering essential checks and balances on AI-generated content. The Perfect Pair? Another promising intersection, according to Bitwise, lies in the realm of virtual assistants. While AI-powered assistants like Siri and Alexa introduced in Apple devices have become “increasingly versatile,” Leon contends that their capabilities can be further enhanced by integrating them with smart contracts and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or stablecoins. The analyst points out that this potential integration would enable secure and efficient execution of complex tasks, boosting productivity and expanding the potential of AI-driven virtual assistants. PwC projects that AI and cryptocurrency could individually contribute $15.7 trillion and $1.8 trillion to the global economy by 2030. However, Leon states that their integration’s “synergistic effects” could result in a compounding effect, potentially driving the combined value to $20 trillion or beyond.

Notably, this extended phase of stability, which is now the longest in Bitcoin’s history, has been seen as the calm before a significant price storm by some crypto analysts. Crypto analysts like Mags have been particularly vocal about the potential shifts in Bitcoin’s price trajectory, detailing a five-step roadmap that could signal major future gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ownership Trends: Short-Term Spike As ETFs Gain Popularity – Report Bitcoin’s Path Towards Higher Prices This roadmap, as outlined by Mags, sketches a cycle of breaking past, retreating, and then firmly establishing new support levels above Bitcoin’s all-time high (ATH). So far, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed its previous ATH of 2021, positioning it at a critical juncture that could precede another substantial price rally. According to Mags, this reclamation stage is critical as it sets the stage for the potential upward trajectory, aligning with historical data suggesting that prolonged consolidations often lead to explosive movements. Despite the bearish sentiments reflected in the past week’s 6.8% decline and a 4.2% drop over the last 24 hours, bringing Bitcoin to $66,767, analysts remain optimistic about its long-term prospects. Mags emphasizes that the market could witness a significant rally once Bitcoin exits this consolidation range. #Bitcoin Roadmap for next few months 🤝 1) Price breaks out above ATH 2) Price finds support above ATH 3) Price breaks down below ATH 4) Price reclaims the ATH (we are here) 5) Price continues Higher pic.twitter.com/fVOvf0FiW4 — Mags (@thescalpingpro) June 13, 2024 Expert Strategies For Navigating Bitcoin Next Big Leap Mag’s viewpoint is supported by RektCapital, which notes the importance of synchronization with historical post-halving cycles, suggesting that a premature breakout could shorten the expected bull run. Gert van Lagen’s recent findings further enrich the analytical perspective. According to van Lagen, the Bitcoin price chart forms a ‘Cup with Handle’ pattern on the 3-day chart, a bullish signal traditionally heralded for its reliability in predicting substantial price increases. His analysis suggests that Bitcoin could surge to as high as $300,000 if the pattern holds. Van Lagen’s observations have added a layer of technical validation to the optimistic forecasts, reinforcing the sentiment that significant gains could be on the horizon.

Increased Venture Capital Interest In The Industry Paradigm’s previous investments include prominent projects like decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap and Optimism, a scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. According to Bloomberg, with the capital raised in the latest funding round, Paradigm aims to contribute to early-stage crypto work and plans to prioritize such projects in the future. Related Reading: Solana On-Chain Indicators Suggests A Return Of Bullish Sentiment, Is It Time To Buy SOL? The latest fundraising comes after Paradigm’s notable achievement in 2021 when it secured a $2.5 billion fund, the largest-ever crypto investment vehicle at that time. The current surge in interest and confidence within the venture capital community towards the crypto industry has led to increased funds focused on cryptocurrency strategies. Paradigm’s fundraising success reflects the growing market appetite for crypto investments. Recent developments, such as the introduction of Bitcoin ETF and the impending approval of ETFs centered around Ethereum, have fueled the industry’s expansion. Hivemind Capital Joins Paradigm In Venture Funding Race Paradigm is not the only venture firm seeking to raise funds within the crypto space. Hivemind Capital, for instance, is actively raising a specialized $50 million non-fungible token (NFT) fund. Hack VC, which previously announced a $150 million fund, is also exploring opportunities to raise over $100 million for another investment vehicle. These initiatives highlight the increasing interest and confidence in the potential of the crypto industry from venture capitalists. While Paradigm faced criticism, including temporarily removing cryptocurrency references from its website, the firm rectified the situation and reaffirmed its commitment to the industry. Fred Ehrsam transitioned from managing partner to general partner at the firm in October, further solidifying Paradigm’s dedication to fostering crypto innovation. Despite setbacks, Paradigm continues to support crypto projects actively. Recently, the firm led an investment round in Merkle Manufactory, a company responsible for developing software infrastructure for the Farcaster social media network. The funding round valued Merkle Manufactory at approximately $1 billion, underscoring Paradigm’s ongoing belief in the potential and value of the crypto industry. Related Reading: Memecoin Fight: DADDY Surpasses MOTHER Despite Insider Trading Activity Allegations Overall, Paradigm’s successful fundraising efforts for its third fund demonstrate investors’ continued interest and confidence in supporting early-stage cryptocurrency projects.

This follows crypto analyst Kevin’s (formerly Yomi OG) analysis of Dogecoin, in which he highlighted an important indicator that has turned bullish for the crypto token. Dogecoin Indicator Turns Green For The First Since 2020 Kevin mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the 12-day time frame on the Gaussian channel just recently flipped green on Dogecoin’s chart for the first time since December 2020. He claimed that this indicates a “potential strong bullish trend” is on the cards for the meme coin in the coming months. Related Reading: Historical Trends Suggest Shiba Inu Price Will Rally 1,000% To $0.00024, Analyst Reveals When Kevin added that this indicator has never failed in indicating these trend changes, suggesting that Dogecoin has indeed undergone a bullish reversal. In another X post, Kevin claimed that Dogecoin has looked much stronger than most altcoins throughout this period, during which the crypto market has continued to bleed and trade sideways. He added that Dogecoin will likely move into the golden pocket at the $0.26 to $0.33 range if it can stay above the Macro 0.382 FIB and the blue support zone on the weekly time frame. Kevin also provided another bullish narrative for Dogecoin in another X post. Looking at the four-hour time frame chart, he highlighted a deviation back into the larger symmetrical triangle, which he claimed is a “bullish sign.” He stated that Dogecoin getting back above key moving averages will be important. He also added that he expects the foremost meme coin to test the $0.175 price level at some point, as there is a lot of liquidity in that price range. The crypto analyst also hammered on liquidity at that price area. He claimed there is a “very big block of liquidity” at the $0.175 level, looking at the 3-month time frame. Additionally, he said that most of the liquidity beyond that level is between the $0.20 to $0.23 range. This is bullish for Dogecoin, as Kevin noted that market makers like to move where the liquidity is, and it is definitely higher for Dogecoin at the moment. DOGE’s Next Move Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto recently mentioned that Dogecoin has reached a ‘make it or break it’ level. He, however, seemed confident that Dogecoin could experience an upward trend from its current price level, noting that the meme coin had reached this ‘make it or break it’ level when Bitcoin hit its range lows. As such, he expects Dogecoin to enjoy a price rebound if the flagship crypto experiences a bullish reversal.
