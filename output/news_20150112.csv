42398128,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWJZ,1421103636,"Bitcoin App Enables Cash Withdrawals at 10,000 Spanish ATMs","UPDATE (13 January 2015 15:56 BST): Article has been updated with fee information.      Bit2Me has launched an app that enables its users to convert bitcoins into euros at more than 10,000 ATMs across Spain.  The Bit2Me mobile and desktop app taps into the existing ATM infrastructure using Hal-Cash, a bank service that allows users to send money to any mobile phone to be withdrawn from an ATM.  Bit2Me hopes to facilitate widespread access to digital currency in Spain by offering rapid fiat currency conversion.    Leif Ferreira, Bit2Me founder, said:      ""Bit2Me is an easy way for new users to probe cryptocurrencies by converting bitcoin into euros anywhere in Spain, without registration and from a mobile device.""              Bit2Me has confirmed plans to expand its services abroad, hooking up to a network of approximately 15,000 ATMs in Mexico.      However, Ferreira insists the main objective is ""to become Spain's point of call for converting bitcoins into euros by building a solid and strong service"".    How it works  The app requires that users enter the desired amount of euros they wish to withdraw at an ATM, and the telephone number to which the service will send a verification code.  The bitcoins that the user needs to pay and the receiving address then appear on the app.  Once the payment has been confirmed, the user receives another code sent by text message. To complete the withdrawal, the user enters both codes into the ATM. Users can locate the nearest participating ATM by searching on the Hal-Cash website.  The app's apparent speed and ease of use as well as the accessible nature of the service have been highlighted as its main advantages.  Commission rates    Like most bitcoin ATM services, Bit2Me commission fees are higher than more traditional alternatives. As such, CoinDesk found some concern among Spain's bitcoin community over Bit2Me's planned cost structure.      Currently Bit2Me is running a special offer charging its users a 1% commission per transaction. As of February, the service will incur a variable charge based on the withdrawn amount. For example, if a user withdraws €100 they will be charged a 4% fee. Fees of €1.5 are also applied by the user's bank.      Jorge Ordovas, a Spanish bitcoin enthusiast, said:      ""The fee is somewhat high compared to other alternatives, but the high number of available and easily accessible ATMs might make it worth it.""              Ferreira admitted that Bit2Me's costs are somewhat high, saying ""it is not the cheapest option out there, [but] it is the easiest and fastest way of converting bitcoin into euros"".      Daniel Diez, a Spanish startup mentor and cryptocurrency expert, added that although the current fees are high, Bit2Me is still in its early stages and should be able to adapt its pricing to the response of its users.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/12/bitcoin-app-enables-cash-withdrawals-at-10000-spanish-atms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/391f5164cf952871a9315bba7e022563ccda7d2c-1500x1049.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398115,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSr5,1421100949,Data Center Operator Sues CoinTerra for $5.4 Million in Damages,"UPDATE (13th January 22:00 BST): This piece has been updated with a statement from CoinTerra regarding the lawsuit filed by C7.      CoinTerra is being sued by a Utah data center operator for alleged breach of contract and $1.4m in unpaid services.  In court documents, C7 Data Centers alleges that former partner CoinTerra acted in bad faith by intentionally underpaying for services and demonstrating a pattern of late repayment. In total, C7 is seeking $5.4m in damages, court fees and related charges.  The court filings follow unconfirmed reports that CoinTerra is seeking to resolve problems with unknown senior debt holders.  CoinDesk spoke to C7 CEO Wes Swenson, who confirmed the lawsuit and said that his company initially sought to solve the situation internally.  Swenson said:  “We had filed suit against them, which is public, for non-payment over 60 days. So, their services were suspended with no attempt to solve that. We went ahead and filed suit for that non-payment, plus the breach of contract for the remaining contract.”  Swenson added that other data centers servicing CoinTerra have experienced payment problems, but said he wasn’t sure if other firms have taken similar action.  Breach of contract  According to court documents, CoinTerra signed an 18-month agreement with C7 in early April to provide data center colocation and hosting services. The company was also contracted to manage and oversee the data centers, with C7 arguing in court that it incurred $12,000 in daily electrical costs as a direct result of its deal with CoinTerra, as well as additional expenses to meet the company's operational demands.  C7 alleges CoinTerra soon became delinquent on payments despite what it argues was the company's ability to meet those obligations.  The document states:  “Almost immediately after entering into the contract, CoinTerra fell delinquent, often paying less than the amount required to bring it current. Upon information and belief, CoinTerra often had revenue sufficient to make larger payments to C7.""  According to C7, CoinTerra was issued weekly invoices about the late payments. Swenson said that the company rebuffed his firm’s efforts to come to an agreement on those charges.  “We did try a remediation process,” he said. ""We did try a remediation process [where] they continue mining but be paying us in the meantime, but they didn’t attempt to resolve it that way.”  CoinTerra issues statement on lawsuit  CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar has sent the following statement to CoinDesk regarding the lawsuit filed by C7:  ""CoinTerra, Inc. (“CoinTerra”) disputes the allegations in the complaint filed by C7 Data Centers, Inc. (“C7”) in Utah State court. CoinTerra has recently retained local counsel to address this dispute. Moreover, CoinTerra has filed a counterclaim against C7 in Federal Court in the District of Utah. CoinTerra intends to vigorously prosecute its claims against C7 while defending the claims levied by C7. Yet, CoinTerra is hopeful that the parties can resolve this matter quickly.""

42398117,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSv1,1421092832,CEX.io Halts Cloud Mining Service Due to Low Bitcoin Price,"Bitcoin mining service CEX.io has announced it will suspend its cloud mining activities.  The company stated in a 12th January blog post that it is no longer profitable, blaming declining revenues amid a dropping bitcoin price. CEX chief information officer Jeffrey Smith told CoinDesk that operations would resume if the price of bitcoin climbs above $320, calling the move “temporary”.  The suspension comes after CEX customers experienced disruptions to their cloud mining service, which the company at the time attributed to third-party complications. Smith said that the two issues are unrelated; that the economic impact of a drop in bitcoin prices cut into its ability to offer its clients profitable mining services.  Indications from CEX’s forums suggest that customers were informed over the weekend about both the risk of unprofitability as well as stipulations in the customer terms of service related to potential stoppages. On Friday, a CEX spokesperson cited the former when asked about reported customer compensation issues.  Smith told CoinDesk:  “Our decision is based on the fact that we pay for maintenance in [US dollars], and mine bitcoins, and if you do the math – you will see that with the next mining difficulty rise – maintenance costs will be greater than the profit from mining.”  No broader company impact  According to CEX, the company will continue to honor customer balances for cloud hashing power and previous discussions to secure cheaper resources will continue. Smith added that clients will also have the option to turn on their cloud mining capacity should they choose.  Smith acknowledged that CEX had foreseen the risk of unprofitable mining, and said that the company is actively seeking solutions to both address the problems related to its cloud mining unit, as well as continue to push development of both its cryptocurrency exchange and mining pool, GHash.io.  “Now we are going to concentrate all our resources on building out the best crypto exchange and on the search of hardware providers and cheap electricity,” he said.  He added that CEX has no plans to significantly adjust its operational strategy in the wake of the cloud mining suspension, though he noted that the company could be impacted in the long term as it moves to diversify its services.  Customers react  Smith’s announcement on Twitter elicited a response from observers and customers, prompting some to speculate about CEX’s future and what led to the cloud mining stoppage.  Signs from the CEX marketplace for hashing power suggest that some customers may be selling their holdings in the wake of the suspension. Questions have also been raised about whether or not other companies that offer cloud mining services have been impacted by the recent drop in the price of bitcoin.  News of the suspension among the wider community has been met by a mixture of dismay and frustration. On the company’s official forum, one customer said that the suspension should have been put in place before the problems worsened, writing:  “Maintenance costs are just too high. No profit can be made. Heck, I was losing money by owning GHs from CEX. Even worse, I sold all of my GHs and, because I had additional hashing power from referrals, I was still losing money.”  “I have faith that CEX will rebound from this,” the user added. “But, these exorbitant fees have got to change otherwise it'll be the end of CEX.”  Images via CEX.io, Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/12/cexio-halts-cloud-mining-service-due-to-low-bitcoin-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e790eec79ff2755c5b986155ef467ab60eae5814-1000x758.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398111,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSp7,1421088035,Inside Buttercoin's Drive to Shape the US Bitcoin Marketplace,"The way the community thinks about the bitcoin network is wrong, at least in the eyes of Buttercoin CEO Cedric Dahl. Maybe he won’t say it exactly, but it’s there, in the words he uses to describe the US-based “bitcoin marketplace” he heads, and the words he doesn’t.  At face value, Buttercoin’s market approach may seem simple – it’s a place where you can buy and sell bitcoin. But to Dahl, it’s a subtle but sizable change in the way we think about financial services enabled by both bitcoin and the Internet.  Take, for example, the business he most often cites in conversation, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the e-commerce giant’s cloud computing platform for enterprise businesses. Though AWS’ revenue figures are not publicly available, estimates suggests it earns $3bn each year by removing the pain points that used to make the launch of websites prohibitive.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, Dahl explained that he sees Buttercoin as providing a similar service to US bitcoin businesses, only instead of hosting computer servers and supporting infrastructure, it will extend its ability to buy and sell bitcoin to other businesses to form the underlying platform for the bitcoin economy in the same way. Notably absent is any comparison to a business that would perform traditional financial services, with Dahl preferring to keep the conversation in terms of the web.  By achieving its vision, Dahl argued his 10-person company can provide what the bitcoin ecosystem truly needs, a way for new entrepreneurs to quickly launch new businesses.  Dahl explained:  ”It took us 18 months to be able to do this, and we’ve had fantastic backers. For the average developer out there, they don’t have a lot of options, but by providing these options, we feel strongly that we’re going to be able to increase the amount of innovation in the bitcoin space – specifically in the US.”  If Dahl sounds confident, his business’ resume has the credentials to color his conversation. Buttercoin’s investors include Google Ventures, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Wedbush Securities and Y Combinator – and figures show it has raised upwards of $1.25m to date.  Moreover, Buttercoin today is operating in a US bitcoin market that has still yet to see the proliferation of trading platforms. With New York’s BitLicense still in limbo, the US is home to just a handful of businesses that provide buying and selling services to other businesses and institutions, including Coinsetter and Mirror (formerly Vaurum).  Rule of threes  The number three seems to reappear in conversation, whether Dahl’s talking about the “three tiers” under which existing bitcoin businesses fall or the company’s own market strategy, which he divides into dinner courses – appetizer, dinner and dessert. Having formally launched in November, Buttercoin is currently in the appetizer phase, he said.  “Appetizer is all about bitcoin marketplace, make sure we’re able to provide a large amount of liquidity to bitcoin businesses and foundational services, really empower businesses to build on top of us,” Dahl stated.  During this phase, Buttercoin is running a variety of what Dahl called pilot programs, where select companies and developers have been allowed into the ecosystem to begin building on its platform.  “It’s a closed garden, we’ve invited about a dozen people, and I know you know them all, and this is part of us just operating quietly,” Dahl asserted.  Dahl explained that Buttercoin has been relatively silent about its partners, but that this is consistent with its goal of falling into the background. Though the interview finds Dahl in the middle of a “press push”, he views discretion as part of his company’s strategy:  “We want to let the brands that decide to work with us decide when they’re comfortable doing so, so people get to keep their brands front and center.”  Main course  Once its place in the US is established, Buttercoin plans to build similar marketplaces around the world, catering to businesses and large institutions while remaining in the background.  Dahl cautions that the company is not there yet, but that should it be able to take the technical and compliance burden off global startups, it is likely to find success wherever it decides to take its model.  “When you think about bitcoin wallets, most of them get the majority of their volume from marketplaces like ours,” he said.  It’s here where the concept of Buttercoin, and other marketplaces, as a foundation comes into play. On top is Buttercoin’s target demographic, the payment processors, bitcoin wallets and mining groups – as well as businesses that are more universal in their market approach.  Lastly, there are more mainstream payment processors, those who have recently sought partnerships with businesses in the second tier like PayPal or Stripe.  But, while in the US the top two layers are already developing, Dahl argues the first layer has been hampered by a variety of factors, leading US businesses to turn to overseas exchanges such as Bitstamp, which most recently suffered a $5m hack that analysts suggest could have been worse.  “If you think about the ecosystem in these three layers, then everyone is dependant on marketplaces and there is no good marketplace in the US,” he said. “What that means is if you’re a bitcoin wallet or a merchant processor, you’re going to have to wait weeks to turn bitcoin into cash or cash into bitcoin.”  By contrast, he said Buttercoin can reduce this timeline to days, removing yet another pain point for its customers.  Proof of work  While Buttercoin will clearly attract interest by providing a stable place to buy and sell bitcoin, it remains unclear just how the company will be affected by the larger questions that still hang over the US sector of the industry.  Though he doesn’t use the same term to describe Buttercoin, he does view the platform as being a competitor to the international bitcoin exchanges that currently serve US entities. Dahl also declined to talk about regulation, an issue that has emerged as one of the major topics of discussion in the industry.  Still, there is evidence Dahl’s interpretation of the bitcoin ecosystem is finding favor with customers. Bitcoin processing giant BitPay and distributed mining company MegaBigPower, for example, have been vocal about their use of the platform.  The development, as well as what Dahl claims is the steady growth the company is seeing, lead him to be confident that, at a time when his competitors are struggling, Buttercoin has found the right combination to thrive in a difficult market.  “Very few companies have figured out how to make this work, and those that have don’t really have a lot of incentive to to enable other people to use what they built,” he said. “Not only have we built something that works, but we have the right incentive position to let everybody build on top of us.”  For the time being, however, Buttercoin’s focus will be on the kind of slow growth that it hopes will encourage the wider development of the bitcoin ecosystem.  “Right now, we’re just happy doing what we can to make sure we have healthy volume on the system and over time,” Dahl concluded.

42398110,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSn9,1421076095,Bitcoin 'Vault' Elliptic Meets Global Auditing Standard,"Digital currency storage service Elliptic has obtained ISAE 3402 accreditation – a global standard for financial reporting – from auditing specialist KPMG.  The ISAE 3402 Type 1 or SOC1/2 review scrutinises various aspects of a business, including financial controls, regulatory compliance including AML and KYC measures, financial controls, code deployment, disaster recovery, segregation of duties and offline bitcoin storage techniques.  The UK-based storage provider says it is the first bitcoin company to receive the accreditation and that ISAE 3402 indicates that the firm operates with the ""same standards as a conventional custodian bank"".  Elliptic  , which provides services to investment funds and trading houses, explained that the successful review demonstrates security and regulatory compliance, as well as the robustness of its bitcoin storage solution.  Accreditation 'important milestone'  Elliptic CEO James Smith explained why the accreditation from one of the 'Big Four' accounting firms is so significant for the company:  “We pride ourselves on understanding and respecting the complexities of regulated financial systems. KPMG’s accreditation is an important milestone, as it demonstrates our commitment to delivering both best-in-class technology and deep operational expertise.”  Smith added that Elliptic is “absolutely confident” in its technology, but went on to note that a bitcoin storage company needs to offer more than its own confidence.  “This report demonstrates to our customers that we have the rigorous internal processes and controls expected of any traditional financial services provider,” he said. “Combined with our comprehensive insurance protection, they provide the robust infrastructure required for institutional involvement in digital currencies.”  Elliptic’s focus on security  Since its inception and launch a year ago, Elliptic has tried to differentiate itself by offering “deep cold storage” techniques for bitcoin, backed by insurance ""providing protection against theft of stored bitcoins"".  After an early attempt to gain cover from Lloyds of London broke down, the company was forced to look for alternative insurance providers and eventually managed to insure its holdings through insurance brokers CBC Insurance.  A few months later, in July 2014, Elliptic managed to secure $2m in seed funding from Octopus Investments.

42398119,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSwz,1421074331,Markets Weekly: Questions for Bitcoin Price After Torrid Week,"It's been a tough week for the bitcoin price.  Trading closed on 5th January at $272.95, losing 2.78% over the week to end on 11th January at $265.37, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  With prices trading below $300 for the first time in a year, Bitstamp revealed that it had lost $5m in coins during a security breach. It pulled the plug on trading for four days as its team scrambled to migrate its systems and introduce new security measures.  During the outage, punters drew comparisons to the suspension of trading at Mt Gox, which signalled the end of that once dominant venue for cryptocurrency trading. While Bitstamp management issued updates on their efforts to get the platform back online, the exchange also missed self-imposed deadlines for the resumption of services, adding to the worried speculation.  Trading volumes rise  Despite last week's weekend price crash and the outage at one of the largest USD/BTC exchanges, total trading volume across exchanges rose. Data from Bitcoinity shows a 10% increase in traded volume, from 2.25 million coins in the week ending 4th Jan to 2.49 million coins for the most recent seven-day period.  Some exchanges appeared to have reaped the rewards of the four-day Bitstamp outage. ANXBTC showed a 75% increase in traded volume, compared to a week earlier with 87,000 coins changing hands there. Bitfinex, which regularly sees more traded volume than Bitstamp, recorded a 30% increase in volume, or 203,652 coins traded. BTC-e also displayed a rise in volume, albeit by a smaller proportion of 18% to 60,000 coins traded.  With even the largest and most reputable exchanges vulnerable to being taken offline by hackers, at least some bitcoiners appear to have reverted to a less centralised way of converting their coins. The second-largest volume gainer in percentage terms however was LocalBitcoins, the peer-to-peer trading platform. LocalBitcoins saw a 46% jump in traded volume in the last week with 18,759 bitcoins changing hands there.  Even with the Bitstamp outage this week, the price shed only about $7 or 2.8% week-on-week. The biggest intra-day swing for the week took place on 7th January while Bitstamp was down. The price achieved a high of $300.30 and a low of $282.06, making gains for the day.  Where does price go from here?  To put this in perspective, devoted bitcoin watcher Martin Tillier at the Nasdaq's trading blog points out that the US dollar has been devalued by the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing measures to the tune of about 10%. Bitcoin meanwhile has only grown in utility since the halcyon days of its storming bull-run at the end of 2013. That run started at around $125, so Tillier suggests that fair-value for a coin should be around $140 today.  Tillier recommends going long if the price holds above $250, but cutting losses if the price falls below that level, because a drop under $200 could well take place.  Similarly Gavin Smith at derivatives offerer First Global Credit recommends watching for the price to cross the psychologically important $250 level. Smith is going long but with plenty of stops placed on the way down to $250 and under.  ""I recommend a very disciplined use of stops at the moment as a further slide can't be ruled out,"" he wrote on his company's blog.  Derivatives exchange BitMEX takes a slightly more bearish view. Its weekly Crypto Trader Digest recommends subscribers take advantage of ""lower lows"" as the price will head for $250 and then $200. But even as traders short the bitcoin price, they must remain vigilant to a ""short squeeze"", where the price moves against them and forces them to close their positions at a loss.  ""Monitoring the level of short swaps on Bitfinex is a must. A successfully executed short squeeze could send the price screaming above $300,"" the Digest observed.  Some analysis for a longer time period is offered by leveraged trading platform BTC.sx. Its chief marketing officer Josh Blatchford applies 'Random Walk' theory, popularised by the Princeton economist Burton Malkiel's 1973 best-seller 'A Random Walk Down Wall Street', to cryptocurrencies.  By BTC.sx's analysis, the bitcoin price can be viewed as being part of a bi-annual cycle: a price rally followed by a random walk. This has been the case in 2011 (rally) and 2012 (positive random walk) and then 2013 (two rallies) and 2014 (negative random walk). The analysis stops short of calling a rally in 2015, suggesting only that volatility is expected to increase in late March.

42398103,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSjD,1421062669,"What It Took to Bring Bitcoin to 5,000 Taiwan Convenience Stores","The organizers of a large-scale project to make bitcoin available over the counter at thousands of Taiwanese convenience stores have spoken about the efforts it took to bring their plan to fruition.  The main hurdles were overcoming lack of knowledge about bitcoin and local regulatory fears among mainstream businesses, according to local exchange BitoEX.  Despite these, the company still managed to launch a fully operational bitcoin-purchasing service in October, with a rollout to 2,980 Family Mart stores. It then expanded to over 5,000 stores in total, with the addition of the OK MART and Hi-Life chains.  BitoEX  anticipates the total number of stores could reach 12,000 by March this year, and told CoinDesk about plans to extend the service to other countries in Asia.  The company says it is funded by its founders' own capital, along with input from angel investors, with a total of $2.5m raised so far.  Cautious approach  CEO Titan Cheng said his company had been through ""quite a hard time"" in its negotiations with its new partners, particularly concerning local regulation.  The firm began negotiations with Family Mart representatives shortly after it launched in May 2014.  ""We spent at least three months discussing the regulation and taxation problems with them. After determining compliance with the laws and regulation in Taiwan, we formally signed contracts and started the cooperation.""  Although customers can pay for and receive bitcoins over the counter within a minute, under the deal, convenience stores will only return the fiat funds to BitoEX a week later.  ""The more convenience stores in cooperation, the more working capital we need to prepare in order to cope with the huge number of transactions.""  This meant that BitoEX needed to partner with larger bitcoin exchanges in other countries for liquidity. Supplying the required quantities of bitcoins to Taiwan are international exchange OKCoin, and Hong Kong-based KBBEX.  How the service works  Using existing multi-service touchscreen kiosks located in the convenience stores, customers enter the amount of bitcoin they wish to buy in Taiwanese dollars (plus a roughly $0.75 service fee) and their mobile phone number.  The kiosks print a receipt for customers to take to the counter and pay with cash, while an SMS message is sent to the mobile number with a link to BitoEX's website. Upon visiting the site, customers can specify a bitcoin address to receive the funds.  The system presupposes a degree of bitcoin knowledge and existing address to use, though is no more complex than receiving coins from a bitcoin ATM – and much less so than ATMs requiring ID-verified accounts.  Customer Jason Gatewood made the video below to demonstrate the bitcoin buying process:  Bitcoin in Taiwan  Despite the size of its population (23.4 million) and its GDP (20th in the world) Taiwan hasn't appeared often on the bitcoin radar – at least, not in the retail sense.  Digital entertainment company Wayi announced in December 2013 it would become a bitcoin exchange and accept bitcoins at its online mall, though a year on there appears little if any mention of bitcoin on its main site.  In January, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) threw a roadblock in front of bitcoin's advance when it prevented one of the earliest rollouts of Robocoin bitcoin ATMs.  At the time, the FSC cited bitcoin's lack of status as a legal currency to justify its action.  By May, however, there was at least one Lamassu one-way machine operating in Taipei.  ""Taiwan is a country that attaches great importance to the interests of consumers,"" Cheng said.  While there are still not many businesses accepting bitcoin in Taiwan so far – with most users seeing it as an investment – BitoEX plans to promote the use of digital currency by opening up its API and holding a hackathon to develop new use cases.  Liquidity partners  KBBEX CEO Patrick Lam said it had initially been a ""great surprise"" to hear that BitoEX had been successful in penetrating the convenience store space.  Realizing the two companies had a common goal to promote bitcoin development, he communicated with Cheng and negotiated the two companies' cooperation.  KBBEX began trading bitcoins over-the-counter about a year and a half ago, and launched its main exchange platform in December after receiving $1.5m from a private equity fund a few months earlier.  The exchange serves clients primarily in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, plus other Asian countries. English and Simplified Chinese versions of its site will launch this month, and services will extend to mainland China in the first quarter of the year.  OKCoin, the more established exchange, is one of the world's busiest in both USD and CNY (yuan) volumes. Its Chinese operation, OKCoin.cn, is headquartered in Beijing and its international arm, OKCoin.com, is registered in Singapore.  The company now operates a multitude of bitcoin exchange services for amateurs and professionals, including margin trading, futures, mobile apps and now P2P lending to earn interest. Notably, it passed a cryptographic audit of its bitcoin reserves last August.
