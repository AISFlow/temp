42403842,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgsmT,1579813221,Hawaiian Bill Would Let Banks Act as Crypto Custodians,"Hawaiian lawmakers have submitted a bill that allows banks to provide custody for digital assets.      SB2594, introduced on Jan. 18 with bipartisan backing, would make it legal for Hawaiian banks to hold “digital securities,” “virtual currencies,” “digital consumer assets” and other “open blockchain tokens” for their customers. It would further authorize Hawaiian courts to hear digital asset claims.      State Senators Gil Riviere (D-23), Sharon Moriwaki (D-12), Stanley Chang (D-9), Les Ihara (D-10) and Kurt Fevella (R-19) sponsored the bill.      In effect, the bill could clear the way for Hawaiian banks to offer digital services alongside their existing ones. U.S. banks have long balked at touching bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, fearing regulatory uncertainties and the assets’ at times illicit associations could spell trouble down the line.      But the troubles go a step further in Hawaii, where even crypto-focused money services struggle to function. That’s because the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions requires crypto-licensed entities hold fiat reserves equal to their virtual currency holdings, a decision Coinbase said led to its shuttering of operations in the state in 2017.      This legislative effort does not appear to end the “double reserve” problem, as Coinbase has called it. But it would, conceivably, give some legal clarity to Hawaiian banks.      The bill’s language describes a low-cost, at times pro-consumer custodial system that could come online 60 days after passage. Banks would be required to pay a $1 annual fee and hire an independent accountant to examine their digital books.      Customers could also authorize their custodians to transact with their digital assets. They would need to agree to the “source code version” the banks would utilize, with statutory ambiguities “resolved in favor of the customers.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/23/hawaiian-bill-would-let-banks-act-as-crypto-custodians,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb8cf04ad97e773cbd2bc2f62367bf26926334f8-1200x797.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gemini announced Thursday it completed an independent SOC 2 Type 2 examination conducted by consulting firm Deloitte, a year after it completed an SOC 2 Type 1 examination. Where the previous examination evaluated Gemini’s design and system control implementation, the Type 2 exam looks at operations across a period of time.      “We believe this kind of assurance, in addition to other safeguards we have implemented, such as digital asset insurance, helps protect our customers data and cryptocurrency,” said Yusuf Hussain, head of risk at Gemini, in a statement.      The firm will be completing a SOC 2 Type 2 on an annual basis, Hussain said.      The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) introduced the cybersecurity risk management examinations, named SOC for Cybersecurity, in April 2017.      The examinations are designed to help organizations meet the growing challenge of communicating the design and effectiveness of cybersecurity risk management programs to interested parties, according to a white paper from the AICPA.      “Simply saying you are secure is not the same as demonstrating you are secure to an independent third party,” Hussain said. “We feel that everyone should require these standards for any cryptocurrency exchange and custodian they use.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/23/gemini-completes-second-level-of-cybersecurity-compliance-exam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/914db3540b7e6539de8fcb73bcb81dc892f13b9b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Vinnik will be sent to France on allegations of money laundering following a ruling from Greece’s Council of State, the country's supreme administrative court, reported Greek news outlet Ekathimerini on Thursday. He was arrested in July 2017 by Greek authorities after Russia, the U.S. and France all issued international arrest warrants on charges of laundering at least $4 billion through BTC-e, which he allegedly set up.      Vinnik has maintained he is innocent of all charges, claiming he was just one of the exchange's employees.      The court ruled a decision by Greek Justice Minister Konstantinos Tsiaras to extradite Vinnik to France, then to the U.S. and then to Russia had been lawful. Vinnik, who previously said he wished to be tried in Russia, has been on a hunger strike for the past month over claims his human rights have been violated.      A Greek court initially ordered Vinnik's extradition to France in 2018, where he is wanted on charges of cybercrime, money laundering, membership in a criminal organization and extortion. Thursday's ruling from the Council of State means Vinnik will no longer be able to appeal the extradition ruling.      The Greek government turned down a request from Russia's Prosecutor General for Vinnik to be extradited directly to the country in late December.

42403845,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgsoR,1579790845,Campaign Privacy Statements Open Voters to Data Sharing,"This story is part of CoinDesk’s 2020 election series exploring questions of information integrity, the rights of digital citizens, the power of centralized platforms, and the future of money.      The 2020 presidential campaign is largely focused on President Trump, the progressive versus centrist wing of the Democratic party and, apparently, according to the New York Times, identifying who broke each candidate’s heart.      Meanwhile, foreign states are known to be targeting our election infrastructure, voters are increasingly concerned about the privacy of their data, and talking points about data and big tech have been rallying cries on the campaign trail for everyone from Andrew Yang to Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Whether campaigns are living up to their own talking points is another question entirely. A recent report has found that while the cybersecurity practices of campaign websites hold up to scrutiny, a close reading of privacy policies (or lack thereof) shows some campaigns paying the idea of privacy lip service while simultaneously employing privacy statements that allow for widespread sharing of supporters' data.      The Online Trust Audit for 2020 Presidential Campaigns, conducted by the Internet Society’s Online Trust Association (OTA), examined all the presidential candidates’ campaign websites for cybersecurity, consumer protections and privacy. The report found several campaigns were lacking in key areas, particularly when it came to privacy.      Campaigns either failed or were placed on “Honor Roll status.” The latter scored 80 percent or higher in the report’s assessment, with no failure in website security, consumer protections or privacy. In its initial report, released in October 2019, the OTA found 30 percent of the campaigns made the honor roll, while 70 percent did not. That’s worse than nearly every other sector the OTA examined in previous reports, including retailers, banks and the federal government. The next-lowest industry was the health sector, but even there, 57 percent of entities audited made the honor roll.    That’s worse than nearly every other sector the OTA examined in previous reports.    In the initial version of the report, all the campaigns that didn't make the honor roll failed in the privacy category while two campaigns also had consumer protection failures.      “Overall, we found that campaigns have strong website security, reasonable email and domain protections and poor privacy scores,” concluded the report. “Privacy statements are the biggest concern, causing failure for 70 percent of the campaigns.”      The report found two campaigns had no email authentication, the process that helps recipients verify the sender of a message. But by far the biggest issue was with privacy statements. Four campaigns had no identifiable privacy statement, which the report called “inexcusable;” others included no mention of data sharing (limits or otherwise) or included language that said they’d share data with “like minded entities” or third parties that were not identified (such as the Democratic National Committee).      After this initial report, the OTA contacted individual campaigns and offered to explain their scores as well as how to improve them. Several, including the campaigns of Elizabeth Warren, Julian Castro and John Kevin Delaney, took OTA up on this. Others, including Biden, Tulsi Gabbard and Yang, did not.      The result is that when the OTA re-released the scores in December, the honor roll to failure ratio had shifted from 30-70 to 50-50.      OTA removed the campaigns that dropped out from the data and bolded the names of those campaigns that had graduated from the failure tier. However, improvement was limited.      “Their data-sharing language is either absent or very, very broad,” says Jeff Wilbur, OTA technical director.      Almost all the privacy statements have a line saying the campaigns don't sell, rent or share your data, he says. Then they go on in several paragraphs to explain all the exceptions . In the political realm this may seem understandable, but Wilbur says it's still a concern.      “Just because I show an interest in one presidential candidate doesn't mean that I'm opting in automatically to all the rest of that stuff,” he says. “It seems to be like it's all or nothing.”        If you were wondering why you randomly started getting urgent emails for fundraising purposes from the Republican or Democratic national committees, it’s likely because you gave money to a campaign or signed up for email updates, thereby launching your data into a rotating crop of third-party vendors and political organizations that will use your information for years to come.      “There is a lot of power and value in the data that's being collected,” says Maurice Turner, deputy director of the Internet Architecture Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy organization ensuring the internet remains open, innovative and free. “Because of the prevalence of opportunities to micro-target, there is a great incentive to collect more data about visitors about donors, and then be able to share those with other networks.”    Multiple campaigns    Turner says voters might just want to support a single candidate or issue rather than the Democratic ticket writ large. But by supporting one campaign that has data-sharing stipulations in its privacy statements, voters' information is shared across so many other organizations that they start getting emails and messages from folks they've never heard of before.      Campaign privacy statements tend to be boilerplate, according to Turner. Party members are likely to see the same statements over and over again. Campaigns hire a company to run their websites without looking into the details of what the privacy policies entail.      Parham Eftekhari, executive director for the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, a cyber security think tank based in Washington, D.C., says campaigns need to have a higher level of integrity when it comes to these types of efforts, and people should be given an option to opt out of these information sharing practices.      “I believe these campaigns have an ethical, and in some terms moral obligation to do everything in their power to reasonably defend the privacy and the protection of the data they're collecting,” says Eftekhari.      There is a tension between achieving the political outcomes people want and maintaining control of personal data and privacy. Putting together a multifaceted political coalition, full of sometimes disparate actors who come from a variety of socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds, is a big ask. Personal data allows campaigns, PACs, and others effectively to pursue ad campaigns, fundraising, and get out the vote actions. But the lack of clarity or asterisks identified by the OTA in campaigns’ privacy statements show that engaging with even one campaign can open your personal data up to a bevy of other actors, whether you want them to have it or not.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/23/campaign-privacy-statements-open-voters-to-data-sharing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfb294b24c075da28c96c5a9c3e4d166279e5b3f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403844,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgsnS,1579788024,Crypto Custody Provider Ledger Extends Reach in Asia With New Institutional Client,"Digital asset storage provider Ledger is partnering with FLETA, a South Korea-based blockchain platform, for decentralized applications (dapps) to provide custodian services compliant with local laws.      The French startup has been trying to extend the reach of its institutional-level services with Ledger Vault, building on the success of its nano wallets, which primarily targeted retail crypto holders.      “Ledger does not just offer the security of storing crypto, it also allows financial institutions to build customized governance rules,” said Glenn Woo, Ledger’s managing director leading business expansions in the Asia-Pacific region.      Founded in 2018, FLETA launched its mainnet in November and has partnered with the government to build a proof-of-concept network for the nation’s healthcare system, hoping to let hospitals share private data such as research and medical records.      The firm confirmed to CoinDesk it held a private token sale in August 2018 and a public sale in 2019, but declined to disclose specific figures for the two funding rounds.    Scaling up    Woo said the partnership with FLETA reflects Ledger's shift in Asia towards helping large-scale institutional clients be compliant with regulators across different jurisdiction in the region.      “We are helping crypto companies, such as exchanges, funds and custodians, to basically abide by the regulations when it comes to wallet management,” Woo said. “Our biggest priority is Ledger Vault.”      Ledger is in the process of building a joint venture with the U.S.-based investment firm Global Advisors and Japanese financial services giant Nomura. The new firm, named Komainu, will offer digital asset managemnet services to institutional investors while helping clients integrate crypto with traditional investments instruments such as mutual funds.      According to Woo, one of the biggest concerns for financial institutions is regulatory risks, particularly at a time when many governments are still developing their guidelines for the emerging industry.      Institutions that choose to be fully compliant may spend large sums of money securing legal opinions and setting up the proper infrastructure and reporting tools.    Regulatory challenges    Two major issues regulators have with crypto companies are how to secure digital assets and how to protect investors' interest when these assets are lost.      Ledger claims its Vault offering requires multiple layers of authorization, which in turn requires a greater degree of involvement from a client’s operations team to withdraw assets.      “One of the big themes when it comes to regulating crypto institutions on the wallet side is to remove the central point of failure where the CEO of an exchange knows everything,” Woo said. “With this infrastructure, we aim to go into more of the regulations jurisdiction where the crypto institutions are struggling to meet the requirements of the regulations.”      Woo said Ledger further backs up its clients’ assets with a customized insurance policy, referencing the company’s partnership with Lloyd’s of London syndicate Arch.      In November, insurance broker Marsh arranged a $150 million insurance policy from Arch for users on the Ledger Vault technology platform.      “My experience is that insurance is actually very hard to get for many crypto startups because they don't have a track record,” Woo said, noting insurance could be critical when a crypto company seeks approval for financial regulators.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | REGULATION | WALLET | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/23/crypto-custody-provider-ledger-extends-reach-in-asia-with-new-institutional-client,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a58e9165ebf67a87ae2c420ea634fa8386fd5fa-1600x1066.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403851,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgstM,1579785000,CoinDesk Q4 2019 Review: A Year in Suspended Animation,"It has been over 10 years since the creation of cryptocurrencies, and while clear narratives have emerged to justify their existence, none are decisively supported by data.      For example, charts suggest bitcoin’s use case as a store of value is taking hold among some new investors, who have been shown to hold the asset through price run-ups. However, other metrics such as bitcoin’s correlation to gold suggest that, across the entire body of bitcoin investors, most are using the asset as something far different from ""digital gold.""      On ethereum, DeFi has made impressive gains, but the shape of that line and a broader decline in user numbers suggest that the ""web 3.0"" narrative is still in its infancy.      Released today, the CoinDesk Quarterly Review surfaces the key data, trends and events shaping crypto markets, in a 45-slide presentation format. It evaluates three different use cases for crypto across more than 25 different data sets. The results of this analysis suggest a dominant narrative for bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies has yet to emerge.      Readers of this report are introduced to key metrics for tracking shifts in investor interest and global usage of cryptocurrencies. These include bitcoin’s “whale” population, UTXO age distribution, exchange volumes and more.      The data-driven takeaways include:    1. Not everyone who stood to profit sold.    Holders of bitcoin who last transacted in the second half of 2017 held through the end of 2019 despite rises in market price that would have made it profitable to sell. This suggests there is investor sentiment for bitcoin as a store of value rather than as a speculative asset. The bump in bitcoin holdings that last moved in late 2018 represents a movement of assets into a more secure form of storage by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in December 2018.      Coinbase’s bitcoin-fiat markets, among the world’s most popular for purchases of bitcoin in USD, GBP and EUR, have stalled since 2018. According to data from Nomics, bitcoin-fiat volume has dropped from an all-time high of $46.54 million in 2018 to $44.92 million in 2019. This market is primarily used by investors who view bitcoin as an alternative store of value from traditional currency, and can be thought of as a barometer for buy-and-hold sentiment.    2. Bitcoin 'whale' population remains healthy.    By the end of 2019, there were 2,100 bitcoin addresses holding more $8.5 million worth of BTC each. The growth in these types of addresses, also called bitcoin “whales,” is a rough indicator of large investor participation in cryptocurrencies. Since 2018, the bitcoin whale population has been multiplying at rates not seen since the early 2000s when bitcoin was trading below $100, or 1/85th of its current market price.      Off-chain activity on regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. does not show similar signs of increased large investor participation in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency data provider Skew reported a decline in volume for both the CME and Bakkt’s bitcoin futures open interest markets in 2019. These markets, unlike that of other popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance, are designed to offer institutional investors regulated instruments for exposure on bitcoin. Institutional participation in cryptocurrencies may be lagging due to persisting imbalances in the underlying liquidity of these assets across various exchanges.    3. DeFi blooms in winter.    One of the breakout successes of 2019 was decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Collectively, these decentralized apps (dapps) managed over $680 million-worth of cryptocurrencies by the end of Q4, according to cryptocurrency data provider DeFi Pulse. Looking at the most popular sub-category of DeFi, cryptocurrency lending, user traction on ethereum continued to climb even when market price for ETH started to decline.      In other dapp categories such as gaming and gambling, the number of applications and users decreased in 2019. Cryptocurrency data provider DappRadar reports fewer dapps and dapp users in Q4 2019 than Q1. “In general, we're seeing a rise in the quality of dapps and over time that means fewer dapps launched and fewer dapps attracting a large audience,” said Jon Jordan, communications director of DappRadar. It would seem outside of the DeFi boom on the ethereum blockchain, other dapp platforms and use cases are struggling to grow.

42403849,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgssN,1579782624,Bitcoin Cash Miners Propose Controversial Soft Fork for Zcash-Style Development Fund,"A group of bitcoin cash miners is preparing a soft fork to redirect some of the block rewards into a new zcash-style development fund.      In a Medium post Wednesday, Jiang Zhuoer, CEO of mining pool BTC.TOP, said that a group of some of the largest bitcoin cash mining pools were preparing to soft fork the network to implement a ""short-term donation plan"" that would cut block rewards by 12.5 percent in order to fund network development.      ""Investment in software and commons is crucial to secure a bright future for Bitcoin Cash,"" the post reads, arguing that neglect can have a ""damaging"" effect on the network. ""We can avoid these problems by providing an adequate level of stable funding, allowing Bitcoin Cash to thrive and succeed.""      Signed by Jihan Wu of Antpool/BTC.com, Roger Ver from Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC's Haipo Yang, Zhuoer's post argues there are ""significant problems"" with the current funding mechanism. Donations are made on a voluntary basis, making it difficult to finance long-term projects and giving corporate donors ""an undue influence"" over developers.      Many community members, Zhuoer writes, don't currently contribute anything at all, creating a ""tragedy of the commons"" situation where the self-interest of individuals is contrary to the common good of the network. It may be controversial, but redirecting block rewards is ""undoubtedly a far better solution"" than the current funding system, the post reads.      Many of the same miners included in the post had previously pushed to introduce a ""development tax"" during a CoinGeek BCH conference back in 2018. A report by crypto investment firm Electric Capital found bitcoin cash lost more than 30 percent of its developers between December 2018 and June 2019, the largest drop of any major blockchain network.      Because bitcoin cash uses the same SHA-256 hash algorithm as bitcoin, most of the block reward costs will, according to the post, be carried by the dominant bitcoin miners, who constitute approximately 97 percent of the hash ecosystem. Assuming bitcoin cash stays at around $300, Zhuoer calculates the new mechanism could raise more than $6 million in six months.      ""It's a clever proposal, with good intent,"" tweeted Emin Gun Sirer, adding that a marginally lower hashrate for steady developer funding was a good trade-off as ""empirically more attacks have been due to underfunded devs than to malicious hashrate.""      But the proposal is not without controversy. Zhuoer's post says BCH blocks that don't follow the soft fork ""will be orphaned,"" meaning they won't be accepted by the five mining pools and risk not receiving any block reward whatsoever.      Funds will also be directed into an unnamed ""Hong Kong corporation"" that will coordinate and pay for network development. It's not certain whether this new corporation will pay third-party developers or if it will do most of the work itself, like the Electric Coin Company (ECC) on zcash.      In an ask-me-anything (AMA) Reddit session Thursday, Zhuoer clarified that miners would ""ensure the transparency and effective use of all funds"" by the Hong Kong corporation. Antpool's Wu added in the same AMA that many of the details for how the corporation would be governed and how development projects would be prioritized were still ""under discussion.""      ""There are many underspecified aspects to the proposal,"" Sirer said. ""Specifically, who will manage the collected funds and how will they be distributed?"" That the proposal was sprung on members of the BCH community ""was terrible PR and community management,"" he continued, while the threat of orphaning dissenting blocks risks alienating much of the mining community.      It's also disputed whether the five mining pools will be able to force the community to accept their soft fork. At press time, the signatories had a combined BCH hashrate of just under 28 percent, way below the required majority needed to push the soft fork through by themselves.

42403852,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgsuL,1579776131,"Bitcoin Faces Move to $8,200 After Dropping Out of Trading Range","View    Bitcoin’s range breakdown has opened the doors for a deeper pullback to support levels at $8,200 and $8,000.  The short-term indicators have turned bearish, supporting the case for further losses.  A move above $8,750 is needed to revive the immediate bullish view.  The broader outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $7,700, according to the weekly chart.    Bitcoin has dived out its recent trading range, opening the doors for a pullback to deeper support levels.      The top cryptocurrency ran into offers around $8,580 at 08:35 UTC and fell through the long-held support of $8,460 in a few minutes to hit a low of $8,340 – a level last seen on Jan. 14, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      The drop to nine-day lows confirmed a downside break of the recent trading range of $8,460 to $8,750.      The cryptocurrency had entered consolidation mode during Sunday’s U.S. trading hours after the sudden reversal lower from highs near $9,200 range out of steam at $8,460 – the level, which saw bitcoin turn lower on Jan. 8.      So it seems safe to say the pullback from $9,200 has resumed with the range breakdown and a deeper drop to support at $8,200 and $8,000 could be in the offing.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $8,415, representing a 2.72 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.    4-hour chart    The range breakdown has created room for a drop to at least $8,170 (target as per the measured move method).      Bitcoin charted multiple four-hour candles with highs around $8,200 in the Jan. 11-13 period. As a result, $8,200 is a key support to watch out for. On similar lines, the psychological level of $8,000 is also crucial support.      On the higher side, $8,750 is the level to beat for the bulls. A sustained move at that level would revive the short-term bullish view and allow a re-test of recent highs near $9,200.      However, a break above $8,750 looks unlikely, as the short-term indicators have made a bearish shift.    Daily chart    The MACD histogram, which is widely used to gauge trend strength and trend reversals, has crossed below zero, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change.      The five- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) have produced bearish crossover.    8-hour chart    Bitcoin has lost its upward trajectory, as indicated by the ""ascending pitchfork"" breakdown.      The ascending pitchfork is a trend channel tool consisting of a median line in the center with two parallel equidistant lines on either side. These lines are drawn by from three points, representing a bottom, a correction high and a higher low.      All in all, the odds appear stacked in favor of a drop to $8,200 and possibly to $8,000.    Weekly chart    Bitcoin broke out of a six-month-long falling channel two weeks ago, confirming a long-term bullish reversal. The setup will remain valid as long as prices are holding above $7,700.

On Jan. 8, Delegate Hala Ayala (D-51) offered two bills to the House of Delegates: the first calling for Virginia’s Department of Elections to investigate blockchain as a means to secure elections, and the second requesting the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) research blockchain’s current and coming role in the Old Dominion's economy.      Together, they comprise Ayala’s political drive to embrace – or at least consider – integrating distributed ledger technology in Virginia life.      They’re also a product of Ayala’s subject matter expertise. She was an information security specialist with the U.S. Coast Guard for nearly 20 years before transitioning to a cybersecurity role at the Transportation Security Administration in 2017, where she continues to work.    “Right now blockchain is a thriving technology,” said Ayala, who was appointed chairhttps://www.ayalafordelegate.com/publications/delegate-hala-ayala-chair-technology-and-innovation-subcommittee of the newly formed Technology and Innovation Subcommittee last week.    The bills outline Ayala’s proposed roadmap to studying blockchain technologies. This is most clear in her election bill. It's a response to the ongoing threat of election interference by “bad actors,” she said.      But it's also a detailed prescription to get ahead of future attacks. With text imploring the Virginia Department of Elections to study current blockchain voting mechanisms, perform a cost-benefit analysis and then determine “whether and how to implement blockchain” in elections, the bill offers a path to possible implementation.      “We have to take blockchain very seriously and understand it has the mechanics and mechanisms that could potentially provide us with more secure election protection,” Ayala said.      The economy bill, too, would nudge blockchain toward more widespread implementation in Virginia, with two years of mandated studies on the tech’s prevalence and role in intrastate commerce.      If passed, VEDP would produce multiple reports outlining what the government should do to foster sector growth. Ayala said it would also tamp down on corporate overreach, keeping companies honest.      While Ayala hopes the reports will shed light on how the commonwealth can take advantage of this relatively new technology, she has not yet committed to implementing blockchain tools.      ""We need to do our homework first to see how we can apply these technologies to their businesses as well as our elections,"" she said.      Ultimately, her economics bill seeks to create “a statewide, comprehensive, and coordinated strategy relating to blockchain technology,” the text reads.      “Technology is always ever evolving, and we want to make sure that we are on the forefront and leading the way here in the commonwealth,” Ayala said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/23/this-virginia-lawmaker-argues-blockchain-can-boost-local-elections-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d280916ade25a4335a1da2f59197412024b4ffa-1200x802.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The AARGOS Global Real Estate Fund was approved as an alternative investment fund (AIF) by Liechtenstein's Financial Market Authority (FMA), the company announced. The fund provides exposure to a global real estate portfolio through AARGO security tokens – built on the ethereum blockchain – with each token representing one share in the fund.      The fund was created by Ahead Wealth Solutions, a financial services provider based in the nation's capital Vaduz, in collaboration with Bank Frick and blockchain technology provider Token Factory.      AARGO tokens have been designed to ensure only legally compliant transactions can be executed, Token Factory said in a blog post at the beginning of the week. In other words, only investors who have completed the requisite KYC/AML forms can actually hold the token.      The fund's tokenization will also create ""greater efficiency and a higher degree of automation in the transmission process,""said Bank Frick head of fund and capital markets Raphael Haldner in a statement.      Speaking to CoinDesk, Bastiaan Don, Token Factory's managing director, said working on a public blockchain also presented opportunities for the financial sector. Funds are protected from manipulation by a centralized entity. Being on the ERC-20 token standard means the company can readily integrate with a ""growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem,"" he said.      ""[You could] easily integrate with, for example, lending applications, so you can get some liquidity out of your tokenized assets,"" he said. Private or permissioned blockchains might have some advantages in the short term, he said, but ""people will realize that they are missing out on all the fun and great applications that are built on public blockchains.""      AIFs are EU-regulated financial vehicles that raise capital from investors and invest these funds with the purpose of making favorable returns. Although Liechtenstein is not an EU member country, its businesses can operate within the single market because it complies with the bloc's financial regulation.      The Liechtenstein government has previously said it would avoid ""excessive"" blockchain regulation and the FMA has previously approved a plan for offering tokenized public offerings for retail investors.

42421063,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBgsf,1579770000,Meet the Crypto Angel Investor Running for Congress in Nevada,"""I would love to sit down with President Trump and have a discussion around bitcoin and cryptocurrency,"" Lisa Song Sutton, an entrepreneur and bitcoin ATM investor in Las Vegas, told CoinDesk.  Sutton might have a better shot than most at having such a conversation. She's running for Congress in the Fourth Congressional District of Nevada, one of nine people currently competing in the June 9 Republican primary to see who will face off against the incumbent, Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat, in the general election in November.  Were she to win, Sutton would be a likely candidate to join the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, co-chaired in the House by Republicans David Schweikert (Arizona) and Tom Emmer (Minn.) and Democrats Bill Foster (Ill.) and Darren Soto (Fla.). The group scored a small victory last year as Soto helped to get language into the Defense Authorization Act's conference report requiring the U.S. military to look into applications of distributed ledger technology.  Even if she makes it through the primary, she may still face long odds. The Cook Political Report has the district rated as ""Likely Democrat.""  That said, she was third in total campaign funds raised as of the third quarter of 2019, according tothe latest Federal Election Commission data, and she remains well behind Horsford. She told CoinDesk she has benefited from media interest in the narrative of a beauty queen/business co-owner running for Congress. Sutton was Miss Nevada United States in 2014.  She also happens to have cryptocurrency bona fides. Her company, Sin City Cupcakes (selling booze-infused confections in Las Vegas), early on accepted bitcoin from customers as payment. She also joined a consortium of angel investors that backed five different bitcoin ATM efforts.  She has small holdings in a few currencies but she doesn't pretend to be an expert or a blockchain hardcore. That said, she thinks if she made it to Congress and got an audience with President Trump, she could make the case that these technologies might define the future of business, and the U.S. should not close itself off from a leadership role.  The argument she would make to the President would be that the U.S. has an opportunity to hold on to its lead in this new sector of entrepreneurship, but, she said, ""I don't know if it would work.""  Cupcakecoin  Sutton spoke Jan. 7 on a panel concerning blockchain and regulation during the Consumer Electronics Show's Digital Money Forum in Las Vegas.  Sutton was invited to the panel, in part, because of her experience as a small business co-founder who got into using cryptocurrency early. In 2017, the state of Nevada banned local governments from taxing cryptocurrencies, she explained on stage. She told the crowd, ""We were like: cha-ching!""  But it turned out the state's policies had gotten ahead of implementation. Sin City Cupcakes moved quickly to get paid in bitcoin, but then needed to know how to document everything correctly. She contacted the state, only to find it really didn't have a plan for small businesses that wanted to take advantage of the new law.  ""So we just made up our own rules, as entrepreneurs do. We figured it out,"" she said. ""There was no guidance. No clarity.""  These days, Sin City doesn't even convert the crypto it earns for cupcakes into fiat, though that's partly because not many people pay that way.  Besides her involvement in founding a few companies, including a swimwear company and a shipping center, she's an angel investor, joining a consortium of investors that ended up backing a few early bitcoin ATM ventures.  She said that through the group she's backed five such efforts, three of which are still live, though she declined to name them.  Nevertheless, on stage she spoke of the confusion borne by companies founded just to allow people to buy bitcoin, only to find two different state laws that may or may not govern their activities depending on tiny nuances in their operations. ""And that's just Nevada,"" she told the crowd.  Working through issues like this is part of why compliance is the largest team at Coinsource, a market leader in the crypto ATM space.  She said that in all things, balances need to be struck between, for example, enabling business and protecting consumers, or free enterprise and stymieing money laundering. Broadly, she said, ""As a business owner, I advocate a free-market approach.""  In particular, she's watched ATMs required to collect more and more information about customers. ""It's a bit in contrast to the premise of bitcoin, which is supposed to be this anonymous currency,"" she said.  Status of campaign  Crypto is by no means Sutton's top issue.  She's running, she said, to give people in north Las Vegas and rural Nevada an elected leader who is more responsive to their needs. ""Politics wasn't in the plan,"" she said.  Though she had only really been a presidential election voter, she started to hear that people were dissatisfied with their representation. She did some research on Horsford and decided, ""Someone should run against this guy.""  When asked about her personal top issues, she pivoted instead to the big issues in her district such as water rights, immigration and the various military facilities in the district.  Her main focus are the issues involved with running a business, and she'd like to see more people from business backgrounds run for public office, possibly for short periods of time as she plans to do if she wins.  She raised over $127,000 in her first quarter of campaigning, and promises she'll beat that number with the next filing. She said funds have come in from around 40 states, as people have heard about her through the media coverage.  If elected, she says, she will be all-in for Nevada and north Last Vegas ""for a finite amount of time,"" she said, because she believes in term limits. She'll be quite ready to return to entrepreneurship when she's done.  ""Don't get me wrong, I'd be taking a pay cut,"" she said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/23/meet-the-crypto-angel-investor-running-for-congress-in-nevada,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea939b738c6426f61a5ec8234871a669d5d9d6ed-1655x1106.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Thursday, Switzerland-based Amun has launched the 21Shares Short Bitcoin ETP (SBTC) on the Swiss Stock Exchange (SIX), an exchange-traded product tracking bitcoin’s price movements inversely.      If bitcoin’s price climbs, traders lose. If it falls, they win.      “If you’ve ever tried trading options or futures, you’ll see that it’s pretty difficult,” Amun CEO Hany Rashwan said in a phone interview. “It's not the easiest thing which is why it's just easier to say ‘I think bitcoin price will go down, I'm going to buy this stock.’”      Compared to entering short trade positions on bitcoin – wherein an investor expects the price to fall and bets against an asset’s value rising by buying and selling a position on loaned funds – Amun’s Short Bitcoin ETP does not require loaned capital.      Rather, the product captures bitcoin’s price movement inversely in one stock purchase akin to a synthetic exchange-traded note (ETN) comprised of short positions. Furthermore, all positions reset at the end of the trading day with performances not rolling over to the next day.      Rashwan noted the rise of crypto derivatives, particularly from lightly or completely unregulated exchanges, which are taking up to 99 percent of the bitcoin derivative market’s volume compared to legacy providers such as CME Group or ICE’s Bakkt.      Indeed, crypto derivatives platform FTX traded some 2,405 options contracts traded on its inaugural day, Jan. 13, versus 54 options contracts on CME which opened the same day, according to financial publication Micky. Options on CME are constructed at 5 bitcoin per contract while FTX allows users to draft their own.      Responding to consumer demand, Rashwan said Amun has positioned itself to provide new forms of crypto exposure in just a few clicks.      “We hope to bring the easiest and most regulated user experience to short or leverage crypto exposure and this is the first step towards that vision... You don’t have to figure out how to open and shut the contract. You don't need to deal with what a perpetual swap is. Nothing of that sort. You just buy a stock,” Rashwan added.      Amun, with some $50 million in assets under management, offers 10 crypto-based ETP products on the Swiss SIX and Boerse Stuttgart.

In a letter emailed to the exchange's former customers and posted to its website, Miller Thomson wrote that Crypto Capital Corp., a ""shadow bank"" registered in Panama, ""may have been a payment processor"" for the exchange and is asking any customers who have emails or other documents that might be related to Crypto Capital to forward the communications to the legal firm.      ""Representative Counsel has been investigating, since its appointment, whether any Quadriga funds were potentially retained by Crypto Capital,"" Wednesday's letter said.      An archived snapshot of Crypto Capital's website lists QuadrigaCX as a client.      The letter referenced the ongoing court case between the U.S. Department of Justice and Crypto Capital, noting that the shadow bank's operators are currently under indictment. Reginald Fowler, one of the alleged operators of the company, is in court and may be heading to trial on charges of bank fraud, operating an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiracy.      Fowler intended to plead guilty to one charge of operating an unlicensed money transmitter, but negotiations between his attorneys and the prosecutors have yet to be concluded. He is now scheduled to appear in a New York courthouse in late April.      Wednesday's letter also referenced the fact that Bitfinex, another crypto exchange, has claimed to be defrauded by Crypto Capital and is seeking information and rights to seized assets in the shadow bank's possession in the U.S., Portugal and the U.K., three jurisdictions that have reportedly frozen Crypto Capital's assets.      ""As you are aware, Ernst & Young Inc. (the 'Trustee') has been unable to locate QuadrigaCX’s basic corporate records or accounting records.
