Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,299-$11,943  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Heavy sell volumes on spot exchanges such as Coinbase caused a fall in bitcoin’s price to as low as $11,299 Tuesday. Profit-taking is one driver of the dip, according to Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for broker Swissquote. “There are naturally some traders looking to take short term profits here, which is driving us lower,” Thomas told CoinDesk.

Read More: Alchemy Goes Public With Developer Platform in Bid to Grow DeFi      The decentralized finance, or DeFi, lending and trading platform dYdX is seeing a jump in borrowing rates on its platform. It’s currently over 11.7% on average, a high not seen since its competitor lender Compound’s emergence in late June, ushering in a wave of interest in DeFi overall.      The catalyst for rising rates on dYdX are derived from the USDC stablecoin, which has seen its borrowing rate jump as high as 25% this week.      DeFi observer “Ceteris Paribus” noted on Twitter that borrowed USD coin (USDC) is being used by traders for quick arbitrage opportunities. In this instance, a trader took advantage of stablecoin tether’s (USDT) price relative to USDC on trading platform Uniswap and borrowed from dYdX. This caused lending rates to jump outrageously as it soaked up the supply of loanable funds; the trade likely involved trading USDC for ether, then trading ether for tether because it is more liquid than trading USDC for USDT outright. The two stablecoins are both supposed to be priced close to one U.S. dollar, but supply and demand on individual exchanges may cause prices to fluctuate.      “Trader had $45,000 USDC, borrowed another $405,000 on dYdX to give them $450,000 USDC,"" reads the tweet. ""Traded that $450,000 USDC for $492,000 USDT on Uniswap. Traded $492,000 USDT for $492,000 USDC on Curve. Paid off $405,000 dYdX loan. Started with $45,000 USDC, ended with $87,000 USDC, and paid $2,000 in fees.”      Thus the arbitrage opportunity, although risky, would net a trader $40,000 on just $45,000 of crypto collateral, a profit of nearly 89% in a short amount of time.

42432471,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa4hh,1597177605,VPN Usage Surges as Belarus Remains Offline,"Anti-censorship tools saw an uptick in popularity in Belarus, the Eastern European country whose citizens have been protesting for three days after contested presidential elections over the weekend.      Residents have been protesting the results of the election Sunday night, which 26-year incumbent Alexander Lukashenko reportedly won in a landslide. Many people believe the results were rigged and that leading opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was the winner.      As people took to the streets and some factory personnel went on strike, internet access went down nationwide. At the same time, electronic payments have been working, the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda wrote.      Lukashenko denied pulling the plug, and the major Belarussian internet provider Beltelecom said its infrastructure was overwhelmed. On the third day of protests, people reported losing mobile internet connections and shared rumors cell phone services were the next to be cut.    'At times shut off'    Locals have still been able to use the internet using virtual private networks (VPNs), and the Telegram messenger app remained intermittently accessible. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov wrote on Twitter the company “enabled our anti-censorship tools in Belarus so that Telegram remained available for most users there.”      “However, the connection is still very unstable as Internet is at times shut off completely in the country,” Durov added.      Telegram became one of the main coordination tools for protesters. Over one million people are now following the NEXTA channel, which is posting updates of the protest activities in real time.      In the meantime, people discovered new tools for getting around the blocked communication channels. Beyond VPNs, residents are using proxy services such as Psiphon, an open-source lightweight proxy server from the Citizen Lab and the University of Toronto.      Before Aug. 8, Psiphon saw zero connections from Belarus – today it reports over six million. In just two days, Belarus became the world leader in using Psiphon, followed by Iran and Saudi Arabia, according to the company’s own data.      People have been also sharing information on how to use VPNs, Psiphon and other tools, and organizing groups to test new open-source options to see what’s working. Some paid VPN providers offered limited free traffic to users in Belarus, including atlasVPN and TunnelBear.    Selective blocking    Before the election, local newspaper Brestskaya Gazeta reported the secretary of the Security Council of Belarus, Andrei Ravkov, told presidential candidates on July 30 that internet access might be blocked in case of “provocations” during the elections.      Cybersecurity expert Alexey Lukatsky believes the Belarus authorities might have disrupted internet connectivity in the country deliberately. In Belarus, all internet connections are concentrated in the hands of a few providers, so it’s not hard to pull the plug, Lukatsky said.      “Knowing how various countries have been blocking access to the internet during elections, I would suggest that it’s not the issues with the infrastructure but a deliberate decision to block access,” he added.      He also said the fact that people are still able to use VPN and proxy services proves that the authorities did not just unplug the whole country from the global internet.      “If that’s a total block or an infrastructure failure, proxies won’t work. But if it’s the government blocking particular websites via internet providers, VPNs and proxies help get around that,” Lukatsky said.      In case of a total shutdown, only access to satellite internet will help, or the custom-designed connection routes via neighboring countries using mobile service and WiFi, Lukatsky said. The former is expensive and the latter requires some tech skills.      The U.S. State Department condemned the violent crackdown on the protesters in Belarus.

42432482,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa4vh,1597176168,Some Traders Now Taking Bets Ether Will Break $1K by December,"Deribit has started listing ether (ETH) options with strikes above $1,000, and some traders are now betting the cryptocurrency will reach that price by year’s end.      Over 3,470 contracts – worth $1.3 million – of ETH 1,120 call options have been traded for December 2020 and March 2021 expiry this month. These trades were executed on the Panama-based Deribit exchange, the world’s largest crypto exchange by options trading volume. It is the first exchange to offer options for strikes above $1,000, which went live on Aug. 1.      ”Volumes have been decent and open interest [open positions] is over 2,500 contracts already, indicating some traders believe ETH can potentially show a price move of over 180% in five to seven months,” Luuk Strijers, CCO at Deribit, told CoinDesk.      Ether is trading near $390 at press time, representing a 200% gain on a year-to-date basis. The impressive price rally and expectations for continued DeFi-led bull run could be driving the activity in the deep out-of-the-money options.      Read more: Deribit Reports Daily Record $539M of Bitcoin Options Traded, More Than Double Prior High      An option gives owners the right, but not the obligation, to trade an underlying asset at a set price and date. Calls give its owners the right to buy the asset while puts give their owners the right to sell.      Open interest in ether’s options market has exploded this year, increasing 2,585% from $14 million to $376 million, according to data provided by Skew.    ETH options as a forecasting tool    Options market data is widely used to identify support and resistance levels and potential trends in prices. For instance, Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, tweeted Monday that $14,000 is a key hurdle for bitcoin, which, if breached, could pave the way for $20,000. That's because there is notable open interest buildup in options at $14,000 strike and negligible activity in higher strikes.      In ether’s case, however, open interest in strikes above $1,000 is too small to draw any conclusions about the investor bias. At press time, there are 2,541 contracts open at the strike price of $1,120. That’s a meager 0.3% of the total open interest of 878,104 contracts spread across multiple expiries, according to data provided by Deribit.      “I wouldn’t make much of the existing open interest of 2,500 contracts on these strikes. Almost every strike from $40 to $880 has that as minimum interest,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5.      This relatively low number of transactions reflects the fact that the options market as a whole sees a low probability that ether will trade at $1,000 or greater by the end of December. The probabilities are calculated with the help of the Black-Scholes formula, which is based on metrics such as call option prices, strike prices, the price of the underlying asset, time left for expiry and the risk-free interest rate.      Read more: Open Interest in Ether Options Jumps to New Record High      Traders use an option’s delta, which measures the sensitivity of the option’s price to changes in the underlying asset’s price, as an estimated probability for a given option to expire in-the-money or make profit on expiry. Call options at $1,120 strikes will expire in the money if the spot prices settle above $1,120 on the day of the expiry. Owners at that strike only see a profit if ether trades above that price plus the cost of the option.      At press time, the delta of the $1,120 call option expiring in December is 0.11. In other words, the probability of ether rising above $1,120 on or before Dec. 25 is 11%. Similarly, delta of the $1,120 March expiry call option is 0.18. Meanwhile, data provider Skew calculates a mere 5% probability of ether trading above $1,000 before New Year’s Day.      Also, the $1,120 call expiring in December has the same probability as the put option at $300 strike. It means the odds of ether ending the year 22% below today's price is similar to prices ending 187% higher from the current price.      ""That tells you something about expectations,"" said Shah, adding, “the ETH options market is not big enough to drive the price of the underlying.” Indeed, global options volume of $22.9 million is just 2% of the spot market’s volume of $11.7 billion.

42432479,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa4rh,1597175745,How Much Ether Is Out There? Ethereum Developers Create New Scripts for Self-Verification,"Ethereum and Bitcoin advocates have engaged in spirited Twitter exchange since Friday to answer an ostensibly simple question: What’s the total supply of ether?      It’s not quite clear where the question originated. But providing one agreed-upon value for Ethereum’s native currency, ether (ETH), proved contentious enough to warrant new code.      “Adding a proper total supply command to the client seems like a low-cost and reasonable thing to do,” said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in the Ethereum R&D Discord channel last Friday.      Multiple independent developers jumped on the opportunity to set the “world computer’s” supply schedule straight.      The coin supply brouhaha takes place in the context of Bitcoin’s more-easily verifiable coin supply, thanks to the gettxoutsetinfo command, which every Bitcoin node can execute to calculate the current supply. Due to its distinct design features, Ethereum lacked such a command, hence the impetus behind independent developers writing code to calculate its supply.      The total supply of ether is 111,562,994 as of publishing time, according to Messari. (The firm pulls data directly off the blockchain, Messari director of research Eric Turner told CoinDesk.)    Ether, bitcoin and verifiability    The verifiability of assets is both a strong and novel feature of blockchains. Only rough supply counts exist for other assets such as gold or dollars. The supply of a given cryptocurrency, on the other hand, can be parsed down to the exact unit. This is valuable for modeling or auditing, among other reasons.      Bitcoin proponents – notably Kraken developer Pierre Rochard – recently pointed out that Ethereum had no simple method for verifying the supply of its native unit.      Bitcoin’s value and perception as “digital gold” emphasizes its supply characteristics – namely scarcity – moreso than Ethereum, which aims to serve as a developer platform for decentralized financial applications.      Read more: Bitcoin and Gold: Evaluating Hard-Cap Currencies in Times of Financial Crisis      Indeed, many Ethereum community members were dismissive of the supply question. “I don’t give a shit about the supply,” said Augur co-founder and early cryptocurrency investor Jeremy Gardner on Twitter.      Beyond simply running the numbers, however, an additional concern voiced after the fact was the difficulty of running a full Ethereum node. Users who run their own nodes can “self-verify” not only the number of ethers in existence but also the validity of transactions on the Ethereum network.      Self-verification is a popular social concept, as well as an ethical touchstone, for Bitcoin proponents. The argument mainly relies on the ease of bootstrapping a Bitcoin node. Running an Ethereum node, on the other hand, is a much more time- and memory-intensive undertaking, one that’s led to the emergence of a small class of infrastructure service providers.      Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Testnet Medalla Goes Live With 20,000 Validators      Ethereum community members are more dismissive of running a full node based on arguments from Buterin in the project’s early days. Ethereum 2.0 developers are also shooting for self-verification via lightweight clients made possible through Proof-of-Stake (PoS).    Third-party scripts    As attention paid to the supply discussion on Twitter grew, Ethereum developers started building scripts to calculate the supply.      Developers were quick to note that many data sites posted wrong figures because of faulty modeling of coin issuance.      In Ethereum, many third party-scripts fail to calculate a few complexities such as uncle or nephew blocks and burner addresses, cryptocurrency educator Andreas Antonopoulos said in a tweet.      Bitcoin developers have often made similar mistakes, Casa CTO Jameson Lopp tweeted. Lopp said many scripts fail to take into account block rewards, called the coinbase, left unclaimed by miners.      Regardless, Ethereum does have one actual supply figure even if it has been difficult to locate, Geth team leader Péter Szilágyi said in a tweet. If it did not, Ethereum wouldn't work.      “Ethereum has multiple client implementations, so a supply bug in one would instantly break consensus,” Szilágyi said.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/11/how-much-ether-is-out-there-ethereum-developers-create-new-scripts-for-self-verification,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3932bde5a1dd1c9df95bbc2159849242825eb75-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404942,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8fZR,1597162499,Binance Denies Report It Was Blocked From Installing Its CEO on Board of Failing Bank,"Binance said reports Liechtenstein authorities blocked a deal to put its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, on the board of a now-defunct bank are unfounded.      On Monday, Swiss newspaper Inside Paradeplatz reported Liechtenstein's Financial Market Authority (FMA) had rejected an application in July by Union Bank to put Zhao on its board in a bid to rescue the company from imminent liquidation.      But speaking to CoinDesk, a Binance spokesperson denied a deal had been blocked by the FMA and that there was no application to bring the exchange on as a major shareholder of Union Bank. ""Binance did not try to invest, and did not try to put CZ on the board,"" they said in a Telegram message.      In a statement, Binance's CFO Wei Zhou said it had not tried to acquire Union Bank nor put anything in front of the FMA for approval.      Binance's spokesperson, however, declined to comment on whether reports covering the deal were factually inaccurate.      See also: Binance Launching Crypto Exchange in the UK      Local media reported in 2019 that Union Bank laundered funds from a sophisticated scheme tied to Venezuela's state oil company. As a result, its chief executive was forced to leave and the bank was left scrambling trying to find new backers.      According to Monday's report, which has been picked up by other outlets, Binance planned to use some of its crypto reserves to invest through a local entity, funding the bank's pivot to become a platform for cryptocurrency investors.      The FMA was reportedly concerned with the deal's complexity as well as Binance's apparently uncooperative attitude in providing necessary information. It also transpired that a local partner, who had guaranteed the funds in question were clean, had apparently been suspected of fraud.      Per Inside Paradeplatz, the deal was blocked by the FMA in mid-July. On Monday, Union Bank put a note on its website saying it had entered voluntary liquidation. Although it didn't disclose specifics, the note says the board had, in vain, tried to put the bank's activities under a new ""anchor shareholder"" who would provide funds necessary so the bank could meet the minimum capital threshold.

42404939,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8fWU,1597155020,Alchemy Goes Public With Developer Platform in Bid to Grow DeFi Ecosystem,"Blockchain infrastructure startup Alchemy, which helps decentralized finance (DeFi) projects run or access nodes, just launched its full suite of products to the public, after a two-year closed beta serving teams including MakerDAO and Kyber Network.      DeFi projects like MakerDAO, 0x and others all use Alchemy’s solutions to access Ethereum blockchain data, rather than run their own nodes. Alchemy CEO Nikil Viswanathan said more than 70% of top Ethereum applications and more than $2.8 billion worth of assets locked in DeFi rely on Alchemy for access to blockchain data.      “We’ve replaced all the infrastructure providers for most of them,” Viswanathan said, referring to “hundreds” of Ethereum startups that pay for Alchemy’s software services. One such user, Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou, said in a press statement his startup relies on Alchemy for “managing infrastructure,” plus “enterprise-grade tools and support,” so the team can focus on shipping code.      It appears as though most Ethereum startups use one of three infrastructure providers, if not all three of them. For example, Infura, the rival service provider partially owned by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, offers a similar API service. Bison Trails is the other major player in the Ethereum infrastructure trifecta.      Developers pay startups like Infura and Alchemy for access to distant hardware (typically managed by Amazon or Google) and tools to easily use blockchain data. This isn’t a “don’t trust, verify” approach, but it does make it easier for startups to focus on serving retail users.      Read more: Alchemy Notify Wants to Simplify Blockchain UX With a Single Push      “Right now, building with blockchain, it’s like trying to build a skyscraper with a hammer and a shovel. Alchemy is bringing the construction equipment so it’s easier to build things,” Viswanathan said. “We are a pipe to a decentralized network, there are other pipes and people can use whatever pipes that they want.”      From his perspective, having a remote-first company with deliberate redundancy offers a type of decentralization, albeit one divorced from bitcoin’s full stack of self-sovereign aspirations.    Behind the scenes    Viswanathan said his startup facilitated roughly $7.5 billion worth of on-chain transactions over the last year, from exchanges to loan platforms.      That may, in part, be thanks to the fact the startup attracted well-connected investors like Coinbase Ventures, which also invested in Bison Trails.      “As the de facto standard in blockchain, Alchemy already powers the most sophisticated teams,” investor Paul Veradittakit of Pantera Capital said in a press statement.      Read more: Alchemy Launches Product to Help Developers Monitor Blockchain Apps      Even after an explosive year of growth, it’s not hard to imagine all the teams responsible for the DeFi ecosystem fitting in a single university lecture hall. In fact, both Alchemy co-founders graduated from Stanford University and attracted investment from their alma mater as well.      By making some of these services free to the public, Viswanathan said he aims to diversify the DeFi ecosystem.      “Our mission is to make blockchain development accessible to every developer,” Viswanathan said, describing the newly public beta. “Now anyone can sign up and use the same tools powering the biggest companies in crypto.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | KNC | ZRX,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/11/alchemy-goes-public-with-developer-platform-in-bid-to-grow-defi-ecosystem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdb306241ad42b1227d32496adb62d2da08c355e-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform was launched at the ETHGlobal hackathon last year as aliquidity aggregator connecting multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This summer, it reported passing $1 billion threshold in the total volume of tokens going through its smart contracts.      Investors in its funding round, announced Tuesday, also included Galaxy Digital, Greenfield One, Libertus Capital, Dragonfly Capital, FTX, IOSG, LAUNCHub Ventures and Divergence Ventures. Loi Luu, founder of Kyber Network, and Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, also participated.      The startup was founded by its CEO, Sergej Kuntz, a software engineer at German luxury car maker Porsche (and about to leave to go full time for his crypto projects), and CTO Anton Bukov, a former smart-contract developer at NEAR blockchain protocol.      1inch provides swaps between ERC-20 tokens (an Ethereum standard), pulling liquidity from exchanges including Uniswap, Kyber, Bancor, Mooniswap (also founded by Kuntz and Bukov) and others.      See also: DeFi-Focused Derivatives Platform Hedget Raises $500K in Seed Funding      ""When we thought of making an aggregator, there were about five big DEXs on the market, with significant price differences,"" Bukov told CoinDesk. ""First, we created a website showing the best prices, but then figured out we need to split orders between different DEXs to get better prices than each one of those DEXs offered.""      According to market data provider CoinGecko, 1inch is currently facilitating over $20 million in trades daily. And the firm doesn't plan to stop there. There are currently about 17,700 wallets registered on 1inch, according to the startup. The newly announced investment will fuel 1inch's team expansion (it now counts 16 people), new products development and marketing.      See also: Bitcoin’s Stolen Revolution      The project aims to ride the wave of the decentralized finance (or DeFi) ""gold rush"" and perhaps even become the first DeFi unicorn out there, Kuntz said.

In a piece for Bloomberg Law, Louis Lehot of L2 Counsel said Coinbase was ""archetypal for the sort of company that might consider a direct listing.""  Sources speaking to Reuters last month said Coinbase had begun the process of a direct listing – the exchange has so far declined to comment and a public valuation isn't known.  In an IPO, a company creates shares for underwriters – typically investment banks – to distribute to its institutional network that sells on the public market. In a direct listing, the company sells shares to the public, cutting out underwriters.  Coinbase would likely gain little from an IPO, Lehot said. It already has an $8 billion valuation, a recognized brand and a strong following: A roadshow ahead of an IPO would likely do little to drum up further enthusiasm.  In fact, the exchange has more downside risk with an IPO, Lehot said: Underwriters can mark down Coinbase's valuation to sell more shares and maximize fees, a practice that has cost newly public companies tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars.  L2Counsel's website says it is a California legal firm that takes companies from the startup stage to the point of an IPO.  Thomas Kuhn, a macro analyst at Quantitative Economics, agreed with Lehot's sentiments, telling CoinDesk that Coinbase was rejecting a model that put companies at the underwriters' mercy.  Past enthusiasm for tech stocks and the lack of equity exposure digital asset industry means there is already ""significant interest"" for Coinbase to go public, he said.  Furthermore, an exchange that has listed assets on its own platform would likely be ""quite comfortable with the pricing and market mechanics"" of a direct listing anyway, he added.

42404948,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8feM,1597149856,Bitcoin Rally Stalls as Increasingly Correlated Gold Drops Below $2K,"Bitcoin's recent price rally has shifted to a sideways meander, possibly taking cues from gold's drop from record highs.    The cryptocurrency is trading in the general range of $11,600–$11,900 for the fourth straight day.  Meanwhile, the precious metal is trading near $1,988 at press time – down 4.2% from the record high of $2,075 reached on Friday.  Both assets have recently developed a relatively strong positive correlation.  As such, gold's decline may have applied the brakes to bitcoin’s rally from lows near $9,000.  Gold (above right) rallied from $1,800 to $2,075 in the three weeks to Aug. 7.  Over the same period, bitcoin rose from $9,100 to a peak of $12,118.  As a result, the one-month correlation between the two assets has strengthened to a record high of 68.9%, as noted by data source Skew.  While the growing correlation validates the""store of value"" narrative surrounding bitcoin, it also makes the cryptocurrency vulnerable to sell-offs in gold.  “Gold is feeling the pull of gravity with U.S. Treasury yields showing signs of life,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel.  QCP noted that investors should keep a close eye on developments in bond yields and gold because they may have a bearing on bitcoin and ether prices.  The U.S. 10-year bond yield is hovering near 0.6% at press time, representing a 10 basis point gain from the recent low of 0.5%.  Gold, which does not provide a yield, may suffer deeper pullbacks and potentially push bitcoin lower if bond yields continue to rise.  Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, believes a potential sell-off in stock markets is a bigger risk to bitcoin's upward trajectory than pullbacks in gold.  ""A turnaround in stocks could threaten bitcoin, given risk for extended stocks to reverse and the potential to see what we saw back in March,"" Kruger told CoinDesk in a Twitter conversation.

42404940,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8fXT,1597149284,10 Reasons Quant Strategies for Crypto Fail,"Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence platform for crypto assets. He has held leadership roles at major technology companies and hedge funds. He is an active investor, speaker, author and guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York.      The terms ""crypto"" and ""quant"" seem to go perfectly together. Bitcoin and crypto assets were born during one of the most exciting times in capital markets coinciding with the golden era of quantitative finance. The technological acceleration caused by movements such as cloud computing and big data together with the renaissance of machine learning have collided to cause the perfect storm in favor of the quant revolution. Billions of dollars are shifting hands every year from discretionary funds into quant vehicles, and Wall Street cannot hire mathematicians and machine learning experts fast enough.      Being a completely digital asset class, crypto seems like the perfect target for quant models. And yet, quant strategies remain constrained to relatively simple techniques such as statistical arbitrage (a pair trade strategy that looks to exploit market inefficiencies in a pair of securities) and we still haven’t seen the emergence of large dominant quant desks in the market. Despite the attractive characteristics of crypto assets for quant strategies, crypto poses unique challenges for quant models and the reality is that most quant strategies in crypto fail. In this article, I would like to explore some of the fundamental but not obvious reasons that can cause the failure of most quant strategies in the crypto space.      See also: Jesus Rodriguez - Crypto Needn’t Fear GPT-3. It Should Embrace It      By claiming that most quant strategies in crypto fail, I am referring mostly to machine learning strategies. Statistical arbitrage has proven to be an effective mechanism to develop algorithmic strategies, but we should expect those opportunities to disappear as the market increases in size and efficiency. In traditional capital markets, we have seen an explosion in the implementation of machine learning-based quant models and the body of research in the space is growing exponentially.      However, most of the quant strategies proven effective in traditional capital markets are likely to not work as well when applied to crypto assets. Based on some of our recent experience at IntoTheBlock working on predictive models and quant strategies, I’ve listed some of the factors that I believe can cause the failure of quant models for crypto assets.    1. Small datasets    Many of the machine learning-based quant strategies you find in research papers are trained in decades of data from capital markets. The trading history of most crypto assets can be counted in months, and, even for vehicles like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the datasets remain relatively small. Many machine learning models will have a hard time generalizing any knowledge from such small datasets. Let’s say that you are trying to build a predictive model for the price of an asset like ChainLink (LINK), which is red-hot in recent days. It turns out LINK has a very small trading history, which is insufficient to train most machine learning models in quant finance.    2. Regular 'outlier' events    Although the terms ""regular"" and ""outlier"" should not be used in the same sentence, I can’t think of a better term to describe what we experience in crypto assets. Massive price crashes or sudden spikes that, in a lapse of a few hours, change the momentum in any crypto asset. These “outlier” events happen quite frequently with many crypto assets.      From a machine learning perspective, most models will be puzzled with these price movements as they haven’t seen anything similar during training. It’s not surprising that many machine learning quant models got decimated during the flash crash of mid-March or failed to capitalize in the sudden increase in volatility of the last few weeks. It is hard to capture knowledge for those types of events during the training of the model.    3. Propensity to overfit    A side effect of the small market datasets in crypto assets is the propensity of most machine learning quant models to overfit or to “optimize for the training dataset.” We constantly see quant models that perform incredibly well during backtesting just to fail when applied to real market conditions.    4. The regular retraining dilemma    Think about this scenario: You have created a predictive model trained on a few years of Bitcoin trading history, then you experience weeks of almost no volatility followed by a few crazy volatile days (not that it has ever happened before ). You would like to retrain the model to capture that knowledge, but how? If you simply retrain the model in the most recent data, there is a strong chance of overfitting while if you wait then the knowledge might not be relevant any longer.    Talent is a very important, and often overlooked aspect, to grow quant investment as a discipline in the crypto space.    This retraining dilemma is a direct consequence of the “regular outlier events” phenomena. If you train a model in a dataset from the last 10 years of the S&P 500, you can design a strategy to retrain the model regularly as it is unlikely the index will deviate too much from its traditional behavior in short periods of time. This regular retraining of models that has been well adopted in traditional quant strategies goes out the window when it comes to crypto.    5. Data quality and reliability    One of the biggest drawbacks of designing machine learning quant models for crypto assets is the poor quality and reliability of datasets. It is not a secret that many exchange order book datasets are full of records that indicate fake volumes, wash trades or spoofing behavior. Obviously, training a machine learning model using those datasets won’t produce any relevant results. Additionally, almost every week we hear about exchange APIs having outages and shutting down for hours. When was the last time you heard about a Nasdaq API crash? It definitely happens, but not that frequently. That lack of reliability can kill the accuracy of the most robust quant models.    6. Anonymous blockchain records    Blockchain datasets remain one of the richest sources of alpha for quant strategies in the crypto space. But the anonymity of blockchain records makes it really challenging to design meaningful quant models. Let’s say, for instance, that one of the features in a quant strategy leverages the address count in the Ethereum blockchain. Well, addresses that are part of exchanges are fundamentally different from addresses of individual wallets and those are different from miners’ addresses. Labeling blockchain records is essential to design meaningful quant models based on blockchain datasets and, unfortunately, those efforts are still in the very early stages.    7. Factor strategies out the window    Factor models have been at the center of some of the most successful quant strategies in the last two decades. Entire mega funds like AQR were built on the promise of factor investing quant strategies. From the original factors like value, momentum, or quality, factor strategies have grown to hundreds of factors that model relevant behaviors in financial asset classes.      At least until today, most factor strategies have proven to be ineffective in the context of crypto assets. When it comes to crypto, factors like value and quality are not clearly defined and the behavior of others such as momentum defies conventional patterns. This causes many crypto quant desks to spend numerous hours trying to recreate factor-based strategies that are highly unlikely to perform in the crypto space.    8. Simple model fallacy    The field of quantitative finance is rapidly gravitating towards large and complex models regularly outperform simpler and more specialized models. This trend is a reflection of what’s happening in the entire machine learning space. The advent of deep learning showed us it’s possible to create highly complex neural networks that acquire knowledge in the most unthinkable ways.      Funds like TwoSigma and WorldQuant are actively pushing deep learning research and incorporating ideas coming out of the AI labs of tech giants like Google, Microsoft, or Facebook. Yet, in the world of crypto, most quant strategies still rely on very basic machine learning paradigms like linear regression or decision trees.      Simpler models are unquestionably attractive given that they are easy to understand, but they can have a hard time generalizing knowledge from a complex environment such as the crypto markets. As a machine learning environment, crypto combines the complexity of a financial market with the inefficiencies and uncertainty of a new asset class. Definitely not the best fit for simple quant strategies.    9. Basic quant infrastructures    Complementing the previous point, most quant infrastructures in the crypto space are relatively nascent. A robust quant infrastructure goes beyond good strategies and includes elements such as risk management, backtesting, portfolio management, strategy execution, error recovery and many others. In the crypto space, the quant infrastructure of most hedge funds remains relatively simple which makes it difficult to operate certain types of strategies.      See also: Jesus Rodriguez - Myths and Realities: Sentiment Analysis for Crypto Assets      For instance, suppose that you have designed a beautiful deep learning quant strategy that forecasts the price of Bitcoin based on blockchain datasets. To operate that strategy, a fund would need an infrastructure that collects blockchain records regularly, has the computer infrastructure to run deep learning models, the appropriate retraining tool, and so on.      Today’s technology has certainly reduced the time and cost required to build a quant infrastructure to run machine learning models, but quant desks remain relatively basic compared to those operating in traditional capital markets.    10. Talent availability    I left the most controversial point to the end. As a financial market, crypto is still failing to attract top quant talent with relevant experience in traditional capital markets. We are still tackling incredibly complex problems such as forecasting the behavior of an asset class with relatively simple models, basic infrastructure and poor processes. Talent is a very important, and often overlooked aspect, to grow quant investment as a discipline in the crypto space. There are incredibly talented quant teams in crypto, but they are the exception, not the rule.      These are some points that might cause us to reflect about the current state of quant investment in the crypto space. Crypto is an ideal asset class for quant strategies and, in the long run, quant funds should be the dominant investment vehicle in crypto. The path includes many challenges, but also fascinating opportunities.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/11/10-reasons-quant-strategies-for-crypto-fail,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd32e4d5ebe01594026acf674c11352b7c3f4d70-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Disclosing its bitcoin buy alongside an equivalent stock buyback in a Tuesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing, MicroStrategy, a Nasdaq-listed software firm worth over $1.2 billion, said the cryptocurrency provided a ""reasonable hedge against inflation"" in a press statement shared with CoinDesk.  “This investment reflects our belief that bitcoin, as the world’s most widely adopted cryptocurrency, is a dependable store of value and an attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash,"" said CEO Michael J. Saylor.  Saylor cited forces working to weaken fiat currencies – COVID-19, global quantitative easing measures, political and economic uncertainty – but also the technical and qualitative aspects that he said give the bitcoin blockchain strength.  “We find the global acceptance, brand recognition, ecosystem vitality, network dominance, architectural resilience, technical utility and community ethos of bitcoin to be persuasive evidence of its superiority as an asset class for those seeking a long-term store of value,"" Saylor said.  The capital allocation quickly fulfills Saylor's late July promise to shareholders that MicroStrategy would buy back $250 million in stock and invest an additional $250 million in gold and bitcoin over the next 12 months.  The belief was that these and other ""alternative investments"" would protect MicroStrategy's dollar-heavy balance sheet.  It is now clear that half of the $500 million bet turns entirely on bitcoin.

42404936,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8fTX,1597147444,"Following OCC Letter, Some US Banks Appear Open to Providing Crypto Services","Major U.S. banks might be willing to support cryptocurrency services – with just a bit of additional guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), their federal regulator.      Multiple national banks responded to the OCC’s June “Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” (ANPR), which asked the general public to weigh in before Aug. 3. on how cryptocurrencies and other fintech tools might be used in the financial sector. Notably, several banks, including U.S. Bank and PNC, indicated they might be interested in actually providing crypto custody and other services to customers.      The responses by just under a dozen banks, among a total of 89 submissions from think tanks, policy advocates, crypto startups and other entities, represent one of the strongest signs yet that traditional financial institutions view the still-nascent crypto space as a legitimate asset class.      The responses contrast sharply with an open letter sent to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks. The letter, which opposed a narrow payments charter for fintech companies, was signed by many of the same respondents and sent to the OCC on July 29.      Fresh guidance from the OCC may help provide the necessary legal comfort for banks to provide crypto-native analogs to traditional bank services, wrote Juan Saurez, Coinbase’s vice president and general counsel for enterprise.      “Although these services, such as borrowing, lending and remittances, are permissible activities for national banks, there remains some uncertainty as to whether the provision of these services using cryptocurrencies is authorized,” he said.      Peter Najarian, chief revenue officer at BitGo, told CoinDesk the ANPR’s very existence is exciting, as it’s “a frankly inevitable step in the maturing of this ecosystem.”    Clarifying treatment    Dominic Venturo, chief digital officer at U.S. Bank National Association, perhaps went the furthest in his response, writing that the OCC and other banking regulators should issue guidance around the cryptocurrency market as well as the “expectations for services conducted on distributed ledger technology.”      A lack of clear regulations might result in both banks and customers being unwilling to invest or use cryptocurrencies and similar digital assets, he wrote, with customers potentially being interested in investing in crypto, funding traditional financial products, using cryptos as payments, tokenizing physical assets.      “U.S. Bank does not have a position on the role that cryptocurrency should undertake in the financial services sector, but merely seeks additional regulatory clarity to service the cryptocurrency market as it is currently structured or may be structured in the future,” he wrote.      The OCC should work with the other federal regulators to clarify how cryptocurrencies and digital assets are treated, Venturo wrote.      Read more: Banks in US Can Now Offer Crypto Custody Services, Regulator Says      Specifically, he suggested the OCC differentiate between utility tokens, stablecoins and exchange tokens; clarify the requirements for providing custody services; cross-border restrictions; and “the extent consensus rules must be a part of a transaction.”      PNC Bank’s head of technology and innovation, Steven Van Wyk, commented that the OCC should “continue to reinforce that national banks should take a risk-based approach” in reviewing new products, but should not have risk elimination as the ultimate goal.      “All banking activities (including deposit-taking and lending) involve risk, and the implementation of new technologies … necessarily will involve some degree of risk,” Van Wyk wrote. “A supervision framework that is focused only on preventing risk will, almost by necessity, prevent responsible innovation and the implementation of new technologies by national banks.”    User protections    Financial institutions – and OCC rulemaking – should have some focus on consumer protections, several of the responses indicated.      Banks might even need to be encouraged to use “privacy-enhancing cryptocurrency technologies,” wrote Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center’s director of research.      He said banks are obligated to both protect their customers’ privacy as well as surveil and report activities that may break the law. In his view, they can do this effectively with privacy coins and other tools.      Banks can conduct know-your-customer checks and otherwise identify their users to comply with relevant laws before providing privacy services by using mixers or other tools to facilitate crypto transactions.      Read more: Goldman Sachs Eyes Own Token as Bank Appoints New Head of Digital Assets      “They should perform heightened due diligence on any payments their customers initiate or receive if either the amounts involved are substantial or a suspicious pattern of behavior has emerged with respect to several smaller transactions,” Van Valkenburgh wrote.      Tina Woo, senior managing counsel for regulatory affairs at Mastercard, also suggested consumer protection rules by the OCC would be helpful, addressing both security and privacy concerns.      The OCC should develop criteria for which “types of cryptocurrencies in which banks may transact,” she wrote, which address “core network principles” including protecting consumers and preventing money laundering or terrorist financing.      “We believe cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology hold the potential to enhance operational resiliency, improve auditability, and enable new functionalities,” she wrote.    ‘Based on confidence’    Not all submissions were positive: some expressed concern about relaxing regulations.      Cornell Law School Professor Dan Awrey, Wharton Financial Institutions Center Senior Fellow James McAndrews and Columbia Law School Academic Fellow and Lecturer Lev Menand wrote the OCC’s ANPR has two major flaws: “an excessive focus” on finding ways to relax existing rules and “its narrow focus” in updating the regulatory framework for national banks and savings associations.      Menand is an advocate for a digital dollar structure, and supported efforts to introduce a digital dollar in multiple congressional bills earlier this year.      “Money and payment systems are based on confidence,” the three wrote. “In the case of the national banking system, this confidence stems from highly sophisticated regulatory frameworks that govern national banks. These regulatory frameworks include federal deposit insurance, access to central bank liquidity support and a special resolution regime.”      In other words, individuals trust banks because of a strict regulatory regime that lets them deposit their funds secure in the knowledge their money is safeguarded.      The second flaw relates to the existing legal structure surrounding banks and savings associations, they wrote.      Read more: US Banking Regulator Suggests Federal Licensing Framework for Crypto Firms      The ANPR notes that many new financial technologies exist because newly created institutions and platforms try to perform banking functions but aren’t regulated like traditional banks.      The OCC should consider whether it makes more sense to strengthen regulations around non-bank financial institutions, which the letter refers to as “shadow payment systems.”      New financial technology firms that sprung up in recent years, including stablecoin issuers and companies like PayPal, operate in a murky regulatory environment that requires far fewer protections than banks face.      To resolve these concerns, the three said Congress could pass new laws requiring these startups hold insured deposits and deposits at commercial banks. Stablecoin issuers could be required to maintain either the sum total of U.S. dollars or the U.S. dollar equivalent of issued tokens at a bank.      “The OCC should recommend that Congress enact new legislation to address the shortcomings in our existing regulatory framework. Such legislation can be quite simple,” they wrote.    Third party help    Banks don’t necessarily have to provide crypto services directly. BitGo, which has offered custody services for over a year, believes that banks should be able to tap sub-custodians to provide these services, Najarian said.      This would relieve banks of the technological and resource burden that would come of having to directly build out their own services.      Miller Whitehouse-Levine at the Blockchain Association told CoinDesk he agreed. The industry organization recommended letting third parties provide certain services for banks in its own response, he said.      “The OCC permits banks to engage third parties to conduct what they consider to be critical bank activities,” he told CoinDesk.      Visa Vice President for Global Regulatory Affairs Ky Tran-Trong wrote that the payment rail wants to be an intermediary for cryptocurrencies and its 61 million merchants.      Read more: Banks Won’t Rush to Hold Crypto – But OCC’s Regulatory Approval Makes It Harder to Ignore      “Our objective is to enable digital currency users to spend from their digital currency balance using a Visa debit or prepaid credential anywhere Visa is accepted,” Tran-Trong said in the letter.      R3, another third-party service provider, touted its integrations with SWIFT, Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse Group, noting these partnerships have allowed participants in financial transactions to monitor these transactions more efficiently than traditional tools provided for.      In particular Nasdaq has launched a platform tapping R3 to help manage issuance and other services, wrote Isabelle Corbett, R3’s global head of government relations.    Ongoing dialogue    Kristin Boggiano, founder of the Digital Asset Regulatory and Legal Alliance and co-founder of trading platform CrossTower, told CoinDesk the OCC is in its initial stage of rulemaking, meaning this is the best time for the industry to express its concerns and make suggestions to the agency.      “Once the broad policy has been etched, market participants and regulators will move to proposed rulemaking,” she said through a spokesperson. “At that stage, the ability to engage in dialogue about policy and the broad framework becomes more difficult. Thus, this is a critical time for market participants and regulators to jointly develop a framework in which all stakeholders are comfortable.”      Read more: ‘Inherently Borderless’: Acting OCC Chief Talks Crypto, State Licenses and DeFi      A wide range of industry participants appear to agree: Novi (the rebranded Facebook subsidiary Calibra), ConsenSys, Celo, Axos Bank, the American Bankers Association, Figure Technologies, Chamber of Digital Commerce, Silvergate Bank, Ripple Labs and other respondents all supported the idea that banks and savings institutions can safely handle crypto-related services with the right amount of regulation.      The Blockchain Association’s Kristin Smith told CoinDesk it is important, as a first step, for any entity that has a stake in the crypto industry to ensure it weighs in with the OCC..      Visa’s Tran-Trong summed up his hope for the OCC’s ultimate rulemaking process by calling for new regulation that still allows for innovation:      “We recognize that enterprise adoption of blockchain technology can improve several core functions in financial services by providing tamper evident and tamper resistant digital ledgers. However, absent further innovations, inherent challenges with respect to improving scalability, security and device usage, can limit consumer adoption and fail to meet regulatory standards,” he wrote.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/11/following-occ-letter-some-us-banks-appear-open-to-providing-crypto-services,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af33378d8eae8e57afc44325aba4b8779ba0286b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404953,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8fiI,1597146395,"First Mover: After Falling 65% This Year in Bitcoin Terms, Do 'Stablecoins' Need a Rebranding?","Imagine a future where bitcoin has taken over from the U.S. dollar as the world's de facto reserve currency. Assuming bitcoin's notorious price volatility continued to that day, major currencies would be considered volatile assets.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Here's a chart of how foreign-exchange rates would have looked over the past few months had the dollar, euro, yen and British pound been denominated in bitcoin:      Such a mental exercise is one of the points highlighted in a recent report on ""stablecoins"" by Matt Walsh and Nic Carter of the cryptocurrency investment firm Castle Island Ventures.      In the taxonomy of digital assets, stablecoins are a category of tokens whose value is linked to dollars or other major currencies or assets. The idea is that their prices are more stable than those of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.      But Walsh and Carter refer to dollar-backed stablecoins as ""crypto-dollars."" Stability, in other words, is in the eye of the beholder.      ""Though initially dubbed 'stablecoins,' due to their emergence as a response to volatile 'native' cryptocurrencies, they are increasingly being referred to as crypto-dollars,"" the report reads.      Such a rebranding could gain traction as dollar-linked stablecoins grow in popularity – even though they've been a pretty lousy investment option in recent months compared with bitcoin.      As detailed in First Mover last week, every digital asset in the CoinDesk 20 gained in July except for dollar-linked stablecoins, whose prices were, by definition, unchanged in dollar terms.      That's partly a reflection of how weak the dollar has been trading in foreign-exchange markets lately, which in turn is a reflection of investors' pessimistic views on the dollar's value as the coronavirus-induced recession drags on.      The total outstanding amount of these ""crypto-dollars"" has more than doubled in the past four months to about $13 billion, according to Coin Metrics, a cryptocurrency data firm.      Crypto traders use the tokens as a form of liquidity, transferring funds easily between digital-asset exchanges.      The tokens are essentially privately issued digital money, and Castle Island points out that they might someday figure in a ""global patchwork of crypto-dollar issuers."" Already, a group of 16 of the dollar-linked stablecoins collectively has a broad monetary base greater than that of 72 countries.      There's a ""growing acceptance of crypto-dollars in commerce,"" according to the report, as well as a ""recognition that these assets are not merely tokens for inter-exchange settlement but have begun to see usage as non-bank dollar substitutes.""      Jump Capital, an investment firm, wrote in an op-ed for The Block last week that, at least for now, ""people want dollars.""      ""Despite potential concerns about U.S. monetary policy and debt levels, for billions of people around the world, the U.S. dollar is more stable than their local currency,"" according to the piece. They predicted that the market value of stablecoins could eventually outstrip that of bitcoin, currently at $218 billion.      ""We believe U.S. dollar stablecoins, or crypto-dollars, may very well end up being the 'killer app' for crypto,"" the authors wrote. ""We may very well end up hearing calls for 'Stablecoins not bitcoin' in the same way we heard 'Blockchain not bitcoin' a few years ago.""      Such an outlook assumes people continue to want stability in dollar terms. After all, prices for the oldest and largest cryptocurrency are up 65% this year against the dollar.      Which means those crypto-dollars are down 65% this year, in bitcoin terms.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $11,764 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,982 | 24-Hr Low: $11,663      Trend: Bitcoin's rally looks to be on pause after the bulls failed to keep gains above the $12,000 mark on Monday.      The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading near $11,760, representing a 1.3% decline on the day. Buyers pushed prices to a high of $12,070 on Monday, but the breakout was again short-lived and prices printed a UTC close below $11,800.      Bitcoin's failure to establish a foothold above the psychological $12K hurdle validates uptrend exhaustion signaled by lower highs on the daily chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and trend strength. Further, the 10-day moving average is no longer sloping upwards – also a sign of ebbing of bullish momentum.      As such, some chart-driven traders may start to sell, yielding a deeper pullback. Immediate support is located near $11,670 at the ascending trendline on the 4-hour chart. A breach there would expose the higher low of $11,219 created on the 4-hour chart on Aug. 7.      However, if the ascending trendline holds firm, a bounce to $12,000 may be seen.      That said, the greater short-term pressure may be to the downside, as gold has fallen back below $2,000 per ounce.

42404949,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAe8fgK,1597141369,India May Be Starting Its Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Yet,"India’s crypto trade volumes have soared since the Supreme Court of India lifted banking restrictions for exchanges in March.      According to Coin Dance's Paxful and LocalBitcoins volume data, India’s bitcoin peer-to-peer trade volume reached an all-time high in July.      Siddhartha Dutta, CEO of Marlin, a tech startup in Bangalore, said the recent spike in demand for bitcoin mirrors Indians’ reaction to demonetization in 2016. Back then some people learned the value of holding bitcoin, whose issuance is not controlled by any government, when the Indian government recalled a vast percentage of paper currency.      The old bills suddenly lost value due to a government decree. The idea that bitcoin’s value is based on market principles, instead of fickle government policies, made it particularly attractive.      The price of bitcoin on Zebpay, an Indian crypto exchange, had surged from $757 to $1,020 in 18 days after demonetization, while the bitcoin price in the U.S. remained relatively static. For some Indian investors, investing in bitcoin was a safe option to store their wealth and minimize the uncertainties caused by demonetization and a possible gold ban.      India’s growing crypto market dramatically slowed in 2018, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ordered financial institutions to avoid working with crypto exchanges.      Read more: The Big Thing Holding Back India’s Crypto Boom      Now, the lifting of banking restrictions appears to have unleashed pent-up demand for cryptocurrency, which no government can declare worthless. These days bitcoin activity is ramping up across India on peer-to-peer exchanges such as Paxful and LocalBitcoins.      As the chart below shows, India’s peer-to-peer bitcoin transaction volumes have doubled over the last five months.      According to a spokeswoman for Paxful, one of the leading peer-to-peer trading platforms, India is now among the five fastest-growing bitcoin user groups in the world. Paxful’s Indian volumes surged from around $576,000 in May 2019 to $8.97 million in July 2020, and the total peer-to-peer Indian volumes on Paxful and LocalBitcoins reached $13.7 million. Smaller exchanges serving the Indian market, like Delta Exchange, are also seeing rapid growth (though Delta is a derivatives exchange, not a spot market). Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani said new signups are growing 100% month-over-month.      Dutta believes crypto has also been slowly gaining traction thanks to mesh networks that help provide connectivity and fast streaming in rural areas. This could signal the start of an even bigger adoption cycle.      “People in India are getting exposed to the internet, mobile first,” Dutta said. However, he added, this growth should not be mistaken for “mainstream” adoption.

Bangalore-based entrepreneur Prashanth Balasubramanian is the co-founder of the Lightning wallet startup Lastbit. Lastbit aims to reach beyond the Indian market to serve Europe and eventually North America. But since 2020 will be a year of relative quarantine, Balasubramanian is thinking it's a good time to build at home.      “Silicon Valley is a fantastic place for business, but as a young company we're able to function more effectively and keep things lean with a 10x difference in runway by using our Indian roots,” he said.      Dutta said he expects that cryptocurrency projects will continue to proliferate across India’s tech industry during the coronavirus recession.      “There is certainly potential to grow much more,” Dutta said.

In the Federal Register last week, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Dept. of Agriculture's standardization and testing authority, said distributed ledger technology (DLT), which includes blockchain, will likely play an ""essential role"" in complex supply chains.  Businesses can use DLT to track a single item in real time in a secure, verifiable and transparent way, AMS said.  The agency added many modern DLT solutions are permissioned; confidential and business-sensitive information is only disclosed to authorized entities.  Supply chain management is already an established use case for blockchain – the likes of Daimler, Tesla and Amazon have all explored using DLT in theirs.  GrainChain, a blockchain platform tracing agricultural products, raised $5 million in a funding round earlier this year.

According to a report Tuesday by Australian news outlet Information Age, 25-year-old Kathryn Nguyen was sentenced to two years and three months by Judge Chris Craigie for hacking a victim's wallet and making off with over 100,000 units of XRP.  Nguyen and an associate infiltrated a 56-year-old man’s cryptocurrency account by swapping his two-factor authentication to her own mobile phone.  She later transferred the stolen XRP to an unnamed exchange where it was traded for bitcoin before being distributed across multiple wallets.  The funds are now worth just under US$30,000, but were reportedly exchanged at the cryptocurrency's peak in early 2018 when they were worth up to around $300,000.  Judge Craigie said the crime was “out of character” for Nguyen and that her “moral judgment was distorted” at the time.  After an almost 12-month investigation, police raided Nguyen's home in Epping, a suburb of Sydney, last year, seizing computers, mobile phones and money.  Detective Superintendent Matthew Craft said reporting of cyber-related crime was a national issue and not solely that of the state of New South Wales.
