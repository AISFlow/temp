42397569,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYfR,1398110636,500 Startups Funds Five Bitcoin Startups With $100k Each,"California-based accelerator 500 Startups has announced it will fund five bitcoin companies in its latest batch of startups with $100,000 each.  The bitcoin startups are part of 500's Batch 9 group – a total of 30 companies building business ideas over a period of four months at the accelerator.  Sean Percival, who runs the incubator for this batch, says the funding will allow the bitcoin startups to really focus on product:  ""$100,000 for these companies is going to go a long way. For some of them it actually provides them a year of runway, so they don’t have to go raise money and they can really prove the product out.""  Building bitcoin businesses  In addition to the $100,000 in funding, the bitcoin companies in the 500 Startups programme will receive mentoring from experts within the industry.  ""I’m looking to bring in thought leaders in bitcoin that can help them, and to help them find the right investors,"" said Percival, ""because there’s not many of them.""  He believes that Silicon Valley only has a handful of investors interested in bitcoin because the total addressable market isn't very large yet:  ""Consumer adoption is very low right now, and it’s not growing at the pace it probably needs to.""  500 Startups is known for embracing marketing and distribution in order to build up its companies. Percival's background is in marketing, so his experiences will translate into helping to get the word out about these businesses in order to grow mainstream awareness.  Talent  Another reason why 500 Startups is so generous with its funding is because the accelerator understands the cost of hiring developer talent in Northern California.  Percival says that most startups need to go out and find software development expertise to help build a company:  ""In most cases, they need to hire developers. And developers are costly. With that money, it’s not just one guy in a corner trying to make it work.""  The Bitcoin Job Fair, being held next month at the Plug and Play Technology accelerator, is one source of that Percival sees as one avenue for finding talent in the area. ""A few of them are going to attend that,"" he said.  Bitcoin accelerators  There are currently three other Silicon Valley accelerator programmes that are incubating bitcoin companies in addition to 500 Startups.  Boost VC has had the largest number of bitcoin-based startups go through its programme and plans on funding 100 more in the next few years.  Plug and Play Technology Center in Sunnyvale is also accepting bitcoin startups. CrossCoin Ventures in downtown San Francisco is also looking to fill out its space with virtual currency companies.  Percival says the incubator ecosystem that exists today is collegial in nature; the accelerators all understand that it takes a group to help build an industry around cryptocurrencies:  ""All the accelerators are sort of being very symbiotic. We’re all in this together right now, we have a lot of work to do.""  Companies  The five bitcoin companies in 500 Startups' programme include:  GoGoCoin – sells bitcoin in gift card form to provide an easy way for users to obtain their first BTC  Bonifide.io – anonymous transaction ratings to help users build up a reputation score  Coinalytics – bringing real-time data to users via information analytics and news aggregation  Neuroware – HTML5 wallet, private keys are stored in a user's brain using distributed deterministic components  Monetsu – focusing on merchant adoption and payment processing  Bitcoin is the core business for each of these companies. Altcoins aren't at the stage that a startup should really be focusing a company on, according to Percival:  ""I’m mostly focused on bitcoin. I’m interested in some of the other things going on, the altcoins. But all of the companies are focused on bitcoin.""  500 Startups image via betakit",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/21/500-startups-funds-five-bitcoin-startups-with-100k-each,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cbc99cd791cba01dccb9988bb202526da488e3ca-1400x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374518,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCdt,1398106908,Decentralized Internet Project MaidSafe to Raise Funds via 'Safecoin' Sale,"Starting tomorrow, decentralized Internet platform builder MaidSafe will hold a crowd sale of currency-like tokens called 'safecoins' to support its enabling software.  MaidSafe, over seven years in development, aims to create no less than a fully peer-to-peer and decentralised Internet platform, in which all data is 'shredded', encrypted and distributed to an extensive network of computers around the world.  The technology allows developers to build applications in which all data is completely secure, private, and protected from deletion.  During the initial sale, safecoins will be made available via purchase of a 'proxy token' called MaidSafeCoin. These are recorded on the bitcoin block chain and available from buysafecoins.com at a price of 17,000 for 1 BTC, or 3,400 for 1 MSC (Mastercoin).  Initially this will raise funds for the project, but the safecoin tokens themselves are a kind of altcoin for developers and users to 'buy' access to network resources.  The sale begins at 9am GMT on Tuesday 22nd April.  Once the MaidSafe network itself goes live, holders of MaidSafeCoins can swap them for 'regular' (ie: no longer on the bitcoin block chain) safecoin tokens at a 1:1 ratio.  Decentralization at its core  MaidSafe, which stands for ""Massive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access For Everyone"" is a 100% open-source project aiming at keeping all data free from malicious intruders and eavesdroppers, at the same time increasing access speed and protecting against hardware failure.  Development of the network is also known as Project SAFE.  Said David Irvine, MaidSafe's founder and CEO:  “What bitcoin is doing for decentralizing money, safecoin will do for decentralizing all Internet services, including enterprise data centers.”  The organization, a 14-member team based in Scotland, was founded in 2006 and has received $5m in funding to date. It has the ambitious goal of replacing all existing major Internet protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and DNS.  No third parties  Since MaidSafe is a platform, use of its protocols is all based on a voluntary 'contract' between self-authenticating users and the network itself, without the participation of other humans or the need for passwords to be transmitted across any part of the network.  It uses unused storage space and computing resources provided by users themselves, or 'nodes', to store and run the repetitive and encryption-based tasks that power the system and allow the rightful owners to access or share their data.  File data is also shredded, encrypted by using its own data to generate keys, and sent to numerous physical locations.  This redundancy ensures data is never accidentally lost due to deletion or hardware failure. Physical access to a complete file is impossible, locking out snoopers and data thieves. Denial of service (DOS) attacks are, according to MaidSafe's explanation, ""thwarted and useless"".  Network performance  MaidSafe's architecture features 'intelligent caching', which actually increases speed and network performance to the most-accessed data as more users join, rather than slowing it down due to server pressure on the existing Internet.  Software running on the various nodes allocates and optimizes network resources, and routes around failures or machines that happen to be offline.  The network's nodes are chained together in a cryptographic consensus model similar to a block chain, in which they watch (anonymously) each others' behaviour and raise the alarm in case of any discrepancy.  Released to the world  As well as open-sourcing all the code that enables the system, MaidSafe has released all its patents and algorithms for public use at no cost. The patents are officially owned by a registered charity called the MaidSafe Foundation, and are to be used ""only in a defensive capacity"".  Developers can access the open API to build decentralized applications that are fully secure and private.  MaidSafe sees its system being used for any communications requiring this level of security and privacy, and suggests it for sharing scientific research data, whistleblowing activism, and more prosaic uses such as personal data storage, social networking, and simple communications like messaging, email and video/voice chat.  ""Real sharing will defeat many global issues,"" says MaidSafe's introductory video.  Sale details  The safecoin/MaidSafeCoin crowd-sale will continue for 30 days or until 10% (429,496,729) of the total tokens are sold, whichever happens first.  Bonus MaidSafeCoins will also be allocated on a sliding scale to early buyers, with first-weekers earning an extra 40%. The bonus drops 10% per week after that until the end of the initial sale.  Once the MaidSafe network is live, users can still earn the remaining safecoins through the system's 'proof of resource' (POR) system known as 'farming', by contributing part of their computers' resources as a node on the network and using fewer resources than they contribute.  Fifteen per cent of all safecoins earned will be contributed as an incentive to the pool of developers, or 'builders', who create the applications necessary for ordinary users to utilize MaidSafe's features.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/21/decentralized-internet-project-maidsafe-to-raise-funds-via-safecoin-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fbabc5c3ffcda4ad6dbd0976ebd2c38f94d1fb9-1000x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397566,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYcU,1398103461,Chrome Extension Could Be Vulnerable to Cryptocurrency Malware,"A browser extension for Google Chrome is reportedly capable of stealing bitcoin and other altcoins from its users.  Called the 'Cryptsy Dogecoin (DOGE) Live Ticker' in the Chrome Web Store, the extension is susceptible to updates that begin monitoring visits to cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet sites. A representative from Cryptsy has told CoinDesk that the exchange is not affiliated with the extension in any way.  The warning about the extension was posted on reddit, along with the following advice:  ""Be careful of what you install on your devices you use to access your wallets.""  How it steals coins  Software within the extension monitors web activity and looks for users who go to exchange sites such as Coinbase. During a transaction, the extension attempts to replace the receiving address with one of its own.  A reddit user reported this happening in a withdrawal from cryptocurrency exchange MintPal, having had the extension installed.  Extensions or add-ons that are related to cryptocurrencies are a logical tool for would-be thieves, as cryptocurrency-related software is generally used by those who hold onto digital coins.  Malware on the rise  The presence of cryptocurrency-related malware is on an upward trend. The rising value of coins, coupled with the increasing number of altcoins has essentially created a new cottage industry, whereby malicious software tries to steal virtual money.  Dell SecureWorks released a report in February stating that it had identified almost 150 different strains of bitcoin-related malware.  Another sought-after method of malware infects a device and tries to generate coins by mining, which is not very effective given the specialized hardware now required to complete proof-of-work algorithms that reward miners.  Ultimately, it ends up being a huge resource drain for users' machines. Or, as in this instance, a seemingly useful tool like the Cryptsy Dogecoin Live Ticker ends up being used for nefarious purposes.  Protecting coins  To guarantee high levels of security, it's important to choose an exchange or wallet service that enables two-factor authentication. This method of verifying actions requires more than one device, which will decrease the chances of malware making changes to your transactions.  It might be better, though, to simply store coins in a brain wallet or paper wallet. Bitcoin Vigil, which monitors bitcoin theft, is a concept that may be useful for thwarting thieves, since storing coins on a local machine connected to the internet has vulnerabilities.  As Cryptsy Dogecoin Live Ticker demonstrates, it is probably better to simply stay away from add-ons and extensions on any computer used to store your coins.

42397554,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYSe,1398076848,Mother: Mark Karpeles 'Lacks People Skills but Was Never Dishonest',"The mother of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles says her son is a poor communicator who easily allows others to take advantage of him, but she insists he is not dishonest.  Tokyo-based Mt. Gox had been the largest and oldest bitcoin exchange in the world until it collapsed and declared itself bankrupt in late February, having lost vast amounts of its customers' bitcoins – allegedly to hackers.  In an interview with Reuters, Anne Karpeles said her son was always a bright child, a prodigy who was admitted to IQ society Mensa as a teenager. However, Anne says her son’s people skills did not keep up with his intelligence.  She described Mark as a gifted child with a love of computing, but at the same time she pointed out he was a terrible student who was often taken advantage of.  Easily led  Karpeles grew up in Dijon, France. Anne says he was always extremely nice and had a “tendency to let himself get taken for a ride by others”. Mark was too conciliatory and his classmates took advantage by asking him to do their homework for them, Anne said.  ""He was a terrible student. Terrible. Most subjects didn't interest him. He took a Mensa test, passed it and was admitted into Mensa [...] during his teenage years. Prodigies understand things straight away, but you don't learn without repetition, without exercises. But that he didn't understand,"" she told Reuters.  Anne says, like many gifted children, Mark had a difficult childhood. He was shuffled from school to school and at one school he had “big problems” with the teacher. As a result Anne tried and failed to get Mark interested in all sorts of hobbies, from drawing and music, to cookery and sewing. None of it worked until Anne shared her love of computers with her young son.  Self-taught PHP expert  Mark started programming BASIC on the family Sinclair when he was just five or six years old. He never went to university and decided to ditch formal education after a bad year in high school. Not long after, Anne saw him walking around with a huge book on PHP – a scripting language used for web development.  Said Anne:  “He told me he had become a doctor in PHP.”  Mark started working in tech and tried to set up a server company in Israel. He then joined software firm Nexway and in 2009 he was offered a post in Japan. He was happy to take the job, having long held a fascination for the Land of the Rising Sun.  However, even though his software career took off, Mark’s people skills did not improve. Anne says Mark's communication at a personal level is ""catastrophic"" and that he is still an introvert.  She says the first time she heard Mark was involved in Mt. Gox was when a local reporter phoned her for comment. She had to look up Mt. Gox on Wikipedia and she does not appear to have any info other than what she could read in the media.  'Never dishonest'  Anne says does not understand the allegations and that she would be shocked if Mark did anything dishonest.  Anne Karpeles said:  “I've never seen him do anything dishonest. He has sometimes trusted in people who were dishonest.""  She added that she would not cover for Mark if there was dishonesty on his part. Anne also said she does not know anything about her son’s previous computer fraud convictions (allegedly admitted to in a 2006 blog post).  Anne visited Mark in Japan last November and witnessed him working long hours, fending off cyber attacks, she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/21/mother-mark-karpeles-lacks-people-skills-but-was-never-dishonest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6444744f58b583ce28c542165920e5fd8989c158-960x541.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397555,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbCYUc,1398076816,OpenSSL Software Foundation Now Accepts Bitcoin Donations,"Those wanting to support the OpenSSL project can now make donations in bitcoin, as well as via more traditional means of payment.  First released in 1998, OpenSSL is a commercial-grade, open-source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.  Currently at version 1.0.1g, and with 1.0.2 currently in beta, it is estimated that OpenSSL is now used on two-thirds of all web servers.  However, the OpenSSL project is headed by a relatively small team with just one full-time employee. The annual budget for the whole project is under $1m and much of the money comes in the form of donations through the OpenSSL Software Foundation.  The OSF, which was set up to support the project, is incorporated as a regular for-profit organisation, so the donations are not tax-deductible, but corporate donations are considered business expenses.  Four levels of sponsorship acknowledgement are on offer, starting at $5,000 a year, and ad hoc donations of any amount are also welcome. The foundation accepts several major credit cards and PayPal, as well as – as of a few days ago – bitcoin.  Bug oversight  OpenSSL does not get a lot of media coverage except in professional, niche publications.  However, a few weeks ago the foundation got its 15 minutes of fame for all the wrong reasons, when the notorious Heartbleed bug – which was caused by an oversight in OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f – came to light.  The flaw was identified two weeks ago and was quickly patched up by the vast majority of companies, including bitcoin operators and Bitcoin Core developers.  Caution is still advised, however, and many sites and services are advising users to change their passwords for additional security and peace of mind.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/21/openssl-software-foundation-now-accepts-bitcoin-donations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f0d1e8673372522f6e22131d2ff287f8b4984b70-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
