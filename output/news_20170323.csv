42379335,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Vpn,1490301350,Bitcoin Core Roadmap Unveils Signature Optimization Plan,"Bitcoin Core developers released a new technology roadmap today that charts the project's planned transition from its current digital signature algorithm to a more advanced alternative.  If implemented, the proposal would find 'Schnorr signatures' replacing the ECDSA signatures bitcoin uses today to sign transactions. By making the switch, developers argue they can decrease the total data in bitcoin's blockchain by up to 25%.  For users, this means nodes that store the network's transaction history would see better bandwidth while using less storage to secure the entire blockchain.  The post describes:  ""Assuming every historical signature would be reduced to 1 byte, except for one per transaction, analysis suggest[s] the method would result in at least a 25% reduction in terms of storage and bandwidth.""  For the project's open-source development team, the introduction of the signature change into the roadmap follows its prominent featuring at Scaling Bitcoin Milan last October.  There, Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille made an impassioned pitch for the change, while appealing to the broader community to help handle identified roadblocks.  To implement Schnorr signatures, bitcoin would require a modification of its OP_CHECKSIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIG functions so that they can stack public keys.  Today, bitcoin's current blockchain size is around 110 GB.  Ifs and buts  Still, the idea is not without potential difficulties.  According to Wuille, Schnorr signatures face a ""cancellation"" problem, an issue that potentially opens the door for an adversarial participant to subtract a key from the multisig transaction and eliminate one of the parties in the wallet.  Further, according to Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell, integrating Schnorr does not require SegWit activation, though he said the controversial code makes the process easier.  For this reason, the Schnorr feature is unlikely to be implemented until a decision on Segwit activation has been formalized.  ""I doubt this would be done without SegWit, though it could be,"" Maxwell said.  The comments come at a time when progress on bitcoin's scaling issues has effectively stalled, with developers pulling out of a meeting this May that would have sought to unite industry participants.

42379336,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87VnH,1490293818,Report: Bitcoin Social Media Scams Are On the Rise,"The rise in popularity and price of bitcoin has led to greater instances of scams perpetrated through social media, according to a new report.  Released by ZeroFOX  , the report categorizes these new types of scams, collecting data from the point at which bitcoin became worth more than 1 ounce of gold in early March. In total, the company said it identified 3,618 bitcoin scam URLs, which were shared on average 24 times per day during the observation period.  The paper goes on to claim that curated bitcoin scam URLs had been shared over 126 million times in total. Excluding two major outliers, each identified URL was shared on average of 5,367 times since its creation.  Of the scams identified, the first involves sending malicious URLs, the second centered on the phishing bitcoin private keys, while a third scheme, known as the 'bitcoin flipping scheme', saw investors be sent promises of irregularly high returns on their bitcoin after they paid an initial upfront fee.    The final scheme was classified as a bitcoin pyramid scheme, essentially a high-yield investment Ponzi scams that require a low initial investment.  Recommendations  The report further included a number of recommendations for bitcoin users.  ZeroFOX advised bitcoin users refrain from helping anyone mine bitcoin, noting that cloud mining contracts historically underperform the gains seen by simply holding the digital currency in a private wallet.  The firm also recommend avoiding transactions that begin via direct messages on social media platforms.

42379324,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Vah,1490283024,A Major Bitcoin Scaling Meeting Could Take Place This May,"A small group of bitcoin industry leaders, developers and miners are planning to discuss the digital currency's development roadmap at an invite-only meeting in May.  A notice of the gathering, as well as a list of potential guests, was posted to a private mailing list today, with participants reportedly including major players from the ongoing, and recently active, scaling debate.  Bitcoin.com owner Roger Ver, Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith are among those listed as possible attendees.  Other participants suggested to be attending include Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik, an undecided representative from BitGo and Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert.  ""It is certainly my hope that each of you see somebody below that you know and trust to advocate for – and hopefully agree on – a path forward that is best for our industry,"" Silbert wrote in the mailing list message.  DCG confirmed it is helping to organize the meeting, which would be held in New York in May.  BitPay CEO Stephen Pair and Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu confirmed they were participating in statements to CoinDesk.  Though some declined to comment, others indicated that they are keen to use the venue as a way to increase their understanding of ongoing disagreements.  ""I am hoping to better understand what those that want a hard fork are hoping to achieve. We think a hard fork is unnecessary and that their goals could very likely be achieved without one. But I would like to hear their reasoning,"" Pair said.  Yet, at press time, it is unclear whether the meeting has broader buy-in, with Back reporting he would not attend, despite the invitation.  He told CoinDesk that he believes miners are ""profiting from high fees"" on the network, and that they stand to gain by delaying SegWit, Bitcoin Core's proposed scaling option. Blockstream is one of the largest employers of bitcoin developers.  ""At root this is an economic question, not a technical discussion,"" Back said.  Other industry participants are reportedly aware of the meeting, with former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem telling CoinDesk that he is involved in helping to promote the planned event as a way to resolve the debate.  ""I messaged Roger [Ver] this morning, saying 'I implore you to go in person because no one speaks for Roger except Roger',"" he said, adding:  ""I will do everything I can to make sure the right people get into that room together, for the sake of bitcoin.""  Ver has been among the more vocal and controversial critics of the Bitcoin Core roadmap, going so far as to back alternative development teams and alternative softwares in order to fix perceived problems in its operation.  Another attempt  Rumors of a larger meeting follow weeks of increasing discussion that the bitcoin network could possibly undergo a hard fork, a process by which its blockchain could be at risk of splitting into two separate networks (with two separate tokens).  Further, it is the latest in what have been several past attempts to settle the so-called 'scaling debate' via in-person events, though none, to date, have been successful.  In recent weeks, developers and miners have shown a willingness to back alternate proposals, a development that has prompted wider discussion.

42379340,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Vup,1490281149,Web Browser Brave to Launch ICO for Ethereum Ad Token,"Paying attention to online ads can be tiresome, as the growth in ad-blocking software will attest.  To tackle the issue, the web browser Brave today revealed a new way to incentivize web users to do just that: by removing the ads and providing the option to get paid for switching them back on.  Already, Brave has unveiled a bitcoin payments solution that divvies out an amount of bitcoin allotted by the user to their favorite websites – a gesture of goodwill for the valuable content they consume in an ad-free environment. Now, Brave is expanding that service with the launch of a new ethereum-based digital advertising platform built from the ground up, to be backed not by gold, or mining power, but its users' attention.  Notably, perhaps, it’s not just Brave that will be able to use the platform, as its code will be published on Github and made available under an open-source license.  The digital token that fuels the network is called a Basic Attention Token (or BAT), and is scheduled to be released later this year in a sort of 'air-drop' to those signing up, as well being apportioned to investors and the Brave team.  According to Brave founder Brendan Eich, approximately 70% of the total amount of available coins will be sold to investors. Tentatively, 15% of the tokens will then be given to Brave with a six-months lockup, and the remaining 15% will be give to users as a ""one-time initial grant.""  ""We’re trying to re-monetize user attention,"" said Brave founder Brendan Eich in conversation with CoinDesk, adding:  ""Which is to say, we’re trying to price user attention into the market from the beginning.""  Further, Eich said that, with the token launch, Brave intends to ""actually give users a take; we stake them with tokens almost like a mini basic-income grant"".  Built on bitcoin  Rolled out in phases, the Basic Attention Token is designed to cut out third-party advertisers that create data-heavy browsing experiences and slow down search and download times, while fueling an ecosystem of transactions between users, publishers and advertisers.  A white paper published discreetly yesterday describes how cutting out the middlemen can lead to new efficiencies for each of the participants, and potentially expanded margins for the business counterparties.  Already, Brave has been testing that theory since October of last year by letting its users pay publishers they like in bitcoin in exchange for the ad-free browsing experience.  The browser was initially publicly attacked by members of traditional media for its promise to block their ads. But, last year, Eich went on a road trip in an attempt to reposition the product as a way to regain ad revenue that was already being lost to other services.  Publishers can follow a few steps to prove they manage a website that creates original content and, in exchange, collect bitcoin their users have set aside for them. But the Brave Ledger itself, which underlies the browser, remains a centralized component of the user experience.  The ledger provides a cryptographically protected way to measure user engagement within the browser without divulging a user’s personal information. At the end of each month, bitcoin is doled out to the top-five most visited sites based on the browser's preference.  By integrating the service with an ethereum-based network, Eich says Brave will take the first steps towards completely decentralizing the offering.  ""Over time you can move from the centralized Brave browser to a decentralized system,” he said.  As a result of launching BAT on the ethereum network, rather than the Brave ledger, is that it will be open source, meaning anyone will be able to build on it.  At the time of the initial roll-out of version 1.0, a BAT wallet will be integrated with the Brave browser, with verification and transactions handled by the company’s own ledger.  Later versions will fully transfer the verification process to ethereum, making it more difficult for the browser to be shut down.  Although Brave is still, in effect, a middle-man – taking a share of the ad revenue – publishing the code to its Github page has the potential to lead to an ecosystem of ethereum-based browsers and other products based on attention that pay out micro-transactions in a variety of ways.  But the process of moving to ethereum does not amount to an endorsement of the network’s underlying token. Instead, Eich says Brave payments will continue to support bitcoin, and other currencies might one day, too, be added.  ""Bitcoin is under some stress and ethereum is a wild ride,"" said Eich. ""We don’t want to pick a winner here.""  To facilitate the open-source, blockchain agnostic paradigm, Eich says his team is currently exploring using Zcash’s cross-chain atomic transactions (XCAT) – a feature expected to be rolled out in the near future and being designed to let multiple blockchain interact.  Eich concluded:  ""We know that there can be multiple choices here, we think there’s going to be evolution and convergance. Down the road we don’t know what the world looks like, but I would say blockchains, smart contracts, private protocols that look like blockchains.""

42399704,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyRED,1490277583,Storj to Migrate Decentralized Storage Service to Ethereum Blockchain,"Atlanta-based Storj Labs has announced that it intends to move its decentralized storage service to the ethereum blockchain.  Long based on the Counterparty protocol, a top-level software that runs on the bitcoin blockchain, the move positions Storj as the latest blockchain firm to transition operations to ethereum, or at least away from bitcoin, in light of the network's changing economics.  In interview, Storj CEO Shawn Wilkinson credited a decline in the use of Counterparty, as well as the ""network effect"" being built by ethereum, as the driving factors in the decision.  Wilkinson told CoinDesk:  ""If you're building a train and they're building a track, one with the larger network, you're going to choose the larger network. It's not only a technical issue of which one do we go to, it's a question of which one is more widely used.""  The official blog post cited the lack of development in Counterparty as a concern, one that could be solved by ethereum.  It further credited ethereum's ERC20 token standard (which effectively allows exchanges to more easily add support for new coins), and the progress on its layer-two solutions aimed at micropayments as other influencing factors.  Storj also reported that users (colloquially called 'farmers') have been asked to pay increasingly high fees as a result of block size constraints on the bitcoin network. (Due to bitcoin's limited block size, those who send transactions effectively bid for space, a development driven by increased use and limited capacity).  ""For the February farmer payout, we paid over $1,600 in transaction fees, or about 13% of total payouts. This is not sustainable or scalable,"" the company said.  Founded in 2014, Storj uses a native cryptographic token called Storjcoin X (SJCX) to incentivize users with spare computer storage to safeguard the files of enterprise users. The combined technology is then sold in a standard software-as-a-service model.  Storj announced it had raised $3m in funding in February, a figure that includes capital raised in traditional crowdsourced fundraising.  Still, Winkinson framed the decision as one that would benefit Storj long term. Faced with its own set of scaling problems and technical concerns, Wilkinson pointed to the performance of ethereum's core development team as the deciding benefit.  ""All of the projects are being built on ethereum. At some point, you have to say that's a good enough metric.""

42399687,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyQzS,1490271327,Bitcoin Unlimited Nodes Recover After Second Bug Exploit,"Bitcoin Unlimited nodes that went offline following a denial-of-service attack on Tuesday are now functioning normally again, according to online data sources.  The issue, the second of its kind this month, was linked to a bug in the alternative bitcoin software that left an opening for the attack, causing over 100 BU nodes to disconnect from the network.  The erroneous code, related to the software's Xthin block architecture, was promptly fixed, and after the binary patch was released, the number of Bitcoin Unlimited nodes quickly recovered to pre-attack levels.  At press time, there are currently 806 nodes running Bitcoin Unlimited comprising 11.76% of the entire bitcoin network. This figure is up from a low of around 650 during the attack, according to data from Coin.Dance.  Yet, much of the debate on social media has since focused on questions relating to the capabilities of the Bitcoin Unlimited team, which is vying to release software that would effectively replace the standard issued by Bitcoin Core, the network's long-time development group.  On 13th March, a bug that allowed BU nodes to be remotely shut down was exploited, resulting in nearly 70% of nodes hosting the software to temporarily be sent offline.  Further, as part of the latest bug, developers opted to keep the changes private, initially only releasing the code's binary from a private repository. Tempers flared following this revelation, and were further stoked by the fact submitted improvements were not cryptographically signed by those who made them.  Additionally, the 'closed-source' code changes appear to have been leaked via Launchpad.

42399703,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyRFC,1490266818,Fork Fallout? A Bitcoin Split Could Become a Legal Mess,"Should the bitcoin network suddenly split into rival networks, those negatively impacted in a shake-up may be unable to turn to courts for recourse.  In conversation with CoinDesk, legal experts discussed the more notable claims that have emerged amidst escalating discussions about a potential bitcoin hard fork, a process by which a portion of the network could migrate to new software, possibly creating two separate blockchains – and two bitcoin tokens – in the process.  In recent days, bitcoin's miners and developers have shown an increasing determination to back separate visions for the technology's path forward, in the process claiming that certain actions taken by the other party could result in legal consequences.  On one side, miners have put forth the idea they could sue developers for changes to bitcoin's consensus algorithm, should it result in their inability to operate profitably. On the other hand, developers have implied miners could face repercussions should they act aggressively, or maliciously, to disrupt one of the two resulting blockchains.  First and foremost, lawyers queried by CoinDesk reported that jurisdiction was likely to prove the biggest hurdle in any lawsuit, given the disparate locations of bitcoin's key participants.  Stephen Palley, counsel at Washington, DC, law firm Anderson Kill, told CoinDesk:  ""Legal theories aren’t the hard part here, jurisdiction is. In the absence of an express contract between someone with bitcoin and someone who can change the rules, you enter into the world of implied contracts and equitable remedies.""  Andrew Hinkes, a lawyer at Florida law firm Berger Singerman offered a similar concern.  On either side, he noted that courts are bounded by geographies, something that internet-based economic networks united by blockchains are not.  ""There are only certain people that I can sue in a Miami court. The court has to have subject matter jurisdiction, and then you have to have the right person to sue there,"" he said.  Hinkes went on to use the example of an anonymous developer named Voldemort, famed for his authorship of bitcoin's MimbleWimble proposal, as an example, noting that jurisdiction would be hard to prove if identity can't first be established.  ""I don't know who Voldemort is. That would be a problem. A lot of devs are outside the US. If I want to sue a guy in China, where most of the miners are, I have to sue there,"" he continued.  Still, lawyers surveyed reported a much wider host of issues that would suggest such legal claims would likely be byzantine, if not impossible, in practice should a fork result in any claims.  Developer risk low  In discussions, one trend that emerged was the idea that miners would likely be unable to sue protocol developers given the absence of a defined contract between the parties.  According to Marco Santori, fintech lead at Cooley LLP, such claims would be barred, at least in the US.  ""Purely economic damages, which are the only damages that I could imagine a miner would suffer, require that there be a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant,"" he told CoinDesk. ""I’m not aware of any such contract between miners and protocol developers.""  Hinkes agreed that the lack of a direct contract between the parties would prove problematic, should a mining group (as an example) try to sue.  ""This has all been done with the tacit understanding that these things can change. There's never been guarantees the consensus algorithm won't change. In short, they're going to have hard time trying to find a person who promised that,"" he said.  Here again, Hinkes brought up the fact that, while developers can release new code to the bitcoin network, they aren't able to force anyone else to run it, meaning that proving such a connection would be problematic.  Possible options  Yet, there could be options.  Hinkes perhaps offered the most in-depth assessment of this scenario, suggesting three potential ways that developers might be sued.  These included claims of tortious interference (a process by which someone not involved in an existing contract takes a wilful action that disrupts it), equitable estoppel (a form of law where parties rely on statements from other parties) and an injunction (whereby a court would explicitly bar a party from certain actions).  Of the three, Hinkes speculated that a tortious interference claim could have the most merit, though he repeated that jurisdiction and identity issues were likely complexities.  ""By propagating new code, you can say you directly damaged me. But, you have to say that you had an agreement. If you're a miner, who is that agreement with? What about the investors? Who do they have an agreement with? There's some issues there,"" he said.  Equitable estoppel, he reasoned, would break down should the party seeking recourse be unable to prove a defendant had a pre-existing position on an issue, and that the direct change in this position resulted in economic harm.  Likewise, injunctions, he said, were likely to be similarly ineffective, as they would require developers to be found and served in a location that may be hard to determine.  Miner threat  Of the two groups, lawyers surveyed seemed to suggest that miners were perhaps more likely to be held liable for actions, though they acknowledged this depended on how nefarious any steps taken could be deemed.  ""It would depend upon what those malicious actions were. Merely moving hashing power from one fork to another wouldn't be sufficient,"" Santori said.  Should the action be sufficiently malicious, however, Hinkes noted there are still roadblocks. Namely, someone from a law enforcement agency would need to take up the case and be willing to venture into its complexities on the basis it could be fruitful for future case law.  He also suggested that precedent here is uncertain, given that it's a commonly held notion that a so-called minority blockchain (one that was small enough to be attacked and taken offline) is expected to fall away in the event of a fork.  ""Any time you attack the property of another person you still have to prove and qualify damages. Does the minority chain have any value at all?"" he asked.  Still, Hinkes and Palley suggested that even if the actions could be construed as criminal, jurisdiction would likely prove another difficult impediment.  ""Let’s say you could convince a US court that you’re entitled to relief, aren’t most miners offshore, in China and elsewhere? It's not impossible, but it's highly unlikely,"" Palley said.  Where there's a will  Yet, some suggested that the right amount of creativity (and the right situation) could combine for an effective legal case.  For example, BakerHostetler fintech lead Carol Van Cleef speculated that a criminal prosecution could be possible, depending on the financial stakes involved and the extent to which the parties were aggrieved by any outcome.  Van Cleef said simply:  ""There are legal theories that can be constructed from existing laws. And these could be pursued by creative lawyers and clients with resources.""

As a result, the startup has become the first business to provide litecoin trading to customers in New York and just the second to offer ether trading. Almost a year ago, Gemini Trust Company, a digital asset exchange run by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, became the first company to provide trading of the ethereum token in the state.

42399699,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyRCF,1490229500,Bats Exchange is Fighting the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF Rejection,"Bats BZX Exchange has filed a petition to review a decision by the SEC to reject a bitcoin investment vehicle proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  Filed on 17th March, the move is the first public attempt by an entity involved in the Winkelvoss Bitcoin Trust effort to push for a review of its 10th March rejection, a decision that followed three years of filings in an attempt to launch the product.  If approved, the Winkelvoss Bitcoin Trust would have been the first exchange-traded fund to offer exposure to the digital currency to retail investors. It would have listed on the Bats BZX Exchange, one of the largest US equities markets.  At the time, the SEC found that bitcoin's market was perhaps too immature to support such a product, citing a lack of regulation and the potential risk for fraud.  Notably, the petition was filed under rule 430(b)(1) of the SEC's Rules of practice.  According to the SEC’s website, Rule 430(b)(1) enables parties to file a notice of petition within five days of the ruling (or within 15 days of its publishing in the Federal Registrar), provided clear reasons for the petition are given.  The rule goes on to state that the SEC, under this clause, may ""affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand"" the prior contested action as part of the review.  As noted in the filing, Bats is now gearing up to file additional documents.  The statement reads:  ""Bats intends to file separately a petition for review in accordance with Rule 430(b)(2) of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rules of practice.""  At this time, it's unclear of how the objection might be received, or what the path forward may be for the proposed investment product, though the SEC may also decline the request for review.  Representatives for Bats were unable to be reached for comment.
