42397862,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQJt,1408488937,"BlinkTrade Opens New Bitcoin Markets in Venezuela, West Africa","This evening New York-based technology platform BlinkTrade is unveiling UbuntuBitX, its West African bitcoin exchange.  It is the second exchange the company has introduced in a week, having launched SurBitcoin in Venezuela last Thursday.  BlinkTrade  provides clients with its technology, thereby offering them a cost-effective way to start their own bitcoin exchanges and removing the need to hire a developer. Other exchanges use their own proprietary software, centralizing bitcoin, fiat money and liquidity, team head Rodrigo Souza explained to CoinDesk.  But one thing BlinkTrade is especially proud of is its ability to give exchange users access to bitcoin liquidity in regions where bitcoin trading is not yet widespread.  Souza explained:  “My mission statement is very simple: let's lower the costs for bitcoin exchanges, using an open-source, cloud-based platform for exchanges like BlinkTrade, and also allow bitcoin exchanges to share liquidity.”  BlinkTrade itself does not hold users’ bitcoin or fiat money; the brokers have custody and are required to publish all of their bitcoin addresses as a transparency measure.  Souza said that one day the company would be able to give users worldwide the option to select their region’s best brokers – but this is looking far into the future. For the time being, he continued, it is focused on empowering as many exchange operators as possible in the developing world.  Entering the Venezuelan market  SurBitcoin, the company’s Venezuelan client, launched in beta on Thursday. The exchange is giving Venezuelan users 200 Venezuelan bolivar fuertes (VEF), or about $32 at press time, in credit upon signup to buy bitcoins. Since the launch at least 160 users have signed up.  Although there is no official data on the number of unbanked citizens in the country, Souza estimates the figure is around 70%, and that as many people therefore struggle with inflation, which was up to a rate of 56.3% by the end of last year – the highest on the continent, according to World Bank data.  Souza added that it is difficult to remit money to Venezuela without going through the black market, where the fees can exceed 20%. Few people use money transfer services like MoneyGram or Western Union, deterred by the steep exchange rate.  Souza said:  “Venezeula imposes a set of challenges. If we can succeed in Venezuela, we can succeed in any country of the world.”  Regulatory limbo  Whether the monetary policy and fiscal objectives driving up inflation will affect the region’s bitcoin economy remains to be seen. Regulators have not given an official ruling on how to control bitcoin or whether to classify it as a currency, a commodity or otherwise.  Souza sees bitcoin as a digital asset, and hopes for his business that the government will rule from a similar stance.  “Venezuelan law doesn't allow you to trade any currency outside of their central bank,” Souza explained. “So, it is very important for us that Venezuelan authority does not rule that bitcoin is a currency, because it is not.”  Presently, bitcoin’s prospects are in the hands of the local people, he added, saying:  “Local people might influence their government. We are not going to try to fight governments with bitcoin, we will follow their local laws and regulations so we don't get bitcoin banned in those countries.”  Targeting West Africa  This evening BlinkTrade will introduce UbuntuBitX, the Benin-based exchange that will operate for users in eight West African countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Sénégal and Togo.  Centralized exchanges don't help the remittances market from any country, Souza explained, adding that high fees and a lack of liquidity restrict bitcoin from thriving as remittances.  Africa is important because of the need and potential of micro-remittances (those less than $100), he explained, saying:  “You send $100 to West Africa, and the other person there will get $90. If we establish a market there with low fees, bitcoin can thrive in the micro-remittances market. For larger remittances you need more liquidity.”  About BlinkTrade  BlinkTrade’s next move is to Brazil, where it is in talks with Bitcointoyou.com about using the BlinkTrade platform.  The platform is built on a WebSocket API, allowing any front-end developer to build applications with which users can convert bitcoin to fiat.  “Providing easy access to liquidity to developers will create an infrastructure that will probably change the way people use bitcoin today,” Souza said.  BlinkTrade is a product of a three-man team of developers: Souza, Clebson Derivan and Roberto Santacroce Martins.  The team use multi-signature technology to protect the customers and brokers. The platform is open source. The code, available on github, is still in beta, but has been public since its inception.

42397861,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQIu,1408484127,How Cryptoagency is Building Bitcoin's Better Business Bureau,"Cryptocurrency forums are littered with stories of scams and bad customer service.  Now, a cryptocurrency ratings agency is hoping to quantify the community’s view of various bitcoin businesses. Cryptoagency.org will use a reputation system to reflect a company’s quality.  But, the question remains, do we need a ratings system for cryptocurrency businesses?  Roger Ver, bitcoin entrepreneur and CEO of Memory Dealers, who has had to deal with malicious parties himself in the bitcoin world, said that he doesn't believe the bitcoin industry has been disproportionately affected by scams.  He explained:  “In my business career before bitcoin, I saw entire ‘businesses’ set up with the sole purpose of scamming others.""  Ver has seen firms attempt to use stolen credit cards, fake purchase orders and fraudulent cashiers checks sent via FedEX.  “These same dishonest people just see bitcoin as another tool in their arsenal to cheat others,” he said.  Bitcoin’s quasi-anonymity doubtless makes it easier for these bad actors, but in many cases, what seems to be a scam often turns out to be ineptitude.  Inspired by poor customer service  It was just such an experience that caused Larry Fenton to start Cryptoagency.org in March, after an encounter with an exchange went sour.  “There was no one really to turn to to try and figure out how to deal with this company that I was having problems with. That’s where the idea came from,” he says.  Fenton bought $800 in bitcoin from an exchange, but found that when he submitted the online transaction, he received no confirmation message. Assuming a system glitch, he did it again. The second transaction was confirmed.  “Everything was fine, until on my bank statement a couple of days later I noticed two withdrawals for $800,” he says. “I checked with my bitcoin exchange account again and there was only one credit for $800.”  The first $800 was trapped in limbo.  “I called up the company, sent them an email, described the problem and they said they’d look into it. Three or four days later, nothing had happened,” Fenton recalls.  Eventually, he had to begin his own investigation. He called the support desk and talked the front line staff into giving him the name of the company’s owner. He surfed online and lucked out: a WHOIS account yielded the owner’s name and address.  After calling the owner, he got a promise to have his money returned. The cash eventually made its way back to him, but with no explanation.  “The company never did give me an adequate reason for why their system didn’t acknowledge my transaction,” he said. “So it was a very unprofessionally run situation, and after I got my money back, I cancelled my account. I no longer wanted to do business with that company.”  How rating works  Cryptoagency.org will charge companies that accept, deal, mine, pay or otherwise use cryptocurrency, in return for accreditation. Accreditation comes in three tiers – bronze, silver and gold – ranging from $400 per year to $1,600 per year in bitcoin. Charges are decided based on a company’s size and longevity, but most people will start with bronze, Fenton says.  But accreditation isn’t something that you can automatically pay for, and there are rules governing it, Fenton explains. Companies must disclose any theft of cryptocurrency, resulting in the loss of accreditation for a year. They also lose accreditation if they fail to repay loans.  The value of the system lies in the community rating, Fenton says. Membership of the community is free for the general public, and they can rate and leave reviews of companies that they have dealt with.  Firms are rated on a ‘five-coin’ system. If a company falls below a three-coin rating for a month, it loses its accreditation until it can regain the three-coin rating, sustaining it for at least a month.  If this sounds similar to the Better Business Bureau, you’d be right. Fenton originally wanted to use the BBB in the company’s name, but decided against it to avoid trademark disputes. But whatever Fenton calls it, Ver likes the concept.  “Reputation-based systems are super important. We already know that we can trust Expedia and Overstock with our bitcoins, but we don’t know the same thing about other new businesses,” he says.  Gaming the system  There is a potential for people to game the system. Fake accounts could easily be used to post bad reviews and depress a company’s rating. That’s the sort of thing that will take manual work from the company's three-person team to prevent.  Fenton said:  “We check the web site daily and we read all the reviews and the comments. Someone would be anonymous to the rest of the world but we know their real name, email address and number. We can personally contact them to verify their information.”  Ideally, as the industry matures, we may see the risk landscape change. “I think we will see more and more businesses with great reputations starting to accept bitcoin,” says Ver.  In the meantime, people may still use credit cards or cryptocurrency escrow services when dealing with companies that don’t have a track record, he concludes. And while we’re in this phase, reputation will be even more important.

42397869,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQOo,1408472758,Chamber of Digital Commerce Proposes Small Business Exemption for BitLicense,"The Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC) has submitted its official comments to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) regarding the BitLicense proposal.  Launched in July, the Washington-based lobbying group led by president and former Forbes contributor Perianne Boring is seeking to influence broader bitcoin policy in the US, while advocating for smart regulation that will support the digital currency industry.  The CDC offered a broad critique of the proposal, suggesting that the NYDFS needs to revise its definition of 'virtual currency' and 'virtual currency business activities' to avoid what it called an ""egregious act of regulatory overreach"".  The full 10-page filing goes on to suggest that the NYDFS should include a safe haven provision for startups, exempt small businesses from regulation, make better use of existing regulation and extend its current 45-day comment period so that the industry would have more time to fully respond to the proposal.  Further, the CDC offered its services to the NYDFS, suggesting that it could provide the department's members with the necessary information to revise the proposal, and expressed its hope that its comments could provide a similar service to the community.  Boring said:  “We have been very vocal in encouraging the industry to submit comments to the NYDFS. The Digital Chamber’s comments are posted on our website and the industry is welcome to use them as a resource.""  The news follows a similar 6th August filing submitted by the Bitcoin Foundation, and comes amid a period of increasing scrutiny for the proposed laws. In recent days, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and the Mercatus Center's Eli Douardo and Jerry Brito have criticized the regulations.  Small business exemption  Perhaps most notably, the CDC advocated for small businesses, defined under New York law as those that employ 100 people or less, to be excluded from the law. Businesses that hold under a certain amount of assets, Boring said, should also be exempt from compliance.  Boring argues:  ""Startups are hotbeds for innovation; they often keep larger players on their toes by offering superior products at lower prices. The regulator of a market should avoid building any artificial barrier to entry. Artificial barriers to entry so will deter intelligent minds from developing interest in the market, make existing players complacent and hurt consumers.""  The filing further states that the NYDFS is required to accommodate small businesses when writing its proposed rules, saying that this is mandated by Section 202-B of the New York Administrative Procedures Law.  Freedom to invest and innovate  The CDC also took aim at Section 200.8(b), which relates that bitcoin businesses maintain their profits and earnings in permissible investments denominated in US dollars, arguing businesses should be able to invest profits without restrictions provided they maintain full reserves.  Under the proposal, permissible investments include certificates of deposit, money market funds, state or municipal bonds and US government securities.  Section 200.10, the provision that requires bitcoin businesses to receive written approval from the NYDFS for any new product, service or activity, was also cited for revision.  Arguing that the provision be struck from the proposal, Boring said:  ""It is dubious that NYDFS has, or can be expected to develop, the technical and business sophistication to make quick and astute decisions as to product development.""  She added: ""Having a regulator calling the shots in the marketplace, rather than protecting consumers, would cripple any industry and would take NYDFS far outside its competence and appropriate role as regulator.""

42397851,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQA3,1408470926,LibraTax IRS-Compliant Bitcoin Accounting Software Nears Launch,"Libra has announced the imminent release of LibraTax, a new software suite designed specifically for digital currency users.  The California-based software developer said LibraTax allows individuals and small businesses to comply with the latest IRS regulations and file returns reporting bitcoin, XRP and other cryptocurrency transactions. The suite should become available by the end of August.  LibraTax allows bitcoin users to comply with accounting requirements put forth by the IRS earlier this year.  Libra said the software will accommodate “all 2013 and earlier” digital currency users as well as those who filed for extensions in spring 2014.  “Even those who have already filed will want to amend their tax returns once they discover that reportable capital gains may be significantly reduced with optimized accounting options,” the company said in a statement.  Automating bitcoin accounting  Libra pointed out that recent IRS guidance on digital currencies requires that taxpayers report digital currency gains and losses on state and federal returns. The problem with this approach is that it requires a lot of manual calculation, making it extremely time consuming and prohibitively difficult.  LibraTax was developed to automate the accounting process by retrieving the user’s transaction history from the block chain. Once it collects the necessary data it synchronizes the value with the digital currency’s historical fair market value. All types of taxable events are supported, including donations, gifts and income.  This allows the software to dynamically compute gains or losses in a few seconds and Libra says it can output a “tremendously beneficial” report to realize minimized or no reportable gains.  More software on the way  Libra said it is also working on a new product suite designed for small businesses and enterprise needs. There is still no word on a launch date for the new suite, but the company said pre-registration will commence with the public beta.  “Our primary objective is to have approachable, convenient software that simplifies the end-user experience associated with taxpaying – ultimately saving users precious time and money. We’ve accomplished that without a doubt,” said Libra founder and CEO Jake Benson.  Libra has been working on LibraTax for months. The company revealed its plans back in April, when it promised to deliver an accounting suite compliant with IRS guidance in the third quarter of 2014.  At the time, Benson told CoinDesk that compliance is one of the most critical issues surrounding digital currencies. He pointed out that tax software might not be the “sexiest business” in the digital currency industry, but it is one of the most essential ones at the moment.

42395308,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHGs,1408457096,New Sentiment Index Tracks Public Opinion on Bitcoin,"CoinDesk is pleased to announce the launch of its new Bitcoin Sentiment Index (BSI), which goes live at 15:00 (BST) today.  The BSI is a measure not of the value buyers and sellers place on their bitcoin, but whether individuals feel the digital currency's prospects are increasing or decreasing at any given moment.  Powered by data collected by Qriously, a startup that leverages mobile ad infrastructure to deliver questions to millions of people across the globe, the index provides a snapshot of the general attitude towards bitcoin at the time of questioning.  Qriously co-founder and CEO Christopher Kahler told CoinDesk:  “The motivation behind the Bitcoin Sentiment Index is to create a time-series tracking the popular sentiment towards bitcoin, in particular how important people think bitcoin will be in the future. A lot of the interest in bitcoin at present is based on assumptions of this data, so we think being able to track and quantify it will be valuable and revealing.”  Survey methodology  In order to gauge public attitudes to bitcoin, Qriously reaches out to members of the public in the UK and US via its mobile polling service.  The firm asks randomly selected smartphone users one simple question:  “The importance of bitcoin in 12 months will: (Increase/Decrease/Stay the Same)”  In terms of numbers, 85 people are asked the question per day in the UK and 50 in the US.  Fifty responses per day is the minimum required to have statistically significant distributions of answers with a seven-day moving average, Kahler said.  Qriously then computes a relative 'sentiment' score by adding the percentage of positive results to 100 and subtracting the percentage of negative results to create an index value. Instead of daily values, a seven-day moving average is used.  The question itself is served in the place of a mobile advertisement unit on both iPhone and Android users, who are selected at random to reflect the average smartphone-using population (as a proxy for the general population).  While currently opinions are gauged from individuals in the UK and the US, CoinDesk hopes to expand the geographical range of the survey to other countries in the near future.  Voice of the people  CoinDesk already provides the Bitcoin Price Index, an up-to-the-minute average price for the digital currency based on data from carefully selected major global exchanges.  However, while following the price of bitcoin can be interesting, at times perplexing and sometimes profitable, looking at general attitudes to bitcoin should provide a different kind of insight into state of bitcoin, now and in the future.  “The popular opinion, as opposed to expert opinion, for bitcoin is interesting and its utility is intrinsically tied to widespread adoption,” said Kahler.  Visit the Bitcoin Sentiment Index here.  The sentiment index is something of an experiment for CoinDesk and we value any feedback our readers may have on its value and potential improvements.

42397853,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQC1,1408440765,Industry Chief: Payments Firms Warming to Bitcoin Partnerships,"Due to bitcoin's perceived benefits as a more efficient and less costly alternative to traditional payment options, many in the digital currency industry view incumbent payment service providers as antiquated competitors – firms that will be disrupted out of business when the technology matures.  Now, at least one notable payments industry trade association indicates that its members may be recognizing that bitcoin possesses this disruptive potential, and that this may soon lead to a rise in partnerships between traditional electronic payments providers and bitcoin startups.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Electronic Transactions Association (ETA) CEO Jason Oxman talked at length about his organisation, how the digital currency can better execute its agenda in Washington and bitcoin's potential appeal to the traditional payments industry.  Notably, Oxman evoked Napster in his comments, comparing bitcoin to the controversial file sharing service that rocked the record industry. Citing it as a cautionary tale that is resonating with the payment industry, he said:  ""They went all the way to the Supreme Court to shut [Napster] down. That is traditionally how incumbents react to innovation.""  Oxman, however, believes the payment industry will take a different approach to emerging technologies. In particular, he noted the recent partnership between Global Payments and BitPay as one that suggests the payment industry will not turn a blind eye to innovation. Under the terms, Global Payments has agreed to refer customers interested in bitcoin to BitPay's service. He added:  ""I think our industry has the opposite story to tell, and I think that's embodied [by] the BitPay, Global Payments deal.""  Founded in 1990, the ETA represents more than 500 companies in the merchant-acquiring industry, fighting for its interests in Washington, DC. Notable members including Amazon, MasterCard and PayPal, along with BitPay – the ETA's only bitcoin industry member.  Embracing innovation equally  Throughout the conversation, Oxman sought to frame his sector of the payments industry as one that is willing to work with emerging tech startups, including those in bitcoin space. He noted, however, that his support is likely to extend equally to providers of all forms of electronic transactions.  Oxman suggested the ETA itself does not advocate for bitcoin over other new and novel means of transacting, nor does it have an official position on its advantages or disadvantages when compared to other offerings.  ""At bottom, our industry is in the business of facilitating electronic transactions, and those electronic transactions are going to take the form of whatever the customer or merchant of choice agrees is going to be the form of their electronic transaction,"" he said.  Oxman further argued that this inclusive viewpoint could be beneficial to the bitcoin industry. As the payments industry has been broadly considering innovations in mobile payments for some time, he suggested his members may now be more inclined to embrace bitcoin and its potential through strategic partnerships:  ""I think it will continue to happen going forward.""  Facilitating connections  To date, just one bitcoin company has joined the ETA, but according to Oxman, that doesn't mean ETA members haven't been given more exposure to bitcoin.  The Bitcoin Foundation has played a central role in educating the ETA and its members about the benefits of bitcoin, he said. As an example, Oxman recalled a 2013 ETA event at which Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck spoke, lauding it as a strong sign that both bitcoin and the broader electronics transaction industry can find common ground.  He explained:  ""[Murck] did a good job of putting a business-focused backing to bitcoin. With that kind of introduction, our members look to bitcoin as an interesting development in the industry, and at least one of our members has seen fit to strike a deal with a bitcoin processor.""  Oxman went so far as to frame the ETA as a potential ally in the expansion of bitcoin's use amongst consumers. Given the large number of merchants accepting electronic payments – between eight and nine million in the US alone – he believes bitcoin could be expanded greatly through the reach of ETA members.  ""No company, no new startup in the bitcoin world has the infrastructure to reach all those merchants to make the pitches to why they should accept bitcoin,"" he said.  Promoting smart regulation  Given his expertise as a liaison to Washington, Oxman also commented on New York's proposed bitcoin regulations, drawing on his experience educating the 20-plus federal agencies that are involved with regulating payments about industry innovations.  The ETA, Oxman noted, spends most of its time ensuring that governments don't stifle innovations in the field of electronic transactions. In the past, this has meant his organisation has needed to pave the way for new and controversial payment options such as those offered by PayPal and prepaid card providers.  Above all, Oxman stressed that he feels it is important for the bitcoin industry to tell its story to regulators, but that he understands the initial reaction of the government. Regulators simply aren't used to payment methods that don't offer certain forms of protections, he said.  Oxman explained:  ""In the world of new payments technologies, any regulators are going to ask questions about the level of consumer protection available through alternative payment systems. The less those systems are established and deployed, the more regulators are going to feel compelled to step in and protect consumers where those protections are not otherwise available.""  When asked for his opinion on the BitLicense proposals, Oxman also struck a balanced tone. He suggested that he sees both sides of the issue, but that he believes New York needs to conduct more research into bitcoin and its underlying technology.  ""I do think that it's important to sound a cautionary note that regulators should not apply reflexive rules just because something is new. What they should do instead – hopefully New York will undertake this, but the early signs are cause for concern – they should take a real in-depth look at how bitcoin's systems operates, how the block chain operates, how bitcoin providers like bitcoin processors take additional steps to protect consumers, to protect merchants.""  ""I'm not surprised to see that interested parties have asked for more time for comments to be filed in New York,"" Oxman concluded.

Investors include London-based Ariadne Capital, Barry Silbert’s New York-based Bitcoin Opportunity Corp (BOC) and Palo Alto-based financial innovation investor, Carol Realini.  BitX  CEO Marcus Swanepoel told CoinDesk the funding would help the Singapore-based firm accelerate its business, furthering international expansion of its wallet and exchange services, assist with merchant acquisition and help the company develop some new products it has in the pipeline.  Silbert praised the BitX team's progress, saying:  ""In a very short period of time, the BitX team has successfully built a highly scalable, unique model that has enabled them to quickly grow a global footprint and demonstrate success in a number of markets […] BitX have a very strong team with a differentiated business model and a great track record.”  Expanding via emerging markets  BitX says it is building a global cryptocurrency platform that provides bitcoin products and services including wallets, exchanges, merchant integration and APIs to consumers, businesses and developers particularly in emerging markets.  Dealing with the variety of regulations and levels of infrastructure in these markets could often slow progress for bitcoin companies, Swanepoel said, adding that he had years of experience working with both authorities and financial institutions in such places, and remained confident.  Of Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Corp, he said:  ""They're bullish on emerging markets, so it plays well to our investment hypothesis.""  The need for and impact of cryptocurrencies will be the biggest in those markets, he said. BOC has also recently funded Mexico's Volabit and India's Unocoin, both bitcoin exchanges.  BitX’s focus on emerging markets has lead to impressive momentum for the business. It now operates bitcoin wallet services across Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, with active exchanges in South Africa, Namibia and Kenya.  Investors praise unique strategy  Other investors involved in the deal said they were attracted to the potential of BitX's focus on alternate markets in new areas.  Julie Meyer, CEO of Ariadne Capital, commented that the investment reinforces Ariadne’s strategy of backing talented entrepreneurs and management teams building global companies that can disrupt on a large scale.  Carol Realini added:  ""BitX has the right team and the right strategy to capitalize on the enormous opportunity for bitcoin in emerging markets. It is impressive how much they have already accomplished with multiple-country implementations and a major partnership.""  BitX also recently partnered with South African payment provider PayFast to provide the largest emerging market bitcoin merchant roll-out to date, enabling over 30,000 merchants the ability to accept bitcoin, including one of the largest e-commerce companies in Africa, Takealot.

The online flight and hotel booking service was one of the first in its industry to serve the bitcoin community, launching in June 2013 as a cryptocurrency-focused alternative to sites such as Expedia and Travelocity.  Speaking to CoinDesk, BTCTrip founder and CEO Martin Fernandez said that he is excited to add the popular altcoins to the company's payment options because they allow BTCTrip to tap into growing communities in the developing digital currency industry.  In particular, Fernandez cited the high levels of enthusiasm surrounding the dogecoin community as a key motivating factor behind the decision, saying:  ""I follow this community and I think they are very fresh. They are trying to do new things, so for us, it was very important to accept dogecoin. [...] For me, BTCTrip is a company, but it is also an experiment in cryptocurrency communities.""  BTCTrip will continue to accept bitcoin through its long-time merchant processing partner BitPay, however, it will integrate processing services provided by GoCoin to facilitate its litecoin and dogecoin transactions.  Diversifying demographics  Throughout the interview, Fernandez stressed his desire to appeal to new digital currency users as the impetus for adding litecoin and dogecoin payments, suggesting he sees the altcoins as a smart, long-term business strategy.  Still, he did indicate sales might have been a motivating factor, noting that his company's bitcoin conversion levels taper off when bitcoin's price is on the rise.  Litecoin and dogecoin payments could provide some additional support during these times, as evidenced by the strong buying power reported by at least one major merchant serving both communities.  While Fernandez talked most excitedly about the dogecoin community and its recent progress, he lauded litecoin as well, saying:  ""Litecoin was, for me, always the second coin in the market.""  David vs Goliath  Fernandez also addressed how the new payment methods will help BTCTrip better compete against other major travel sites serving the bitcoin space such as CheapAir and Expedia. CheapAir now accepts bitcoin for hotels, flights and Amtrak bookings, while Expedia added bitcoin as a payment option for hotel bookings in June.  Although he evoked classic David vs Goliath imagery when referencing these companies, Fernandez said he feels his company's emphasis on community will help it find success, saying:  ""I always repeat the same sentence, we are not accepting bitcoin [and dogecoin], we are accepting bitcoiners and dogecoiners. We are accepting the cryptocurrency community.""  As a sign of its ability to compete against bigger rivals, Fernandez cited BTCTrip's recent inclusion as part of PhoCusWright's Travel Innovation Summit to be held this November.  Notably, BTCTrip won a scholarship to attend and speak at the leading global travel industry conference, one that required it to ""demonstrate the greatest potential for success"", among other qualifications.
