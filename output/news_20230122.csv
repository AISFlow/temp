7907717,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517060,1674425674,Binance Announces New Transaction Limit By Fiat Partner – What Could This Mean For BNB?,"According to a report by Bloomberg, crypto exchange Binance has announced that one of its fiat trading partners, Signature Bank, will no longer be processing transactions of less than $100,000 as the bank attempts to reduce its exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Binance said this is a broad action affecting all crypto exchanges dealing with Signature bank. And that efforts are underway to find an alternative solution immediately for members of its user community whose accounts are serviced by this bank. “One of our fiat banking partners, Signature Bank, has advised that it will no longer support any of its crypto exchange customers with buying and selling amounts of less than 100,000 USD as of February 1, 2023. This is the case for all of their crypto exchange clients. As a result, some individual users may not be able to use SWIFT bank transfers to buy or sell crypto with/for USD for amounts less than 100,000 USD,” the statement sent by Binance to Bloomberg News on Saturday, said. Signature Bank is one of the biggest fiat banking partners in the crypto industry in collaboration with many industrial giants, including Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Circle and the now-bankrupt FTX exchange. Following the heavy losses in the crypto market in 2022, Signature Bank lost about 64% of its shares (SBNY) value after paying out $8.1 billion worth of digital assets in service of withdrawal orders during the last quarter of the year. To avoid similar losses in the future, Signature Bank has begun a massive withdrawal process from the cryptocurrency industry. To this effect, the New York-based bank even plans on voluntarily reducing its crypto deposits by $8 billion to $10 billion. Related Reading: THETA Breaches $1 Level Courtesy Of Solid On-Chain Developments How Does Signature Bank’s Action Affect Binance Coin (BNB)? Following the announcement of Signature Bank’s minimum transaction limit by Binance, there has been no significant effect on the BNB token. According to CoinMarketCap, BNB is trading at $302.89, having lost only 0.11% of its value in the last 24 hours. BNBUSD trading at $303.0 | Source: BNBUSD Chart on Tradingview.com. Ordinarily, BNB’s price movement is within the range of an expected reaction as Signature services only 0.01% of the average monthly customers on Binance. Thus, causing no need for panic among investors. However, it may be too early to tell the full effects of Signature’s action on the BNB token, especially considering the ongoing social media rumors on Binance’s “true” relationship with the American banking giant.

Apparently, it is believed by some crypto enthusiasts that Binance has been dealing with Signature via an account belonging to “Key Vision Development Limited”, a Seychelles-based company that has been defunct since September 2021. According to rumors, Signature Bank imposed a $100,000 minimum transaction limit on crypto transactions only after forcefully closing Binance’s “phony” account. Some also say that Binance is the only exchange affected by this new transaction limit policy, especially since there have been no official statements from other crypto exchange clients of Signature bank. That said, it is worth stating that all these statements are still rumors with no confirmation by any credible authority. However, Binance users as well as BNB investors, are advised to watch out for any developments in that space.

It also signals the likelihood of another refreshing BTC rally after gains of last week. Bitcoin’s MVRV Breaks Above 1 The breakout coincided with BTC prices surging to as high as $23,300 on Saturday, January 21, a positive development, especially for optimistic holders. As of writing on January 22, prices have cooled off, and the coin is trending at around $22,700, albeit with relatively low trading volumes. Still, the retracement puts BTC within a bullish formation following impressive gains on January 20 when the coin printed higher, defying gravity and confirming demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $23,000 As Crypto Market Cap Revisits $1 Trillion Mark The MVRV ratio changes depending on Bitcoin’s market forces. The prevailing sentiment is that BTC is bottoming up. Bulls could be preparing for another leg up, injecting the much-needed volatility and volatility into the crypto markets. However, the absence of confirming indicator presented problems. Technical and fundamental analysts may use the MVRV ratio to time market entries and exits. Typically, whenever the MVRV ratio is below 1, then it implies that prices are at their bottom. Any reversal from sub-1 to above 1 with increasing valuation may signal price bottoms and, possibly, more room for upsides in the coming days. This signal could be a precursor to guide swing and long-term traders to hold on to their long positions and wait for more gains before exiting once BTC becomes overvalued based on on-chain readings. Conversely, historical values reveal that whenever the MVRV is above 3.7, there is a real probability that the Bitcoin market will be overheating. Subsequently, it could be the best time to exit and take profits. Bitcoin Sentiment Shifting To MVRV ratio is dynamic, changing depending on the fluctuating valuation of BTC. At any point, the MVRV ratio is calculated by dividing the market value and the realized value of bitcoin. The market value measures the prevailing sentiment amongst holders, which, as history shows, changes depending on spot rates. Meanwhile, the realized value considers each coin’s actual spending. Calculating the realized value takes into account the acquisition cost of each coin in question. If the MVRV ratio is below 1, should coins be sold, most holders will realize losses. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze May Reach $30,000, Top Crypto Trader Predicts The more the MVRV ratio increases, the more holders and traders will be willing to sell as they get more into the money. Subsequently, the ratio is a good gauge of whether BTC is overvalued or undervalued in the short, medium, or long term. Streams from IntoTheBlock show that, on average, 62% of BTC holders are making money, with 36% losing money.

According to CoinGecko, THETA rose 15% in the bi-weekly timeframe along with other altcoins. The network has been revving up development with the recent alpha release of EdgeStore, Theta Network’s decentralized storage solution.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of those tokens that maintained a solid performance in the last week. According to CoinGecko, SHIB is up 19.5% in the weekly timeframe and over 47% in the monthly at the time of writing. This strong growth is fueled by external factors along with the nearing launch of Shibarium, the ecosystem’s upgrade that would bring a list of features for the ShibArmy. Related Reading: What Is SingularityNET And Why Is Its AGIX Token Exploding By 116%? Who Let The Dogs Out? Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous chief developer of the Shiba Inu meme coin, has been constantly teasing the release of Shibarium since the start of the year. The nearing launch of the upgrade led the price to climb. As the Shiba Inu community excitedly anticipates the beta release of Shibarium, Kusama is promoting the notion that the release of the Layer 2 scaling solution may be closer than previously believed. The primary developer for SHIB tweeted a link to the official Shibarium Telegram handle and instructed fellow SHIB developer Trophias to “open the chat.” The Shibarium upgrade would leverage the Ethereum network’s security while scaling Shiba Inu’s ability to handle transactions. This would lower fees significantly while making the network faster and more efficient. Image: TrackShiba.com It would also offer utility as the upgrade would mean more SHIB tokens burnt. As of January 21st, the total burned SHIB is over 410 trillion, according to SHIB burn tracker, TrackShiba. With the beta launch of the network upgrade being used as an introduction to the features Shibarium will have, SHIB is expected to continue to soar in price in the next few days. SHIB’s Next Target Should Be This Level The token’s current price movement is a result of hitting the $0.00001293 resistance. As of writing, SHIB may be in some short term pain as the resistance proves itself difficult for SHIB bulls. In the coming days, bears might be able to test the token’s current support at $0.00001184. If the bears ever broke through this support, pain in the medium term would be inevitable as bears would have access to the $0.00000968 support which, if broken, would make the token revert to pre-2023 price levels. Investors and trades should target the $0.00001293 resistance after consolidating above $0.00001184. This would alleviate any downward pressure on the token, giving SHIB bulls legroom for an explosive upward movement. SHIB total market cap at $6.6 billion on the weekend chart | Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $23,000 As Crypto Market Cap Revisits $1 Trillion Mark For now, investors and traders should be focused on consolidating for a continuation of the current rally.
