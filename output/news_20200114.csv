42403798,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgmpW,1579045374,"In New Court Filing, Craig Wright Claims to Receive Keys to $9.6B Bitcoin Fortune","Craig Wright, bitcoin’s self-declared creator, says the much anticipated “bonded courier” has arrived.      According to a court filing to the U.S. District Court of Southern Florida dated Jan. 14, a third party has “provided the necessary information and key slice to unlock the encrypted file,” seemingly referencing the “mysterious,” unnamed intermediary with the private keys necessary to unlock the $9.6 billion bitcoin trove.      In another filing Tuesday night, attorneys for Ira Kleiman, the brother of Wright's now-deceased business partner Dave Kleiman, wrote that Wright only provided a list of 16,404 addresses but no information about the courier.      This so-called bonded courier was originally due to arrive Jan. 1, though Wright did not confirm or deny whether this transpired at the time. Wright instead requested an extension for the intermediary to unlock the encrypted “Tulip Trust” at the heart of the case.      On Jan. 10, U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom granted Wright until Feb. 3 to alert the court of the courier’s arrival.      ""Plaintiffs request they be provided with seven (7) interrogatories about the courier that Craig must respond to in ten (10) days. Plaintiffs will then use those responses to seek discovery from the bonded courier and his company,"" Kleiman's lawyers wrote. ""In the interim, Plaintiffs are having their experts review and analyze the list. Plaintiffs expect that they will be ready to depose Craig after this discovery occurs, in early March.""      The 1.1M bitcoin Tulip Trust is at the center of a bitter dispute between Wright and Ira Kleiman. Kleiman is suing Wright, alleging Wright expropriated bitcoin and manipulated documents, emails and other correspondence to defraud his brother’s estate.      Judge Bloom expressed doubt over the bonded courier’s existence and the amount of bitcoin in dispute. Wright was previously held in contempt of court for failing to produce a full list of his bitcoin holdings. He alleged it would be “impossible” to comply with the court order, as his bitcoin was encrypted by the complicated Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme.

42403801,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgmsT,1579041725,Traders Turn to DeFi to Capitalize on Tuesday's Crypto Market Spike,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications are popping off Tuesday, and the ETH price spike isn't the whole story.      As of this writing, ETH is up around $20 since Monday. ""Cryptocurrencies are still pretty correlated so with some of the developments around Craig Wright and BSV, that ended up moving the entire market,"" Paul Veradittakit, of Pantera Capital, told CoinDesk in an email. Bitcoin SV is the fourth-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. It shot up 117 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk's BSV Price Index.      Since ETH gets ""locked in"" to DeFi apps, the total market value will go up any time the value in ETH increases, but that's only part of the picture.      DeFi Pulse showed the DeFi market as having roughly $706 million in ETH locked into its applications on Monday. As of this writing, that value has risen to $782 million.      Another part of the story is speculators looking to capitalize on a market spike. It has been a very long time since we've seen such a big day in a Top 10 cryptocurrency, Robert Leshner of Compound Finance told CoinDesk. Leshner said that it's very likely that money is moving into DeFi because traders are looking for liquidity in order to play the market.      ""On a day when prices are moving 100 percent, an annual rate doesn't matter to them,"" Leshner said.      Compound, which provides an easy way for ETH holders to borrow, saw a surge in usage Tuesday with collateral rising about 10 percent, according to DeFi Pulse. Similarly, volume on Uniswap, the decentralized token swapping dapp, is up almost 100 percent over the day before, according to Uniswap Info.      MakerDAO has also seen a large jump, nearing $50 million, likely because traders are locking up ETH to create DAI they can trade with.      ""Ether is the primary form of collateral used to do other stuff,"" Leshner noted, so when it's worth more, its holders can do more stuff. However, the first step in that process is to turn to DeFi applications to provide liquidity, for example, by borrowing against an asset whose value is rising.      Joel Monegro of Placeholder, a venture firm focused on innovative blockchain technologies, told CoinDesk that now is the early phase of a new technology class. Now is when users are going to test its mettle.      “The ~$600 million 'locked' in DeFi protocols is all funny money. It’s not enough for global finance to care. But it’s a huge bounty to break the smart contracts behind it. And if we’re going to break them, better do it at the toy stage,"" Monegro said, comparing it to the era when spending money on the web still felt dicey.      ""Commerce moved online slowly, then all at once; finance will move on-chain slowly – then all at once,"" he wrote.",POSITIVE,ETH | BSV,ETH | MARKET | MKR | UNI | BSV,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/14/traders-turn-to-defi-to-capitalize-on-tuesdays-crypto-market-spike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f57133532d740e990f1a1556937fd4c024abfb28-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15989482,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/heres-bitcoin-makes-major-banks-nervous,1579037400,Here’s Why Bitcoin Makes Major Banks Nervous…,"Before Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies were around, the idea surrounding this backstreet currency was one that was used by thieves and drug dealers on the dark web Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are challenging the monetary systems, which has long been intrinsically linked to banks Major banks have always been very sceptical of crypto currencies, and in particular, Bitcoin, and this scepticism has only increased along with Bitcoins popularity. To put it simply, the banks want to destroy Bitcoin, before Bitcoin gets to the bank. Before Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies were around, the idea surrounding this backstreet currency was one that was used by thieves and drug dealers on the dark web. However, this is not the case now, and since the introduction of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ICO’s and blockchain technology, they are now posing a legitimate threat on traditional banks, which has understandably left them incredibly nervous. An unnamed person spoke, agreeing with this view; “Bitcoin’s skyrocketing run in value, as well as adoption and mainstream acceptance, has led to banks – and regulators, getting very nervous and instigating a few knee jerk reactions. These reactions are, however, simply asserting the fact that Bitcoin is a legitimate disruptive threat.” Why is it targeting banks? Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are challenging the monetary systems, which has long been intrinsically linked to banks – especially the central, government-backed banks. This has led the banks to quickly try and play catch up, as it is clear that these cryptocurrencies are not going anywhere. Many countries, namely China, Russia, Japan and the US have tried different ways to try and control this decentralised money idea, which has led traditional centralised, powerful organisations like banks, government and regulators are spending billion in figuring out how to use and control distributed trust technologies. Why are banks nervous of this? Banks are unsure how to react to any threat from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They have been unchallenged for a huge number of years, which has made Bitcoin and all blockchain technologies incredibly hard to control, thanks to its decentralised nature.

15990446,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/heres-bitcoin-makes-major-banks-nervous,1579037400,Here’s Why Bitcoin Makes Major Banks Nervous…,"Before Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies were around, the idea surrounding this backstreet currency was one that was used by thieves and drug dealers on the dark web Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are challenging the monetary systems, which has long been intrinsically linked to banks Major banks have always been very sceptical of crypto currencies, and in particular, Bitcoin, and this scepticism has only increased along with Bitcoins popularity. To put it simply, the banks want to destroy Bitcoin, before Bitcoin gets to the bank. Before Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies were around, the idea surrounding this backstreet currency was one that was used by thieves and drug dealers on the dark web. However, this is not the case now, and since the introduction of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ICO’s and blockchain technology, they are now posing a legitimate threat on traditional banks, which has understandably left them incredibly nervous. An unnamed person spoke, agreeing with this view; “Bitcoin’s skyrocketing run in value, as well as adoption and mainstream acceptance, has led to banks – and regulators, getting very nervous and instigating a few knee jerk reactions. These reactions are, however, simply asserting the fact that Bitcoin is a legitimate disruptive threat.” Why is it targeting banks? Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are challenging the monetary systems, which has long been intrinsically linked to banks – especially the central, government-backed banks. This has led the banks to quickly try and play catch up, as it is clear that these cryptocurrencies are not going anywhere. Many countries, namely China, Russia, Japan and the US have tried different ways to try and control this decentralised money idea, which has led traditional centralised, powerful organisations like banks, government and regulators are spending billion in figuring out how to use and control distributed trust technologies. Why are banks nervous of this? Banks are unsure how to react to any threat from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They have been unchallenged for a huge number of years, which has made Bitcoin and all blockchain technologies incredibly hard to control, thanks to its decentralised nature. As more and more people are using Bitcoin, the power and control is being taking from traditional banks. Whilst some of the smaller establishments are doing what they can to go along with this change, as they recognise that it is the future, larger banks actively denounce it. This is because, they fear that their establishments could go the same way as others when new technologies have come in, making others completely obsolete.

According to an email sent to multiple users of the exchange and shared with CoinDesk, Valerie Gauthier, a victim specialist with the FBI, has been reaching out to former users of the exchange to alert them of a new portal containing information about the case, confirming that the investigation continues.      ""A criminal investigation can be a lengthy undertaking, and, for several reasons, we cannot tell you about its progress at its time,"" Gauthier wrote.      Victims can contact the FBI at quadrigavictims@fbi.gov, though ""inquiries about the status of the case will not be addressed,"" she wrote.      The FBI has reportedly been investigating Quadriga since March 2019, and it announced in June it was looking for victims of the exchange. At the time, the agency included a questionnaire for individuals to fill out.      Multiple email recipients told CoinDesk they filled out the questionnaire last year, while at least one user who did not receive an email said they did not fill out the form.      The FBI is one of at least four national investigative agencies looking into Quadriga, along with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The other two agencies have not been publicly disclosed, though an Australian investigative agency appears to be one of the groups.      Payment processor    Separately, Roger Knox, the founder and operator of Swiss asset management firm Wintercap, formerly known as Silverton, pled guilty to securities fraud before a Boston judge on Monday.      Knox allegedly facilitated market manipulation schemes, including pump-and-dumps on microcap securities, acquiring some $164 million as a result.      Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has alleged that Knox coordinated his scheme with Michael Gastauer, who controlled WB21, a payment processor that Quadriga claims (in a separate proceeding) holding some $9.2 million in Quadriga's funds.

42403794,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgmla,1579028403,More Than Half of Financial Advisors Want Better Regulation Before Investing in Crypto,"More than half of financial advisors in the U.S. are too spooked by regulatory uncertainty to initiate or expand their cryptocurrency investments, a new study by Bitwise Asset Management found.      The annual survey, released Tuesday, asked 415 advisors a range of questions on their crypto sentiments, including where they think the market is going, how their clients approach crypto and what it would take for them to invest more in the space. Bitwise found advisors are increasingly bullish on bitcoin’s future but hesitant to invest in it – for their clients or themselves.      Bitwise conducted the survey in December.      Only 6 percent of respondents currently invest clients' funds in crypto assets, and the holdouts largely plan to continue avoiding crypto in 2020; 55 percent said they will “probably” or “definitely” not invest in crypto this year, while only 7 percent said they “probably” or “definitely” will.      The survey found a notable slice of fence-sitters, too: 38 percent are “unsure” what they’ll do this year, which is significant, said Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s global head of research, who conducted the survey.      “Advisors are intrigued by crypto’s proven history of delivering uncorrelated returns or high returns,” Hougan said. However, many continue to balk at investing, largely because of regulatory uncertainty and questions of access.      Fifty-six percent of respondents said “regulatory concerns” are preventing them from embracing crypto assets. This is despite what Bitwise describes as “significant progress” in the crypto regulatory space in 2019, including action by New York’s Department of Financial Services and steps toward a regulated bitcoin exchange-traded fund.      Respondents are looking at the regulatory landscape. According to the 2019 figures, 42 percent indicated regulation was their top concern, while, looking ahead, this year a majority, or 58 percent, said “better regulation” could spur them to invest.      Hougan said even small increases in investor’s crypto allocations could be a boon for the market overall. He said advisors control $24 trillion in assets, dwarfing bitcoin’s current market cap of about $160 billion.      “Crypto people are over-focused on institutions as the next wave of adopters and under-focused on advisors, who control just as much as the institutions,” he said.      The survey finds advisors increasingly think bitcoin is on the rise. Sixty-four percent project it will add value by 2025, while 8 percent think the market will crash by year’s end.      Their clients, too, seem to show notable interest in crypto’s future – and sometimes outside of their relationships with the fiduciary; 35 percent of advisors believe that some of their clients are investing in crypto themselves. A far larger slice of the advisors – 76 percent – said they fielded clients’ crypto questions in the past year.      Hougan said advisors’ attitudes towards the market made strides through 2019; compared to the “nadir” of December 2018, when bitcoin’s price made historic lows, advisors are more positive this year.      “Last year people were not sure if crypto would survive.

42431390,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2EVh,1579023033,Storming the Gates: How 'Crypto Davos' Became a Thing,"This is part of a series of op-eds previewing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. CoinDesk will be on the ground in Davos from Jan. 20–24 chronicling all things crypto at the annual gathering of the world’s economic and political elite. Follow along by subscribing to our pop-up newsletter, CoinDesk Confidential: Davos.      Sandra Ro is the CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC), which is organizing the four-day Blockchain Central Davos event.      The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF), renowned as a place where business executives, government officials, entrepreneurs and NGO leaders convene to create positive change, is days away.      In recent years the WEF Meeting has come under fire as a place where wealthy elites gather to discuss solutions to problems they helped create and perpetuate – problems many blockchain startups are working to solve. But the reality of Davos lies somewhere between these two extremes.      So why engage? Why do we keep going back?    WEF 2020    2020 is special: It’s the 50th anniversary of the WEF, a non-profit foundation created in 1971 to engage society’s foremost political, business and cultural leaders to shape global, regional and industry agendas.      This year’s WEF theme is “Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World.”      Some of the broad questions to be asked: What does “stakeholder capitalism” mean? Is it tracking progress towards the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? How does technology fit in?      “With the world at such critical crossroads, this year we must develop a ‘Davos Manifesto 2020’ to reimagine the purpose and scorecards for companies and governments,” said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF.      If the world is at a crossroads, what is the role of cryptocurrencies, digital assets and blockchain? And who gets to shape and influence this future?      In short, should “Crypto Davos” collaborate with the established elites?    Crypto Davos, four+ years in the making    Crypto pioneers set up shop with Davos side events four or five years ago. These were modest gatherings to discuss the future of cryptocurrencies. Very few elites knew what this was, or paid it much attention.      Just as bitcoin and ethereum began as organic grassroots initiatives, Crypto Davos grew mainly by group chats and word of mouth. However, by 2018, Crypto Davos reached peak excess, coinciding with the boom of ICOs. This was followed by muted numbers in 2019 with the bust, and now, in 2020, a mix of Crypto Davos stalwarts are returning alongside mainstream corporations that are ahead of the curve in embracing blockchain and, sometimes, cryptocurrency. (Unfortunately, the mantra of “blockchain good, crypto bad” lingers in certain corporate and government circles, though it is dissipating over time.)      What happens at WEF’s official gathering is important, but most who have attended Davos previously know that “the Promenade” is a beehive of activity around cryptocurrencies, blockchain, AI, cybersecurity and other emerging technologies. Many crypto people who attend Davos never step foot inside the main event and do not hold a coveted “white badge.” Instead, they hang out on the Promenade and participate in a myriad of panels, networking events and meetings, mixed with late-night partying and bonding.      The Promenade blockchain events are in high demand and considered cutting edge, thereby attracting some high-profile leaders who might seem out of place under normal, stodgier circumstances. Seeing rock stars, actors, CEOs, billionaires, social-impact entrepreneurs and developers together is not unusual at Crypto Davos.      Where else do you see both Jamie Dimon and Jamie Oliver walking down the same block within meters of each other? Or Michael Douglas walking into an MIT-hosted lunch on AI and blockchain? (Seriously, that happened back in 2017.)      So why did a bunch of crypto people start coming to Davos in the first place? Switzerland’s crypto-friendly environment partially explains the attraction.      But the secret sauce of Davos is not just about discussing important ideas.      Once you make it to this normally sleepy town, you are jumbled together with 30,000 influential people on a few blocks of a “main street.” It makes for an intense and rewarding four days of networking and deal-making, which sets the tone for the rest of the year.    Crossover appeal    Crypto Davos, despite its outsider status, has influenced and changed the course of mainstream Davos.      Just look at 2020’s big thematic on “stakeholders in a cohesive and sustainable world,” which covers everything from economics to climate change to technology, and includes topics like digital identity, digital asset regulation and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).      In 2020, many, if not most, corporations participating at Davos have internal blockchain projects and/or are members of digital asset groups. Five years ago, the CEOs of these same corporations probably did not know blockchain existed.      Crypto Davos has profoundly influenced the interest and growth of digital assets and blockchain technology among some of the most elite institutions, governments and world leaders.      Not bad for a bunch of outsiders.    Selling out?    To the cynics and anti-establishment crowd, we debate every year why we pay exorbitant rates to put together an event at Davos. The high costs, occasionally not-so-subtle hostility from the mainstream, increasingly strict town council rules and the general logistics nightmare are enough to deter most.      However, we return, because our supporters love attending. Why? Because we have met some of the most awe-inspiring people at Davos, from rocket scientists to world leaders to humanitarians.      With a combination of bright, motivated people, ideas turn into action here: from investments to business deals to project launches. No matter how great the tech, we are humans who make connections by meeting each other, spending time with each other and, ultimately, collaborating with each other.      The key for Crypto Davos is to keep influencing and building bridges with the establishment to yield the societal change we want. Blockchain works best when it’s collaborative. The same holds true at Davos: Crypto Davos can improve and scale with the resources of large institutions; Establishment Davos can reimagine business models and government services to create a more equitable and functional society.      This grand experiment works best if people collaborate across geographies and disciplines.      Long live Crypto Davos (at least until the next better version comes along).",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Sandra Ro,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/14/storming-the-gates-how-crypto-davos-became-a-thing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c844b7350cec4f214e77556db9f84608fbd2807-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the notice, the regulator considers IEOs to be similar to initial coin offerings (ICOs), many of which the agency has been investigating as unregistered securities offerings for the past several years. While IEO providers may claim their sales are different from ICOs, they may still violate federal securities laws, the SEC said. As such, the agency warned investors to ""be cautious"" if they are considering investing in an IEO.      ""IEOs are being touted as an innovation on ICOs because they are offered directly by online trading platforms on behalf of companies – usually for a fee – to provide immediate trading opportunities for the digital assets,"" the notice said.      However, the SEC took aim at crypto exchanges directly, noting they ""are typically not registered with the SEC"" and ""may improperly refer to themselves as 'exchanges.'""

42431387,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2ELh,1579021251,What It Takes to Get a Crypto-Friendly Bank Charter in Wyoming,"It’s been more than three months since Wyoming began taking applications to charter a new type of crypto-friendly bank, and no company has announced its application while a handful of firms have indicated an intent to apply.      This hasn’t cooled hype around the charter’s potential. In October, Colorado announced plans to draft special-purpose banking legislation to cater to crypto companies. At CoinDesk’s Invest conference in New York in November, the SPDI charter was touted as a superior substitute for New York’s BitLicense. One month later, crypto exchange Kraken opened a position for an operations director to oversee a Wyoming special-purpose depository institution (SPDI). Currently, the Wyoming Division of Banking is developing partnerships with other state regulators to create joint legal procedures around digital assets, according to a spokesperson for the Wyoming Division of Banking.      So why isn’t Wyoming flooded with SPDI applicants? For one gung-ho firm, it’s been a matter of having the processes in place to apply.      “Once you go into the formal application process, everything has to be pretty well prepared to have the full scrutiny of the Wyoming Banking Commission,” said Jeremy Dzral, co-founder and CEO of WYo Financial, a newly formed corporation in Wyoming that plans to apply in Q1 2020 and be full-fledged SPDI in Q3 of the same year. “We've been in ongoing dialogue with the banking commission for a little over two months.”      Just like a traditional U.S. bank application, an SPDI has to have its procedures, officers and directors, and capital commitments in place before formally applying, the division of banking spokesperson said. The application would take just as long as a traditional bank application to get approved.      “The application is over 19 pages long with more than a 100 items to address,” said Robert Cornish, a partner at the law firm Anderson Kill, who was an advisor to the Wyoming Blockchain Taskforce, Wyoming Blockchain Coalition and WYo Financial.      For some in the crypto community, that might be too much work. Consider that some crypto firms applying for the BitLicense in New York found the six months to a year spent answering requests for information to be daunting, said Chris Ray, partner at Dean & Ray, who’s worked in the crypto space for two years.      “It ended up being quite unwieldy, mostly because of what is perceived to be heavy-handed regulators who are overcautious on every application,” Ray said.      SPDI promises something much more powerful than the BitLicense, however. Under federal interstate banking law, it might allow firms that get the charter to operate anywhere in the U.S., including New York. Firms that get a BitLicense or a trust charter still need to seek money transmitter licenses across the U.S.      SPDI-chartered firms also have the assurance of a crypto-friendly regulator.      The Wyoming Division of Banking would be the SPDI bank’s primary regulator, not the risk-averse U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. On a case-by-case basis, the bank could potentially also gain a master account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, allowing it to deposit funds at the Fed as well as access the global payments system.      The benefits of crypto-friendly regulation come with heavy capital requirements. While the statute that ratified the SPDI charter required $5 million and three years of operating expenses at the time of application, the Wyoming Division of Banking has decided to require a minimum of 1.25 percent to 1.75 percent of proposed assets under management or assets under custody or $10 million, whichever is greater.      Firms should also look to how much de novo retail banks raise – around $25 million – when looking to apply for the SPDI, the spokesperson added.      These capital requirements are designed not to prevent a run on a leveraged bank – SPDI banks are required to keep all of customers’ fiat demand deposits as liquid assets and cannot lend – but to be in effect in case the SPDI bank fails. While SPDI banks don’t have to deal with the FDIC, the Wyoming Division of Banking will now have to play the FDIC’s role in case of bank liquidation.      In a bank failure scenario the Wyoming division of banking would have to contact depositors, arrange for their assets to be returned, hire accounting firms to audit the books and manage the assets while the estate is being settled and cover any litigation costs against the state resulting from the failure.      The SPDI also has to carry a “living will” or resolution plan that outlines how the bank would wind down.      The rules go on to point out that a SPDI bank may resemble a custody bank with a focus on fiduciary activities, asset management and custody. Because of this the division of banking analyzed the tier 1 capital ratio to assets under custody at large custody banks like State Street, BNY Mellon and JP Morgan. To finalize annual reviews and audits, the Wyoming regulator consulted with regulators in other states and around the world, including the U.K., Switzerland and Abu Dhabi.    How to make money    Without the ability to lend while holding a high amount of capital reserves, SPDI banks have the option of making money off the repurchase agreement market but with low interest rates there might not be much money for SPDI banks to make in the repo market.      Without legacy banking infrastructure, Drzal envisions WYo Financial being able to offer custody and banking services as an easily integrated service for blockchain companies – like how Stripe offers mobile app developers the ability to add payments to applications. For instance, Drzal predicts that real estate tokenization firms will be large commercial enterprises which will need payments, onboarding, know-your-customer and compliance services.      “We’re focused on trying to be a bridge between traditional financial services and the next generation of digital asset management and blockchain technology and tokenization,” he said. WYo Financial will also offer banking, card issuing, deposits, payment management, compliance services and managing issuers.      Matt Kaufman, partner at Hathaway & Kunz and former Wyoming Blockchain Task Force participant, is also optimistic that crypto firms can create viable business models using the SPDI charter.      “I’ve gotten dozens and dozens of calls from people about the SPDI and lots of people with different visions for how they might use the SPDI in their business,” Kaufman said. “You’ll see some interested in a B2B solution or commercial type custody, money financial services model … Others are interested in using it as an on- or off-ramp into the crypto world.”      Another reason why firms might be holding off on applying is because the Wyoming legislature will consider adding retail customers to the charter in February, Kaufman added. While there are no traditional underwriting standards for crypto lending, the issue of lending crypto may also be revisited by the Wyoming legislature in the future, Kaufman added.      SPDI banks may also have opportunities to bank other high-risk industries that were affected by Operation Choke Point like the firearm industry and coal industry, said David Pope, president of the DPACPA group of accounting firms and a volunteer advocate for the Wyoming Blockchain Taskforce.      Until the first applicant applies and begins operating under the new charter, many in the crypto industry are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the charter.      “It’s going to be a subjective valuation by the state on a case by case basis,” Cornish said. “Certainly, the first applicant that’s approved will serve as a model of some sort for those considering doing this.”      UPDATE (Jan. 15, 22:30 UTC): A passage in this article was edited to clarify that SPDIs do not automatically get master accounts at the Kansas City Fed; requests for them would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/14/what-it-takes-to-get-a-crypto-friendly-bank-charter-in-wyoming,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f5d3d5ff5427a137218758e134d3dc8d4a11d59-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to an exclusive report by CoinDesk Korea, Binance has taken a 500 million won ($432,000) stake in BxB, a Korean fintech firm that launched a Korean won stablecoin last year.      Alongside the investment, the two firms have inked an agreement that will see BxB support Binance in operating a new support center for local users of Binance.com, the exchange's international platform.      The investment was made, not through the exchange's incubator arm Binance Labs, but directly from Binance, according to the report. Binance Labs has previously invested in local firm Terra.      “We are continuously working with local partners across regions to jointly realize our shared mission in furthering cryptocurrency adoption globally. This investment is another step forward in exploring avenues of growth in Korea, which is an industry-leading market strongly positioned to stimulate blockchain innovation throughout Asia.” Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said.      Binance has also publicly acknowledged for the first time its local entity, Binance Co. Ltd., registered with Korean authorities in October 2019. The subsidiary will operate the new support center in partnership with BxB, the report indicates.      Going forward, Binance has bigger plans for its Korean firm, too.      ""Binance is currently developing a future plan for the Korean market with BxB,"" CZ said. ""We are reviewing what kind of business Binance Co., Ltd. will carry out in Korea, in addition to operating the customer support center.""      One scenario raised by a representative of Binance Co. Ltd. was that it's ""possible"" that BxB's KRWb stablecoin could be linked to Binance's BNB token, presumably to facilitate trading on Binance's platform. While it's recently added a raft of new fiat currency payment options, the exchange doesn't yet have a Korean won gateway.      BxB was previously linked to Binance when it set up another Korean entity, Binance LLC, last July.

After analyzing the profiles of the users who are “getting hired at the highest rates,” LinkedIn researchers found “blockchain” to be the most in-demand skill. So the top ranking might actually be a result of the higher wages employers are ready to pay people who can ostensibly do the blockchains.

""Which means that you don’t have to be in financial services to be seeking new hires who have background and expertise in putting blockchain to use.""

In addition to its spot market trading, PAX Gold is now available as perpetual and quarterly futures contracts on FTX.      Using PAX Gold, a stablecoin backed by gold, FTX will allow traders to buy and sell gold futures contracts via digital assets.       A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified asset at a predetermined price at a specific time in the future.       The price of PAX Gold is tied to the spot price of one troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold, a standard measure for the London gold market. With PAX Gold, a trader or investor owns the underlying physical gold stored in London vaults, which is unlike gold futures, exchange-traded funds or unallocated gold.       By offering more sophisticated trading vehicles for digital assets, FTX hopes to pave the way for eventual options and leverage trading for PAX Gold.

The exchange recently announced that following an upgrade to its wallet security system, the platform is once more able to support ETH deposits and withdrawals. A tweet indicated the services had become available soon after 09:00 UTC Monday.      Traders will need to create a new wallet address to which ETH held on the exchange will be automatically deposited, the firm said.      On Nov. 26, Upbit confirmed an ""abnormal transaction"" had resulted in the exchange losing more than 342,000 ETH from its hot wallet, which at the time was worth approximately $49 million.      The exchange transferred all remaining digital assets into cold storage as a precaution. Although user funds had not been affected, CEO Lee Seok-woo said in a statement following the attack that Upbit would suspend all trading functions temporarily.      Days later, hackers divided the stolen ETH among several wallet addresses. One analyst suggested the group may be sending small test amounts through rival exchange Huobi in an attempt to launder the funds.      In its announcement, Upbit requested users delete their previous addresses, reiterating that wallets created before the hack could not be used: ""The recovery of ETH sent to previous addresses from now could be long and costly process,"" the exchange warned.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/14/upbit-exchange-resumes-ether-services-months-after-49m-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c477df21f38e57e290de1663a1d93721703badc-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A customer of alternative investments gateway AltoIRA purchased an initial investment in security tokens representing CityBlock Capital’s $20 million venture fund, with tokens issued by Securitize. The arrangement is set to open new opportunities for retirement account investors seeking exposure to digital securities, an alternative investment, said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo.      “At the moment [digital securities] are not widely distributed,” Domingo said. “That makes it more complicated for investors to access them, creating a bad cycle.”      Before now, retirement investors were hard-pressed to find entry points into the high-risk, high-reward asset class AltoIRA CEO Eric Satz says has regularly outperformed the market.      “The idea of investing in alternative assets, much less a security token, would be anathema to traditional organizations,” Satz said, referring to companies such as Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and Schwab.      To overcome the institutional blockade, AltoIRA offers individuals those services as a self-directed Individual Retirement Account custodian. In effect this means AltoIRA facilitates trades and is the asset custodian, while the individual makes all investment decisions.      That introduces risk. But Satz said retirement account investors are up for the effort, and are not ones to invest in asset classes of any type without “doing their homework.”      “What we're trying to do is open the doors and provide access to the everyday investor, the same access to higher assets” that institutional investors have, Satz said.      In the case of CityBlock Capital, the tokens will represent CityBlock’s ventures fund NYCQ, a private fund with $10 million allocated to institutional investors. NYCQ includes holdings in CoinBase, Bakkt, Tagomi and Nomics.

That amounts to a notional volume of about $2.3 million or 275 bitcoin, with each contract worth 5 BTC. Also, only call options traded on the first day, as noted by Skew.com, provider of data analytics for Bitcoin and Ether derivatives.      An option contract is a derivative based on the value of an underlying instrument that provides the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the specified amount of the underlying on or before the expiration date. A call option gives the holder a right to buy, while the put option gives the holder the right to sell.      The growth of bitcoin options is widely being touted as a move in the right direction for the cryptocurrency as it may boost institutional participation and help bitcoin evolve into a mature asset class.      Institutional trading platform Bakkt, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, launched bitcoin options on Dec. 9, with very little action on the first day. CME's launch-day trading volume was nearly double the average daily volume seen on Bakkt since then.      Options volumes on the CME may rise rapidly, too, as it has a robust, liquid underlying futures market.      ""Successful options products require a robust, liquid underlying futures market, our CME Bitcoin futures have rapidly evolved over the last two years to become one of the most liquid, listed bitcoin derivatives products in the world, averaging nearly 6,400 contracts (equivalent to 31,850 bitcoin) traded each day in 2019,"" Tim McCourt, managing director at CME Group, wrote in a LinkedIn post.

Chair Heath Tarbert told Cheddar Monday his agency is helping create a regulated futures market investors would be able to ""rely on"" for better ""price discovery, hedging and risk management.""      ""By allowing [cryptocurrencies] to come into the world of the CFTC,"" investors can better access trusted and regulated financial products, improving overall confidence in the asset class, according to Tarbert. ""It's helping to legitimize [digital assets], in my view, and add liquidity to these markets.""      The marketplace for cryptocurrencies derivatives is expanding. Although still dominated by unregulated exchanges, it is gradually facing greater competition from regulated alternatives. Bakkt launched physically delivered bitcoin futures last September and CME, which first launched bitcoin futures in December 2017, opened trading for options contracts Monday.      In the interview, Tarbert reiterated that his perspective will only extend to cryptocurrencies the CFTC currently classifies as commodities. Appointed chairman last April, he has advocated for an open regulatory regime when it comes to cryptocurrencies.      In an op-ed published on the CFTC website November, Tarbert argued regulators should adopt a greater ""principles-based approach"" to the asset class. ""The trick with digital assets is to foster the development of exciting new products while mitigating potential risks,"" he wrote.      Rather than the regulator issuing prescriptive rules that companies need to follow, companies should develop commercially viable solutions that satisfy regulatory standards, he said.      The CFTC first defined bitcoin as a commodity in 2015, confirming the classification when it gave the go-ahead to CME and Cboe to launch regulated futures at the close of 2017. Ether was only confirmed as a commodity last October when Tarbert said that, as it hadn't been treated as a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ""it stands to reason"" that it is most likely a commodity.      When asked by Cheddar whether any other cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, could soon be defined as commodities, Tarbert told investors ""to watch this space"" as the CFTC works closely with the SEC to ""really think about which [crypto] falls in what box.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/14/regulated-derivatives-will-legitimize-crypto-says-cftc-chair,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f54e1cf685c2d6a39a68c54f4521319ddd0f3e60-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431402,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2Elh,1579001146,Resurgent Bitcoin Will Likely Shrug Off Long-Term Bear Cross,"View      Bitcoin's short-term technical charts indicate scope for a test of the 200-day average at $9,100.  A breakout on a longer duration chart has opened the doors for a rise to $10,000 and above.  An impending long-term bearish crossover on the three-day chart is a lagging indicator and is of little concern.  The short-term bullish case would weaken if prices print a UTC close below $8,200.    Bitcoin is better bid at press time and could maintain its recent upward trajectory despite a long-term bearish indicator making its first appearance in 19 months.      The top cryptocurrency rose to a two-month high of $8,580 during Tuesday's Asian trading hours and is currently trading at $8,480 indicating a 4.8 percent rise on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Bitcoin is now up by more than 30 percent from the low of $6,425 reached in December 2019.      While the cryptocurrency is showing signs of life following the gloomy second half of 2019, a widely tracked technical indicator is about to flash a bearish signal.      The 50-candle average on the three-day chart is trending south and looks set to cross below the 100-candle average in the next few days. That would be the first bearish crossover of the two averages since June 2018.      However, moving averages are based on historical data and tend to lag prices. To put it another way, crossovers are the result of the price action that has already happened and have limited predictive powers.      While bitcoin did drop in the days leading up to and after the confirmation of the same bear cross in June 2018, the broader market conditions were bearish at the time, as seen below.    3-day chart    The 50- and 100-candle MAs produced a bear cross in the three days to June 21, 2018 (above left). Prices had fallen from $7,800 to $6,300 in the first two weeks of June and dropped further to lows below $5,800 by the end of the month.      A subsequent rise ended up creating a bearish lower high at $8,500 and prices remained below the 50-candle MA till April 2019.      It's worth noting that bitcoin had rallied by more than 1,300 percent in 2017 before falling by 50 percent in the first quarter of 2018. Essentially, the market had a hard landing after the staggering annual gain, and the bear cross likely gave traders a reason to unwind their long positions.    Brighter picture    This time, however, the situation is very different. Bitcoin has recently broken out of a six-month falling channel, signaling a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,100 seen in April 2019 and opening doors for a re-test of October highs above $10,000.      Further, the breakout comes four months ahead of the mining reward halving – a process that reduces the supply of bitcoin. Alex Benfield, data analyst at Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk the event could bode well for prices.      Historically, bitcoin tends to hit a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of a halving, but before the event, according to popular analyst Rekt Capital.      So, the cryptocurrency could rise above the 2019 high of $13,880 ahead of the May 2020 halving.      All in all, the impending three-day chart bearish crossover should not be a cause for worry for the bulls.    4-hour and daily charts    The high-volume bounce from the ascending trendline on the 4-hour chart (above left) indicates the rally from the Jan. 3 low of $6,853 has resumed. Prices could challenge the 200-day average resistance at $9,097 (above right) in the next few days.      The daily chart (above right) also indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side. For instance, the recent inverse head-and-shoulders breakout and the subsequent rise to two-month highs is telling a tale of a successful transition from a bearish-to-bullish setup.      The immediate bullish case would weaken if prices close (UTC) below $8,200 today. That level acted as strong resistance multiple times over the weekend.      A UTC close below the higher low of $7,667 created on June 10 is needed to confirm a short-term bearish reversal.

42374503,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWva05b,1578996000,Off-Blocks Launches US Government-Tested Digital Signature Service in Beta,"Digital signature platform Off-Blocks is bringing its government-tested document verification tools to the public.  The company launched its digital identity mobile app beta Monday, according to CEO Colin Campbell, offering to the public some of the Factom blockchain-powered anti-forgery mechanisms the companies have been building for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) since November. The full platform is expected to go live in the coming weeks.  Off-Blocks’ public service seeks to infuse trust across digital file sharing. People and companies have an inherent need to authenticate any number of documents, Campbell said. While signing PDF contracts is perhaps the most well-known digital signature use case, Campbell said that, increasingly, digitized workspaces and lives require more robust platforms.  Campbell said he built the file-agnostic Off-Blocks platform for the everyday, any-situation user that might need to verify a screengrab, a video or music file.  “The big difference is you can sign any file in any format, however it’s presented to you,” Campbell said. “Imagine how you could interact with the digital world around you.”  He said the service could be used by creators seeking to validate their digital rights and even car crash victims who need to provide photographic “evidence” to their insurance providers.  Campbell said he’s positioning his service for wide adoption in the belief a second-layer solution is the ""only way to bring [the] masses to blockchain.""  Market realities dictated Campbell’s partnership with Factom. He could not afford to pay often-high and volatile transaction fees associated with public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum, he said, and many of his prospective clients balked at interacting with cryptocurrency, still untrusted in some enterprise circles.  If all goes according to plan, Off-Blocks’ first users will have no idea a blockchain’s involved.  “You won’t find a single mention of the word ‘blockchain’” in the app, Campbell said. “It’s become a bit of a dirty word.” (The beta does mention the term, though.)  But that doesn’t mean it’s not a valuable technology. Campbell saw no reason to burden everyday users with buzzwords; he does not consider himself a “tech guy” and therefore believed he had more to gain by staying quiet on the back-end complexities than attempting to educate a public still largely ignorant about blockchain.  “Most applications now on a blockchain are built by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, trying to impress their mates,” Campbell said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/14/off-blocks-launches-us-government-tested-digital-signature-service-in-beta,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63cfffc149c1153b68fb997bbaedd4bb808aff69-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431392,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2EXh,1578992400,Kraken Futures to Expand Into Russia After New Hire,"Kraken Futures has hired its first Russian representative in a bid to ramp up its operations in the world's largest country by land mass.      The regulated futures provider, acquired by Kraken last year when it was called Crypto Facilities, brought on Aleksey Bragin last month and now intends to grow its Russian presence with in-person visits and Russian-language social media groups. The London-based subsidiary currently offers bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin and XRP futures contracts and sees some $48 million in average daily volume for the bitcoin futures. The company saw $17 million in volume on Monday.      “Russia is the most under-appreciated market in crypto today,” said Kevin Beardsley, head of business development at Kraken Futures. Beardsley believes the abundance of tech talent, especially in crypto, makes Russia an attractive market.      “The conversation is dominated by the U.S. and China, probably a bit less Japan and Korea,"" he said. ""Even [though] Russia is objectively a leader in the infrastructure building and has a large community, it gets relatively little coverage,.""      As two examples, Beardsley cited Telegram and TradingView, which have teams predominantly from Russia and surrounding nations.      Bragin started in November 2019, the company announced last month (Beardsley said the post was published on Dec. 24 but backdated to November). He comes with experience in the industry, having founded peer-to-peer crypto futures exchange ICBIT back in 2011. That was acquired by Swedish crypto exchange Safello in 2016.      “Russian traders increasingly consider cryptocurrency to be just another asset class, alongside commodities and currencies,” Bragin told CoinDesk. “The rapidly growing number of individual traders, combined with the increasing acceptance of trading cryptocurrency, represent clear, positive signals for the growth cryptocurrency futures trading in Russia.”      He added that even though derivatives market at large in Russia is still very young, it’s already “developed into one of the most important markets.”      “Cryptocurrency derivatives started attracting traders from the classic futures market in 2018, it grew in 2019 and trading experts expect the trend to continue in 2020,” Bragin said.      The Russian expansion for Kraken will not involve spot trading or see any fiat on-ramps for the Russian ruble. Crypto-to crypto futures trading is the safest way to enter the market, Beardsley said, as it presents “a relatively low risk of [the exchange being used for] money laundering.”      So far, few global exchanges have paid special attention to Russia, among them Huobi, which opened an office in Moscow in November 2018, Binance, which launched a fiat on-ramp for the Russian ruble earlier this year.      Russians are trading crypto derivatives quite actively, according to the Yakov Barinsky, CEO of HASH CIB, a crypto asset management firm that actively trades derivatives itself.      Barinsky said between 10 percent and 15 percent of the trading volume on the most popular crypto derivatives exchanges like BitMEX, Deribit and Kraken comes from Russian traders, most of whom are professionals.      Russian traders might be bringing in from $4 million of trades on Kraken to some $230 million on BitMEX in bitcoin futures trade. As such, Kraken will face some serious competition in Russia, Barinsky said, adding, “After Binance Futures was launched, liquidity started moving to it and we expect that it’s going to exceed others by trading volume this year.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/14/kraken-futures-to-expand-into-russia-after-new-hire,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2aa538495e2a0a17ecbdc1e2e39c791a0574fc04-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Jan. 14 at around 00:30 UTC, the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value rose above an area of resistance that had stifled previous rallies near $8,200 for over a week beginning Jan. 7.      As of press time, BTC is changing hands at $8,413 after reaching its highest point in nearly two months at around $8,446, CoinDesk BPI data shows.      This comes several hours after the successful launch of Chicago-based derivatives exchange CME’s futures contracts for BTC, which surpassed rival Bakkt in reported volume within its first day of trading.      Global Head of crypto trading giant Cumberland, Chris Zuehlke said institutional investors are seeking traditional risk management tools to support greater entry into crypto.      “As with any new financial product, we expect volume will grow organically as investors get more comfortable trading it,” Zuehlke said.      An option on a futures contract gives a holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific futures contract at a strike price on or before the option's expiration date.      Joshua Green, head of trading at cryptocurrency trading firm Digital Asset Capital Management, said the rise in BTC’s value was “nothing obvious” citing a potential short-squeeze.      “Maybe some negative gamma from spot moving through that strike (of $8,250) or people covering shorts that were put on in a notification of Chinese New Year sell-off,” Green said.

42431395,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2Efh,1578960793,WisdomTree Mulls New Stablecoin as US Money Manager Drives Toward Crypto,"WisdomTree, an asset manager specializing in exchange-traded funds, is vying to become one of the first established U.S. financial firms to offer clients digital assets, including a so-called stablecoin whose value is closely linked to the U.S. dollar.      New York-based WisdomTree, which oversees about $63 billion, views cryptocurrencies and digital assets as a natural extension of its business in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, according to corporate-strategy director William Peck. ETFs trade like stocks on exchanges but allow investors to allocate money to traditional financial assets ranging from high-dividend companies to bonds and emerging-market currencies.      According to Peck, a regulated WisdomTree stablecoin could look similar in structure and purpose to an ETF backed by dollar-denominated assets like short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. But it could appeal to crypto traders since it would theoretically move easily on networks powered by blockchain, the computer-programming technology underpinning cryptocurrencies.      “We absolutely see a market within the existing crypto-native community, transacting digital assets today,” Peck said. “Longer term, this is positioning us to be a leader” in fast-evolving crypto markets.      The revelation that WisdomTree was looking into creating a stablecoin follows the announcement last week that it was the lead investor in a new $17.65 million funding round for the startup company Securrency, which specializes in tools designed to assure regulatory compliance on blockchain systems.      Late last year, WisdomTree launched an exchange-traded product, on a Swiss stock exchange, designed to provide investors with exposure to bitcoin.      A stablecoin from a regulated money manager like WisdomTree might receive a warmer reception from U.S. authorities who last year largely panned a proposal from the social network Facebook to launch a token that its 2.3 billion users could use for payments.      Dollar-linked tokens like tether, USD Coin and MakerDAO’s Dai - launched by crypto industry programmers and entrepreneurs - have evolved to become a de facto form of cash in digital-asset markets, though none of those are regulated as registered securities.      WisdomTree hasn’t filed any public, formal proposals with securities regulators for digital assets, according to Peck, and he declined to provide a timeline for any plans. Big money managers often discuss proposals privately with regulators prior to making a formal filing.      “This is going to be something that we would proactively bring to them,” Peck said.      Boston-based Fidelity Investments, which manages or administers about $7.8 trillion of customer assets, argued in a report last week that the potential of bitcoin, the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, “cannot be ignored.”      “There's a belief among some that blockchain-based infrastructure is going to be more and more critical in financial services going forward,” said Peck. “We feel like this kind of step is a way in which WisdomTree can be involved if the world evolves in that way.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MKR,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/14/wisdomtree-mulls-new-stablecoin-as-us-money-manager-drives-toward-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2bb4f21521ddf6555ab1f27f5e08408960c1e460-1200x1159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
