42386085,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR3a7,1614729205,Gensler Straddles Innovation and Enforcement at Senate Hearing,"“I'm neither a maximalist nor a minimalist but I do believe [blockchain is] a catalyst for change,” said Gary Gensler, the potential next chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      Gensler was speaking to the Senate Banking Committee, which held a hearing Tuesday to consider his nomination to the SEC, along with President Joe Biden’s nominee to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra.      Gensler’s background suggests he is both pro-crypto and pro-regulation, and it remains unclear if the industry will perceive him as friendly or overzealous on regulation. The hearing didn’t provide too many clues because Gensler was careful to strike a balance between emphasizing regulating suspicious behavior and encouraging new innovations.      The largely substantive hearing had senators asking Gensler to detail how he would approach current issues, including the recent GameStop stock market volatility and Robinhood’s payment for order flow model, diversity mandates and financial regulation in the wake of the pandemic.      Gensler, who has lectured at MIT about the cryptocurrency industry, praised the technology at various points during the hearing, noting that it could provide cheaper cross-border or domestic transactions while the underlying blockchain technology can be applied to medical records, trade finance or other data collection uses.      “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have brought new thinking to payments and financial inclusion, but they've also raised new issues of investor protection that we still need to attend to,” he said. “If confirmed at the SEC, I'd work with fellow commissioners to both promote the new innovation, but also at the core to ensure investor protection.”      This would include examining what might fall under U.S. securities laws, and checking whether there are any specific investor protection statutes that would apply to crypto exchanges, he said.    Investor protections    Gensler, a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman, repeatedly brought up investor protection concerns, telling Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) that as cryptocurrencies and possible central bank digital currencies grow, “it’s important to stay true to our principles of investor protection and capital formation.”      If an entity is offering an investment contract, that falls under the SEC’s purview. If a cryptocurrency is more a commodity like bitcoin, it could fall under the CFTC or Congress could determine how it would be overseen, he said.      These protection concerns include crypto custody and ensuring that regulated entities have sole control over the private keys for digital assets, he said. Gensler’s concerns also include overseeing fraud and manipulation.

The SEC should also remain technology-neutral, Gensler said.      When Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) asked how the SEC could regulate the industry, Gensler said it would be important for the agency to provide guidance, which could occur through no-action letters or rulemaking.    Real-time payments    Both Gensler and Chopra mentioned the benefits of a faster real-time payment settlement system, with Chopra specifically calling for more work to be done in implementing such a system.      “We can not be falling behind other countries. We see that China is in many ways investing in faster payments, in a stablecoin,” Chopra said. “That will help consumers and businesses get funded faster, to their benefit, and I strongly support efforts to modernize that system so that everyone can have equal access.”      Chopra has advocated for a modernized real-time payment system before, writing a letter to the Federal Reserve in 2019 recommending the central bank move forward on the “FedNow” service in light of the at-the-time Libra stablecoin initiative. He revisited his concerns on Tuesday.

Chopra also raised data privacy concerns, saying there are “real questions” about what data is collected by technology companies and how that data is used.      After Tuesday’s hearing, the Senate Banking Committee must vote on whether to advance the nominations. The full Senate will then vote on whether to confirm the nominees to their respective positions.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/02/gensler-straddles-innovation-and-enforcement-at-senate-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f7eaa3245b082830282102d7c891eb1794c9e22-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386074,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR3On,1614727172,"For a Sense of Gensler's SEC, See His CFTC","In his highly anticipated U.S. Senate hearing this morning, Gary Gensler, nominated to chair the Securities and Exchange Commisson (SEC) presented tech savvy and powerful understanding of the regulatory challenges facing the crypto industry.      Gensler’s opening statement stressed “strengthening transparency and accountability in our markets, so people can invest with confidence, and be protected from fraud and manipulation.”    Chen Arad is the COO of Solidus Labs, a New York-based provider of crypto-native market surveillance and risk monitoring solutions.    On that note, Gensler referenced his tenure as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and in particular his “decisive action to increase transparency and reduce risk in the $400 trillion swaps market.”      While history is not an indicator of future performance, it’s wise to use the past to help inform our future expectations. So the crypto industry should educate itself on Gensler’s actions and priorities while leading the CFTC to better understand how he might approach crypto (should he be confirmed as the next SEC chairman).      There are clear parallels between current crypto markets and the historical derivatives markets Gensler addressed during his time as CFTC chair. In a recent NPR interview, Salman Banaei, a lawyer and economist who previously worked under Gensler at the CFTC on market surveillance, noted that “before Gensler came in, there wasn't much active surveillance of what traders were doing during the trading day.”      The CFTC, he says, would often wait until a complaint was filed and react to that. But with Gensler, Banaei says, that changed.      See also: How SEC Chair Gary Gensler Could Differ From Predecessor Jay Clayton      Creating a holistic trade surveillance program, as opposed to launching investigations based on anecdotal reports or incidents, led to a number of investigations and settlements, according to Banaei. In other words, proactively surveilling market data immediately advanced market integrity.      Gensler has frequently emphasized the need for modern surveillance of markets, notably following the May 6, 2010 flash crash. In a congressional testimony then, Gensler highlighted how cross-market trading strategies – which focus on trading price-correlated assets in separate markets to affect pricing and make arbitrage gains – contributed to the crash that hurt millions of Americans.      Until then, the CFTC collected all transaction and open position data. Due to the flash crash, it asked exchanges for full order book data for the days leading up to the event. “This was a tremendous effort to collect and analyze an enormous data file that included more than 14 million messages just for one day,” Gensler testified. It took months, but this ultimately enabled the CFTC to understand what happened.      But it wasn’t sustainable. Gensler told Congress that regulators must be able to truly understand and respond to suspicious market behavior in real time or near it. In the long term, capital market supervision needs to incorporate more comprehensive data reporting regimes, shared data repositories, and harness technology to surveil the data in an automated and sophisticated manner.    Markets work best when there's a cop on the beat.    What does this mean for crypto with Gensler as SEC Chair?      If you read any of the SEC’s rejections to bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications – and I read most of them – you know that market manipulation is a major concern for the SEC. Those concerns are already addressed in other markets through shared-surveillance and data repositories, like the ones Gensler helped promote and enable in swaps and future markets.      But in crypto markets, where assets like bitcoin aren’t native to any exchange, the agency is not confident such frameworks are in place (though they are technically possible).      See also: Gary Gensler - Even if a Thousand Projects Don’t Make It, Blockchain Is Still a Change Catalyst      Gensler seems to be in agreement with these concerns. “The volumes, millions of customers, repeated hacks and ample potential for manipulative behavior, suggest that oversight is worthy by securities, commodities and derivatives regulators around the globe,” he told Congress in 2018.      Given the importance of learning from history, we know the SEC sees market manipulation as a fundamental hurdle to allowing the further adoption of crypto by American retail and institutional investors – as its ETF decisions indicate.      Second, we know Gensler isn’t blindly pro-crypto and he does specifically understand how crypto markets work, as Jeff Bandman who worked with him aptly pointed out in a CoinDesk op-ed.      Third, he sees market manipulation as a major challenge crypto needs to address, and believes federal regulation and shared surveillance frameworks are ways to stymie manipulation and trade abuse in crypto markets.      Finally, we know Democratic administrations are more likely to provide regulators with increased oversight authority and supervision mandates.      As Gensler told NPR, “Markets work best when there's a cop on the beat.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Chen Arad,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/02/for-a-sense-of-genslers-sec-see-his-cftc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/801ff2132554c41f6ead16d9b88665f1692ce3c9-1087x825.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386093,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR3hf,1614722580,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Continues Choppy in High $40Ks Amid Market Indecision,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $47,700 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET) slipping 1.83% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $50,213 to $47,118.  Following a correction over the weekend, bitcoin struggles to regain upward momentum as market indecision lingers.    Bitcoin slid 5%, struggling to maintain momentum after a big rally on Monday to start off the month.      As of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), bitcoin was changing hands just above $47,000 on Coinbase. The largest cryptocurrency is still well off its all-time high price above $58,000 reached late last month.      A combination of factors could have spooked some cryptocurrency traders, leading to last week’s 21% sell-off, the biggest for a seven-day stretch since March 2020.    Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s (GBTC) premium to its underlying asset flipped negative for the first time in years last week shortly before the market dipped, potentially signaling investors exiting the market.  Goldman Sachs announced plans to restart its cryptocurrency trading desk, which some traders speculated could be bearish for the market simply because of the timing of Goldman’s initial launch of the desk at the market’s peak in 2017.  Leading stablecoin issuer Tether was threatened with a 500 BTC ransom note to be paid to prevent the public release of supposed documents between Tether and its bank, Deltec.    But there’s also been a steady stream of bullish news:    Cboe BZX Exchange filed to list shares of VanEck’s bitcoin ETF, kicking off the regulatory review process for an exchange-traded fund listing in the US.  Goldman Sachs restarting its cryptocurrency trading desk is not bullish to many traders who see it as merely another indicator that more institutional traders and investors are showing interest in digital asset markets.  Corporate buyers aren’t finished investing either, with bitcoin-laden MicroStrategy topping off its latest $1 billion investment with another $15 million purchase.  Citigroup released a 108-page report about the cryptocurrency industry in which it said bitcoin is at a “tipping point” amid surging retail and institutional interest.  PayPal is said to be in talks to acquire Curv, a cryptocurrency custody business, in a move that could position the payments giant to dive further into the crypto market.  Large bitcoin outflows from Coinbase continue. Another 12,000 BTC left Coinbase on Tuesday. Although there are many blind spots in Bitcoin blockchain data, these large outflows have recently coincided with investments from institutional or corporate investors.    Speaking to Cboe’s filing, EQUOS head of sales and trading Matt Blom told CoinDesk, “This by no means ensures the floodgates will open, but it is a huge step towards allowing the investing public easy access to the performance of our favorite asset.” As regulators consider the listing, “there will be a long line of competitors to the VanEck bitcoin ETF hoping that the winds of change are officially here,” Blom said.      The bottom line: The market is quiet as it struggles to find direction. Bitcoin has gained 60% year to date. Ether (ETH) has doubled over the same period but today the crypto is down -3.87%.

42386091,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR3iv,1614721334,"More Institutional Investors Jumping Into Bitcoin Leaves Less to Go Around, Data Shows","Four million. That’s roughly how much bitcoin is circulating freely right now, blockchain data show. The number has been getting a little smaller with each passing month over the last year.      It's the assessment of Glassnode, an analysis firm that tracks blockchain data. The pattern suggests that the ever-decreasing supply of bitcoin available to buy and sell might lead to a price surge as more institutional investors embrace the largest cryptocurrency as an investment.      Bitcoin’s “liquid supply change” – the amount by which the number of coins in circulation has changed over the prior 30 days – has been negative for most of the past year, according to Glassnode:      That’s a longer period in negative than seen historically, potentially providing more support to bitcoin’s price strength in the long term despite short-term corrections like last week’s 21% retreat.      As of Monday, there were only about 4 million BTC in constant circulation and available for buying, trading and selling, according to Glassnode. The 30-day net change of BTC supply held by liquid and highly liquid entities has been in the negative territory since last April, except for a short stint between July and August and again briefly in December.      “This has never happened before for such an extended period of time, and could lead to a massive supply squeeze soon,” Glassnode wrote on Feb. 26 in its weekly newsletter.    Increased recognition of bitcoin’s long-term value    The Bitcoin blockchain’s third halving last May cut the pace of mining rewards to 6.25 BTC for every data block (roughly every 10 minutes) from 12.5 BTC. At the same time, big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and BlackRock are now dabbling in cryptocurrencies, while the payment giants PayPal and Square’s Cash App have allowed their users to buy and sell the digital assets.      On Monday, Daniel Loeb, CEO and founder of the hedge fund Third Point, wrote in a series of tweets that he was taking a “deep dive into crypto.”      Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter bitcoin broker, told CoinDesk that “institutions are buying up more bitcoin per month than the ones that are being mined, and there just isn't enough for everybody.”      “This is the biggest factor that has been driving bitcoin's price up lately,” he added.      The supply dynamic could prove crucial to restoring a bullish tone to the bitcoin market, after last week’s price correction shook some retail investors’ confidence. The sell-off took bitcoin to near $43,000, down 26% from an all-time high price above $58,000 on Feb 21.      Compared with bitcoin’s last big market correction in early January, fewer long-term bitcoin holders appeared to be reducing their positions or taking profits last week, according to Glassnode. This can be seen in the chart below, where the shaded red area – indicating a position reduction by long-term holders – has been moving back toward a neutral footing.    Supply squeeze for institutions    Data from another blockchain-analysis firm, CryptoQuant, show that more than 12,000 BTC, worth roughly $600 million, was moved out of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Pro Tuesday – seen as a likely withdrawal to cold storage for long-term holding by one or more institutional investors. It might be a sign the investors took advantage of the price dip to accumulate bitcoin at a discounted price.      Exchanges like Coinbase Pro are among the few preferred platforms by institutions to buy and sell bitcoin, according to John Willock, chief executive at digital-asset exchange Blocktane. It means that bitcoin’s already finite supply is only more scarce to these large bitcoin buyers.      “Coinbase will only touch coins through their exchange, liquidity providers and network of other partners that are brought to their liquidity pool by parties which are able to be fully vetted for the source of legitimate funds,” Willock said. “The bitcoin available on that platform can be considered ‘clean’ and not having recently been the proceeds of a hack, theft, ransomware or darknet markets.”      Fewer bitcoins are becoming available to institutions “because they have higher standards than the general market, “ Willock said. “So, as a result, these sorts of institutions can be forced to start bidding up coins on these ‘clean’ exchanges, and that drives up the price overall.”      Read More: Bitcoin Outflows From Coinbase Suggest Institutions Are Buying the Dip",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/02/more-institutional-investors-jumping-into-bitcoin-leaves-less-to-go-around-data-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/054e26070839bb8fb8867bfba7ebb9fbd32db90e-1200x610.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Indeed, the Tuesday posting for an early-stage blockchain strategist makes clear that any corporate plans are still in the works. The position’s exceptionally broad mission only serves to underline that Discover could take its roadmap in any number of ways.

The three-year old startup, which builds tax assistance tools for U.S. crypto exchanges and customers, told CoinDesk it will more than double its 40-odd headcount as it prepares to add even government clients to the list.      TaxBit’s software powers behind-the-scenes number crunching for exchanges in order to give crypto traders a handle on their tax burdens. Going into the 2021 tax season, TaxBit founder Austin Woodward told CoinDesk his firm has already generated over 1 million reports for exchanges like Gemini.      Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss invested in TaxBit’s Series A, as did PayPal Ventures and CoinBase Ventures. The VC trio led a separate “strategic investment” in TaxBit earlier this year.      The eye-popping raise will allow the historically hush-hush, Utah-based firm to explode into the global crypto tax field, Woodward said. First up is a U.K. debut in the next few months followed by a smattering of other international markets.      Along the way, TaxBit will continue integrating its B2B software across more U.S. exchanges, though Woodward wouldn’t say which ones.      Woodward even hinted a government partnership is fast approaching, cryptically citing the City of Miami’s bold bitcoin strategy.      “The reason for the big funding is because that's what it takes to go and build an asset, a platform, that can enable an entire asset class.

42386084,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR3bN,1614713745,"BitGo Reveals $250M in Bitcoin Holdings, Signaling More Crypto-Native Disclosures Ahead","Digital asset infrastructure company BitGo holds $250 million in bitcoin on its balance sheet, CEO Mike Belshe revealed to CoinDesk in a recent interview.      The disclosure comes at a time when more crypto companies are opening up about their own bitcoin holdings. It’s not unusual for crypto firms to hold the same assets as they’re selling to their customers, but a recent wave of institutional investment has these same firms sharing details about their own investments in crypto assets.      BitGo has had bitcoin on its balance sheet since 2014, Belshe said. One of the first products BitGo pursued in that same year was a multi-sig, multi-user wallet designed in part for treasury management, he added.      While putting bitcoin into treasury became trendy in 2020 with MicroStrategy, Square, MassMutual and others, it’s an asset diversification strategy that BitGo had seen clients practice long before the bull run.      “It’s taken longer for the industry to evolve than we thought it would,” Belshe said.      BitGo’s disclosure comes about a week after leading crypto exchange Coinbase revealed in a blog post that it has held bitcoin and other assets on its balance sheet since 2012.    Read more: Coinbase Has Held Crypto Assets Like Bitcoin on Its Balance Sheet Since 2012    At the time BitGo added bitcoin to its own treasury, Belshe argued the firm should have the same exposure to the asset its customers were taking on.      “A venture-backed firm taking a position on something other than U.S. dollars for their investment money is a very controversial thing,” Belshe said. “If the founders came to the investors and said, ‘Hey, I’d like to take the cash you gave us and put it in gold, the answer would be, ‘No, you shouldn’t do that.’”      At the time, BitGo developed a liquidity policy that looked at what would happen in the event the digital assets in its treasury went to zero, and has maintained 24 to 36 months of cash runway aside from its digital asset holdings.      “I strongly recommend that companies invest heavily in bitcoin,” Belshe said. “I think the global pandemic has shown that some exposure to digital assets is actually a way to stabilize your business as opposed to destabilizing it.”      Belshe points to insurance funds and pensions allocating 3% to 5% of their cash reserves to bitcoin as a benchmark for other companies thinking about adding bitcoin to the balance sheet. While interest rates remain low, Belshe expects investors to keep pouring into high-yield assets like bitcoin for some time.      “Generally, what people are expecting is a pretty dismal [bond] market for a while,” Belshe said. “The other place you can go right now is the stock market but if those bond rates go up then the stock markets are going to take a hit … so I think people are looking for a general hedge against both markets.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/02/bitgo-reveals-250m-in-bitcoin-holdings-signaling-more-crypto-native-disclosures-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df43532615c44b1b1706fba94b636acb2dcf7d8e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386089,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR3dt,1614713448,How Regulating GameStop's 'Market Manipulation' Could Harm Crypto,"The ongoing roller-coaster ride of GameStop, dogecoin and other so-called meme stocks has led day traders, market makers and exchanges to attack each other with knee-jerk accusations of “market manipulation.” When this happens, the primary winners are government regulators seeking to expand the scope of their authority. Industry cries of market “manipulation” – from all sides – are not only shortsighted. They also risk setting the market on a path towards an enforcement framework that all market participants may come to regret, no matter what side they think they are currently on.    Reddit takes on Wall Street    Since early this year, by sharing tips and organizing on social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter, individual traders have been able to rally prices of meme stocks to unbelievable heights. First, it was GameStop, AMC and a handful of other targets, with traders sending prices skyward 1,500% or more. Then, traders set their sights beyond the securities markets: dogecoin (DOGE) rose over 800% in 24 hours after a tweet from Elon Musk rallied the masses behind it.    Benjamin Sauter, David McGill, Steven Perlstein and William McGovern are all attorneys at global disputes and investigations firm Kobre & Kim. The lawyers aggressively defend clients in the cryptocurrency and commodity derivatives industries against high-stakes government actions.    Naturally, not everyone was happy with these developments. As institutional investors and short sellers proceeded to lose huge amounts of money, they accused the day traders and social media platforms of market manipulation by banding together to buy assets for the purpose of raising the price – and worse, doing so with the specific intention of inflicting pain on Wall Street. In turn, the day traders are throwing these accusations right back at Wall Street, arguing that trading platforms and market makers mounted a defense by unlawfully colluding to stamp out their trading.      See also: Jill Carlson - GameStop and the Real Market Manipulators      As both sides bray for blood, government regulators, legislators and opportunistic lawsuit filers are wading in a move that threatens both the institutional players as well as individual traders.      This is not good for either side: While some traders and investors may welcome government intervention and reallocation of trading profits today, they may not realize that, in the long run, loose accusations of “market manipulation” may create a lose-lose situation that promotes precisely the type of expansive enforcement theories regulators have been pushing for – and the industry has been fighting against – for years.    A Trojan Horse for broader regulation    By inviting government intervention, the industry may be ushering in a new era of regulatory oversight over not only financial markets, but also the act of discussing and organizing investments on social media.      That’s not to say existing financial regulations should be free from scrutiny. Social media creates a world where anyone can become an investment adviser for large audiences, and the existing regulatory regime may not be up to the task of the digital age. In the U.S., there is currently no coherent regulatory approach to digital assets. But in attempting to shoehorn the recent GameStop and dogecoin rallies under the umbrella of “market manipulation,” the industry is setting a trap for itself.      Regulators have long argued that people who trade securities or commodities for the purpose of changing their price can be guilty of market manipulation. An example can be found as recently as just last month, when the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) accused a swaps trader of manipulation simply for selling swaps to move its price down.      This type of theory is flawed, bordering on nonsensical. The financial industry – including individual traders, market makers, and institutions alike – has valiantly opposed such amorphous theories of “market manipulation” for years, with notable success in the courts. The current round of finger pointing, however, threatens to undo these industry gains.    The folly of intent or price impact    A trader’s subjective intent in placing an order is not a rational standard for policing global financial markets. Regardless of a trader’s true intent in his heart of hearts, any executable order placed into the market is exactly what it purports to be: an offer to buy or sell at a particular price. All bids and offers placed in an electronic marketplace represent true and actionable market depth, and that does not change simply because one trader intends one thing while another trader intends something different. An intent-based standard for market manipulation poses a serious risk of arbitrary enforcement – and a risk that the government will pick winners and losers by singling out politically-unfavored traders.      Nor is price impact a rational standard. Any order can theoretically impact price, whether of the particular asset in question or of a derivative or correlated asset. A trade’s impact on price, like a trader’s subjective intent, is not a meaningful standard by which to distinguish lawful from unlawful trading in today’s interrelated markets.      Market transactions should not be distorted by the deliberate spreading of falsehoods and misrepresentations, which is what the concept of “market manipulation” was originally designed to address. But claims that GameStop traders “manipulated” the market because they intended to or in fact did drive the price up (or short positions down) are reckless and simplistic. Placing real orders to buy or sell at prevailing market prices, whatever the intent of those orders, should not be seen as manipulative in an unlawful sense.    Claims that GameStop traders 'manipulated' the market because they intended to or in fact did drive the price up.. are reckless and simplistic    In debating GameStop and dogecoin, investors seem to have lost sight of a concept the industry has been fighting to uphold for years. The two landmark cases in this ongoing struggle over what constitutes market manipulation are the CFTC’s enforcement actions against DRW Investments and Kraft Mondelez. In both cases, the industry fought back against the government’s overreach and was vindicated in court.      In the DRW case, the CFTC argued the defendants’ orders for a swap contract were “inherently manipulative” because the defendants “understood and intended that their bids would affect the settlement price” of that contract. As the court summarized, the CFTC’s position was that the defendants “had intent to affect the prices, and because they had intent to affect the prices, that means [the prices] were illegitimate, which means that the prices were artificial.” The court rejected that logic as “circular,” concluding the government’s “theory, which taken to its logical conclusion would effectively bar market participants with open positions from ever making additional bids to pursue future transactions, finds no basis in law.”      See also: State of Crypto: How Will the Government React to GameStop?      In the Kraft case, the CFTC again pursued an expansive theory of manipulation, arguing it had authority to bring claims against manipulative “schemes” regardless of whether those schemes involved fraudulent conduct. At issue in Kraft were orders allegedly intended to drive up the price of wheat futures and drive down the price of cash wheat. The court rejected the government’s manipulation theory as over-broad, reasoning that “[s]uch an interpretation would be unreasonable, as the vast majority of law abiding participants in the commodities market engage in ‘schemes’ of one type or another ... a commodities-based scheme could be something as simple as ‘buy low, sell high,’ trading based on market trend lines, or any other plan for trading aimed at profit making.”      Ultimately, the court found that “an interpretation prohibiting such activity would be absurd, and declines to adopt that reading of the text.”      The key lesson from these cases applies to the GameStop saga: Trading schemes, even ones intended to affect price, should not be considered unlawful as long as they do not involve fraud. The industry has successfully resisted recent attempts by the federal government to pursue more expansive (and incoherent) theories of market manipulation. If investors and institutions continue to play into regulators’ hands, however, years of progress made through costly litigation could be lost.    GameStop deep breath    While traders debate the interaction between the financial markets and social media, they are inadvertently arguing for arbitrary government enforcement to fill the void. We’re not seeing the scrutiny and due care that would usually accompany such regulatory evolution. The industry needs to think carefully about taking a more nuanced approach to addressing the admittedly complicated issues that the GameStop episode poses.      These issues are particularly relevant to the crypto community, where the underlying value of the assets is harder to evaluate and much of the information we have about these assets comes from platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Whatever rules and laws come out of this saga are likely to have a disproportionate impact on crypto and digital currency markets.      Traders and investors on both sides of the GameStop short squeeze should step back and consider what exactly they are arguing for before they try to tear each other down, because if they continue, neither side will be left standing.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Benjamin Sauter, Steven Perlstein, William McGovern, David McGill",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/02/how-regulating-gamestops-market-manipulation-could-harm-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53cc5a406780c84e26b1c5ccc9381471c51e6dbd-1420x1093.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386088,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR3f9,1614710470,"Human Rights Foundation Grants Will Advance Bitcoin DeFi, Education and Activism","The Human Rights Foundation (HRF) dished out another round of Bitcoin development grants today.      These grants are the latest from the nonprofit in a series of gifts to developers and designers who work on Bitcoin’s open source software. Or, in this instance, software and education.      The funds are dispersed among four separate projects: one to Bitcoin developer Jesse Posner, one to Bitcoin Lightning Network wallet Muun, one to independent privacy journalist Janine and one to open-source incubator Blockchain Commons.      Per the Human Rights Foundation’s mission to foster innovation “to unite the world against tyranny,” the grants to Blockchain Commons and Janine of $10,000 in bitcoin each will fund activism onboarding and educational efforts, respectively.      On the software side, the HRF grant to Argentina-based Muun wallet will go toward improving non-custodial payments technology, and Posner’s grant funds work on bringing the next generation of so-called decentralized financial (DeFi) applications on Bitcoin. Each of these projects will receive $25,000 in bitcoin.      In particular, the HRF believes the work by Muun and Posner will be invaluable for creating better key management practices, more efficient wallet design and more robust smart contracts that will make bitcoin more usable for everyone, especially those who need it most.    Muun wallet    Drawing on the Lightning Network – a secondary protocol built on top of Bitcoin’s primary network to facilitate fast, penny-fee payments – Argentinian Muun wallet will use its funding to “make Bitcoin more accessible to everyone,” founder Dario Sneidermanis told CoinDesk.      “Being Argentinians, we’ve seen first-hand why this is sorely needed, maybe a little bit earlier than the rest of the world, so it’s important that organizations such as the HRF are paying attention to this.”    Read more: Crypto Is Booming in Economically Challenged Argentina    Muun is a non-custodial Lightning Network wallet that is enjoying growing popularity in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America that has, in some places, wellsprings of Bitcoin adoption.      To increase this adoption, the pain points in Bitcoin wallet technology, particularly regarding self-custody, needs improving “to completely remove the incentive of using custodial services just for the fear of losing one’s bitcoins,” said Sneidermanis.      As fees rise, things like Lightning need work with low-connectivity, low-ram phones and language support needs to expand beyond the English tongue as well, he said.    Education and activism    Independent journalist Janine has been at the forefront of exposing some of the crypto industry’s more damning stories. For example, she was the first to sound the horn about Coinbase's acquisition of ethically dubious software surveillance firm Neutrino.      In recent years she’s split her time between internet privacy and Bitcoin podcast Block Digest as well as launching her own cypherpunk-focused newsletter, This Month in Privacy, a monthly catalog of everything that’s happening in the realm of Bitcoin, internet privacy and other cyber happenings.      ""Whether you believe privacy is a human right or a human fight, protecting financial access and privacy should be an essential part of that mission,"" Janine told CoinDesk.      ""The last thing I want is for the harmful policies and exclusionary structures of traditional finance to be ported into Bitcoin. I started my newsletter on that basis, and I am glad that so many people are becoming interested in this topic, too.""      She told CoinDesk she may use the funding from HRF to give the blog a multi-media component, such as a conference call Q&A for readers. Per reader requests, she's toying with the idea of a web privacy guide, which would include Bitcoin resources, among other tips.      The Blockchain Commons, a not-for-profit benefit corporation that hosts Bitcoin development internships and designs open source software, will also use its funding for education and to set up HRF activists with bitcoin tools.    Read more: Blockchain Commons Internship Introduces New Developers to Open Source    The bitcoin grant will fund a new activism internship. Colleges students who receive the internship will assist citizens and activists in economically disadvantaged areas to set up Bitcoin wallets, payment software and full nodes to ease their onboarding into the Bitcoin economy.      ""Interns will have the opportunity to self select into HRF-aligned projects, and we expect a third of the workload this summer to have a direct activist focus,"" Blockchain Commons' Vinay Taylor told CoinDesk.    Discrete log contract 'stablecoins'    Once a lawyer, now a Bitcoin developer who used to do key management for Coinbase, Posner now focuses on Discrete Log Contracts (DLCs), threshold signatures and adapter signatures. All are complex, cryptographic tricks that can create the conditions for more creative financial contracts on the Bitcoin network.      With DLCs, for instance, which Posner develops with software firm Suredbits, you can create smart contracts to escrow bets. Suredbits founder and BTCPay Server creator Nicola Dorier entered in one for the U.S. presidential election, but another, more novel application comes in the form of what Suredbits calls the “stable not a coin.""      More formally known as a Contract for Difference (CFD), this DLC allows two parties to enter into a contract wherein one side pays the other if bitcoin goes up and vice versa if it goes down. The idea is to offer one party exposure to a stabilized price so that the balance of their bitcoin in escrow is always on par with a specified dollar amount.    Read more: Discrete Log Contracts Are Bringing Private, ‘Scriptless’ Smart Contracts to Bitcoin    Under these conditions, one side is technically “long” bitcoin and the other is “short.” For example, let’s say Alice and Bob both deposit 1 BTC each (at $50K BTC) into a CFD and Bob is on the “short” side, meaning he expects bitcoin to go down and thus wants a safety net. If bitcoin does go down (let’s say, 50%), then Alice would pay him the $25K difference in bitcoin to make him whole (so instead of losing $25K on a 50% drawdown, Bob still has $50K worth of bitcoin). But if bitcoin goes up, then Bob pays Alice this difference.      This financial application is just one of many possibilities for a future of decentralized financial markets on Bitcoin, Posner told CoinDesk. One benefit of DLCs, he continued, is that almost all of the data regarding the contract specifics is computed off chain. This should give these contracts privacy improvements over Ethereum smart contracts, Posner said, where trades can be sniped in the mempool and frontrun.      “Jesse’s work and research helps lay the foundation for two key areas that will be important for Bitcoin users moving forward: more powerful and private multi-signature transactions and more flexible smart contracts, which will lead to the creation of DeFi features on the Bitcoin network,” Human Rights Foundation Chief Strategy Officer Alex Gladstein told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/02/human-rights-foundation-grants-will-advance-bitcoin-defi-education-and-activism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3ac6789ad43632f25716f885aee8eb791fea716-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386077,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR3Q3,1614708307,Lessons from CoinDesk's One-Day YouTube Shutdown,"Last week, CoinDesk was served a powerful reminder that the ability to disseminate information in the Web 2.0 era remains subject to the permission of a few centralized Internet gatekeepers      This dependency is immensely harmful to society. One way or another, we must reform this system.    Michael J. Casey is CoinDesk's chief content officer.    It began with an email notification Thursday afternoon that YouTube was shutting down our account because of “severe or repeated violations” of its community guidelines. The message offered no further details and the suspension lasted a frustrating 28 hours.      By Friday evening, after CoinDesk had appealed via various channels, we were back up. In a second email, YouTube said, “After taking another look, we can confirm that it is not in violation of our Terms of Service.” We are still none the wiser on what triggered the shutdown.      Read more: YouTube Suspends CoinDesk’s Channel      We’re grateful YouTube’s appeal process worked for us and are hopeful the reinstatement means it now recognizes CoinDesk for what it is: an independent media organization committed to providing balanced, high-quality news and information that’s free from the influence of vested interests.      Still, the helplessness we felt during the suspension points to a much bigger problem, for everyone.    'Crypto' red flags    Our experience was far from unique. YouTube suspensions have hit many crypto publishing services – some commercial services, others news outlets like us. Elsewhere in the Google empire, including in its ad server business, all sorts of content carrying words like “cryptocurrency” or “crypto” are repeatedly blocked.      That this is happening now is counterproductive to the public interest. Mainstream companies including PayPal, Visa, Tesla, Square, Fidelity, Bank of New York Mellon, Guggenheim Advisors and now Citigroup, to name just a few, are engaging in various ways with cryptocurrencies. People are clamoring for reliable, trustworthy information about this sector. The last thing they need is for organizations with expertise to be muzzled.      But the crypto industry’s concerns are the tip of the iceberg. There’s a worldwide outcry against the excessive power of Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms.      Part of that backlash is about censorship. This was heard most vociferously from one group after Twitter and Facebook suspended former U.S. President Donald J. Trump’s account in January, but it affects the entire political spectrum, leaving all sorts of voices de-platformed or blocked globally.      The other issue is the internet titans’ de facto monopoly power to employ the user data they gather to dictate what we get to view and, in so doing, corral us into echo chambers of like-minded audiences to be packaged and sold to advertisers.      What’s poorly understood is that the two issues are intertwined. Until we address social media’s “surveillance capitalism” business model, we can’t properly address internet censorship.    Arbitrary power    What was most frustrating about the CoinDesk suspension was the sheer lack of information on what prompted it.      The only possible clue was that the account went dead during a live broadcast of CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” show, right when our Learn Editor, Ollie Leech, was talking matter-of-factly about different proposals for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).      Was this a coincidence or were we mistakenly flagged as an investment firm offering an unregistered security? Was the decision triggered by a YouTube algorithm or did some ill-informed employee unilaterally decide we were doing something wrong? Was it in response to a complaint from a “human flagger,” and how do we know such pecksniffs aren’t CoinDesk competitors or people whose interests are harmed by our coverage?      Asked about the lack of details on our and other cases, YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi noted the company shares its community guidelines publicly. She also said that if, on appeal, content is found to have been removed in error, the company “acts quickly to reinstate it.” According to YouTube’s quarterly enforcement report, it reinstated 83,346 out of 223,008 videos appealed last quarter.      That’s not the level of transparency we need, certainly not when there’s a 37% error rate, by YouTube's own count. We’re still left guessing about the subjective logic in each case. If the cryptocurrency industry knew what words and topics flagged a breach of guidelines in each case, it could engage in a healthy dialogue with YouTube about what’s harmful or illegal and what’s not.      Why won’t YouTube go into detail? Perhaps because Google’s business, much like Facebook’s and other platforms’, depends on protecting the proprietary models and algorithms they use to curate users’ news feeds and generate ad dollars. Their systems for deciding what gets published when and where are their secret sauce.      That leaves the rest of us, publishers and audiences alike, beholden to the threat of unpredictable judgments ostensibly made to “protect” us. If you know anything about how authoritarians deploy arbitrary power, you might find some similarities here.      I use that analogy not to accuse the platforms of playing politics per se – simplistic arguments about a right- or left-wing bias in social media censorship are red herrings – but because, at the end of the day, this is all about power. And in this case, it’s the economic power derived from control over information.    Power shift needed    Right now, there is an excessive concentration of power in the hands of a few organizations uniquely positioned as gatekeeping distributors of the information society needs. Their business interests in managing that information are not necessarily aligned with the public interest. That puts our democracy at risk.      There are various ways under consideration to attack this problem. These include antitrust actions, legislative proposals to treat the platforms as regulated utilities or to force their algorithms open, reforms to the Section 230 rules protecting platforms from lawsuits and tech solutions such as those of decentralized “Web 3.0” blockchain developers.      All face challenges. Because of the value of network effects, it’s going to be difficult to lure people away from Google, Facebook or Twitter onto less populated platforms.      Yet, doing nothing is not an option. Society needs a fairer, more open system of information.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Michael J.

Mining income for Hive's fiscal third quarter, ended Dec. 31, reached $13.7 million, a 174% increase from the same period a year earlier when it had mining income of $5 million, per its reported financial statements.  The price of bitcoin quadrupled in 2020, and ether rose fivefold.  Earnings per share: $0.05 a share for the quarter, up from $0.01 a year earlier.  Gross mining margin: Stable at 78% compared to a 77% margin from a year ago.  CFO Darcy Daubaras, on Tuesday's earnings call, said the company is slowly ramping up its bitcoin mining operations with 165 BTC mined in Q3 and a recent purchase of 10,500 ASIC mining machines. But the lion's share of operations are dedicated to mining ethereum (ETH).  ""Our bread and butter is ethereum mining,"" Daubaras said on Tuesday's earnings call.  Hive mined 21,506 ETH in Q3, a slight decrease from 23,174 mined over the same period a year ago. Daubaras attributed the drop to the increased difficulty of mining new data blocks on the Ethereum blockchain. The difficulty level has doubled over the past year.

42421779,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpvvp,1614703131,The Node: SEC Worried About Default Bitcoin ETFs,"It’s Gary’s day.  Gary Gensler, a former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is due before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee Tuesday to discuss his nomination to head to the SEC.  The testimony will be closely watched for clues as to how Gensler might regulate cryptocurrency and related technology.  We could use some guidance.  This article is excerpted from The Node (formerly known as Blockchain Bites), CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The SEC has been criticized for both failing to clamp down on dodgy crypto (during the 2017 ICO boom) and for being too cautious about green-lighting legitimate activity.  One example: how it has batted back numerous applications for bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are widely seen as key to getting investors into the space.  Will Gensler be more open to innovation? A CoinDesk op-ed from 2019 suggested so. And, from Gensler’s background, it seems likely.  Former SEC Branch Chief Lisa Bragança noted on CoinDesk TV today that, unlike the former chairman, Jay Clayton, Gensler is not a lawyer. He can see the bigger picture beyond technical details.  “I think we are well on the way to having [a BTC ETF] in the U.S. A lot of the concerns the SEC has raised in the past are again coming from the perspective of ... very cautious lawyers,” she said.  That doesn’t mean Gensler, if confirmed, will be a soft touch. Bragança said in the same conversation the SEC is worried about the recent spate of companies buying big into bitcoin.  The likes of MicroStrategy, which has bought almost 91,000 BTC with a current cumulative value of $4.3 billion, may be creating default ETFs before ETFs are approved. There is “huge concern that companies are turning themselves into crypto bitcoin ETFs,” she said.  With the crypto industry going full tilt, Gensler is going to have his hands full. As explained by Nik De, CoinDesk’s regulatory expert, he also faces the ongoing XRP controversy, a booming (and lightly regulated) stablecoin market, and questions about whether the U.S. should launch its own central bank digital currency.  How he comes down on these topics, starting today, will have ramifications for years.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/02/the-node-sec-worried-about-default-bitcoin-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c15cce9fb4729eb21d239369b08ba4da8a0e2449-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421782,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpvtl,1614695400,State of Crypto: How SEC Chair Gary Gensler Could Differ From Predecessor Jay Clayton,"Gary Gensler ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) after the 2008 financial crisis. Now, he’ll get a chance to run its securities-regulating counterpart.  You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Meet Gary  The narrative  Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Gary Gensler has been nominated to run the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by President Joe Biden. Gensler unites a pro-regulation history with a pro-crypto viewpoint, and could finally implement the regulatory clarity many in the industry have desired. In this, he's likely to depart from predecessor Jay Clayton, who repeatedly said he believed initial coin offerings are securities but did not provide much guidance on when or how tokens might be classified as something other than a security.  Today, the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs will hold a hearing to consider his nomination for chairman of the SEC.  Why it matters  Should he be confirmed, Gensler will shape crypto policy over the next several years, though it’s an open question if the industry will love the rules he implements. Under his tenure, the CFTC approved nearly 70 rules or pieces of guidance, and he may just regulate the hell out of crypto. He told the Senate Banking Committee he intends to continue focusing on consumer protection at the SEC.  “We have seen that when the SEC does its job – when there are clear rules of the road and a cop on the beat to enforce them – our economy grows and our nation prospers.,” Gensler said in his prepared remarks.  Companies are already hinting at or have announced plans to file to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), a retail-accessible product that the industry has been pursuing for years. Some in the industry hope that under Gensler the SEC might finally create “bright-lines” regulatory guidance that clearly defines when a token is a security and when one is not.  He’ll also oversee litigation against companies that SEC staff believe have violated federal securities laws, including the high-profile lawsuit against Ripple Labs.  Breaking it down  Like many of Biden’s nominees, Gensler was an official in former President Barack Obama’s administration. As CFTC chair, he had a major role in the Dodd-Frank Act, which sought to bring some consumer-focused reforms to Wall Street. Gensler has been a part of Team Biden since the president won the White House last year; Biden announced Gensler would lead his Wall Street reform team just days after news organizations projected his victory.  Many of his views on the digital asset space can be found in the transcripts of his lectures at MIT, some of which my colleague Danny Nelson went through. Gensler gave these lectures in 2018, though he has remained active in the industry as a member of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.  He’s also spoken out about blockchain over the past several years. Below is a summary of his views on some issues that are important to the crypto industry.  XRP  A day before former SEC Chair Jay Clayton stepped down, the securities regulator filed a lawsuit alleging Ripple Labs, the San Francisco startup closely associated with the XRP cryptocurrency, had violated securities laws for over seven years by selling XRP in unregistered securities transactions. Other senior SEC staff, including now-former Director of Enforcement Stephanie Avakian, also departed around that time. If approved, Gensler will inherit an agency overseeing one of its highest-profile crypto cases.  In his own words, Gensler believes XRP is “a non-compliant security,” though he said (again, this is from 2018) that it would require the courts to make that determination, “whether it's appellate courts or the Supreme Court.”  He went on to explain that he believes XRP meets the requirements of the Howey Test, the Supreme Court case often used to determine whether something is a security.  ICOs  The SEC has spent years suing companies that conducted initial coin offerings (ICOs) without registering their tokens as securities, often because they raised money specifically to build a project that could issue a token that investors could re-sell at a profit.  Gensler raised concerns about information asymmetry in one of his lectures, noting that U.S. law is designed to protect investors and consumers. He’s also expressed concern that ICOs, which were numerous in 2018, might violate securities laws, particularly given the projects that launched without having any code or tokens developed.  “Jay Clayton, who runs the SEC, has said in congressional testimony in February that he hadn't met an ICO that he didn't think was a security ... But it wasn't quite enough,” Gensler said.  He said early tokens may fail, but as some projects go live they could provide a roadmap for how future projects could succeed, pointing to Telegram (which ended its blockchain ambitions after the SEC sued) and Filecoin (which went live last year).  CBDCs  Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are becoming increasingly popular, with multiple central banks now trialing different types of sovereign digital currencies. In Gensler’s view, CBDCs could bring efficiencies to cross-border remittances or local payments.  Central banks have to understand why they would launch a CBDC and what the benefit would be, he said, explaining:  “The strategic question for the central banks is, should we allow direct access to digital reserves? We have this intermediated central bank digital reserve called bank deposits, but should we have something direct to us? Like cash is a direct relationship between the central bank and the holder.”  Still, in that same lecture Gensler noted that a CBDC doesn’t necessarily need to rely on a blockchain platform, a view echoed by Boston Fed and MIT Digital Currency Initiative researchers looking into different technology bases that could support a digital dollar.  Digital yuan  In 2019 Gensler participated in a wargaming exercise that looked at a hypothetical future where the digital yuan, China’s effort at a central bank digital currency, was live and used by the government of North Korea to bypass U.S. sanctions. The premise of the exercise was the U.S. may need to revisit how it enforces its sanctions regime, which basically seeks to lock individuals or entities out of the global financial system.  “I think it’s good to have a healthy debate about where we stand with the U.S. dollar, our reliance on SWIFT – the international messaging system – for a tool in our sanctions regime that we the U.S. have,” Gensler told CoinDesk ahead of the exercise. “We’re using it as a tool in geopolitics, a digital form of blockade that in the 17th and 18th and even in the 19th century, what one would have to do with ships we’re doing digitally.”  Gensler further noted during his MIT lectures that other countries could use CBDCs as part of an effort to bypass U.S. sanctions, citing Venezuela and Iran, both of which had announced efforts to create sovereign digital currencies at the time.  Does crypto fund terrorism?  Last week, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee’s Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy held its long-awaited hearing on domestic terror financing. You can read my preview and summary but my immediate impression was that it seems good crypto wasn’t being scapegoated as this tool for terror financing, despite multiple statements of concern by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other lawmakers.  The hearing almost went in that direction at the beginning, when Rep. James Himes (D-Conn.), the subcommittee’s chair, asked the witnesses to speak to whether cryptocurrencies were enabling easier terror financing.  Instead, the witnesses compared cryptocurrencies to systems like PayPal or GoFundMe, and called for better moderation efforts by the companies behind these tools.  That said, the proposed FinCEN counterparty rule was raised multiple times, and so it is worth keeping an eye on any next steps here.  Robinhood, GameStop and Whether Blockchain Fixes This™  I wasn’t planning on talking about the Robinhood-GameStop thing again but the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) published a proposal to shorten settlement times from T+2 to T+1, on the same day GameStop’s stock jumped like 100%. So let’s take a quick look.  First off: If the bit about T+2 to T+1 didn’t make sense, read this article first, then come back to the newsletter.  Okay, so moving to T+1 requires industry agreement, meaning participants have to get together and say, “We think one-day settlement makes financial and operational sense and that we are all capable of handling it.” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has come out in favor of shortened settlement times, blaming T+2-related margin requirements for why his company had to suspend trading in volatile securities last month. The DTCC said in a blog post after that incident that it didn’t have the authority to unilaterally make that decision, but now “based on extensive industry engagement conducted throughout 2020,” it seems the industry could be open to faster settlement.  The DTCC has looked into whether blockchain in particular can offer a T+0/1 settlement solution through its Project Ion last year. In short, a distributed ledger-based settlement system can effectively shorten settlement times, though the Project Ion proof-of-concept paper noted that its PoC focused on usability over scalability.  “It’s important to note that NSCC and DTC can support T+1 and even same-day (T+0) settlement today, using existing technology. In fact, NSCC clears T+1 and T+0 trades every day and DTC is already a T+0 settlement platform. However, the current T+2 settlement cycle is a convention of market practice,” last week’s white paper said.  Biden’s rule  Gary Gensler’s confirmation hearing is today, as is that of CFPB Director-Nominee Rohit Chopra. I’ll be live-tweeting the hearing (shameless plug here). As of press time, there’s still no formal nomination for the next heads of the CFTC or OCC.

US Central Bank Explains ‘Preconditions’ for a Digital Dollar: Three Federal Reserve officials published a paper detailing some of the considerations that will go into a digital dollar.

FATF Says It Is Open to Amending Crypto Travel Rule Guidance: The Financial Action Task Force closed its plenary session meeting last week by announcing that a) it’s confident the industry will be able to implement the data-sharing requirements inherent in its “travel rule” by June but b) it’s open to consulting on the public on how it can amend this rule. It’ll be worth keeping an eye on this one (refresher on the travel rule here).

""On Monday, some block traders took bull call spreads at $75,000 and $100,000 strike call options expiring on May 28 via over-the-counter (OTC) trading and settlement desk Paradigm,"" Swiss-based options analytics platform Laevitas told CoinDesk. ""These could be institutions betting that bitcoin will hit at least $75,000 by summer.""      A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A bull call spread involves buying call options at/below or above the spot market price and selling an equal number of calls with the same expiry at a higher strike price.      For instance, at 20:23 UTC (5:23 p.m. ET) on Monday, a trading entity bought 100 contracts of the May 28 expiry call option at $75,000 strike and sold 100 contracts of the May 28 expiry call option at $100,000 strike. Bitcoin was trading at $48,721 when the call spread was bought.      Institutions tend to trade through OTC desks to avoid influencing spot market prices. Trades facilitated by Paradigm are automatically executed, margined and cleared at Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by trading volume.      The trade cost 4.75 BTC, which is the maximum loss the institution would suffer if bitcoin ends at or below $75,000 on May 28.      The initial cost would have been much higher if the trader had only bought $75,000 calls. ""The purpose of the call spread is to have a bullish direction but offset the costs of merely buying calls,"" Laevitas said.      While selling $100,000 calls has bought down the cost, it also limits maximum return possible to 20.25 BTC. The strategy will earn a maximum profit if bitcoin settles at or above $100,000 on May 28. Several other call spreads were bought on Monday at strikes ranging from $52,000 to $100,000.      The data shows institutions remain undeterred by the recent price pullback and foresee a continued rally over the next three months.    View    At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $48,730, representing a 1.8% gain over 24 hours. The cryptocurrency was rejected above $50,000 during Asian hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      While the cryptocurrency has bounced up from lows near $43,000 observed over the weekend, some analysts believe the pullback may not be over yet.      Also read: Bitcoin Briefly Climbs Back Above $50K for First Time in Six Days      ""At the moment, we think the biggest risk to bitcoin is the short-term risk associated with a downturn in the U.S. and global equities,"" said Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital. ""We think there's still room for more weakness ahead and would caution against expectations that the bottom is in.""      Futures tied to the S&P 500 are currently down 0.23% on the day.

FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted Tuesday that users can get ""instant"" payments to their accounts if they use the PayPal option.  Most currencies are supported by the payments giant, and credit card payments can also be made through PayPal, Bankman-Fried said.  He cautioned that, due to PayPal's fees, larger payments would be cheaper for users if sent to accounts with bank wires.  FTX is noted for offering innovative derivatives products. It previously launched the S**tcoin Futures Index as a way to short alternative cryptocurrencies; ""TRUMP"" and ""BIDEN"" futures ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election; and a derivatives contract based on the Airbnb initial public offering.

According to a report from the Bangkok Post on Monday, the secretary-general of the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol, now says the criteria proposed in the draft, announced last month, were an attempt to gauge public opinion and can still be changed based on the opinions of stakeholders.      The draft plan had suggested new crypto investors should have a 1 million baht ($33,000) minimum annual income, a minimum age limit and proven trading experience. However, the proposal was heavily criticized for effectively barring investors with low or middle incomes and those wanting to get involved in trading, per the report.      The average salary in Thailand is around 175,450 baht, or $5,800, according to Trading Economics.      ""I proposed the criteria that many considered too tough to prompt people to express their opinions on the matter and did not intend to say these are the exact qualifications that will be implemented,"" said Suwanmongkol. People had misunderstood that the annual income limit is not the minimum fund required, she said.      See also: Thailand Wants to Target Japanese Crypto Holders as Part of Plan to Revive Tourism      The SEC is also bringing forward a public hearing to Tuesday – three weeks ahead of schedule – to discuss the proposal.      The plan came as an attempt to safeguard possibly ill-informed new investors against the risks of trading in notoriously volatile cryptocurrencies.

Still, he said the time had come to attain more licenses – and also make a push into Switzerland and Singapore.      “We want more regulatory licenses in the U.K., EU and Switzerland,” Landsberg-Sadie told CoinDesk in an interview. “These are expensive, not just from a working capital point of view in terms of funding staff. But there's also a regulatory capital aspect. Where our licenses become more bank-like, we have to hold more capital on the balance sheet in reserve.”      Landsberg-Sadie said one of the interesting (and expensive) licenses BCB is pursuing is the Swiss Fintech license, which comes with a connection to the Swiss National Bank.
