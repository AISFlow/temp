Announced today, the move is the latest step forward in a project that began for the e-commerce giant in late 2014 with the launch of a blockchain R&D division dubbed Medici. That plan, which would find Overstock being granted approval to issue digital versions of its public shares on a blockchain, received key approval from the SEC in 2015.  In statements, Keystone Capital’s Steven Capozza said his San Diego-based firm is ""excited"" to provide brokerage and trading account services to traders seeking to use the tØ platform.  Capozza said:  ""Everyone speaks about using blockchain technology, but very few are actually making it happen.""  Data from US News & World Report indicates Keystone has $12.5m in assets under management and 143 clients.  The news follows similar announcements from last year, including Overstock's investment in Pro Securities, a New Jersey-based brokerage, as well as its acquisition of financial technology provider SpeedRoute.  However, more work appears to be needed before trading commences, as evidenced by today’s release, which indicates that Overstock will need to file a prospectus supplement with the SEC related to the offering.  Representatives from tØ were not immediately available for comment.

42399322,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbisvK,1473874635,"On High Seas of Bitcoin Trading, Whales Still Make Waves","Single traders appear to still have an outsized influence on the bitcoin market.  Thus far in September, analysts have cited single traders as the likely cause of two significant price movements, both of which point to liquidity problems in the nascent market. In a time when bitcoin markets are characterized by low trading volume and speculation, bitcoin prices have become vulnerable to the point where either a single buyer or one, large transaction can trigger sizeable shifts.  For example, on Sunday, 11th September, bitcoin prices plunged more than 5% in less than an hour, according to BPI data.  During just a half-hour session, the digital currency fell from $628.14 at 19:00 UTC to $595.43 by 19:30 UTC.  Here, analysts cited low trading volume and a highly speculative market when explaining this sharp drop, asserting that a single large transaction was likely to have helped fuel this decline.  Petar Zivkovkski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform WhaleClub, for instance, believes the sell-off was likely the result of one player.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The current market environment is illiquid, making price susceptible to larger players with larger firepower. In this case, a few hundred BTC sold triggered a sell-off amplified by the use of high leverage by individual players.""  His assertion that traders harnessed substantial leverage is backed up by Whaleclub data, which reveals that 76% of positions were long on 11th September and confidence, the percentage by which a particular day’s position sizes were larger than average, reached 75%.  Complicating matters is that when there are many speculative bets on an asset like bitcoin, these wagers can turn a modest price movement into a larger fluctuation, triggering either a short squeeze or a long squeeze.  Rise above $600  A good example of how low liquidity and substantial speculation can fuel notable price movements is bitcoin’s climb above $600 on 4th September.  After opening 2nd September at $571.68, the digital currency rose more than 7% over the course of three sessions to reach $612.39 on 4th September, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal.  The digital currency enjoyed this climb as low trading volume made the market susceptible to large transactions.  Once the market experienced this vulnerability, all it took was one purchase of less than 600 BTC to move bitcoin prices higher, said Zivkovski.  The resulting upward climb combined with the highly leveraged market to trigger a short squeeze, he added. Many speculative wagers were in place since market participants had been placing them during weeks of range-bound trading. Between 2nd and 4th September, 86% of speculative position size was long, Whaleclub figures reveal. Confidence had a mean value of 85% between 2nd and 4th September.  BTC VIX, an admin at a popular bitcoin trading club, provided further detail on how low price volatility can make the markets more vulnerable to single traders.  ""When we consolidate for long periods in a tight price range, it is quite easy for larger players to calculate where liquidations will occur,"" he told CoinDesk. ""When they get to those price levels the liquidations come in batches.""  When liquidation orders hit the books, he said, larger players can close their positions. ""Then it is just rinse and repeat.”  Cryptocurrency investment fund manager Jacob Eliosoff also professed his belief that a single buyer helped cause the notable price movement, as did investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham.  Lingham told CoinDesk he believes that a single buyer likely made use of low liquidity and a highly leveraged market to fuel a notable price increase.  Steady progress  As for whether this is a cause for concern about the market is uncertain.  Over the last several years, bitcoin has reached several milestones, as it enjoyed rising adoption as a payment method, regulators began assessing its merits and bitcoin's price has followed a steady, upward trend.  However, the digital currency has run into some challenges lately as low liquidity and substantial speculation have created a perfect environment for sharp price gyrations.  While bitcoin's volatility provides opportunities for traders, it can make the digital currency less credible in the eyes of market participants.  If bitcoin’s user base keeps expanding, this development might help bolster trading volume and make the currency’s price less dependent on speculation. Together, these improvements would make bitcoin prices less susceptible to the impact of major transactions.  For now, however, buyers should continue to remain cautious.

42399321,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbisuL,1473860004,ItBit Rebrands as Paxos Amid Blockchain Pivot,"Blockchain startup itBit has taken steps to reorganize its corporate assets.  Announced  yesterday, itBit officially rebranded as Paxos, migrating its blockchain projects to a new entity under which itBit will now sit as a separate division. The move confirms past indications that its leadership was seeking to rebrand to better highlight its private blockchain and distributed ledger work.  According to the company, ""Paxos"" will now house itBit's distributed ledger efforts, thereby separating this division from its bitcoin exchange and over-the-counter trading services.  The rebrand comes more than a year after the firm launched its New York-based exchange and announced a $25m Series A round, but according to representatives for the firm, the change won't have any immediate impact on how itBit operates.  Spokesperson Silvia Davi told CoinDesk:  ""ItBit continues to operate as usual. It's now focused solely on delivering their bitcoin trading services for institutions and trading professionals.""  The rebranding follows an outflow of employees from the startup, and may be connected to rumored plans to sell or shutter the exchange entirely.  Regardless of the future of the bitcoin exchange, the move suggests that the company is continuing to invest time and resources in its enterprise blockchain work.  In statements, the startup suggested that the rebrand reflects the direction the company intends to take in the months ahead. It's a strategy that has resulted in at least one confirmed project, as Paxos is already working on a gold settlement platform for Euroclear.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in itBit.

42399304,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiseb,1473855618,Preparing for a Bitcoin Hard Fork,"While a bitcoin hard fork isn't imminent, its developers have begun to research how the complex technical change could be enacted, if needed.  The proactive steps illustrate the new responsibility Bitcoin Core, the network's mostly volunteer developer group, has taken on as the protocol has grown from the pet project of its mystery creator to a broad network of consumers, businesses and stakeholders.  As bitcoin remains the most widely used blockchain platform (one that many people see as having the greatest potential to change the way society transacts), this responsibility, the bitcoin developers argue, should be treated with caution and respect.  In this light, there has been a renewed emphasis within Bitcoin Core to explore how it could implement a hard fork, a type of protocol change that has proved a lightning rod for controversy during bitcoin's ongoing scaling debate and resulted in schisms in other blockchain networks.  Long-time Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo told CoinDesk:  ""No one has pulled off a hard fork on a working system swimmingly with a clean system coming out on the other side. A number of people working on Bitcoin Core think we should have an idea of how [a hard fork] should look.”  Preparedness is important either way, Corallo said, but the unsuccessful ethereum fork pointed out further issues with hard forks that need more analysis.  Earlier this summer, ethereum enacted a change to its code after one of its more notable projects was compromised. The result was that the developers proposed a permanent divergence in its blockchain, scraping one bitcoin blockchain for an upgraded one.  A hard fork meant that every node – miners, merchants and users – had to upgrade to be able to validate the new blocks, but due to the controversial reason for the fork, a sizable minority chose not to make the switch.  The result is two development groups – ethereum and ethereum classic – both of which claim ownership over the vision for the ""ethereum"" project.  Given the risk that bitcoin could face from a similar split, there remains deep reservations among its developer community about whether a bitcoin hard fork should be discussed at all.  Scaling bitcoin  The tension on the subject has led to a larger debate on how best to change the bitcoin protocol, but ""hard forks"" aren't the only solution being discussed.  ""Soft forks"", for one, are backwards-compatible and self-correcting in that only a majority of miners need to update to the new consensus rules. Old nodes will then see the new blocks as valid.  In this case, not every user or node will need to update to accept the new consensus rules and continue validating transactions. (Note: There remains deep divisions about what constitutes a ""hard"" vs ""soft"" fork, with core developers even disagreeing on how to define past network issues in such terms).  Most of the conversation around hard forks so far has centered on Segregated Witness, a method originally proposed to fix transaction malleability that soon evolved into a way to scale bitcoin with a soft fork. The scaling mechanism will allow blocks with 2MB of data to be validated, up from the current 1MB limit, when implemented.  Yet, since the time it was proposed in December, the scaling debate has tapered off as other improvements have brought optimizations.  ""Six months ago the network was in rough shape. The propagation across the network was really slow,"" Corallo said. ""We've been optimizing a bunch of little places all over the place and that starts to make a big difference for people.""  Because the Core developers have succeeded in optimizing the network through efforts like Corallo's Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Network (FIBRE) and mempool size limiting, the network, in Corallo's view, is more able to handle small increases in the blocksize, which can come in the form of the Segwit upgrade without a hard fork.  That said, there remains a vocal contingent that remains committed to ""on-chain scaling"" that believes the bitcoin network, its user base and its businesses will not be able to sufficiently grow without more aggressive changes to the protocol that go beyond tweaks and upgrades to its exterior components.  Squabbles and gaming votes  One of the biggest concerns for the Bitcoin Core team, however, is that it remains difficult to tell when the community, and how much of that community, desires a given upgrade.  This has led to the rise of the term ""consensus"", or the belief that participants in an economic network are giving approval or in some way agreeing to a set of unspoken terms and conditions.  Some of the most public ways to measure this sentiment aren't that helpful because they don't incorporate all bitcoin users or they can be manipulated rather easily. Node voting, for example, was used to measure sentiment on ethereum in the run-up to its hard fork, but the practice was widely criticized for its results.  Because the majority of people that use bitcoin don’t run full nodes, using node votes typically leaves out a significant number of users, including those that may be utilize the network on a regular basis. Further manipulation can happen through the spinning up of ineffective nodes.  Miscommunication, in Corallo’s eyes, is one of the reasons the ethereum community is now running on two chains. While the majority of people that voiced an opinion were in support of an ethereum hard fork after The DAO hack, only a small percentage, less than 10%, of community members voted at all.  In Corallo's opinion, all mechanisms for measuring community consensus should be deployed. These include node voting; coin voting; measuring support and opposition on community discussion boards; and polls of industry players.  ""We don’t want to leave people behind,"" Corallo said.  Peter Todd, a Bitcoin Core contributor who recently penned a blog post about hard fork proposals, thinks that this approach still leaves many out, notably those who lack a full understanding of the proposals.  In interview, he said language and privacy barriers can further complicate the situation, potentially excluding those who can't read a particular proposal or don't want to broadcast their identity.  Selling the hard fork  Core's main focus, then, must be on writing up the technical specifications in ways community members can understand, said Corallo. If bitcoin businesses, for instance, push back on a hard fork because they don’t understand the proposal and its effects, that's core's responsibility, a communication error, he said.  While Corallo thinks the community has calmed a bit since the hostility over hard forking bitcoin started last year, Todd thinks the ethereum debacle has stoked hesitation again.  ""The main thing is a lot of people quite understandably are dubious about [hard forks],"" Todd said. ""It's harder now to convince people [hard forks] are a good idea than it was six months ago.""  This contention around hard forking is one reason why research and development around the concept has largely stalled, Core contributors say.  ""People troll you to death,"" Todd said. ""And I think that has stopped people from working on Core development publicly and sometimes altogether.""  Quite a few, though, are working on hardfork proposals quietly, he said.  Core developer, Cory Fields declined to comment on hard fork issues, and several other core developers never responded to inquiries for CoinDesk. This speaks not only to the community’s sensitivity to the idea, but also that Core is merely a group of individuals who don't always see eye-to-eye on elements affecting their work.  ""People aren’t used to these things being driven by money, like bitcoin. I think it creates a different intensity,"" Todd said.  In the next five years, though, Todd said, there's a pretty high chance the rules of the network will need to be changed. Specifically to enhance security of the network, such as improvements that would prevent attacks against mining pools, Todd doesn’t have a problem with hard forking in the future.  ""You need a pretty good reason to do a hard fork; we just don't have good reasons right now,"" Todd said.

42399320,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbisqP,1473852870,Can Blockchain Help America’s Veterans? One Lawmaker Thinks So,"A member of the US House of Representatives has proposed that the country's administration for veterans affairs use blockchain to track medical appointments.  House Resolution 859  , submitted on Monday, is directly aimed at providing a means for dismissing employees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which oversees the distribution of government services to former members of the armed forces.  The bill is tied to a long-simmering controversy surrounding the VA Department and delays in medical treatment for veterans. In 2014, for example, the Obama administration was fiercely criticized after it emerged that some VA staff had manipulated scheduling records to mask the delays.  Now, one member of Congress is looking to distributed ledger tech as a possible solution.  A number of changes have been proposed beyond the language related to the firing of employees, including a proposed amendment, submitted by Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, that states:  ""Beginning not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall ensure that veterans seeking health care appointments at medical facilities of the Department are able to use an Internet website, a mobile application, or other similar electronic method to use distributed ledger technology to view such appointments and ascertain whether an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs has modified such appointments.""  Schweikert has emerged as a notable proponent for the technology within Congress, appearing earlier this year during a blockchain event in DC organized by the Chamber of Digital Commerce, remarking at the time that ""this is going to create a revolution"".  Schweikert further proposes that the Veterans Affairs Department hire one or more ""appropriate entities"" to undertake developing the system. The amendment also contains language related to data privacy.  It’s not immediately clear when the amendment will be taken up for consideration, given that the proposal comes weeks before national elections in the US. It's also not clear how the system would be constructed, or why a blockchain would solve the cited issues.  However, the timing is notable, given that the House recently approved a non-binding resolution that calls for the government to adopt a more accommodating stance on blockchain and financial technologies.

Statements on the BTCXchange website informed users of a possible sale of the service on 18th August, and on 4th September, users were asked to withdraw funds ahead of an expected 12th September shut down.  According to Romanian news source Bihon, it remains unclear whether the exchange, the first of its kind in Romania, is still for sale.
