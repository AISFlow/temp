42432073,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9NFh,1591831221,"WATCH: US Lawmakers Talk Digital Dollar, FedAccounts in Thursday Hearing","For the first time since the U.S. went on lockdown three months ago, lawmakers will convene Thursday to discuss digital currencies and other novel technologies.      The House Financial Services Committee (FSC) Task Force on Financial Technology will be evaluating how FedAccounts and other digital tools might help the federal government distribute stimulus payments to help Americans suffering the economic fallout of COVID-19. The virtual hearing kicks off at noon Eastern (16:00 UTC).      The concept of using FedAccounts to manage digital currencies has gained traction during the pandemic: bills introduced to the committee have suggested using bank accounts managed by the Federal Reserve to issue stimulus payments. The U.S. government has issued one round of payments by check, but only individuals who have filed taxes within the last two years received them. The idea behind FedAccounts is that any U.S. resident could receive these funds in a snap, rather than wait for a piece of paper mailed across several weeks by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).      “What we discovered is that large segments of the population were not included in the financial system in that they didn't have either bank account information with the IRS or were otherwise reachable,” said J. Christopher Giancarlo, one of the witnesses for Thursday’s hearing, in a phone interview. “The government had to resort to good old trusty paper checks with the delay in time and the imprecision and the challenges that presented to populations that didn't have bank accounts.”      Giancarlo will advocate for a slightly different version of this vision, and plans to call for a token-based system rather than an account-based one.      “We think that this both addresses the concern that this particular hearing is there to address but goes way further by also future-proofing the dollar for the coming digital 21st century when things of value will be increasingly tokenized, decentralized and programmable, and we think that the United States needs to recognize the direction that the world is going,” he said.      Read More: Digital Dollar Project Calls for 2-Tiered Distribution System in First White Paper for US CBDC      The witnesses will include Giancarlo in his capacity as former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair and now Digital Dollar Project director; University of California Irvine School of Law Professor Mehrsa Baradaran; Vanderbilt University School of Law Professor Morgan Ricks (who co-created the concept of a FedAccount); and Electronics Transaction Association Jodie Kelley.      The hearing will be chaired by Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), who heads the task force and has previously commented on the potential role distributed ledgers and cryptocurrencies could play in the U.S.      Earlier this year, Lynch proposed recording the Strategic National Stockpile on a blockchain database, to ensure the government has a more accurate picture of the medical supplies it has available.      “We are looking at ways that we can adopt this new technology and address some of the challenges that we have in government,” he told CoinDesk in April about using blockchain and distributed ledger technology. “That attitude and that desire has been out there and so we have been looking for ways to utilize that technology to help government function better.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/10/watch-us-lawmakers-talk-digital-dollar-fedaccounts-in-thursday-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d63e59e157c6838bff4d7cc4f905d66aaa169ee5-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,894 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining 1.6% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Wednesday (8:00 p.m. Monday ET), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,783 on exchanges like Coinbase. Its price dipped to as low as $9,709 at 09:00 UTC (5 a.m. ET) before buying volume picked up, pushing the price above its 50-day and 10-day moving averages, a bullish technical indicator.      Read More: Another Data Point Suggests Bitcoin Close to Prolonged Bull Market      A      Speaking after the Federal Open Market Committee’s two-day June meeting, Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank will likely keep interest rates near 0% until 2022. That sent bitcoin briefly to $10,000 before it dropped back.      “There is great uncertainty about the future,” Powell said. “At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to use our tools to do whatever we can for as long as it takes to provide some relief and stability to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible.”      Cryptocurrency stakeholders see the Fed's announcement of no changes as reason to buy bitcoin. “Liquidity can’t paper over insolvency,” said Scott Bambacigno, a vice prescient at crypto exchange software provider AlphaPoint, “When you are deep in debt, more debt isn’t going to help. The Fed can ‘print money’ but they cannot ‘print jobs’. Assets like gold and bitcoin should do well if the economy continues in this direction.”      While the price did briefly pop, bitcoin’s brief run to $10,000 quickly lost steam. ”A lot of analysts may be looking for the Fed decision to move BTC, but It's important to bear in mind that over a long time horizon bitcoin remains uncorrelated to traditional markets,” said Aaron Suduiko, a research analyst for crypto liquidity provider SFOX.      Indeed, the upward trajectories of bitcoin seem totally unhinged from stock indexes like the S&P 500.      Read More: Bitcoin Bulls Might Get Negative Rates From Central Banks, Just Not the Fed      As a result of the Fed news, or perhaps the lack of much new information, the S&P 500 index was flat, slipping less than a percent. U.S. Treasury bonds all slipped. Yields, which move in the opposite direction as price, were down most on the two-year bond, in the red 14%.      Stocks in the U.S. are basically back to where they started the year. Meanwhile, many in the cryptocurrency world are pondering if investors will pour more money into blockchain-based digital assets. “Eventually the $3 trillion freshly printed dollars are going to find their way into places other than stocks and urban real estate,” said George Clayton, managing partner of New York-based fund Cryptanalysis Capital. “I'm wondering what the Fed will do when inflation starts accelerating.”    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mixed, though mostly higher Wednesday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), is trading around $247 and climbed 1.9% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). Ether’s 2020 price performance is trouncing bitcoin, led by the surge in interest of decentralized finance applications like stablecoins.

In commodities, oil is in the green, up 1.4% as a barrel of crude was priced at $38 at press time.      The rest of the global equities market was flat on the day, a less-than-exciting week after huge run-ups the past week erased most of the losses incurred during the coronavirus-induced crash. “The market is going sideways.

It’s that last point that gained him any media notoriety in what otherwise would have been a tame contest for a local seat of power in upstate New York.      “Bitcoin is well in line with the principles of federalism and checks and balances that underlie the American system of government. The blockchain and bitcoin are poised to do for the transfer of value what the internet did for the transfer of information,” he said in a 2016 Reddit AMA.      While he’s not – yet – accepting bitcoin for campaign contributions as part of his election run, as a Democrat, to the New York Senate in the 43rd District (which extends from Kingston past Albany) against incumbent Sen. Daphne Jordan, a Republican, crypto is still a core political and personal interest.

I’m kidding of course but it feels like that sometimes,” Nelson said.

CoinDesk spoke with Nelson, who currently serves as Trustee in the Village of Stillwater and a New York State Democratic Committeehttps://www.nelsonforny.com/bio member, about his attempts to convince state party leadership to use blockchain infrastructure for internal voting as well as the inconveniences of accepting crypto for political donations.    The following conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.      You’ve been pretty vocal about crypto as a political candidate. How do you think the industry has changed since your first run for office in 2015?      Well, I accepted bitcoin in my previous two campaigns – until BitPay stopped supporting that service – as a way to demonstrate that I was running a forward-thinking campaign and embracing new technologies. I was an investor, still am. I like the idea of a decentralized payment system for people to control their own money without necessarily having to use banks as intermediaries if people don’t want to. That’s my connection to the space.      I haven’t been too involved in it in recent years, but I have seen some interesting applications for blockchain technology in voting. For a second there, I actually thought there could be an application at the state level and the Board of Elections had, for a time, cancelled the Democratic primary in the state. One of the solutions I was bringing to leadership was an encrypted, remote voting system that could ensure ""one person, one vote"" using a blockchain system.      There was a lawsuit that put the Democratic primary in the State of New York back on the ballot for June 23, but there was a time when we still had to elect delegates for the party without a primary. I was looking to see if there was an appetite for using those systems to involve voters in the process.      Where did those conversations lead?      It probably wouldn’t have been the solution we would have used. We just voted by electronic device in the N.Y. Democratic party election – with the keypad thing that a lot of other organizations have used – and it took awhile for people to get comfortable with that.      There was an opportunity for something like blockchain, and I was intent on pursuing it even if it was an unlikely solution. But before that conversation could proceed, the court stepped in and set the primary back on the calendar. To be fair, I’m glad we’re voting the traditional way and won’t have to throw together some ad hoc system. But if we did have to throw something together, having a blockchain voting solution would have enabled a mass election that could have involved the voters, rather than having just the state committee members, to elect the delegates.      It probably would have fallen on deaf ears, but it would have started a conversation that could be useful down the line. The Democratic party apparatus is in a constant state of reform. I could see a blockchain voting system for the election of DNC (Democratic National Committee) members. These are quasi public/private offices that have large influence within the party organization, not the government, but still play a representative role in representing the State of New York in rulemaking, platform development for the national party. Blockchain could provide more transparency to that process.    One of the solutions I was bringing to leadership was an encrypted, remote voting system that could ensure ‘one person, one vote’ using a blockchain system.    Looking at the Iowa caucus debacle, which could be attributed to the use of new technologies, how would you address the security and training concerns of blockchain voting? It’s an application that even people in the blockchain industry are skeptical about.      I’d love to hear some of the skepticism. That’s not something I’ve heard.      Okay, well, perhaps the largest startup working on a voting solution – Voatz – was reviewed by the Department of Homeland Security and MIT and found to have major security flaws.      Well, that would be concerning. The thing that I’m interested in is being able to use a public/private key issued to every voter to track if a person voted and only voted once, like solving the double-spend problem, and also encrypting the vote itself to ensure that a ballot is recorded without being assigned to an individual. I want to create a digital private ballot, but if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.      Instead of going through a startup, would you support the state itself developing this sort of technology?      Longer term, for public elections I’m still a fan of paper ballots, headcount backups, and machines that cannot be hacked. I think digitization of governmental elections has been an area of extreme concern among voters. There’s an opportunity for use of this technology for non-governmental elections, as a means of doing something like an election on a lower budget, working within a party structure.      Even the solution I mentioned before to elect delegates: It’s not something that would necessarily have been determinative by the vote, but it would have been good to have some sort of secure metric measuring the will of the state’s Democrats in that deciding process.      Bitcoin played a more prominent role in your previous campaigns for Town Board and even Congress. Is this something that you’re underplaying?      Let’s put it this way, when you’re running for Town Board, it was basically the only interesting thing to differentiate the candidates. During the congressional campaign, yes, we accepted it and talked about it. Actually, it was a flash point in a lot of debates. Not that you’re going to watch this, but I had got into a pretty heated debate about bitcoin mining in the City of Plattsburgh, because it was driving up the community’s power rates.      One of my competitors referred to bitcoin miners as parasites, and I was, like, “You should be careful about using that kind of language when talking about an emerging technology.”      That being said, there was a legitimate problem there because Plattsburgh had a power purchasing agreement, up to a certain level, at reduced cost. That reduced cost was what brought the miners there in the first place, but then the mining operations were eating through the purchase agreement, which was supposed to be enough for the city for months, and pushing the entire city into a higher tier billing bracket. Everyone having to pay a higher rate because of bitcoin mining is a legitimate concern. I just don’t think they should be called parasites.      Are you supportive of developing a crypto mining industry in New York State?      Yeah, but you want to avoid the Plattsburgh situation. There would need to be a mechanism for miners to generate their own electricity or strike their own purchasing agreements with the grid. Then again, Plattsburgh was a special situation with that purchasing agreement. That’s local politics.      What were the compliance constraints around crypto donations?      I experienced the compliance of funding through bitcoin at both the state and federal level, and I have to say the federal government doesn’t seem to understand the process. They were trying to treat it like cash, so the contribution was subject to the same $100 cash limit.      I was, like, “No, no, no treat it like PayPal, or like Act Blue credit processing.” To remain in compliance, I had to book it as an in-kind contribution and then separately book the sale into fiat. For every contribution it was adding two entries of compliance instead of one.      It's just a means of transferring value, but the [Federal Election Commission] got their heads tilted the wrong way. That goes to people generally misunderstanding what crypto is and what it isn’t.      On the state side, we always treated it like a payment processor and never ran into compliance issues. Last I checked, there was nothing in the state laws on the subject.      Is that why you’re not accepting bitcoin this time around?      My attitude, with the experience of the last two races, is, if we get folks who want to support the campaign in bitcoin, if there is demand for the service, we’ll look into providing that avenue. If there’s sufficient volume, we’ll facilitate it. Otherwise I’m not looking into right now. I put myself out there twice to support it, and it wasn’t a significant piece of what we were doing to justify the work we had to do on the compliance side.      You’ve mentioned in the past you would like to see New York’s BitLicense reformed.      I would like it to be as hands-off as possible, while still preventing fraud and mishandling. I don’t like unnecessary bureaucracy or compliance costs on the part of new businesses, or situations where people need to make friends with people in politics in order to build a business.

I would appreciate your readers reaching out to provide me with better information and provide perspective on this. I’m looking to represent my constituents. So any bitcoin miners or crypto enthusiasts in the 43rd district should definitely reach out and I’ll take that information under advisement.      To underscore my philosophy. It’s like the [Securities and Exchange Commission's] regulations show they clearly do not understand what they are dealing with in the way in which they choose to regulate it. When you have the situation of having regulators that don’t know how to regulate, and are putting crypto in categorical boxes, it can shut out innovation of technologies that don't exist in those boxes.      What’s it like running a campaign during a pandemic?      Sometimes it feels like you’re not. So much of running for office is jumping around to events, knocking on doors and meeting people. A lot of the traditional signifiers that my brain would see and say, ""Yes, I’m being a candidate now"" aren’t present.

While that May 30 tweet is now gone, it's hard to hide its effects given a recent surge in the stablecoin's count of active addresses. The number of unique addresses active in the network, either as a sender or receiver, nearly doubled to 203,776 last week, having risen by 26% in May, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. However, as of Tuesday, the number of active addresses was back down sharply to 122,809.      Coinbase Custody’s original tweet was shared on the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex's social platform and also acknowledged by Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Bitfinex and Tether Ltd (creator of tether).      It is unclear when the tweet was removed. Also, there is no mention of USDT in the list of supported assets on its official website. CoinDesk reached out to Coinbase Custody on Tuesday for information on whether it are supporting tether. As of press time, we have yet to receive any reply.      While that mystery remains, the on-chain data shows the original announcement was followed by a spike in the number of active addresses.      “Coinbase Custody International’s announcement may have contributed to the recent jump in addresses,” said Wilson Withiam, research analyst at data provider Messari.      The custodian mainly serves wealthy institutional investors, such as family offices and trading firms. As such, one may conclude that its decision to add support for tether is reflective of the increased institutional interest in the stablecoin.      See also: As Tether Supply Hits Record Highs, It Moves Away From Original Home      Demand for tether and other dollar-backed stablecoins has been on the rise this year in the wake of the U.S. dollar shortage in the global economy and extremely low interest rates in fiat markets as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. While commercial banks across the advanced world are offering near zero interest rates on deposits, cryptocurrency lending platforms including Nexo and Celsius Network are paying 8% interest rate on tether deposits.      Hence, it's no surprise the number of active addresses has risen by over 600% so far this year.

42432079,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9NTh,1591816976,'Radical Indifference': How Surveillance Capitalism Conquered Our Lives,"When Shoshana Zuboff returns my call 15 minutes late, it’s because her previous call with an organization in Israel dropped halfway through and it took them a while to reconnect. Such is the peril of functioning in quarantine, even as tech companies exert more power than ever.      Rather than having time over the summer to reflect and plan her next book as she intended, Zuboff has been very busy with people wanting to speak with her and do virtual events. It’s part of the reason that for the last four months we’ve been trying to schedule a call, only to have the date repeatedly pushed back.      Birds are chirping in the background as we speak over the phone, part of the ambience of Zuboff’s home in the country. She says she’s lucky to be there, given the challenges her friends face balancing COVID-19 and living in cities. The birds beat the dystopian jingle of ice cream trucks as they rove New York City, looking for customers amid a pandemic.      “Pandemic life just takes so much time,” she says. “Between figuring out how to get groceries and everything else, it is just so painstaking.”      See also: In Trump Versus Twitter, Decentralized Tech May Win      Zuboff is the author of ""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power,"" and the Charles Edward Wilson Professor Emerita at Harvard Business School. Zuboff saysthe book (which is 660 pages long) “synthesizes years of research and thinking in order to reveal a world in which technology users are neither customers, employees, nor products. Instead they are the raw material for new procedures of manufacturing and sales that define an entirely new economic order: a surveillance economy.”      Zuboff and I speak about the framework of surveillance capitalism. But I'm keen to hear her views on the roiling protests in the U.S., and President Donald Trump’s executive order on Section 230, a law that affords social media companies immunity from content liability, with which the president has taken issue. It feels like a good time to think about the context the internet gives to these events,and who controls it.      This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.      Describe surveillance capitalism and what that means for people who might not be familiar with it.      Surveillance capitalism was invented at Google between 2000 and 2001 as a response to the financial emergency during the dot-com bust. They were the smartest guys with the best search engine and the swankiest venture capital investors. But even they came under the gun with their investors threatening to withdraw. At that time they decided they had to find a fast track to monetization, and it was going to have to be through advertising, which they’d rejected previously.      They discovered leftover behavioral data on their servers, called data exhaust, was actually full of rich predictive signals. And those predictive signals were just lying around unused, more than what was needed for product or service improvement. I call these data behavioral “surpluses.” It was by training their already highly sophisticated analytical capabilities on these surplus flows and pulling out those predictive signals, while using them for analysis, that they discovered that they could predict what kind of ad somebody is likely to click on and if they would click through to the website. That became what we now know as the “click-through rate.”      The click-through rate is a computational product that predicts a fragment of human behavior. It turned out that there was a very substantial market of business customers who wanted to know what customers will do, who wanted behavioral predictions of customer behavior and user behavior.      So advertisers and their clients surrendered the traditional relationship between a product and its ad, where a company decides where to place its ads based on alignment with its brand values. Even the first years of online advertising maintain that continuity. But Google made them an offer they couldn't refuse and they agreed to it after quite a bit of debate and conflict. They agreed to buy the product without asking to see what was inside Google’s black box and let the machines decide where the ads go.      How does this model expand to enmesh almost all of the internet?      This is not just an accident that happened at Google. This is an economic logic that was so successful at Google that within just a few years, it became the default model throughout the tech sector and then spread through the normal economy and has become the dominant economic logic in our time.      Between 2001, when this logic first started being systematically applied, and 2004, when Google went public (the first time we got to see any of their numbers) their revenue increased by 3,590%. That exponential increase represents what I call the surveillance dividend. At that point, they had cracked the code and many companies found a path to monetization. Now everybody from your TV manufacturer to Ford Motor Company started to say “to heck with the product, we want the data.” Everyone in every sector is chasing the surveillance dividend.      There is a story about the top young folks at Google sitting around in an office in 2001, trying to answer the question: “What is Google?” And nobody had a cogent way to answer that question. Larry Page ultimately began to share things and what he said was if Google had a business, it would be personal information. People are going to produce so much data. There will be cheap cameras and sensors everywhere. There will be so much data about people's lives that all of human experience will be searchable and indexable. He had the vision that personal information was the game. Surveillance capitalism is an economic logic founded on the unilateral, secret theft of private experience as a limitless source of free raw material, and that free raw material becomes the zero-cost asset [meaning that, after set-up costs, it is free to produce]. It can be translated into behavioral data. That behavioral data is now claimed as proprietary and it’s gathered into new complex supply chain ecosystems.    This is the arc that surveillance capitalism is traveling: Not only to know everything and use it for prediction, but to actuate human behavior.    Everything feeds the supply chain. Not only what you do online, but everything on your phone, all the apps on your phone, and as Page predicted, all the cameras and sensors are gathering data. All of behavioral data is now claimed as proprietary and flows into complex ecosystems before being conveyed to surveillance capitalism's computational factories, called artificial intelligence. The [output] is computational products that predict human behavior that are sold in markets, just like we have markets for pork belly futures or oil futures.      What does this mean for people’s daily life?      Human futures markets have competitive dynamics. What the actors and the sellers in these markets are competing on is certainty. They're selling certainty to their customers and the best predictions win. We had some insight into these factory hubs a couple years ago with a leaked Facebook document in 2018. The document revealed that in Facebook's AI hub, trillions of data points are ingested every day and 6 million predictions of behavior are produced every second. So this is the kind of scale that we're talking about. When we think about the competition in these prediction markets, and you kind of deconstruct that competition, you begin to see the economic imperatives at work here very clearly.      The first one is scale. For AI to be effective in producing predictions, it needs a lot of data. The second one is scope. In addition to volume, you need variety. That involves getting people off their desktop, off their laptop, and out into the world and getting them moving around their house, in their cars, through their cities. Give them a little computer, they can take it in their pocket and it will tell us everything they're doing. We'll call it a phone. Those are economies of scope.      The final discovery was that the very best predictive data comes from digitally intervening in people's behavior and learning how to tune and herd their behavior in the direction that maximizes the strength of their predictions and therefore maximize customer outcomes. This became a new zone of experimentation. The extraction scale is huge, but conceptually straightforward. The scope is huge but has required a lot of invention. Facebook, for example, is now working on how to translate brainwaves into language.      How do we actually modify behavior in the direction that optimizes revenue flows? This is not as straightforward. This is a new zone of experimentation and so the companies went to work experimenting with it. Things like Facebook's massive scale contagion experiments, and things like Google's Pokemon Go, the augmented reality game which experimented with how to herd people through their cities, towns, and villages to the establishments that were paying Niantic Labs, which made Pokemon Go and which was spun off of Google, for guaranteed footfall. This is exactly the same structure as the online ad market markets who are paying for click through rate and now you have a real world establishment paying for guaranteed footfall.      See also: Why Bitcoin's 'Culture War' Matters      This is what data scientists call the shift from monitoring to actuation. That’s when you actually have enough knowledge about a machine system to be able to control it remotely and automate it. You can change the parameters or do whatever you need to do remotely because you have so much information now about the system monitoring the actuation. This is the arc that surveillance capitalism is traveling: Not only to know everything and use it for prediction, but to actuate human behavior, social behavior, and individual behavior to drive behavior in the direction that is optimal for revenue.      We see this in psychologically-based micro targeting. We see this in the real-time use of rewards and punishments, delivered through your phone. We see this through the importation of gamification in order to point people in the direction that satisfies commercial outcomes. Pokemon Go was an example of that. The point is that when people think about these issues, they just think about targeted ads. They think this is just about advertising. It no longer is. This is about your insurance company rewarding and punishing you in real time for the amount of pressure that your foot places on the gas pedal. In real time it can raise or lower your premiums based on your immediate behavior.      So what’s the end game in this scenario? You reference Sidewalk Lab’s previous experimentation with Toronto as a “smart city” that exchanges data for all sorts of privileges. What does that look like?      Such an experiment replaces decisions that citizens make about how they want to live together, which are the building blocks of every democracy. The citizen has no role other than just to be part of this larger system. And these companies say if you agree to give us all your data and make your life completely accessible to us in every way, then you will be eligible for all these cool new services.      If you choose privacy and anonymity though, you will be excluded from the service offerings. You won't be able to take advantage of the new transit systems or the new security systems or the food delivery systems. These are the real-time rewards and punishments in action. Google spoke about using data to construct reputation scores. People and businesses that behave within the algorithmic parameters get higher reputation scores and that privileges them when it comes to bank loans or other kinds of services. People who violate the algorithmic parameters are punished because they're excluded from these kinds of relationships and services, and they can't advance their lives because they're excluded.      See also: Decentralization and What Section 230 Really Means for Freedom of Speech      This is a vision of a future: a private corporation with unaccountable power. It’s a future where we don’t have the great democratization of information that we expected in the digital century, but just the opposite. We revert to a feudal pattern with these huge concentrations of knowledge and this new kind of power.      This power is not soldiers coming to your house in the middle of the night and whisking you away to the gulag. This is not violence and terror and murder. This is power that operates remotely through the milieu of digital instrumentation. For anyone who thinks that such systems are only the subject of ""Black Mirror"" episodes, go and read the history of the 20th century where it took the entire Western alliance to fight back another kind of totalizing power that wanted total control over individuals and society and that was totalitarianism. This is different because it tends to come bearing a cappuccino rather than a gun.    Radical indifference is about maximizing flows of data, not because these are evil people, but because this is the compulsion of this economic logic.    How might Trump’s executive order attacking Section 230 – which absolves companies from civil liability for online content – impact this, if at all?      Disinformation is a routine consequence of the economic logic that we have just discussed. It’s a consequence of the imperatives of economies of scale and economies of scope. All systems have been engineered right from the start to maximize supply chain flows. In the euphemistic language of the surveillance capitalists, it is engagement. There is no room in this economic logic to judge the quality of supply. It doesn't matter. Scale matters. Scope matters. Actuation that allows us to increase the accuracy of prediction matters. That's all.      This is what I call radical indifference. We don't care if you're happy or sad. We just care that we can get the data. We don't care if you have cancer if you're getting married or if you're planning a terrorist attack, we just care that we get the data. Radical indifference is about maximizing flows of data, not because these are evil people, but because this is the compulsion of this economic logic. Until we interrupt and outlaw that economic logic, we will have disinformation.      The nature of the human being is if you're driving down a road, and there's a car accident, you're gonna stop and look. If you're driving down the road, and there's a beautiful willow tree, you're gonna keep driving. It turns out that violent, contentious, hateful, rabble rousing and mendacious content gets people to stop and look. That's the car wreck.      Because the systems are engineered to maximize supply, and because people stop and look at car wrecks, it enables armies of bots and trolls. That’s Mr Trump.      Section 230 had no way of anticipating surveillance capitalism. There's no incentive to take down bad stuff and massive incentives to keep the supply chains full. It turns out that the internet is not a bulletin board, as the creators of Section 230 envisioned. The internet is more like the bloodstream of the global body politic. Thanks to the economic imperatives of surveillance capitalism, the people who own and operate the internet, are incentivized to allow anybody to put any kind of poison into the bloodstream without an antidote. That's where we are today.      So does Section 230 need scrutiny? Yes, but it needs scrutiny as part of a larger discussion about legislative frameworks, regulatory paradigms, charters of rights or the institutions that we need to make the internet compatible with democracy.      This is the third decade of the digital century. We have to figure this out. Mr. Trump is coming along and shining attention on Section 230, which one might think was a good thing, but now here we have the second whiplash. That whiplash is that Mr. Trump is fighting for the right to put poison at will into the global bloodstream. He's fighting for the right to lie. He's fighting for the right to put counterfactual information into the body politic.      We need to construct a rule of law compatible with democracy that addresses these core questions of surveillance capitalism and who owns and operates the internet. We need to do it so that we make the internet safe for truth. Not safe for lies. There are areas where there's opinion but there are areas where there are facts. Now we have a global bloodstream in which there is no institutional operation that comes under democratic protection and democratic oversight. This has made our democracies untenable.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/10/radical-indifference-how-surveillance-capitalism-conquered-our-lives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55d7bc44a05991affb30a7804d636a70fecc3f18-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prices for personal consumption expenditures are expected to climb just 1% this year, down from a December projection of 1.9%, according to the document. Inflation will average 1.5% next year and 1.7% in 2022, the officials projected.      ""Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation,"" the Fed's monetary-policy committee said Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day, closed-door meeting.      The Fed made no change to its benchmark interest rate, now set in a range from 0% to 0.25%, and officials projected no hikes through the next three years. The officials saw U.S. gross domestic product falling 6.5% this year before a 5% increase in 2021 and 3.5% growth in 2022.      The central bank pledged to continue its purchases of Treasury bonds and other securities ""at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning.""      Read more: First Mover: Bitcoin Bulls Might Get Negative Rates From Central Banks, Just Not the Fed      The revised inflation expectations show that officials see little threat of runaway inflation despite the central bank's trillion-dollar money injections to stabilize markets and heal an economy devastated by the coronavirus and related lockdowns.      Bitcoin prices have surged 36% this year, partly on expectations that the largest cryptocurrency by market value might serve as a hedge against inflation. Economists including Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University have written that hyperinflation episodes in Zimbabwe, France and elsewhere have historically occurred when ""when the supply of money had no natural constraints.""      The Federal Reserve has expanded its balance sheet by about $3 trillion this year to $7.2 trillion as of last week. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the central bank had less than $1 trillion of total assets.      Yet, so far inflation has remained muted. Rising unemployment tamps down wage growth and flagging consumer demand reduces upward pressure on prices for goods and services.      A report earlier Wednesday from the U.S. Labor Department showed another closely followed inflation gauge, the consumer price index, or CPI, climbed just 0.1% over the past 12 months, partly due to this year's collapse in oil and other energy-related costs.

42432059,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9Hjh,1591812536,Human Rights Foundation Funds Bitcoin Privacy Tools Despite 'Coin Mixing' Legal Stigma,"On one hand, the bitcoin industry has matured to include traditional brokerages and institutional traders. On the other, bitcoin privacy tech is still shrouded in a legal gray zone.      The Human Rights Foundation (HRF) took a strong stance on bitcoin privacy tech Wednesday by announcing its new Bitcoin Developer Fund. The first $50,000 grant from the fund has been awarded to freelance CoinSwap developer Chris Belcher.      CoinSwap, a mixing technique originally invented in 2013 by Greg Maxwell, is part of a comprehensive suite of privacy tools being developed by bitcoin advocates.      “The fund’s next gift, already earmarked for another developer working on strengthening Bitcoin pseudonymity at the network level, will be announced later this summer,” Alex Gladstein, the HRF’s chief strategy officer, said in an email.      HRF will also crowdsource fundraising for such privacy tech, he added, using both dollars and bitcoin, while making it “possible for activists to more safely receive donations, earn income and continue their important work under increased financial pressure.”      Belcher said he hopes to have a primitive testnet available near the end of the year.      “It will be a bit like Lightning, where there’s never a single day when it’s finished, but it slowly gets more and better features and bug fixes until one day you realize it’s everywhere,” Belcher said of CoinSwap, which he plans to keep as an open source hobby project and not a revenue-producing company.      Theoretically, any wallet provider could use the open source code to add the feature to their mobile app or desktop app. Privacy-focused wallets could even use CoinSwap features as another layer to current CoinJoin offerings.      Read more: Samourai Wallet Releases Privacy-Enhancing CoinJoin Feature      “The bitcoin ecosystem could end up in a bad situation where it's impossible to accept bitcoin as payment without consulting some centralized blacklist … so I talk a lot about privacy but fungibility is important too,” Belcher said. “Centralization also makes the privacy of the software worse, so I’m less interested in going in that direction … it’s all about tradeoffs.”      Adam Fiscor, co-founder of zkSNACKs, said the next Wasabi Research Club will examine CoinSwaps, though he said it would be premature to comment on it further.      Both CoinSwaps and CoinJoins are a type of non-custodial mixing, which could theoretically be layered as two privacy tools used in the same transaction. CoinSwaps are comparable to atomic swaps, while CoinJoin options typically pool disparate funds together as part of the transaction.      Read more: 100 Bitcoin Users Perform What Might Be Largest ‘CoinJoin’ Transaction Ever      However, some compliance officers at leading analytics companies and crypto exchanges treat mixed bitcoin as inherently suspicious, which influences how legal authorities view the technology as well. It remains to be seen if CoinSwap features will suffer from the same stigmas as the incumbent method, CoinJoin.    CoinJoin    The technologists working with bitcoin privacy tech walk a delicate line, and tend to pay their lawyers accordingly.      Attorney Preston Bryne said he would not advise clients to use CoinJoin transactions, which he said is sometimes wrongly associated with money laundering. Many exchanges and wallet companies choose to be safe rather than sorry when it comes to legal battles.      Yet, lawyer Rafael Yakobi said there’s nothing inherently wrong with using this privacy feature, it’s all about how you report it. In the case of wallet providers, this may be possible in non-custodial scenarios where the intermediating startup never controls the assets.      “I'm quite confident that CoinJoin has not yet been mentioned in any piece of legislation. It's not even mentioned by name in FinCEN’s guidance,” Yakobi said. “The more appropriate question is whether flagging CoinJoin transactions is implicitly required by the relevant regulations. I’m not sure about Europe, but in the U.S. it’s not an objective yes or no answer. Each business is required to formulate best practices designed to comply with the law.”      Over in Europe, it appears the law enforcement agency Europol is wary of the privacy-oriented Wasabi Wallet, because the analytics firm Chainalysis estimated $15 million worth of illicit transactions used the bitcoin wallet’s CoinJoin feature.      Read more: EU’s Europol: Bitcoin Privacy Wallet ‘Not Looking Good’ For Law Enforcement      Critics like Reckless VR founder Udi Wertheimer and Jon Matonis of Cypherpunk Holdings, the latter of which invested in both the privacy-oriented Samourai Wallet and Wasabi-maker zkSNACKs, say blockchain analytics firms are overestimating the amount of illicit transactions when they flag mixed bitcoin.      “Exchanges, banks and regulators are being sold a false narrative if they believe that this [analytics] technology provides reliable, or more importantly, actionable results,” Matonis said. “It is purely a dangerous game of probabilities and false positives, disingenuously overstated to peddle more forensic services.”      HRF’s Gladstein recently took Elliptic, another blockchain analytics firm, to task for its “surveillance” work.  “The tools you’re building regardless of your intentions will be used for policing bitcoin,” Gladstein said during a panel with Elliptic’s Tom Robinson at an event this month. “At the end of the day what you’re doing is warrantless surveillance against people in other countries.”      Read more: ‘Financial Surveillance’ or ‘Blockchain Analysis’? Human Rights Foundation Debates Elliptic      For his part, Matonis’s investment thesis revolves around the belief the legal community will adopt compliance norms that don’t restrict or criminalize privacy-tech like mixers.      “The concern around mixing technology, or coin hygiene, stems from the flawed thinking that cryptocurrency transactions are identical to bank transfers using fiat currency,” Matonis said. “This is a grand societal battle that must be won by privacy advocates, not because it is a cute feature or a principled position, but because it is an existential economic necessity. A peer-to-peer value transfer system fails without underlying coin privacy at its core, because the entire system would lack fungibility if all coins were not treated equally the way paper cash is today.”      This is why some bitcoiners continue to work on privacy tech, regardless of exchange policies and other hurdles.    Continued growth    Meanwhile, CoinJoin usage continues to increase, with roughly 13,500 new Wasabi Wallet downloads this year.      So far in June, more than 10,000 fresh bitcoin were used in Wasabi CoinJoin transactions for the first time, the highest record since the all-time peak in August 2019 according to the Wasabi team.      Overall, usage has more than tripled since May 2019, when roughly 9,764 total bitcoin were used in Wasabi’s CoinJoin transactions, compared to 35,697 total bitcoin used in May 2020, they said.    And that’s not even to mention the few thousand bitcoinhttps://joinmarket.me/ob/ sent using other CoinJoin tools since the coronavirus began, including Samourai Wallet and JoinMarket. Generally speaking, usage appears to be up across the sector.    Matonis said as long as companies and public individuals focus on non-custodial, open source software, he believes privacy-tech projects will actually bear less compliance costs over time as the tools become normalized. For example, mixing protocols could become a “standard default feature” in bitcoin wallets.      “Both the bitcoin industry and law enforcement need to resist falling for the myth of blockchain forensics as perpetrated by the blockchain surveillance firms,” Matonis said of companies that routinely flag mixed coins as suspicious.      “Law enforcement methods will undoubtedly have to evolve beyond simply using money as an identity tracking device or simply relying on metadata through non-targeted driftnet surveillance,” he added. “This means employing real and sometimes cumbersome police work that doesn’t violate the rights of any individuals.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/10/human-rights-foundation-funds-bitcoin-privacy-tools-despite-coin-mixing-legal-stigma,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5758f812d5d80aa9f9151f3b1c6c08ed7a440d53-1500x1037.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Libra's Future Libra’s initial prospectus and subsequent redesign has left its imprint on the world. Some 70% of central banks are researching a national digital currency, a fact that Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications at the Libra Association, thinks is good for the Libra project and its mission. “I think there would be nothing better for the world and for poverty alleviation if, in fact, we started to trigger a bit of a space race on compliance to address the 1.7 billion people who are unbanked and underbanked,” he said. “So from my point of view, there is no monopoly on this work. Let others enter this process and let the race begin.” CoinDesk’s Ian Allison takes a deep dive into where Libra stands in midst of the “digital dollar space race.”      Institutional Investors Fidelity Digital Assets found the number of U.S. institutional investors buying crypto derivative products jumped significantly in 2020. In a survey the subsidiary found “22% of U.S. respondents invested in digital assets have exposure via futures, which is a substantial increase relative to 9% of U.S. investors surveyed in 2019,” while 80% of investors surveyed have found “something appealing about the asset class.” Separately, Bakkt and Galaxy Digital plan to partner to offer a ""white glove"" trading and custody solution targeting institutional investors this year. Galaxy will provide all the trading services and functionalities, while Bakkt will repurpose part of its Bakkt Warehouse as the service’s custody solution.      Building Blocks Elrond, a proof-of-stake blockchain, is offering up to $60,000 to node-runners and white-hat hackers to find bugs and vulnerabilities in a trial-by-fire test of the network. Separately, Band Protocol 2.0 launched Wednesday with its mainnet oracle solution, BandChain, leveraging the Cosmos SDK. The project’s revamp comes 10 months after listing as an initial exchange offering (IEO) on Binance Launchpad and a $3 million 2019 seed round led by Sequoia India.      Investments Hacker Noon, a tech publication with 4 million monthly readers, has closed a $1 million strategic investment from micropayments firm Coil, a blockchain-agnostic product built on the Interledger protocol and headed by former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas. The publication will integrate Coil’s Web Monetization technology to pay Hacker Noon writers based on their screen time.      Financial Products London-based investment firm ETC Group plans to list a bitcoin-backed exchange-traded product (ETP), called the Bitcoin Exchange Traded Crypto (BTCE), on Deutsche Borse’s Xetra market. This would be the world’s first centrally cleared derivative crypto asset. Meanwhile, Bitwage, a crypto payroll provider, has added USDC support to its platform.      Ill-Gotten Gains? Just before 10:00 UTC Wednesday, an unknown wallet holder sent 0.55 ether (around $133) with a 10,666 ETH transaction fee – currently worth just under $2.6 million. The fee went to Chinese mining group Spark Pool – which ordinarily would have averaged around $0.50 – that now says it has frozen the payout to miners in its pool. Elsewhere, a 20-year old California resident was charged Monday by the U.S. Department of Justice with allegedly participating in a SIM-swapping scam that defrauded Apple and stole an unknown amount of cryptocurrency from one victim.      Movers & Shakers Brian Brooks sold $4.6 million Coinbase stock options when he left the exchange to become interim head at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Since taking office Brooks has already publicly suggested a federal payments charter for fintech companies, asked state and local governments to consider lifting COVID-19 lockdowns to protect the banking system and published a request for public input on how banks look at crypto. In an interview with CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De, Brooks said, “My job here is not to protect incumbents, and it’s not to preserve the status quo.” He also thinks DeFi is the most exciting corner of crypto today.      Blockchain Voting Residents of Moscow will have the option to cast votes electronically in Russia’s upcoming national referendum on its constitution, and have their votes recorded on Bitfury’s open-source enterprise blockchain, Exonum. Sources close to the matter say Moscow’s Department of Information Technologies tapped Kaspersky Lab, an anti-virus software vendor turned blockchain consultant, to build this technical solution.    Opinion    The Crypto Community Needs to Stand Up and Fight Racism Robert Greenfield, CEO of Emerging Impact, takes a moment to reflect on the crypto industry’s response to the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests around the country. Whereas other corporations and public figures working in the broader tech industry have taken a stance against police brutality and economic injustice, the crypto community has been mostly silent. “The crypto community is conveniently selective about what aspects of society it wants to change,” Greenfield said.      Bitcoin Doesn’t Take Sides: Why Apolitical Solutions Are the Internet’s Future Preston Byrne, partner in Anderson Kill and a CoinDesk columnist, sees another side of the culture war. In an op-ed examining censorship and the future of Section 230, Byrne thinks the winners will likely be apolitical. “Companies that build politics-free solutions will be the future of the internet. Not because such products have the right opinions about their users, but because they have no opinions at all,” he said.    Market intel    Profitable Coins Over 16 million BTC out of the total circulating supply of 18.4 million, or 87%, is currently making gains. The metric, an obscure data point called percentage of bitcoin’s circulating supply in profit, is calculated by looking at the ratio of coins with a value that is higher now than when they were last moved, and signals a coming bull run. “Historically, levels of 90% and higher have clearly marked pronounced bull markets,” Glassnode said in a weekly report.      Playing it Loose Officials in the U.K., Europe and New Zealand may push interest rates below zero as a form of economic stimulus. And bitcoin might be a beneficiary of looser monetary policy outside the U.S., even if the Federal Reserve never joins its foreign counterparts. While central banks’ dalliances with negative interest rates in the mid-2010s didn’t seem to affect bitcoin’s price, a current market capitalization roughly 20 times levels in 2014 and an increasing correlation with the broader market may see people turning to bitcoin as a hedge against increasing consumer prices.

42432051,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9HXh,1591804800,Microsoft Releases Bitcoin-Based ID Tool as COVID-19 'Passports' Draw Criticism,"Microsoft’s Bitcoin-based decentralized identity tool, ION, went live with a beta version on mainnet Wednesday as one of many efforts by members of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), some of which may fast-track tools anyone can use for COVID-19 crisis response programs.      Microsoft and ConsenSys’s uPort project are both leading DIF members. Separately, Microsoft is also collaborating with the bitcoin startup Casa to create a user-friendly interface for managing multiple digital identities.      “We’re excited to help ION take full advantage of technology like Bitcoin to vastly improve authentication, security and privacy on the internet,” Casa CEO Nick Neuman said in a press release.      “We are thrilled to have Casa collaborating on ION with us, which showcases the potential of building real-world applications that leverage the strong foundation Bitcoin provides,” Microsoft project lead Daniel Buchner said in a statement.      First announced last year, ION is meant to enable user-controlled logins that suit independent companies or services, rather than having system-providers (like Facebook) owning a user’s login credentials. ION can be used for many use cases that aren’t strictly related to health certificates or contact tracing, though the continued spread of coronavirus has influenced its potential usage.      Read more: Microsoft Launches Decentralized Identity Tool on Bitcoin Blockchain      “Almost every group in the blockchain industry is coming up with use cases,” said ConsenSys employee and DIF leader Rouven Heck, referring to potential partnerships with government agencies.      “There are conversations happening at the moment but it’s not a formal agreement,” Heck said.      “Everybody wants to move fast and has a high interest in demonstrating this technology can be very powerful.”      The race is on for companies to work with governments on such high-tech emergency ID measures. There are generally two approaches, contact tracing and digitized medical records, while some Asian governments combine them. For example, dozens of blockchain startups joined forces to start creating an “immunity passport” approved by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Verifiable Credentials standard.      However, some people see both approaches as controversial, even dangerous.      In May, attorney Elizabeth Renieris resigned from her advisory role at the ID2020 consortium for decentralized ID (DID) creators, including Microsoft, saying she “cannot be part of an organization overly influenced by commercial interests that only pays lip service to human rights.”      Read more: ‘Decentralized ID at All Costs’: Adviser Quits ID2020 Over Blockchain Fixation      Microsoft would not make executives available for an interview, though the company did provide a statement.      “Microsoft is continuing to work on the ION project, which has always included considerations on functionality for a wide range of use cases,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CoinDesk. “While there could be relevant software solutions inspired by new needs and current market demands, Microsoft believes in empowering people and protecting privacy and is committed to growing the open source community and industry standards.”    Layered privacy    Microsoft’s open source ION project uses the Bitcoin blockchain for something comparable to a coat-check ticket.      Rather than include all the data about the coat (or person), which would be hard to scale, it offers a Bitcoin-ledger reference number to the data’s chronology. The heavy data is actually stored between ION nodes using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Whoever is anchoring the data pays a small fee to bitcoin miners to record the reference number.      “The focus is to make things highly interoperable,” Heck said, referring broadly to the urgent work being done on solutions across the space.      Part of the reason why organizations involved with DIF are working to make their technologies compatible across use cases and systems is interoperability might, at the very least, make it easier to build privacy features that apply across the spectrum.      “Uport at ConsenSys are also working on projects,” Heck said. “Microsoft’s ION stack or Uport’s stack should be compatible.”      Even so, some privacy advocates say the project’s safeguards are lacking.      Read more: Israeli Bitcoiners See Surveillance as Unavoidable During Coronavirus Crisis      Former W3C employee Harry Halpin, now CEO of the privacy-tech startup Nym, said some of these efforts are simply repackaging previous work.      “ID2020 is just the latest attempt to violate people’s privacy using feel-good rhetoric. It’s also part of a larger business plan. Microsoft and IBM’s entire bottom line is to build identity systems,” Halpin said. “Governments need to establish identities of who owns these keys, so they say, ‘OK, we’ll have an open standard, call it decentralized, and make it mandatory.’”      In the face of such harsh criticism, blockchain advocates are working to identify and minimize the ethical risks of the tools they continue to build.      According to W3C member and nonprofit Blockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen, it’s not clear the contact tracing like Google and Apple are offering will work unless the vast majority of all Americans use them. Since it’s hard to get enough people on board for contact tracing to work, he worries the most salient result may simply be accelerated data collection.      “Probably the most dangerous type of information, out of all types of personal information, is location data,” Allen said, explaining contact tracing would require privacy tech at multiple layers, from the app level on the phone to the internet infrastructure someone uses.      “It’s incredibly hard to protect,” he said.      In reference to an open source emergency app in Israel, which does have privacy measures yet was operated in cooperation with various government entities, Allen said it’s clear “this data is already out there being collected and [location data] correlation is happening.”    Government partners    Zcash Foundation researcher Henry de Valence agreed such systems are not the best use case for distributed ledger technology, or really any software.      “I don’t think people should build those systems and I don’t think they would be effective at preventing the spread of disease,” he said, adding he does not see so-called immunity passports as any better. “There’s no cryptographically strong way to prove immunity one way or another.”      Read more: Immunity Passes Explained: Should We Worry About Privacy?      Some countries, like Honduras, have already implemented some type of blockchain solution for certificates that give people a type of ticket for medical services or free movement outdoors.      However, in these cases, the government generally came up with a policy and found a startup to create the relevant tooling, rather than tech startups coming to policymakers with prospective offerings. One exception, which isn’t widely adopted so far and didn’t use blockchain technology, was NSO Group pitching surveillance technology to American police. Despite the societal risks, crypto companies are taking NSO Group’s proactive approach.    Blockchain certificates    Allen is slightly more optimistic about decentralized identity tools for self-sovereign medical records.      “This architecture is ripe for solving this particular problem,” Allen said, warning this is only in reference to the digital certificate itself. (Whether the medical tests actually prove immunity is a different matter entirely.)      As someone who collaborates with both immunity passport teams and companies involved with the DIF, he said they are taking disparate approaches based on their own evaluations of the tradeoffs. He’s not sure which will be better and hopes the market will decide.      “We don’t know what the best answer is and we don’t have a strong rubric for what the best level of decentralization means,” Allen said of the immunity passport coalition. “Parties like DIF, with Microsoft and ConsenSys … [have] a different set of rubrics to decide the answer to their solution.”      On the other hand, Zcash’s de Valence remains skeptical.      “It’s the duty of technologists to ask what types of systems we’re creating and what kinds of social structures do those things create,” he said.      Although Allen warned no technology offers a panacea, especially with regards to government overreach or recurring outbreaks, he expects some type of new “verifiable credential” technology will probably emerge from this crisis.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/10/microsoft-releases-bitcoin-based-id-tool-as-covid-19-passports-draw-criticism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d0b705c95343bf881ff027abd94b7d81293b3e1-1500x619.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432047,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9HRh,1591803341,This Political Conversation With Vitalik Buterin Shows How Ethereum Could Change the World,"New York congressional candidate Jonathan Herzog hosted a live YouTube broadcast with Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin on Monday, along with author and activist Glen Weyl.      Herzog is a Democrat who previously worked on Andrew Yang’s failed yet crypto-savvy presidential campaign earlier in 2020.      These three white men talked about the protests erupting across the United States. To his credit, the Russian-Canadian Buterin spoke broadly instead of attempting to comment on inequality in American politics. He said the current generation is facing a global “crisis of legitimacy,” concerning both corporations and “many types of governments.”      “The challenge here is can we create systems that allow some groups of people to cooperate without that downside of a centralized or trusted actor having to be in the middle,” Buterin said.      Buterin skillfully framed his software project as it relates to the current economic and political crisis. Yet this YouTube broadcast on Herzog’s campaign trail was hardly Buterin’s first brush with politics.      Read more: The Crypto Community Needs to Stand Up and Fight Racism      Buterin met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2017 because the Ethereum movement is – as a threat to incumbent systems – inevitably political (as Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir often tweets). Former Ethereum Foundation employee Virgil Griffith, Buterin’s American mentor, is even on trial for allegedly violating sanctions related to North Korea. Token evangelism is a type of diplomacy, for better or worse.      None of this is to say these men will achieve their vision, nor that they have the “right” vision for political reform. But as this underdog democratic candidate in New York revealed, it would be naive at this point to overlook how crypto pioneers have gone from trading magic internet money to influencing politicians around the world.      Herzog literally asked for Buterin’s perspective on policy issues as part of this campaign broadcast.    Thought leaders    Buterin’s philosophical compatriot, Glen Weyl, is the Ethereum community’s latest ideological godfather (after both Griffith and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin).      Weyl charmed diplomats and bankers at the World Economic Forum 2020 and inspired an activist movement promoted through the RadicalxChange Foundation. He takes Ayn Rand’s hyper-individualistic ideology and reshapes it to fit liberal morality. Equality can be achieved through free market auction, he argues in his economic manifesto “Radical Markets.” An organizer said more than 900 people are signed up for the upcoming RadicalxChange virtual conference starting June 19, where Buterin is also a headliner.      “More than ever, in the time of COVID-19, the problems we face are collective, not individual. And if we each try to protect ourselves, rather than some notion of the public,” Weyl said on Monday. “It’s like trying to replace the military with a bunch of guards protecting individual buildings.”      Read more: How a Crypto Guru Shaped Harvard’s Roadmap for Reopening the US Economy      The key, he continued, is distribution mechanisms that come from pre-determined, historic hierarchies, aka structural bias. Together, the charismatic economist and crypto pioneer joined forces to argue in favor of quadratic funding and Ethereum governance, which Herzog compared to opportunities for American legal reform.      In short, quadratic funding means a certain amount of money is committed to a cause or project then future donors can vote on how money is spent while increasing or matching funds. The donor engagement vehicle is seen as a way to encourage online donations.      For example, Weyl said, a government or philanthropist can match smaller donations, or eventually even an automated smart-contract managing funds. (CoinDesk experimented with quadratic funding during Consensus: Distributed, raising more than $107,000 for COVID-19 charity efforts.)    Growing adoption    Buterin said he was interested in ideas like socialism, libertarianism and bitcoin, which initially inspired his continued work on Ethereum.      While he remains an active member of the bitcoin community, Buterin said he is moving Ethereum away from proof-of-work (PoW) mining to reduce the environmental harms of electricity consumption. Ethereum critics would argue there are environmentally friendly ways to mine bitcoin. Either way, the Ethereum creator uses both bitcoin and ether tokens as part of his activism. He’s experimented with quadratic funding, both academically and diplomatically.      See also: The Unsolved Mystery of How to Fund Public Protocols      Buterin’s Ethereum Foundation donated $150,000 to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in 2019. During the broadcast on Monday, Buterin said he’s fascinated with the quintessential question of politics: “how to fund public goods.” So far, the UNICEF donation is one such answer.      As for Herzog, he asked the crypto pioneer to recommend a “path forward” in the “context of liberal democracy.” Regardless of whether Herzog wins a congressional seat in New York, Buterin’s political influence doesn’t appear to be fading any time soon.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/10/this-political-conversation-with-vitalik-buterin-shows-how-ethereum-could-change-the-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00b773babe1f9d1a45457c8e14bfabbfb5f11caa-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432055,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9Hfh,1591801226,Russia's Economy Ministry Calls for 'Controllable Market' Rather Than Crypto Ban,"The Russian economy ministry is pushing back against the nation's planned ban on cryptocurrency.      In a letter to the country’s parliament, the nation's Ministry of Economic Development criticized a package of draft bills recently introduced by lawmakers. If passed, Russia would at last have its first regulatory regime for crypto and digital assets – but would also effectively ban any businesses facilitating crypto transactions.      According to the Russian newspaper Kommersant, which obtained the letter, the ministry points out that people will still be able to buy crypto assets elsewhere, but the current version of the bills would not allow the government to protect their rights. Crypto-oriented businesses would also be driven outside of the country, harming the economy.      Instead, the new rules should take a different approach and work on creating a “controllable cryptocurrency market” in Russia, the ministry argues, according to the report.      The regulatory landscape around cryptocurrency has been quickly shifting across the world in the last year, with authorities and regulators paying closer attention to the industry, and the industry looking for ways to comply (or occasionally not). Yet, while Russia is a significant crypto market and the motherland of many blockchain developers, it has opted for an ultra-conservative approach, led by the country’s central bank.      The more conciliatory stance on cryptocurrency from a government ministry, however, might be a sign Russia could yet tone down its hostile approach, which recently led to a loud outcry from the local crypto industry.    'Marijuana treatment'    The draft legislation, introduced in late May as a supplement to the previous bill on digital assets, deems illegal any activities facilitating the issuance of, and operations with, virtual currencies and if Russian servers or websites registered by Russian providers are used.      This includes purchasing crypto for fiat currency and accepting it as a payment. However, owning crypto is legal if it’s inherited, transferred as a result of bankruptcy proceedings or seized as a result of a court decision. Also included is the potential to issue digital securities, but that must be done under the full control of the central bank.      “The Bank of Russia does not understand how to control crypto. Rule number one: if you can’t control something, ban it,” a source in the cryptocurrency mining industry, who participated in the working group drafting the bill and asked not to be named, told CoinDesk.      For many crypto businesses, the bills would not actually change much, the source added, as even now, exchanges and over-the-counter services with Russian origins prefer to register in other jurisdictions. And large amounts of cryptocurrency in the country are often purchased for cash.      Sarkis Darbinyan, an IT-focused attorney at Moscow-based law firm the Digital Rights Center, believes that if the law is passed inits current form, cryptocurrency in Russia is going to go from the grey zone “into the darkness of the digital underground.”      “In fact, bitcoin gets the same status as marijuana. You can use it in a limited fashion under the close eye of the state, but can’t talk or write about it,” Darbinyan said.      Under the draft law, he continued, crypto owners would have to report their holdings for tax purposes, and that information would be readily available for the country’s law enforcement agencies. “In the Russian reality, only a crazy person would choose to keep the police posted about the state of their crypto accounts,” Darbinyan said.    Threat to miners    The proposed regulation looks problematic for Russia's crypto miners, too. While mining is not explicitly mentioned in the draft, the draft bills' ban on the digital asset “issuance” is likely to cover the sector.      “This draft has been in the works for three years. We suggested some options to legalize crypto mining back in 2019 that was a lot of work, but it all got thrown out the window,” the industry source said,. The mining industry in Russia is yet not big enough to have strong lobbyists to help push their case, they added.      Compounding matters, miners can’t be as nimble as over-the-counter brokers in shifting to other jurisdictions because relocating a building full of mining machines is a much greater logistical problem than moving an office.      However, bigger mining entities in Russia, which tend to keep their businesses secret, might have a quick and easy fix for their pending legal troubles. “You register a company abroad, say, in Hong Kong. This company puts the miners in a data center in Russia, and the Russia-registered company is not issuing crypto,” the source said.      But not everyone can afford such tricks, and small miners may be forced to close or operate illegally. “Everyone who has less than $50,000 worth of mining equipment will be swept out of the market into the black – not even grey – zone,” they warned.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/10/russias-economy-ministry-calls-for-controllable-market-rather-than-crypto-ban,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2e7fa5c5cbaace5f82d2e62dda86a6f052a1351-1500x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432050,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9HVh,1591801208,Algorand and Blockstack Are Building a Multi-Chain Smart Contract Language,"Algorand and Blockstack are collaborating on a new smart contract programming language that moves the two startups toward direct, inter-blockchain communications.      Called Clarity, the project will ultimately allow developers to write smart contracts that execute across their two blockchains – and others that might decide to join the open source initiative – without involving third-party interoperability protocols like Polkadot, executives at both companies told CoinDesk.      The potential for direct inter-chain communications is likely as boundless as the ideas of the developers deploying smart contracts across the two very different platforms. Algorand’s proof-of-stake blockchain often caters to financial use cases, while Blockstack’s upcoming Stacks 2.0 “proof-of-transfer” blockchain looks more broadly at decentralized computing.      “We believe it's a multi-chain world,” said Steve Kokinos, chief executive at Algorand. “People are going to use different chains for different purposes and interoperability is going to be critical.”    Less-buggy smart contracts    Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali said it was the similarity of his and Algorand’s smart contract design philosophies that brought them together.      “We were already looking at the same properties,” Ali said.      Both are acutely interested in deploying “non-Turing complete” languages. Algorand 2.0’s TEAL smart contract language is non-Turing complete, as is Blockstack’s eponymous Clarity, already planned to debut on Stacks 2.0. Ali estimated the two languages had “80-90%” in common at the outset.      Non-Turing completeness means, in part, that a language’s programs cannot in theory run forever – and that, in practice, means its programs are somewhat more restrictive than ones written in a Turing-complete language.      But non-Turing complete languages are also far less prone to bugs than their computationally complete brethren because of that same property. Their smart contracts don’t need to be manually audited, Ali said.      Read more: Who Will Pay for Turing-Complete Smart Contracts?      “Everything can be precise, everything can be verified,” Ali said, contrasting Clarity with potentially error-prone alternative languages that could put “hundreds of millions of dollars” of smart contract user funds at risk.      The infamous DAO hack is perhaps the best-known example of the potential perils of buggy smart contracts written in a Turing-complete language. That 2016 heist cost users $50 million in ether, all because of a bug.      “The number question for these smart contracts is actually just: Are they precise and secure?’ So the language has to be just focused on that, which is what we have done here,” Ali said.      Kokinos said Clarity provides a “philosophically different approach to smart contracts.”      Clarity will also make for simpler developer experiences, he said. “We’re providing people tools to make it less necessary for them to learn a lot about how the blockchain works and about the underlying parts of the system and just enable people to get their work done.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | DOT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/10/algorand-and-blockstack-are-building-a-multi-chain-smart-contract-language,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd400b802423866fb6d1efc774fa3280e6af6de0-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432056,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9Hhh,1591798284,Sequoia-Backed Band Protocol Creeps Onto Chainlink’s Turf With Oracle Product,"Another sprinter has entered the cryptocurrency oracle race, this one backed by Sequoia Capital and Binance.      Band Protocol 2.0 launched Wednesday with its mainnet oracle solution, BandChain, leveraging the Cosmos SDK, according to a release from the firm. The project’s revamp comes 10 months after listing as an initial exchange offering (IEO) on Binance Launchpad and a $3 million 2019 seed round led by Sequoia India.      “Band Protocol is launching at a momentous time with the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol stabilizing,” Zaki Manian, director of Tendermint Labs, said in a statement. “There will soon be a network of chains who can take advantage of the flexible data script and real-time data requests enabled on the BandChain mainnet.”      The technical ability to place real-world data onto a blockchain network is alluring though still very much in question. To date, Chainlink has dominated the oracle space, nabbing integrations with scores of crypto projects, but others are rushing in with competing visions.      Read more: Sequoia-Backed Startup Enters DeFi Market With Bitcoin Binary Options      Initially run on the Ethereum blockchain, Band Protocol built out its own blockchain on Cosmos technology to sidestep congestion concerns, co-founder and CEO Soravis Srinawakoon told CoinDesk in an interview.      As previously reported by CoinDesk, Band Protocol first launched in 2017 with the intention of tackling, among other things, “fake news” through a tokenized oracle platform. The Thailand-based team also launched a decentralized trading app, BitSwing, in October 2019.      The firm’s new offering, BandChain, will launch in three successive stages including the on-boarding of community, professional and ecosystem partners as validators, the release states.      Decentralized price feeds provide information by querying multiple off- and on-chain sources such as, in BandChain’s case, a Bloomberg price feed. Data accuracy is assured by validators staking the network token, BAND, as collateral.      Data pulled from on-chain sources has its drawbacks, however.    The oracle race    Blockchains are notoriously slow and are prone to transaction bottlenecking when multiple users are competing to execute transactions at the same time. For products depending on oracle solutions, the problem is compounded: decentralized applications (dapps) are dependent on oracles to execute transactions which are then dependent on the underlying blockchain.      If that blockchain cannot execute the order for the oracle, then dapps cannot execute their transactions either. This most recently came to a head on March 12’s “Black Thursday,” where overwhelming sell pressure from the plummeting price of ether (ETH) caused a cascade of technical failures, including momentary operational lapses for both Maker’s V2 oracles and Chainlink.      Read more: Thursday’s Market Madness Strained Ethereum’s Killer App: DeFi      Srinawakoon said Cosmos’ underlying tech prevents on-chain congestion – and therefore transaction failure – by grouping transactions together in a way Ethereum cannot currently do.      The team chose to build on Cosmos over Polkadot, another interoperability project, because Polkadot has yet to fully launch, as well as perceived costs, Srinawakoon said.      “For Polkadot, you don’t have to spin your own chain. So there’s a benefit, but the drawback is it’s quite expensive for any blocks to happen because you can think of it as [if] you need to rent a space on top of Polkadot,” Srinawakoon said.      BandChain is focused on multiple products outside of decentralized finance (DeFi) as well, Srinawakoon said, including stock and commodity prices, verifiable random number generation and sports betting, the firm said.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | LINK | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/10/sequoia-backed-band-protocol-creeps-onto-chainlinks-turf-with-oracle-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b604a133ebae1c78121c0340d4e83bb3e70aa41b-1500x1071.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432058,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9Hnh,1591794513,Bitcoin Doesn’t Take Sides: Why Apolitical Solutions Are the Internet's Future,"Preston Byrne, a columnist for CoinDesk’s Opinion section, is a partner in Anderson Kill’s Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies. His biweekly column, “Not Legal Advice,” is a roundup of pertinent legal topics in the crypto space. It is most definitely not legal advice.      Irrespective of what “side” one takes in the many-front culture war raging on keyboards at the moment, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that a “reign of terror” vibe is sweeping the Western world. This is a continuation of a theme familiar to anyone who has followed the internet culture wars of the last few years. Anyone who has followed GamerGate, or the mass de-platforming of Alex Jones and Live Action, or the YouTube AdPocalypse, or the partisan advertiser boycotts of Breitbart and Fox News, or the rollout of social credit scoring in China, and many, many more individual cases, will be familiar with the battlefield and the terminology.      See also: Robert Greenfield - The Crypto Community Needs to Stand Up and Fight Racism      This fight is framed as a ferocious struggle for “control” of the internet and society. Only now, rather than manning barricades and mobilizing minutemen, we sit at our computers screaming ferociously into the void where everyone loses precious time and energy. Everyone, that is, except online political grifters and social media companies, the latter of which use algorithmically driven fury to compete for eyeballs and a dwindling pool of advertising dollars.      Those who have not been paying attention may have difficulty figuring out exactly what the landscape looks like or how they need to adjust. “Censorship” is a spectrum of behaviors meant to suppress ideas by a range of players. Historically, this meant the repression of ideas at the hands of either state or quasi-state, often ecclesiastical, actors. Socrates was killed for encouraging young people to ask uncomfortable questions. Galileo spent the last days of his life under house arrest for daring to question the accepted wisdom that the Earth did not revolve around the sun. William Prynne was branded by the Star Chamber for daring to utter seditious libels in England. And so it went.      The legal system of the United States was designed, in part, to render forever impossible such prosecutions. It is why our First Amendment exists and has been interpreted by our courts to protect a wide range of speech, including advocacy of violent insurrection, from state interference.      The First Amendment worked well, for a time. With the advent of the internet, publishers were granted broad immunities from liability for user-generated content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, presumably with the goal of ensuring that information flowed freely online.      In Western democracies, groups wielding political power are usually found in three different forms. The first is the state, for obvious and longstanding reasons. The second are corporations, for equally obvious and longstanding reasons. The third is the mob.      The mob used to be a fairly short-term phenomenon. Social media changes this. Its power to create and share is equaled only by its immense capacity to destroy. Balaji Srinivasan refers to this phenomenon as a “Rage Epidemic” where “mind viruses” burn through the digital hordes, directing their victims towards their hapless targets in an exponential fashion until the target either capitulates, is banned or suspended from a platform, or dies/is destroyed. Whether it be buildings in American cities, statues of historical figures including Gandhi and Lincoln being defaced in central London, or the summary termination of star soccer player Aleksandar Katai by the L.A. Galaxy club for the impertinent opinions of his wife, the mob is selecting its targets, broadcasting those targets and coordinating attacks on those targets through the use of social media.    Companies that build politics-free solutions will be the future of the internet. Not because such products have the right opinions about their users, but because they have no opinions at all.    Combined with the fecklessness of corporations and (in most cases) lack of strong civil rights protections afforded by the American state, mobs on social media have the capacity to hijack our societies and coordinate themselves to direct the energies of these larger entities onto individual citizens one-by-one based on the adoption of mainstream political views that a given mob opposes. Candace Owens was booted from GoFundMe last week; an advertiser boycott is being organized against Tucker Carlson as I write this article (June 9). I refer to the interaction between these three sources of censorship as the “tripartite model of internet censorship,” detailed in the chart above.      Today’s digital mobs tend to have one set of beliefs. If history is a guide, there is every reason to believe that tomorrow’s digital mobs might have other, more evil but nonetheless widely accepted, beliefs. Mobs are the antithesis of due process and careful deliberation. Mobs are not good, no matter who is in them.      With this as our background, I am often asked what role I believe Bitcoin will fulfill in our future. Some people say it is digital cash. Others say digital land. Still others say digital gold.      See also: Preston Byrne - How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive      I say Bitcoin is digital no-fucks-given.      The infusion of politics into everyday life – the requirement for every company to take a partisan stance on every issue – is set to become more commonplace, and not less. This is a business distraction of immense proportions. It will likely soon become impossible to post anything controversial online under one’s own name. It may become difficult for controversial political figures to transact financially under their own names. As platform and content bans increase, seemingly daily, by November it may become difficult to find business and communications systems that do not have some kind of ongoing ideological purity monitoring that is a prerequisite to continued use.      In a world where everyone is taking sides, it’s important to remember that each of us has only one life. We don’t owe anyone our allegiance, attention or time. In the United States, nobody is legally entitled to draw adverse inferences from silence; the same is true politically. There’s nothing wrong with avoiding the dystopian digital hellscape of the culture wars. It is perfectly fine, even healthy, to avoid the fighting and pursue only what matters to you.      Making the internet safe for individuals again, in my view, is the most compelling use case for Bitcoin and every other cryptographic method or technology.

Previously he was head of Social Impact & Diversity Programming at ConsenSys.      Here we are again. Another unarmed, defenseless black man killed by the police.      Another wave of protests against police brutality and systemic racism.      Another wave of actionless, apologetic cries, willfully ignorant excuses and political re-directs about the real problem.      Since the 2012 lynching of Trayvon Martin, we have been in a cycle of videoed black murder porn, criminal immunity and corporate cowardice. In America today, being black can get you killed for driving, jogging, sleeping, yelling, parking, babysitting, sitting in a van, selling CDs, even eating ice cream in your own house.      See also: Preston Byrne - Bitcoin Doesn’t Take Sides: Why Apolitical Solutions Are the Internet’s Future      This is not because black people are more “prone to criminality.” Rather, criminal activity is a complex socioeconomic phenomenon proven to be closely related to poverty. The rate of violence is actually higher among poor, urban whites. And “black on black crime” is not out of control. Most victims of crime personally know their assailants. While this is a truth across racial boundaries, no one ever talks about “white on white crime.”      It is because black Americans are 2.5 times more likely than whites to be killed by police. It is because the U.S. has been built on institutionalized racism, using slavery to build the global economy to institute oppressive policing policies via the “War on Drugs” and “War on Crime.” It is because major companies, government institutions and influential people rarely speak up and actively support systemic change.      These protests are combating the unarmed murder of innocent black men, women and children. We are asking to be able to live – not asking to vote Democrat or Republican. We are asking for equality, equity and justice.    Misunderstanding racism    Responses to the #BlackLivesMatter protests have followed a familiar refrain. Some have taken the “diversity is already solved” position. Yet, in a “post-Obama” era, black employees make up only 3% of Google, 6% of Apple and 3.8% of Facebook’s respective workforces. The blockchain and crypto ecosystem inherited a lack of diversity from legacy tech, from hiring to funding founders of color and highlighting black and brown voices in conferences and press. Even so, there has been a market-wide unwillingness to publish diversity reports and open investor networks.      What about the distribution of cryptocurrency ownership? Though there have been few studies, we do know the majority of Bitcoin and Ethereum nodes operate in regions such as the U.S. and Europe. If we look at crypto exchanges, many are quick to equate international trading volumes as a mark for success in diversity, obscuring the way large holders could easily be responsible for an entire country’s cryptocurrency trading volume, given the nascent state of the market.    The crypto community is conveniently selective about what aspects of society it wants to change.    Even more disturbing reactions to the current #BlackLivesMatter movement have come from well-followed individuals in the space such as Nick Szabo, who has readily retweeted positions in the victim-blaming camp for George Floyd’s fate. Worse, Szabo has retweeted threads claiming black intellectual inferiority, such as this one.      The crypto community is conveniently selective about what aspects of society it wants to change. Many libertarians were drawn to the ideas of disintermediating government and financial centers of power. In the face of the current president of the U.S. using tear gas against protesters and sending in unmarked security officers in riot gear, many of these same libertarians have been very quiet about this profound display of fascist overreach.      The truth is most major blockchain companies and crypto personalities refuse to publicly stand in solidarity against police brutality and racism, fearing the retribution of white supremacist trolls more than valuing the lives of their black colleagues, friends and employees. The issue of “black lives matter” is treated as a subjective and politically divisive topic rather than a well-documented and well-researched fact of American history. It shouldn’t be controversial that efforts to improve diversity and inclusion in corporate executive teams can result in up to 30% more profitability.      At this point, even executives at the highest levels of Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase, organizations that Bitcoin and Ethereum maximalists incessantly demonize, have come out in solidarity. If they can risk that much business I think crypto startups, many that do not serve white supremacist consumers, can take a risk, too.    Where is the crypto community now?    As someone passionate about blockchain technology, it has been increasingly difficult to ignore the cultural hypocrisy in our ecosystem. Crypto community members of color have had a constant internal battle as to whether or not we should even address this issue, many of us choosing to leave blockchain altogether instead. I have personally wondered:      Why isn’t the work of people of color highlighted at conferences and in the press? Why don’t we see more people like myself at these crypto startups? Why is there so much nepotism masquerading as meritocratic hires under the guise of ""We only hire those that are qualified""? Why is it there are so few women of color in the ""women in blockchain"" events and leadership talks?      What would happen if I spoke out? Would there be retribution? Would I be labeled as the ""angry black guy"" of crypto? Am I selling out by not bringing these issues to the forefront?      Many of you can identify with these questions, each representing a small, frustrating moment pre-empting a larger, more important question, “Why does nobody seem to care?”    Since the 2012 lynching of Trayvon Martin, we have been in a cycle of videoed black murder porn, criminal immunity and corporate cowardice.    We have heard nothing from the Ethereum Foundation, which continues to espouse the desire to support global adoption and operate under a subtractive mindset. How can you say ‘fight for change’ at Devcon but not take that same action yourselves? Why has the Hypeledger community via the Linux Foundation taken a stand, but you cannot?      We have heard nothing from the Libra Association, whose mission it is to provide people everywhere access to affordable financial services. Is positively impacting people of color not a part of your goal for financial inclusion?      We have heard nothing from the Web3 Foundation, whose mission it is to nurture cutting-edge applications for decentralized web software protocols. Are we to believe all the applications needed to make real change in the world won’t need essential contributions from people of color?      We have heard little from Coinbase (not just Brian Armstrong), whose mission it is to build an open financial system and increase the amount of economic freedom in the world. Are black and brown lives not a part of that world they seek to change?      We have heard nothing from the Maker Foundation, a direct beneficiary of increased awareness of the world’s first cryptocurrency-backed cash assistance program. (Project Unblocked Cash, co-led by Sandra Hart and myself leveraged dai in communities in the Asia Pacific.)      In fact, we’ve heard and seen the opposite. I have seen crypto layoffs nearly eliminate the entire black employee community of multiple organizations. I have seen and heard of disastrous “all hands meetings” at many of the world’s largest crypto companies where executive teams fumble over the decision to simply tweet “Black Lives Matter” and ignore the voices of even their white employees pleading to make a change. I have heard that employees have had to fight company leadership just to put out a post on social media in support, even through the veil of performance activism.      This is not to say I don't greatly admire each of these organizations; it is to say I admire them so much I expect them to do better.    #CryptoForChange    If the crypto community wants to truly use this moment to change, it needs to recognize the problem first and pledge actionable ways to correct it. Thus, I have created a #CryptoForChange Pledge to motivate our community to stand in solidarity against police brutality and systemic racism.      Leading blockchain organizations have already agreed to take a stand, including Althea, Gitcoin, cLabs (Celo), The Giving Block, Sempo, Amentum and Storj – many of them led by people of color. In fact, The Giving Block has gone one step further and waived all monthly subscription fees for civil rights-related nonprofits as a part of the #CryptoForChange campaign.      The pledge, which you can find here, is a promise to the community that you will take substantive action against police brutality and systemic racism as a member of the crypto community. Actions must be taken in the next 90 days for companies and 30 days for individuals. I know we all want the best for our communities, and we’d love for blockchain technology to serve as a mass-adopted tool to realize such change. To do so, we need to actually put in the work.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Robert Greenfield,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/10/the-crypto-community-needs-to-stand-up-and-fight-racism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3af1812963f31cb3407b188241e5accc30ac3279-1780x1424.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432064,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9Hxh,1591792729,"First Mover: Bitcoin Bulls Might Get Negative Rates From Central Banks, Just Not the Fed","As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell steers U.S. monetary policymakers away from negative interest rates, he risks becoming increasingly isolated among the world's top central bankers.      Officials in the U.K., Europe and New Zealand are reportedly considering the once-unthinkable strategy of pushing interest rates below zero, seen as a form of economic stimulus. And bitcoin might be a beneficiary of looser monetary policy outside the U.S., even if the Fed never joins its foreign counterparts.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The divergence over the issue shows just how challenged central bankers are as they struggle to find consistent strategies for healing economies devastated by the coronavirus and related lockdowns. The World Bank on Monday forecast global output will tumble by 5.2% this year, the worst recession since World War II.      With the situation so dire, more central bankers are willing to consider negative interest rates, which encourage people to spend money by making it more costly to deposit money in a bank account, as a viable monetary-policy tool. U.S. President Donald Trump joined the chorus last month, tweeting that ""as long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the 'GIFT.'""      It’s unlikely Powell will change his tune now with Federal Reserve policymakers scheduled on Wednesday to announce the outcome of this week's two-day, closed-door meeting. So far, the Fed's response to economic crisis has been to cut interest rates to zero, roll out emergency lending programs and inject trillions of dollars of new money into the financial system via asset purchases.      As recently as last month Powell said top Fed officials ""do not see negative policy rates as likely to be an appropriate policy response here in the U.S.""      Bitcoin prices do appear to have risen in sync with this year's announcements of new stimulus measures. According to the cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital, bitcoin began to “flirt” with the psychological $10,000 price threshold last week as the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan ramped up their asset-purchasing programs by a combined $1.5 trillion.      And now the drumbeats are starting for negative rates.      Last month, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey raised hackles when he told a parliamentary select committee that negative interest rates were under “active review” for the very first time in the bank’s 324-year history. The week before, he had explicitly ruled out the possibility.      The U.K. central bank already has cut its base interest rate to a record low of 0.1%.      Then there's the European Central Bank, led by President Christine Lagarde, which opted last week to expand its stimulus measures by 600 billion euros.      But central bank analysts still forecast an 8.5% contraction in the euro area this year, and ECB board member Isabel Schnabel said Tuesday that cutting rates below zero ""remains an option.""      ""Our experience with negative interest rates has been positive,"" the German economist said in a Twitter Q&A, according to Reuters.      The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said last month that negative rates could ""become an option in future,” possibly as early 2021.      Central banks' dalliances with negative interest rates in the mid-2010s didn't seem to affect bitcoin's price. But the digital asset has grown since then, with a market capitalization that's roughly 20 times where it stood when the ECB went negative in 2014.      And while analysts in the past claimed that bitcoin was uncorrelated with most traditional assets, recent price action has shown an increasing connection between the cryptocurrency and broader economic and market developments.      Bitcoin is now increasingly regarded as a hedge against inflation, and negative rates represent an aggressive form of monetary-policy easing that could ultimately help to push up consumer prices.      Another school of thought says that if banks try to set deposit rates at negative levels, many customers would just pull their money out to avoid charges. Rather than keeping cash under the mattress, some might instead decide to store the value as bitcoin in a digital wallet.      More broadly, negative rates might simply highlight how experimental monetary policymaking has become in the coronavirus era, Stack Funds, a bitcoin index provider, wrote in a report last month.      “By being in bitcoin, you’re opting into transparency,"" Lewis Harland, founder of analytics site Formal Verification, told CoinDesk.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,759 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,838 | 24-Hr Low: $9,637      Trend: Bitcoin has rallied by nearly 150% in the last three months, but a long-term bullish breakout is yet to arrive.      That's because the cryptocurrency is still contained within a 2.5-year long descending triangle represented by trendlines connecting the December 2017 and July 2019 highs and the December 2018 and March 2020 lows.      According to the weekly chart, the triangle resistance (upper edge) is currently located at $10,260. A weekly close Sunday (midnight UTC) above that level would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open the doors for a rally to $20,000 by the year's end.      Bloomberg analysts expect the cryptocurrency to challenge record highs this year on the back of increased institutional participation and rise in haven demand.      While $10,260 is the level to beat for the bulls, the June 2 low of $9,136 is key support currently. A breach there would invalidate a bullish lower-highs setup on the daily chart. Acceptance under $9,136 would likely yield a deeper decline to $8,630 (May 25 low).      The bearish divergence of the three-day chart's relative strength index (RSI) suggests scope for a drop to $9,136.

But over the past two days, an unknown wallet holder has paid some $5.2 million in transaction fees for two ether transactions.      Just before 10:00 UTC Wednesday, an unknown wallet holder sent 0.55 ether (ETH) (around $133) with a 10,666 ETH transaction fee – currently worth just under $2.6 million.      The fee went to Chinese mining group Spark Pool, which processed the transaction and may distribute the millions to its members. A normal transaction fee would likely be up to $0.50 or so, but can be manually set higher by a sender if they want to push a transaction through more quickly.      Around 4:00 UTC Thursday, the same address sent out another 350 ether (ETH) with another 10,668 ETH – worth $2.6 million – in transaction fees. The block was mined by the Ethermine pool.      The identities of both the sender and receiver are not yet known. But the sender has an ETH wallet balance worth more than $11 million – even after spending $2.6 million in transaction fees. In comparison, the receiver's wallet is now empty, with past funds transferred out to other wallets.      Strangely, the sender's wallet has been sending out transactions every minute in recent hours and with attached fees worth less than a dollar. As such, it's possible the whale accidentally reversed the figures for this odd transaction.      See also: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Decline as Network Congestion Eases      This isn't the first time Spark Pool has been on the receiving end of a transaction fee windfall.      Last year, the company froze a mysterious 2,100 ETH payment (then worth $300,000) it made for mining just one block – 600 times the average block reward at the time. After tracking down the sender, a South Korean blockchain firm, Spark Pool agreed to split the reward 50/50.      Regarding this latest transaction, a Spark Pool spokesperson told CoinDesk it was following up and welcomed any potential leads about the identity of the sender just ""in case it was sent by mistake.""      Following the publication of this article on June 10, the spokesperson said it had frozen the payout to miners in its pool.

42432063,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9Hvh,1591790110,Another Data Point Suggests Bitcoin Close to Prolonged Bull Market,"Bitcoin could be on the verge of breaking into a multi-month bull run, according to a lesser-known data metric.      The percentage of bitcoin’s circulating supply in profit is currently hovering at 87%, according to data provided by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The metric is calculated by looking at the ratio of coins with a value that is higher now than when they were last moved.      Essentially, over 16 million BTC out of the total circulating supply of 18.4 million is currently making gains. More importantly, the 87% level is close to that seen at the onset of the previous long-term bull markets.      “Historically, levels of 90% and higher have clearly marked pronounced bull markets,” noted Glassnode in its weekly insights report.      For instance, the percentage of circulating supply in profit rose above 90% in October 2016 as the cryptocurrency rallied from the August low of $470 up to record highs above $1,100 in the first quarter of 2017.      Bitcoin continued to gain altitude and ultimately reached a record high of $20,000 in December 2017. Throughout the meteoric rally, the non-price metric hovered largely in the range of 80 to 99%.      Looking further back, the percentage of supply in profit crossed well above 90% in January 2013 and remained above that level for three months as bitcoin rose to clock highs near $250 in mid-April. A similar pattern was seen as prices rose to record highs above $1,000 in mid-November the same year.      So, if history is a guide, bitcoin may embark on a stellar bull run if and when the percentage of supply in profit rises above 90%.      Bitcoin will likely cross that key level if prices rise above $10,000, reinforcing the argument put forward by analysts that $10,000 is the level to beat for the bulls.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,740, marginally down on the day. The cryptocurrency has rallied by nearly 150% over the past three months, lifting the percent supply in profit from 43% to 87%.      The metric may be of help in identifying major price tops and bottoms. In the past, readings near 40% have marked bear market bottoms, while highs above 95% have coincided with market tops.

Brian Brooks, who was the cryptocurrency exchange's chief legal officer from late 2018 until last month, sold his stock options to become interim head at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) – a 3,600-person bureau in the U.S. Treasury Department.      Financial disclosures seen by Bloomberg show Brooks sold $4.6 million stock options in Coinbase, earned on top of a $1.4 million salary, to take up his new role as acting comptroller – a position that earns less than $300,000 a year.      Brooks had joined the OCC back in March as chief operating officer and first deputy controller, but assumed the position of acting comptroller following the sudden departure of his predecessor, Joseph Otting, halfway through a five-year term, in May.      Brooks was confirmed as acting comptroller on May 29.      See also: ‘Inherently Borderless’: Acting OCC Chief Talks Crypto, State Licenses and DeFi      The OCC's primary role is to maintain the integrity of the U.S. banking system, encourage greater competition and innovation as well as ensuring full regulatory compliance.      In the past, the OCC has been accused of becoming too cozy with the financial institutions it is supposed to watch over. In late 2017, in his second week in the job, Otting scrapped longstanding plans to move hundreds of OCC staff out of the Manhattan offices of JPMorgan, Citigroup and other large-scale lenders. At the time, he said the move was ""not practical.""      In his inaugural statement, Brooks said he planned to foster innovation in the banking sector: ""We should support banks’ use of new technology, products, and models that safely and fairly accelerate the velocity of money, create greater financial inclusion, and empower consumers and businesses with more control over their financial affairs.""      See also: US Bank Regulator OCC Asks for Public Input on Cryptocurrency Use in Financial Sector      In an interview with CoinDesk, Brooks went further: “My job here is not to protect incumbents, and it’s not to preserve the status quo...The job I have is to make sure that the bank charter’s flexible enough to maintain a safe, sound, strong American economy and the shape of banking has to be flexible to accommodate.”      As he is only acting comptroller, Brooks doesn't yet face the same ethics restrictions he would if he led the regulator permanently. Still, he has assured the OCC's ethics department he will stay away from any investments that could present any conflict of interest, which include tech firms such as Amazon and Coinbase.      See also: Capitol Controls: From Coinbase to the OCC, How Brian Brooks Is Changing Regulation      In a letter, Sunday, U.S. senator and former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren urged Brooks to undo some of the actions from the previous OCC administration which, she said, had been ""tainted by Comptroller Otting’s own conflicts of interest.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/10/coinbases-ex-lead-lawyer-sold-46m-in-stock-to-head-us-banking-watchdog,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21aad3e4da93c10808bc786aeb18dfb9dd091d68-1378x688.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432054,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9HZh,1591783223,Libra Is Ready for the Digital Money 'Space Race': Dante Disparte,"The first Libra white paper published in June 2019 had the temerity to threaten the monetary authority of central banks and governments. The empire struck back.      That’s why an updated white paper from April 2020 has taken a belt and braces approach to regulatory compliance, said Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications at the Libra Association. The new technical document comes replete with buttoned-up hires and a pending payments license through the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).      Libra’s watering-down of its global stablecoin to a series of fiat-backed stablecoins has prompted some commentators to say the project has lost its soul. Meanwhile, Libra has been written off by crypto purists (who didn’t like it anyway) and there is at least one U.S. lawmaker calling Libra’s revamp insufficient.      Whatever you thought of the “unfortunate” positioning of Libra’s first white paper, as Disparte put it, the effort undoubtedly triggered a “space race,” he said, particularly regarding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).      And a world where 70% of central banks are exploring CBDCs presents an opportunity, he said.      “When they [central banks] take the leap beyond wholesale, which is where most CBDC work is going, and start thinking about retail applications, then we will be in a better world for the fact networks like Libra exist,” Disparte told CoinDesk in a recent interview.      According to the updated white paper, Libra hopes that “these CBDCs could be directly integrated with the Libra Network, removing the need for Libra Networks to manage the associated Reserves, thus reducing credit and custody risk.”      Read more: Libra Scales Back Global Currency Ambitions in Concession to Regulators      Further down the road, it would be possible to offer the central bank of Ghana, for example, a way of “creating a cross-chain trading window between you and the currency you issue, and user-level applications that are interoperable,” Disparte said.      As well as shaking up central banks, Libra has spawned some direct competitors such as the Andreessen Horowitz-backed Celo Alliance and the Google- and Gates Foundation-backed Mojaloop Foundation, which aims to interconnect privately siloed forms of mobile money such as M-Pesa in Sub-Saharan Africa and India.      But the elephant in the room is China, said Disparte, where WeChat Pay, Alipay and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) digital payments efforts are serving hundreds of millions of users.      In this particular race, Libra appears to be extending its hand to the U.S. and offering a way to get a CBDC into the hands of consumers.      “You can be NASA, [Libra is] telling the Federal Reserve, and we’ll be the Space-X of money,” is how author and digital money expert Dave Birch put it in a recent article.      “I think there would be nothing better for the world and for poverty alleviation if, in fact, we started to trigger a bit of a space race on compliance to address the 1.7 billion people who are unbanked and underbanked,” Disparate said. “So from my point of view, there is no monopoly on this work. Let others enter this process and let the race begin.”    Unfazed    Cynics have scoffed at Libra’s stated mission to help the planet’s unbanked population.      But one-size-fits-all compliance regimes that can inadvertently shut people out of the financial system – and regulatory dead zones where users lack verifiable identities to pass know-your-customer (KYC) checks – is where Libra is taking its fight now.      In such cases, every inch gained helps “expand the perimeter of the formal economy,” said Kiva Chief Strategy Officer Matthew Davie. (Davie is on the board of Libra and Kiva is one of the Libra Association’s founding social-impact partners.)      However, the first phase of Libra’s rollout, which commences in Q4 of this year, Disparate said, will require permission to join the network instead of it being open and relying solely on monitoring, as was promised in last year’s plans. In other words, the phase 1 will not move the needle on reaching the unbanked.      The first phase will be closely tied to the licensing of crypto companies in regulated jurisdictions such as the U.S., Europe and Singapore, and will also apply the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations for regulated virtual asset service providers (VASPs) involving things like the “Travel Rule.”      But Libra knows financial inclusion can only really start to be driven by phase 2, at which time the network will start adding so-called “unhosted wallets,” not connected to regulated VASPs or in countries where that option is not available.      Libra could not say exactly when the second phase is expected to begin, but allowing unhosted wallets to create accounts directly on the network is “something the project feels very strongly about from a financial inclusion perspective,” said Mandeep Walia, chief compliance officer of Novi, the Facebook subsidiary formerly known as Calibra.      Read more: Facebook’s Calibra Rebrands to Novi, Details Wallet Tie-Up With WhatsApp      “Obviously, there is a certain risk associated with that if there is no KYC done and no real compliance happening directly on that particular account,” said Walia. “There are other controls we have been talking about, such as creating some kind of a protocol-level automated balance limit/transaction limit so that damage from any potential bad activity is relatively mitigated.”      The FATF Travel Rule’s $1,000 threshold on transactions could be a starting point for discussions around setting a ceiling for limits, and Libra has some ideas in mind, said Disparte, but at the end of the day, the Association is not the rule maker, he added.      In an interview with CoinDesk, Tom Neylan, FATF’s senior policy analyst, said the AML watchdog was open to talking with Libra about tiered customer due diligence, which would include things like limited accounts, where users can transact a certain amount of business in a certain period.      “If you think about the average remittance outflow from many countries around the world, it’s a low amount even on an annualized basis,” said Disparte.      On the subject of connectivity between participants on the Libra network and users of Facebook services like WhatsApp with its end-to-end encryption, Walia said Novi users will have to perform a standalone KYC check.      “We are having conversations, data field by data field, with those teams to make sure that we are clear regarding what the stance will be for each of the requirements on both sides,” he said.      In addition, Libra will operate financial intelligence units using the capabilities of firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic and a range of tools looking at IP addresses, geo-location and so on.    Cost of identity    Allowing unhosted wallets on the network is an important on-ramp for the financially excluded, said Kiva’s Davie, but it’s only part of the journey.      Extending the perimeter for KYC checks is the most exciting innovation Libra can offer, he said. This is extremely difficult, especially where people have limited documentation, and it’s expensive for what amounts to a low-value account.      But systems like Libra can dramatically reduce the cost of compliance and enable full KYC inclusion for people who don’t have a national identity or couldn’t pass a KYC check, said Davie.      Read more: Crypto ‘Gray’ Markets Could Be Unintended Consequence of FATF Travel Rule      “We can actually reduce the barrier to bring compliance to where it’s not,” he said. “Because most actors outside the perimeter are very good actors. Kiva has been deploying millions of dollars in the unbanked sector for 15 years. Our default rate is lower than U.S. credit card default, and most of those people have never passed a KYC check.”      In places where people may lack a paper ID, they may have access to Facebook. Could that digital credential be combined with something like a $20-a-day transaction limit to get those people into the financial system?      “I would love to see regulators think about it that way,” said Davie. “Setting an appropriate transaction limit is a sovereign decision and a regulator’s decision. But look, 70% of the world’s adult population makes less than $10 a day. So you are not talking about big amounts of money: $10 or $15 or $100 as an account limit and you include a whole bunch of people under that regime.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/10/libra-is-ready-for-the-digital-money-space-race-dante-disparte,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2db18982226fb9f591d1c71a9eeae6c44a4c4e41-1500x743.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That's why Mincu, who founded the Transylvanian network, is in the midst of a 15-day campaign to do just that. Nearly two years after first revealing his “secure proof-of-stake” sharding protocol in a technical white paper, Elrond’s 24-person developer team will offer up to $60,000 to node-runners who can successfully wreak havoc upon their code.      Mincu’s goal with the so-called “Battle of the Nodes: Onchained” campaign is, of course, to have white hats expose every bug, attack vector, vulnerability and critical breakpoint on Elrond before unsanctioned hackers do so. This testnet trial by fire will prove if the network is ready for mainnet launch, he said.      “When we have 15 days without interruption of the network despite this kind of attacks and stress testing, at that point we know Elrond is finally prepared and good – robust enough to go live,” Mincu told CoinDesk.      Elrond’s 15-day clock resets when the “interrupters” manage to take the network down. Nobody has yet: Elrond’s protocol has foiled three attacks so far. Underminers have nevertheless uncovered plenty of lower-level bugs worth fixing, and that’s enough to keep nodes in contention for a slice of the $60,000 plunder, paid out in the ERD token.      “We’re on a daily basis discovering some things that we can improve from the validators,” said Mincu. “We usually do one or two releases per day,” patching the bugs, clarity issues and other pain points that the battle’s 1,700 node participants dredge up.      But the effort is not just about the money and the bugs, Mincu said – it's also a competition for mainnet validator slots. Some 34% of Elrond’s initial 1,500 nodes (500 for each execution shard and an additional 500 for the metachain) will go in part to “trusted” parties who helped the hunt for flaws.      It also gives Elrond a chance to flex its network specs. By Tuesday, the blockchain – which has a “divide and conquer” sharding mechanism with a consensus that randomly assigns validator work to members of the two sharding groups – was posting a peak transactions-per-second (TPS) rate of 712. Mincu claimed Elrond can handle 10,000 TPS at full tilt.      The 1,700 nodes far outstrips Mincu’s original projection of 700-800 participants when he announced the bug bounty battle with hardly a week’s notice.

42432052,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9Hdh,1591777620,Crypto Payroll Startup Bitwage Lets Earners Sidestep Volatility With Stablecoin Payments,"Bitcoin payroll provider Bitwage has begun offering employees a way of receiving wages paid in cryptocurrency, but without the volatility.      Announced Wednesday, company clients can now sign up to the Bitwage platform in order to pay their workers using the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin, which is linked to the price of the U.S. dollar. Salaried workers or freelancers can also sign up to receive wages from employers in the coin.      The move comes at a time when global markets have been in turmoil resulting from the ongoing uncertainty relating to the recovery from coronavirus-affected communities, and many national currencies have lost value against the dollar.      USDC is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin that was launched in October 2018 by the CENTRE consortium, comprising of a partnership between P2P payments fintech firm Circle and U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase. The consortium was formed to develop price-stable crypto assets and network protocols.      The stablecoin is issued as an ERC-20 standard token on the Ethereum blockchain and is backed by corresponding USD held in accounts, subject to regular public reporting of reserves.      See also: Bitcoin in Emerging Markets: Latin America      The ability to pay employees in cryptocurrency isn't new as Bitwage has been engaged in crypto-related wage activity since at least 2014. In addition to bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH), it started offering payments in ether (ETH) last June. Employees and freelancers are able to choose a percentage distribution of their payments in crypto or fiat.      Using stablecoins for payments is a relatively recent but fast-growing trend. They remove the risk to earners' salaries from the volatile movements of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, meaning workers won't risk having lost a percentage by the time the funds have arrived and been exchanged.      The fiat-backed tokens are, according to Bitwage, becoming more popular in South America, where inflation has severely impacted the value of government backed fiat currency in some nations.      The Venezuelan bolivar, for example, has depreciated significantly since June of last year and is down by more than 3000% against the dollar, opening up the potential for USD-backed stablecoins to provide more stability for communities.      “During our testing, we have seen a lot of interest in the Latin American communities around stablecoin wages. We are excited to see how this will improve the lives of communities with struggling financial systems around the world,” Jonathan Chester, Bitwage CEO, said.
