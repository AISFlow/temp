42425836,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRHh,1403956863,Bitcoin Helps Anti-Poaching Teams in New Charity Campaign,"Australian bitcoin payments startup BitPOS is teaming up with the International Anti-Poaching Foundation (IAPF) to help save Africa's endangered wildlife from hunters.  It's the latest campaign aiming to demonstrate how bitcoin companies can raise money for a cause and give digital currency a friendlier public face in the process.  A similar campaign by South African exchange iceCUBED, started last month, has already raised over 2.4 BTC for a Botswana children's charity, and is ongoing.  Anti-Poaching Campaign  So far, the partnership between BitPOS and the IAPF has been a success,, with bitcoin payments making up around 10% of the total amount raised so far in the IAPF's current campaign.  Funds donated will help train Africa's anti-poaching teams.  Using an existing payment processor helps to ease charities into the world of bitcoin, where new sources of revenue might seem attractive, but technologically daunting to the uninitiated.  The IAPF's Managing Director in Australia, Ian Mackenzie-Ross, said it would help his organization focus on its mission rather than worrying about the technicalities of using bitcoin:  ""The idea that we can tap into donations from around the world via one collection point is ideal, it couldn’t be simpler.""  BitPOS  founder Jason Williams said he got the idea to help out with the fundraising campaign after reading a story about the federation's work on reddit:  ""I got in touch with Ian asking if there was some way BitPOS could help, and before I knew it, we were providing the means for bitcoin donations. The bitcoin community is known for its generosity and the IAPF is doing great work, it’s a natural fit.""  He added that all donations would be forwarded to the IAPF's campaign and BitPOS would convert them into Australian dollars once it concluded.  ""Bitcoin is a global currency and by setting up donations on the IAPF website, we’re enabling the global community to get involved in conserving Africa’s wildlife.""  Bitcoin's charity advantages  The ability to transmit small or even micro payments anywhere in the world almost instantly showcases one of bitcoin's major benefits over traditional payment networks.  While Paypal has its own free-free charity option, it is not truly global – often the kinds of places who would benefit most from a large collection of small donations are not served.  The public blockchain can provide greater transparency for charities using a single address, allowing donors to check exactly how much money is being raised. Bitcoin also gives donors a greater degree of anonymity than a credit card payment.  Botswana  Botswana bitcoin campaigner Alakanani Itireleng launched the campaign for the SOS Children's Villages in May, and says the demonstration of bitcoin as a charity helper has been great so far:  ""It is a good intiative indeed 'cause for me it enabled me to show that it is easy to fundraise with bitcoin.""  The campaign has so far raised over 2.4 BTC (and 8.1 LTC), with most donations in small amounts like 0.02 BTC. One generous donor contributed an entire bitcoin.  Donations are still coming in, and Itireleng said the campaign would continue to raise funds until its goal was met.

42425845,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRXh,1403953543,"What Would You Buy With 30,000 Bitcoins?","So, the US Marshals are auctioning off 30,000 BTC.  In 2009, that wouldn't have been worth very much, but at the time of writing, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index puts that at a cool $17,610,000.  It's a tiny fraction of the overall number of bitcoins in circulation, but here at CoinDesk, we certainly wouldn't turn it down. What could you spend it on? Here are a few ideas.  A little over one-sixth of David Siegel’s house  David Siegel is the billionaire owner of Westgate Resorts Ltd, the largest privately-held timeshare company in the world. His 15-bedroom, 30-bathroom home was featured on the documentary 'The Queen of Versailles'.  Siegel lost most of his fortune during the financial crisis, and construction on the home stalled as he had to sell off most of his assets.  Now he’s back, and building out the rest of the house, although we don't think he won his fortune back investing in bitcoins, sadly. It’s valued at $100m on completion – perhaps you could buy five of the 30 bedrooms. Or just rent it for a bit?  Namecoin  As it turns out, the market capitalization for namecoin at the time of writing is just a little under $15.8m. So actually, you could pick up all of feathercoin as well, and still have a couple of thousand dollars in bitcoins over in change.  Embarrassingly, though, you couldn’t afford the whole of dogecoin, and that only launched in December. Too shame. Much poor. Which is what David Siegel must have been thinking in 2009.  17 Hublot Classic Fusion Haute Joaillerie watches  This Hublot model is one of the most expensive watches in the world. It is dusted with 1,305 baguette diamonds. With 30,000 BTC, you could buy one for each wrist, and still have $15.6m left.  Or, given that only eight of these were ever made, you could collect the set and still scrape together enough dough to use the bathroom at Siegel’s house.  68 trips to space  $250,000 will get you a trip into space with Virgin Galactic, which you can pay for in bitcoins at the going market rate. It’s quite an experience.  You are instantly pinned back into your seat, overwhelmed, until everything goes dark, when you begin to experience a weightless sensation and feel a little sick.  And that, my friends, is what it may feel like to sit next to a Winkelvoss for two and a half hours. With 30,000 bitcoins, you get to do it another 67 times. Just don't mention Facebook, or you may have to pay extra for the earplugs.  320 high-roller weekends in Vegas  Cryptocurrency fans tend to be a speculative lot, so how about a weekend away, gambling in fun Las Vegas? Take four friends from New York and head down there on the Friday, coming back on Monday. Let's do it in style, shall we?  It turns out that it isn’t that expensive to rent a private jet. You can pick up a medium jet which will whisk you from New York to Las Vegas for a four-day trip, and it will only cost you $42,500.  Bitcoin high rollers can’t be expected to stay at fleapits, so we are putting you up in the Encore Salon Suites at the Wynn Hotel. We’d rent two of them, each for two people to stay in, so that you’re not cramped. That costs $8,300, bringing your grand total to around $50,800.  Oh, you want to gamble, as well? Let's round it up to $55,000, then, because we hear the drinks are free, and they do those cheap seafood buffets. You still get to go 320 times, assuming that you lose your entire kitty every time you fly.  543 dinners with Barack Obama  How about sitting down for a friendly bite with President Barack Obama? He recently held a fundraiser at the home of Vogue editor Anna Wintour, where people paid $32,400 a plate to dine with him. Apparently, you get a photo with him, as well.  Technically speaking, you'd be able to do this 543 times, at which point you might have run out of things to talk about. To be honest, it might take a few of those dinners to politely inform him how the government should be dealing with it. Try not to get too worked up and point your fork.  Luckily for you, that $32,400 figure is significant, because it's the most that an individual can donate to the Democratic party in 2014, which means that one plate of steak diane is all you can buy, even if it’s far less than you can afford.  So, you'd either have to sponsor 542 friends to do the same thing, or just switch allegiance to the Republicans instead, and donate a bit more to other causes. It seems to work okay for the Koch brothers.  890 trips in a MIG  The MIG-29 was introduced in 1983, just over a quarter century before Satoshi figured out how to create bitcoin. It's still in service, and in between patrolling the Ukrainian border, it also does day trips.  You can fly one for 45 minutes for just under $20,000. That also gets you two nights in a five-star Moscow hotel, and another two nights in a four-star, nearer to the launch site 400km away.  You'll get the chance to do some aerobatics, including rolls, loops, and tail slides. Bonus points if you can create a vapour trail mimicking the price of bitcoin over the past year.  You can't fit many people in a MIG-29, meaning that the flight will be Winkelvoss-free. Although by the time you've completed almost 900 flights, you might still feel a little queasy.  One million Empire Manhattans at Evr  30,000 BTC will buy you just over one million Manhattan Empires at Evr, the New York bar founded by Charlie Shrem last year.  The Empire Manhattan is a saucy little mix of rye or bourbon, Vermouth, Angustora Bitters, and brandied cherry with orange peel. You might have to drink them over a few sittings, though.  Shrem may even be able to join you there. The bitcoin entrepreneur, facing federal money-laundering charges, was told in May that he could leave the house between 9 AM and 9 PM, Sunday through Thursday.  Nearly 2 million pizzas  Back in 2010, a pizza cost 10,000 BTC, apparently. That's how much Florida programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for ""a couple of pizzas, like maybe two large ones so I have some left over for the next day"".  These days, you can pick up two medium two topping pizzas from Domino’s for 0.03050 bitcoins, and you don’t have to pay someone halfway around the world to help you out.  It means that you could happily chow down on 983,606 pizzas. Oh, hang on, though – you get two in your order, so that’s 1,967,213 pies. Although you should probably pick some of the sausage off, because that's a lot of fat, you know?  Or you could go upmarket a bit, and buy some Pizza Royales. Forget your all-dressed nonsense here. Domenico Crolla created what is said to be the most expensive Pizza in the world. It's a 12-inch pie, with caviar soaked in Don Perignon, Scottish smoked salmon, lobster marinated in Cognac, venison medallions, and a vintage balsamic vinegar. He used ""a significant amount"" of edible 24 carat gold flakes as topping. Which would be appropriate, we guess, if you ever make it to David Siegel’s bathroom.  It sold for $4200 at auction, meaning that you could buy 4,192 of them. Actually, 4,192.8, which means that you could give away a few slices if you were really stuffed.

42425844,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRVh,1403949619,Under the Microscope: The True Costs of Gold Production,"Hass McCook is a chartered engineer and freshly minted Oxford MBA. He has been researching bitcoin over the past several months and recently joined the Lifeboat Foundation’s New Money Systems advisory board.  This article is the second in a series on bitcoin’s sustainability. Having previously examined the cost of bitcoin mining, here McCook seeks to quantify the economic and environmental factors involved in mining gold.  Gold has been used for millennia as a means to project and protect wealth.  As the data below indicates, 52% of all gold ever mined is used for jewellery and palatial adornments. In terms of protection, central banks hold 18% of the world’s gold supply and other investors hold 16% (Hewitt, 2008).  However, the metal also has practical applications, with 10% of yearly demand coming from industry (World Gold Council, 2012). Almost 12% of the world’s supply of gold is contained within technological products, and is lost forever unless recycled – which has its own costs attached to it.  For completeness, according to the World Gold Council (2012), over 2700 tonnes of gold were produced and over 1600 tonnes of gold were recycled in 2011.  Gold is valuable is due to its intrinsic properties: it is highly durable, malleable and never loses its lustre. Most importantly, it is scarce, and becomes increasingly more difficult and expensive to mine – so it is safe from inflation.  It is for these reasons, as well as its applications for industry, that the metal has demand, and by extension, value. The following paragraphs seek to quantify the lifecycle of gold, as well its economic, environmental and social costs.  Future Trends  Gold is becoming both harder to mine and more scarce, which means that its associated costs will continue to climb.  Relative labour costs are also increasing dramatically, which could be a large driver in the metal's future mining cost. As most of the energy used in mining comes from non-renewable fossil fuels like diesel, there isn’t much hope for reducing its carbon footprint in the near future.  With that said, there is hope for improvement in gold recycling as national grids transition to green energy. Additionally, annual statistics on mining fatalities are improving.  As can be seen from the figure below, at current production rates, known global gold reserves will be depleted in 20 years’ time. New production will rely on recycling.    Mining Lifecycle  As can be seen from the graphic below (Minerals Council of Australia, 2014) the mining of gold is an intensive process, and the lifecycle of a mine is typically quite long and varied (upwards of 20 years).  Although there are triple-bottom-line costs associated with each of these stages, the most expensive stages are the fourth, fifth and sixth: construction, production and rehabilitation.  Mine construction provides the necessary infrastructure to allow for a productive mine; this includes bulk earthworks and the construction of roads and facilities. It can generally take several years to complete.  Rehabilitation involves returning the land as close to its pre-mining condition as possible to allow plant and animal life to flourish, or the original owner to use it as they please. Although these activities have both impacts and costs associated with them, these pale in comparison to production itself.  Figure 4 shows the process of extracting gold from the ground. Whilst we will not discuss the activities involved in the process chain, you will notice that large volumes of rock, water, and cyanide are used to produce gold.  There is a plethora of peer-reviewed scientific literature and industry-based data on the economic, environmental and social impacts of these processes, and they will be discussed in the following sections of this report.  Economic Costs of Mining  At the time of writing, the price of gold was approximately $1,250/ounce. Here, I will provide industry data on the economic cost to miners to produce this ounce.  In early February 2014, the World Gold Council noted that the average industry cost of production is $1,200/ounce, with 30% of the industry becoming unprofitable if the gold price drops below that level (Rudarakanchana, 2014).  Barclay’s commodities research provides similar figures. Their report from April 2013 shows that the marginal cost of production was $1,104/ounce (Barclays Commodities Research, 2013).  Andrew Su, CEO at brokerage firm Compass Global Markets concurred, stated that the cost of producing gold in Australia had jumped to over $1,000/ounce in 2013 (Naidu-Ghelani, 2013).  2,700 tonnes, or just over 96 million ounces, of gold were mined in 2012. At an average of $1,100/ounce, this puts the economic cost of mining gold at $105.6bn.  Environmental Costs of Mining  While the cost of mining is easily and conveniently packaged into a cover-all $1,100/ounce figure, the devastating toll it has on the environment can often be overlooked.  The table below compares and contrasts various lifecycle analyses of gold-mining, presented in different peer-reviewed journals and scientific sources:  With 2,700 tonnes, or, 2.7 million kilograms of gold mined each year, using low average numbers from the above literature review, total yearly impacts can be summarised as follows:  Recycling  Gold can be recycled, and frequently is – Figure 1 shows that just over a third of all gold produced each year is recycled.  Recycling is significantly less energy intensive than mining gold, however, definitive data does not exist as to the exact energy savings (US EPA, 2012). As an indication of how much energy is saved recycling, here are statistics for other metals and products (The Economist, 2007):  Aluminium: 95%  Steel: 60%  Plastics: 70%  Paper: 40%  Glass: 5-30%  Assuming optimistic energy savings of 90%, energy used to recycle gold would be 475 million GJ x 0.5 (ratio of recycled to mined gold) x (1 – 90%) (energy saving) = approx. 25 million GJ.  Converting GJ of energy to tonnes of CO2 & Dollar Cost  The most consistent approach to converting GJ of energy to tCO2 would be to use a weighted average of tCO2 produced by the source of primary energy supply. This is calculated in the table below (Moomaw, et al., 2011), (Sovacool, 2008), (US Department of Energy, 2013):  1GJ is equivalent to 277.77 kWh or 0.2777 MWh, therefore, 25 million GJ results in 4 million tonnes of CO2 produced at 600g/kWh. To sense-check these results, mined gold results in 54 million tonnes of CO2.  Therefore, it can be concluded that carbon emissions are cut by 90% if gold is recycled, so long as the above assumptions hold true. This conclusion seems logical, due to not having to deal with huge amounts of waste rock, water, cyanide and other chemical by-products during recycling.  At an average cost of $100/MWh of electricity generated, the economic cost of energy used for recycling would be $694.25m.  Assuming that all recycled gold is low-grade 14 carat, this means that cost to acquire 1600 tonnes of scrap gold is as follows:  The cost to acquire recycling facilities has not been considered, as this is expected to be marginal.  After rounding, we can conclude that the recycling of gold costs about $40bn per year (and rising), or about $780/ounce.  Social Costs of Gold Mining  The obvious major social costs of gold mining are native land-owner rights, the human rights abuses involved in obtaining “conflict gold”, and the unacceptably high worker fatality rates. According to research by Oxfam (2004), 50% of all newly mined gold is taken from native lands.  Gold is a renowned conflict mineral, with more than $600m of gold estimated to leave Congo every year alone – this metal is tainted with physical and sexual violence, and human enslavement.  The mining of gold allows local warlords to continue to finance their armies, causing suffering to millions of Africans (Raise Hope for Congo, 2014).  Most striking are the statistics on worker fatalities, which whilst incomplete and incomprehensive due to difficulty in obtaining reliable international data, still serve to paint an ominous picture.  As can be seen, statistics from a very small sample of gold-producing countries show almost 50,000 fatalities in the last century alone.  In addition to this, gold has been mined for centuries, surely causing tens of thousands of more deaths prior to statistics being recorded.  Also to be noted, the above data only cover fatality statistics, and overlook injuries and long-term effects on health such as tuberculosis, silicosis and other occupational diseases.  Gold Investment Fraud  Precious metal fraud has cost Americans $300m since 2001 alone (Miedema & Bartz, 2014), but on a global and historical scale, the damage has been significantly worse.  In a one-off event, BRE-X, a Canadian gold mining scam, cost investors $6.5bn in the biggest mining scandal of all time (Ro, 2012). There are several other documented and undocumented large-scale precious metal frauds that have occurred throughout history, which would be impossible to completely quantify.  Now we’ve looked at the costs of gold production, it’s time we compared it with the cost of generating other stores of value.
