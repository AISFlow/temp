As such, Purse’s original June 26 shutdown date is likely to be postponed, he said.      One of the investors may well be bitcoin cash (BCH) evangelist and Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver who posted a video on April 19 saying he has “been talking to [Purse].” Purse lists Ver as an original investor in the project.      Ver declined to comment when asked over email.      “Purse is too important for the ecosystem to let disappear. I don’t think [Purse] is going to go anywhere,” Ver said in his Sunday video.

42383557,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x58l,1587678468,Bitcoin Messenger Explores Censorship Resistance During Coronavirus Crisis,"A new bitcoin privacy technology was born this week, inspired by the politics of the “Great Lockdown.”      On Monday, software engineer John Cantrell released a messenger application called Juggernaut. It’s built entirely on top of bitcoin’s scaling layer, the Lightning Network, and offers end-to-end encrypted, onion-routed, peer-to-peer messages.      In some ways, Juggernaut offers a more secure and primitive version of the Ethereum-based Status messaging app or the bitcoin-friendly mobile app Sphinx Chat. But everything comes with tradeoffs and Juggernaut prioritizes privacy.      While it's now in early beta stages, Cantrell said the idea was inspired by censorship concerns, such as those we’ve already seen during the coronavirus crisis, from WeChat and Facebook deleting posts about the pandemic to Google suspending an Idaho church app for allegedly violating Google Play’s new events policies. For just one more example, bitcoin advocate Knut Svanholm said Amazon forced him to remove a brief mention of the coronavirus from his self-published book in order to distribute it through Kindle.      Read more: Europe Debates COVID-19 Contact Tracing That Respects Privacy      “It seems like maybe we’re heading toward a type of world where the government may shut down communication channels, you can’t say these things on Twitter, etc.,” Cantrell said. “If I want to use some service with an API to, say, send emails or text messages or pretty much any API, I have to create an account with that website and use my credit card or bank account.”      This messaging app doesn’t rely on a commercial server. Instead, the app runs on a Lightning node, from homemade Raspberry Pi devices to Casa models, so that bitcoiners can send messages directly between nodes by using their node public keys like usernames.      This primitive beta allows users to open channels with a small amount of bitcoin, that can be sent back and forth without actually requiring payment, or pay small routing and transaction fees to the network if the user doesn’t use a direct channel. Either way, it would cost less than a dollar to send millions of private messages without relying on an external service.      “In these LSAT or micro-payment-enabled APIs,” Cantrell said, referring to how Juggernaut plans to use Lightning Lab’s LSAT standard, “it allows for global access to almost any service. That’s the grand vision here. How do we allow someone to use any service without needing to go through the traditional route.”      Read more: Bitcoin’s Lightning Becomes Latest Protocol to Court Publishers With Micropayments    EARN IT Act    Censorship isn’t strictly a pandemic issue, pending legislation could jeopardize legal protections for technologists and service providers long after coronavirus fades into memory.      The Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (EARN IT) Act, a bill sponsored by South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal may soon force tech companies to abide by new online child protection laws or risk lawsuits for unmoderated content.      Riana Pfefferkorn, the associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, called the EARN IT Act a “stalking horse for banning end-to-end encryption,” supported by President Donald Trump.      Eugen Rochko, founder of the decentralized social network Mastodon, which runs on federated servers, believes bills like the EARN IT Act could further entrench tech monopolies. On the other hand, he said decentralized platforms can still address moderation concerns without government censorship.      Read more: ‘0% Success’: Why Blockchain Apps Just Aren’t Taking Off      “One benefit is that there's just, like, more moderation,” Rochko said of grassroots networks. “The other benefit is that the moderation is more flexible to global needs because there is not a predefined set of rules that come from a specific place.”      From the perspective of Juggernaut’s Cantrell, creating a privacy tool for more decentralized social messaging felt like a “revolutionary” moment, discovering a radically different way to use bitcoin software. The Lightning Network could be used for anything from an “unstoppable poker room” to complex software services, he said.      “The messages are being routed over the Lightning Network. They're not just simple messages, they’re server requests,” Cantrell said, adding the server requests could be configured to automate a wide range of computer functions. “I can access a paid API and pay for exactly what I use. It would allow for easier onboarding and global access.”      Benjamin Powers contributed reporting.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/23/bitcoin-messenger-explores-censorship-resistance-during-coronavirus-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0339da34915562d247b29f076764eb1655b18e9a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383579,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x5St,1587677924,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Gains as Futures Dance the Contango,"Bitcoin futures are showing signs the market is more optimistic on the cryptocurrency. On Thursday, prices for further-dated futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) were higher than near-dated ones. The term structure, known as contango, is usually taken as a bullish signal.      The world’s oldest cryptocurrency popped 10 percent Thursday ahead of April CME futures expiration, from $7,018 to as high as $7,765 on retail-friendly spot exchanges like Coinbase. The CME April contract settled at $7,115 on Thursday while those for May delivery came in $40 higher, indicating a positive outlook.      “Leveraged demand is back with a vengeance today, with the futures term structure shifting back into contango, after a trigger of stops on the break of $7,500 sent bitcoin all the way to the $7,800 level,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for cryptocurrency brokerage and exchange Bequant.      Earlier in the week, further-dated contracts were trading at a discount to the spot price, a situation known as “backwardation.” Contango returned Wednesday and for a short period of time Thursday, Kraken futures dated a month out were trading at a 7.3 percent premium on an annualized basis to spot on the Kraken exchange, according to data from Skew.      Thursday's rally has some observers wondering if the crypto derivatives market, particularly BitMEX, continues to amplify drastic bitcoin price movements. During sudden price changes, automatic liquidations are triggered on such exchanges as BitMEX, for those traders unlucky enough to bet the wrong way. Alex Mashinsky, CEO of crypto lender Celsius Network, wonders if bitcoin can maintain its gains. “The big question is will this hold or are we just seeing flash liquidations of shorts on BitMEX,” he noted to CoinDesk.    Long-range bitcoin outlook    Bitcoin’s price is only now approaching where it was just prior to its March 13 crash, when it changed hands as low as $3,867.      “I’m happy for the pop. However, being bitcoin I’m not impressed - we are back at the April 9 level, nothing to see here,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter (OTC) trader.    Other crypto markets    As bitcoin goes up, so do other crypto assets. Ether (ETH) climbed 3.7 percent in the past 24 hours of trading as of 21:10 UTC (5:10 p.m. EDT).      Other digital assets were also in the green for the day. The biggest winners Thursday included stellar (XLM), up an eye-popping 18 percent, cardano (ADA) higher by 16 percent and ethereum classic (ETC) gaining 6 percent. All price changes are as of 21:10 UTC (5:10 p.m. EDT).      Despite recent research towards the contrary, increases in stablecoin issuance are one signal to look towards for today’s bullish activity, says Blockfills’ Van Huis. “We’ve seen a massive increase in stablecoin activity, perhaps indicating fresh money coming into the market which eventually gets distributed into cryptos.”    Other markets    Oil is roaring back in a big way, jumping 19 percent in trading per barrel as of 21:10 UTC (5:10 p.m. EDT). This is after a historic week saw ‘black gold’ futures prices hit historic negative values Monday.      As for real gold, the yellow metal gained 1 percent - trending downward a bit in Thursday afternoon trading but the safe haven remains in the $1,700 area it crossed Wednesday.      In the United States, the S&P 500 index slipped less than a percent with U.S. Treasury yields relatively flat as a reported 4.4 million fresh jobless claims were reported this week.      The FTSE Eurotop 100 index of largest companies in Europe was up less than a percent , even as economic data made available Thursday in the U.K. showed dismal numbers amid the coronavirus pandemic.      As for the Asian markets, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.5 percent as sectors such as real estate and transportation rebounded from Wednesday losses. The Bank of Japan is expected to have a policy meeting on Monday with stimulus reportedly on the agenda, particularly bond repurchases.      “Everything is up today - gold, equities, even bonds. It's a 'risk-on' day,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at digital asset management firm Koine. “The question is whether when equities head south again, will bitcoin be correlated, like last time, or uncorrelated?”",POSITIVE,ETC,BTC | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/23/market-wrap-bitcoin-gains-as-futures-dance-the-contango,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20e52c272189f8059618357d366fce3e97a39189-2600x1563.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One of the key aspects of most plans to survive the virus and reopen the economy is digital contact tracing. This would be an apparatus whereby mobile phones kept track of the other mobile phones they had been physically proximate to, so that if someone were diagnosed with COVID-19 the at-risk people they had been in contact with could be notified. Apple and Google have proposed one plan while a European consortium is working on another.

The rally comes on the day before the expiry for CME April bitcoin futures.       According to comments shared with CoinDesk, bitcoin traders view Friday's expiry as a primary catalyst for Thursday's rally. There’s a “general expectation for a pickup in volatility” around CME expiry, said Kevin Kelly, former equities strategist at Bloomberg and co-founder of Delphi Digital. But bitcoin was “primed for a move given the recent consolidation,” said Kelly.       Over $68 million worth of contracts were liquidated on BitMEX Thursday morning, according to data from Skew, as futures open interest is still recovering from a 50 percent plunge at the end of Q1 2020.       Bitcoin’s performance during a period of macroeconomic instability may be underwhelming for some investors. But Thursday’s price action marks an over-100-percent recovery from bitcoin’s plunge at the end of Q1 2020.       Thanks to bitcoin’s “strong macro fundamentals,” we’re ""seeing buying interest coming back,” Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, told CoinDesk in a private message.       Traditional markets also rallied Thursday morning, with the S&P 500 up almost 2 percent at the time of publication.       “As traders have been closely monitoring stocks, the push higher in U.S. equities today may share some responsibility for the jump in bitcoin's price,” Joseph Todaro, managing partner at Blocktown Capital, told CoinDesk.

A philosopher of the web and all-around radical open-internet advocate, Halpin is the CEO of Nym, a privacy-tech startup. Here he talks to privacy reporter Benjamin Powers about what he's doing to see out the virus and why ""holistic privacy"" matters more than ever at a time like this.      Powers: How are you holding up?      Halpin: I first heard about coronavirus, not surprisingly, through crypto Twitter. At first I panicked and went out and bought about a month's supply of food and basically started preparing for lockdown, which then did indeed happen. It was the first time crypto Twitter seems to have been correct. I would never trust crypto Twitter when it comes to cryptocurrency, but it was completely correct on the coronavirus.      In my personal life it's not a huge change. The main difference is I no longer travel. Our team is spread out among Belgium, London and other places but now our team is just fully remote. On some level I've enjoyed not traveling because I can get more work done.      See also: Cypherpunk Harry Halpin Takes On Davos      So I just wake, do some stretching and I’ve ordered weights and a punching bag. And so I just wake up, I go running, I stretch, and then will do some weightlifting and boxing. The main issue to some extent is lack of downtime. Because there's no events or socializing outside of me and my girlfriend basically. So far we’ve not killed each other, so it's been fine!      BP: We’re all learning a lot about our relationships these days.      HH: But when I call my friends and family in the United States I get very concerned. Most of my friends have lost jobs, and most people we know in the States had their health care attached to their job. They can't afford it otherwise. It’s interesting, too, because my younger friends, who are Zoomers or millennials, are taking this really seriously, while the [baby] boomers aren’t. It's really weird but it looks like the boomers are in a deathtrap.      BP: And how is COVID-19 impacting your business?    It was the first time crypto Twitter seems to have been correct.    So we obviously can’t have regular in-person meetings. But when it comes to online meetings and chatting, we do that all the time anyway. So it’s been fine and makes you think that maybe we didn't need as many face to face meetings as I thought we did previously.      We're making a lot of breakthroughs partially because it's easier to focus without a lot of meetings, events and conferences. That being said, we have had a lot of security concerns. We set up our own Jitsi server and we’re phasing out of Zoom. We’re keeping all internal communication encrypted. We are big fans of Signal and to a lesser extent Keybase.      And from a bottom line business standpoint, it's been fine. In terms of funding we aren't a huge Filecoin-style project. We've never raised that much in f funds, but we've done conservative management of the funds we have, so we have a year's runway or so. Therefore, we're not particularly concerned about running out of money and, to some extent, we've noticed that cutting travel has saved a lot of money.      That being said, we did have to phase back and remove a few contractors and cut non-essential expenses. From the business standpoint the question is, how long is coronavirus going to last? Should we keep our office leases? Those are pretty large sunk costs. We're also, as a blockchain business, not sure if we even qualify for these government loans and emergency funding.      See also: Preston Byrne: How to Escape Contracts That Are Killing Your Company During Coronavirus      If you're a firm with a year's worth of runaway in the bank, it’s unlikely. And, looking at the fine print, it seems to say these loans are only for businesses that will have to lose employees. And that’s not really the case for us. We cut contractors and we cut one employee at the end of the month.      The loans also aren’t all that big and, with the bureaucratic overhead, maybe a smarter decision for the business would be, or at least what I’m doing with some of my personal finances, is playing the long game on bitcoin.      BP: You and I have spoken previously about contact tracing, which is something you have been looking at closely. Does it worry you?      HH: When it comes to contact tracing, we see a lot of interest in blockchain, even if that’s not translated to financial support. We see people wanting to build on a mixnet, and researchers discussing the benefits of that. And we were talking with some governments, but that’s gone cold, and I’m worried governments are moving towards centralized, non-privacy enhanced solutions. So why would they fund research or deployment of a privacy enhanced solution? [A mix network, taking its name from the proxy servers it employs, called “mixes,” obscures the metadata left behind when data passes through a network.]    We’re keeping all internal communication encrypted.    BP: And so give us a little preview about what you’re going to be tackling and talking about at Consensus.      HH: We're going to be looking at privacy, holistic privacy, and not just cryptocurrencies. So a lot of people believe rather mistakenly that if I send them monero transaction or Zcash transaction it’s fully secure and private, but that’s just not true. With Zcash not only do you have to be shielded but you have to descend to your network-level traffic (that's your IP address), which is broadcasting your bitcoin transaction or your Zcash transaction and every other transaction.      So we're going to walk people through what we call a holistic approach to privacy, starting with a kind of interesting setup where we're going to try to get people to use a VPN. There's a very nice secure VPN run by the ex-Pirate Bay people that takes payment in cryptocurrency without your ID. I’m going to see if people could get that set up, then work with them on The Onion Router (TOR), particularly looking at Tails, which is the Linux bootable TOR CD that [whistleblower Edward] Snowden used, which is still up to date and very probably the best network-level security.      But it's not clear how to integrate Tails very well with something like Zcash or monero desktop wallets. I've actually done it. It's very complicated.      And then lastly, we're going to get people to try to spin up, or contribute to privacy, by running a TOR relay and mixnet, showing them how to set up their own VPN server. That would mean they could go to, say, China and communicate back without too much of a problem.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | XMR | ZEC,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/23/road-to-consensus-harry-halpin-talks-holistic-privacy-mixnets-and-covid-19-of-course,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02d7aaab1ef259e773cd2807a04b2b6c8bb6ffd9-1500x1025.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383566,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9x5Ip,1587662979,Immunity Passes Explained: Should We Worry About Privacy?,"As governments look to lift restrictive measures put in place for the coronavirus, one genre of proposals is to give people who have recovered from COVID-19 a digital immunity pass, passport or certificate. It goes by many names, but the idea is the same. It would say you’re immune and no longer spreading the virus, letting people get back to work, enter shops and engage in the physical world again ahead of the rest of the population.    That sounds like a good idea.    It makes sense. The world can’t continue to deal with the social and economic costs of this magnitude for an extended period of time. People want to get back to their lives. But doing so in a normal way right now isn’t possible. Immunity certificates, based on more widespread testing, would crack the door to a pseudo-normal world ajar, something that appeals to lawmakers.      “Everyone staying home is just a very blunt measure. That’s what you say when you’ve got really nothing else,” Emily Gurley, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told NPR regarding immunity tests. “Being able to test folks is really the linchpin in getting beyond what we’re doing now.”    So antibodies mean you’re immune?    Scientists are studying whether people who recover from the virus possess antibodies that may confer immunity for a period of time. The idea is a person would get tested, receive the results of the test and, if they were found to have antibodies, they would be issued a QR code or other digital pass/document that could be scanned or reviewed on their smartphone. That pass would have been issued by a health agency, be timestamped and authenticated as accurate.      Several countries are implementing or close to implementing immunity passes now. Chile's passes, for example, exempt those who have recovered from COVID-19 or tested positive for the presence of antibodies, from quarantining and lets them return to work, The Washington Post reported. Residents of Chile can apply for these passes if they haven’t shown symptoms for the disease and they’re willing to be tested.      See also: Privacy Advocates Are Sounding Alarms Over Coronavirus Surveillance      Germany and the United Kingdom are in the process of pursuing widespread antibody testing, and states in the U.S. are considering similar measures, which is a precursor to issuing passes. China enforced a more draconian form of health pass, which greatly curtailed movement for citizens based on whether their pass was colored green, yellow or red. The color was based on location tracking, travel history and health information, and has been criticized for the lack of transparency as to why certain people are branded with a certain color.      Immunity passes are likely to be based solely on testing, rather than the various factors that influence China’s system.    So what’s the problem?    First, there’s a lack of testing being done, which is the basis for any tracing or passport system. The U.S. is struggling with testing even as thousands of tests sit unused in labs. The Food and Drug Administration has relaxed accuracy standards regarding tests as it rushes to get them to the public, but there are concerns regarding the prevalence of false negatives. False negatives are people who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 but test negative for the virus, sometimes incorrectly. Just recently, a panel of more than 45 scientists, health experts and economists estimated the U.S. would need to administer 20 million tests every day by mid-summer to open the economy in a safe way.      “In a situation where the prevalence of people with antibodies in the population is quite low – probably no more than around 10 percent of people – even if you’ve got a highly, highly specific test, it is still going to give you quite a lot of false positives,” Robert West, a health psychologist at the University College London told Wired. “That means the government cannot say to people, 'Because you’ve got this test result, you’ve got the antibodies.'”      Then there’s the question of how long immunity might last. Scientists can’t tell us for certain. Still, immunity passports may be the best-worst option for getting us back to work.    Aren't there privacy problems here?    Maybe. There are still pressing questions regarding how people’s medical data will be protected when it comes to issuing a digital immunity pass, how they will be verified and whether creating essentially two classes of people, one of which would have more freedoms and would disproportionality impact vulnerable populations.      Countries continue to grapple with implementing contact tracing yet are still considering reopening in the near future. These passes will play a key role in letting people go back to work and businesses to open again, even as debates continue about how they're executed and their unintended consequences.      See also: European Contact Tracing Consortium Faces Wave of Defections Over Privacy      For example, there could be black markets that arise for spoofed certificates, or false ones, that let people who desperately need to go back to work do so. Another concern is whether a record of all people who have passes is kept in a centralized database that could be co-opted for surveillance or hacked for their personal information. Similarly, clear timelines for data storage relating to these passes would need to be clear, lest they continue to exist indefinitely.      For now, in the U.S. at least, these passes may not be mandatory. But, in effect, they could become compulsory. If a private business said people without such a digital certificate couldn’t enter, and such practices became widespread, a pass would essentially become mandatory in practice if not name. There are also concerns about access to digital passes. While 81 percent of Americans have a smartphone, that leaves millions of people who don’t have one. People without phones might have to procure paper passes, which also would have to be made secure.      These are questions that will need to be answered in the coming weeks and months as the world continues to move through the trajectory of this pandemic.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/23/immunity-passes-explained-should-we-worry-about-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7ad3248b97319956d09d0af7d59a3b062ede7b0-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top Shelf    Miner Hardships Spring usually draws in a crowd of miners and investors into the Bitcoin network, as China’s rainy season drives down the costs of hydropower making mining more profitable. However, bitcoin’s recent price drop, the cost of buying the latest mining rigs and the upcoming halving have collided and now, this season, miners aren’t investing.      Leaseback Rig Private investment firm Arctos Capital has acquired $1 million in assets from Blockware Mining LLC, but will lease them back to the company so it can continue operating as usual. In what’s known as a leaseback transaction, Arctos will lease Bitmain Antminer hardware to the firm allowing the company to continue its mining and hosting operations.      China's Pilot Chains Starbucks and McDonald's are reportedly among 19 restaurants and retail shops that will be involved in testing China's central bank digital currency in the country's Xiong'An district. The move signals China's wider efforts to test out the digital currency project, with state-owned commercial banks already developing wallet applications for the digital yuan, also known as DC/EP.

He proposes a new form of monetary circulation, enabled by a central bank digital currency, that is issued by employers when paying wages and would reach the central bank only after circulating among persons and businesses. “The [MoneytothePeople] model directly tackles unemployment by granting the power to issue the new currency to public and private institutions responsible for paying wages,” he said.

Announced Thursday, the Blockstack testnet is open. Developers can now simulate the Stacks blockchain's new, hybrid consensus mechanism, which Blockstack calls Proof-of-Transfer (PoX).      A functioning blockchain is key to Blockstack's ability to power a new kind of decentralized internet, one that gives users more control over their data and makes it much harder for content to be censored.      The key innovation to this new consensus mechanism: it uses bitcoin. Besides regularly storing a hash of the Stacks blockchain on Bitcoin's, many of the node participants in the blockchain will receive rewards in BTC, a more reliable source of value than rewards in a Stacks' native token, STX.      Read more: Blockstack's New Consensus Mechanism Creates New Use Case for Bitcoin      ""A successful trial of Proof of Transfer would signal a viable third option that relies instead on Bitcoin as a foundation for Web3 going forward,"" Blockstack PBC CEO Muneeb Ali said in a statement. ""It would literally create a new use case for BTC.""      To recap, PoX uses miners and stackers. Miners log transactions, much as miners on the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains do, and stackers keep a copy of the blockchain while signaling which fork to mine on. Miners earn new STX from inflation, and they pay to participate in BTC. That BTC gets distributed to stackers, who have to stake STX.      Bitcoin was originally incorporated as a way to tie the security to the most secure crypto network of them all and to give more users a better incentive to actively participate. As the design has evolved, the team has started to see more possibilities.      In an email to CoinDesk, Ali said:    ""Users can do thousands of transactions on the Stacks chain and the Bitcoin chain only sees a hash of the Stacks block. It starts to become more interesting when you start exploring potential movement of assets or cryptocurrencies between these chains e.g., Bitcoin getting locked on the Bitcoin chain and being used … on Stacks. This area is currently in R&D phase but we’re really excited about the possibilities.""    We covered a similar project with a bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum being built by Keep.      The testnet    All the BTC and STX on the testnet will be simulated, but there is a tangible reason for developers to take part. Blockstack has a series of bug bounties planned for everything from security to smart-contract functionality.      By participating in the testnet, developers can help Blockstack identify problems and earn rewards.      A few notes on the design for consensus on Stacks that will be tested here:    The usual threat of losing staked crypto for negligent behavior is not part of the design for ""stacker"" nodes on the Stacks blockchain.  Tezos-style delegation has been implemented, so users won't need to run a node in order to participate.  The threshold for STX needed to run a node has been lowered and will be dynamic, based on the level of participation. Blockstack did not give a specific number but when we last covered Blockstack 2.0 it was 100,000 STX.    The testnet will provide an opportunity for smart-contract developers to try out Blockstack's new programming language, Clarity, which will also be previewed there.      Testnets can be an important opportunity for new networks to drive developer adoption. A report by Electric Capital last year showed that a well-designed testnet has consistently been one of the best tools for getting more developers interested in a new public blockchain.      The Stacks blockchain first launched in late 2018. Blockstack expects a mainnet launch of its new consensus mechanism, Blockstack 2.0, this summer.",POSITIVE,BTC | STX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | STX,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/23/blockstack-opens-testnet-for-new-bitcoin-linked-consensus-mechanism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37c9df12759bc9b9c45bf8d4c6d590a4a1f3bb34-2000x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance said in a press release Thursday its social payments app Bundle would provide users across Africa with a fee-free means to store and transact in both cash and cryptocurrencies, through a new digital wallet that can be downloaded on their phones.      The payments app went live initially in Nigeria, the continent's largest economy, with support for its national currency, the naira. Other supported assets will include bitcoin, binance coin and BUSD, the exchange's dollar stablecoin.      Bundle was the brainchild of Binance Labs' former director, Yele Bademosi, who grew up in a town just north of Lagos, the Nigerian capital. The app received $450,000 in seed funding from Binance in late 2019 and, while part of the exchange's ecosystem, will run as an independent entity.      Although Binance's press release mentions that Bundle is backed by ""other African investors,"" it doesn't give specifics.      Binance already has a presence in Nigeria. The exchange's local director told CoinDesk earlier this year it had received ""thousands"" of new signups soon after launching a fiat on-ramp in the country in October 2019.      Using Nigeria as a launchpad, Binance said Bundle will be fully operational in as many as 30 other African countries by the end of 2020.

The Binance announcement also comes days after rapper-turned-entrepreneur Akon said his own Stellar-based cryptocurrency project, Akoin, was in good position for becoming the region's primary payments solution.      Akon said a deal for Akoin to be used as the chief payments processor for Kenya's Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC), a city of 35,000 residents, gives ""Akoin a dominant position to control the market of 400 million people in eastern and central Africa, many of who rely on mobile digital transactions for their financial services.""      Akon added the company be able to scale-up throughput for Akoin – which is set to launch at some point this year – so it can handle upwards of 100 million transactions, in Kenya's MMTC alone, within five years' time.      Binance has long had a presence in neighboring Uganda, and entered Kenya at the same time it launched its fiat onramp for the naira.

42431797,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6Tnh,1587650148,How a Crypto Guru Shaped Harvard’s Roadmap for Reopening the US Economy,"An intellectual firebrand of the Ethereum community has played a key role in creating the action plan for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic published this week by Harvard University.      E. Glen Weyl, founder of the RadicalxChange Foundation and a researcher for Microsoft, collaborated with Harvard professor Danielle Allen and other experts to write the ""Roadmap to Pandemic Resilience."" The 56-page document charts a course for scaling up testing, tracing and supported isolation (TTSI) in a way that protects health while preventing permanent injury to regular people's livelihoods.      ""In public health, you have a lot of experts doing their thing ... but not really working in an integrated way with other people to come up with what the policy framework should be. I felt the same way about the economy,"" Weyl told CoinDesk.      He and Allen convened a group with strong reach in the academic and industrial worlds, including Alex Tabarrok, one of the two economists behind the blog Marginal Revolution; Weyl's colleagues from Microsoft (including YouTube legend Vi Hart, who made a video explainer of the plan); other Harvard faculty; and NGO leaders from organizations such as the Breakthrough Institute and New America.      The work at Harvard's Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics was conducted at first through a series of white papers and discussions that eventually coalesced into the document released Tuesday, which Weyl described as ""a compilation.""      The report concludes: ""We can be democracy's bulwark against this existential threat if we elevate our ambitions and determine to act swiftly and with purpose.""    War effort    The core idea of the plan is that COVID-19 must be fought with massively scaled-up testing and tracing. Further, it says people who have a reasonable expectation of exposure should be isolated in a way that won't make them miserable, wreck their careers or expose others.      The centerpiece of that plan is a proposed body established temporarily with significant but narrow powers, which the authors call the Pandemic Testing Board, in the same spirit as the World War II-era War Production Board.      ""What we're advocating in this plan is that for a very narrow part of the economy, we get this real concentration of authority from a bunch of different people working together to coordinate everything,"" Weyl said.      Read more: The RadicalxChange Movement’s Crypto-Cypherpunk Appeal      He acknowledged that a central authority with outsized power is not the type of prescription RadicalxChange usually makes.      ""A lot of centralization is not a big focus of our movement,"" said Weyl, a frequent collaborator with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.      But the report Weyl helped write notes these are extraordinary times:    ""In virtually every successful historical example of such rapid coordination, a central authority has set goals and ensured that each part of the chain meets the interlocking goals required for the chain to succeed. This authority must have clarity on the levels in the supply chain and the kinds of output required at each level to reach desired targets and must induce all parts of the chain to act in conformity with this plan, to avoid failure in one part that would sow systemic distrust.""  Distributed centralization    Weyl said he hopes authorities will realize that such a model can work only if it blends private entities with different levels of government, rather than attempting to beat COVID-19 with a command-and-control operation out of the federal government alone.      ""Obviously, RadicalxChange is a big fan of that sort of emergent cooperation,"" he said. ""It's going to really need to be complemented with a lot of these emergent technologies to support all sorts of things.""      In a section called ""Design of the Pandemic Testing Board"" the Harvard paper presents two possible models for convening such a board, and Weyl pointed in particular to the ""Federalist Model,"" which envisions a body funded by Congress but convened through an interstate compact. The nine-member board would include representatives from business, labor, academia and government.      Read more: Post COVID-19, Companies Must Be Resilient, Not Just Efficient      It's politically conceivable, Weyl said, that because leaders in Washington have failed to coordinate a national response, state leaders may be able to fill that void in a way that turns out to be much more distributed in practice.      ""The challenges the Trump administration has had are encouraging because they mean we are going to have a more decentralized approach to dealing with this,"" Weyl said.      The paper presents a strategy where the board initially focuses on stabilizing the spread of the virus in the 40 percent of the economy that's deemed essential, using a flexible suite of TTSI strategies.      ""Once we do get that part of the economy stabilized it will be far easier to reopen the rest of the economy,"" Weyl said.    Taiwan    Before the coronavirus was designated a pandemic, Weyl had started getting interested in Taiwan's success.      He and virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier wrote a piece on how the island nation’s hacker culture was marshaled into creating applications that shared data about the crisis in a way that made people better prepared and less prone to panic.      Read more: As Governments Rush to Track Coronavirus, Honduras May Offer a Privacy-First Model      Taiwan's success has been well documented throughout this crisis – and RadicalxChange had a direct connection to its anti-COVID apparatus. Taiwan's digital minister, Audrey Tang, is also a member of the RadicalxChange board.      Weyl found Tang was deeply involved in getting technologists there to work with people on the ground, creating solutions that fit people's actual needs.      ""I think what Taiwan got really right is the fusion of technology and empowering diverse people to build that technology – which crypto doesn't always get right,"" Weyl said, citing contact tracing that preserved individual privacy as an example.    Technologies    Just before the Harvard report came out, RadicalxChange published a series of examples of distributed approaches to problem-solving that might be useful in this crisis.      While the Harvard roadmap says nothing about blockchain or adjacent technologies, Weyl said this industry has an important role to play.      For example, there's the issue of using mobile technology for contact tracing. Weyl explained that technology is particularly important for such tracking in large urban areas. There's no way to interview someone and find out every person they sat with on a subway car, but with Bluetooth enabled on ubiquitous mobile phones, it is possible, using cryptographic tools, for an application to know and warn others without revealing the infected person's identity to them, or vice versa.      Weyl is aware privacy advocates have had significant doubts about using these technologies this way, but he said there's an opening for cryptographic tools to be integrated in a way that makes these more protective. ""I think there's a quite good chance that that plays some non-trivial role,"" he said, even at the level of the model that Apple and Google have committed to deploy.      Read more: For Contact Tracing to Work, Americans Will Have to Trust Google and Apple      Additionally, Weyl worries a pandemic environment could undermine civic participation in a way that's truly crippling for the U.S.      ""I would love to get the VTaiwan system, the digital democracy platform they have there,"" Weyl said, ""to sustain democratic engagement.""    VTaiwanhttps://civichall.org/civicist/vtaiwan-democracy-frontier/ is a technology-enabled public deliberation process that has driven the writing of legislation in Taiwan over the last several years and would be quite adaptable to the present Zoom era.    ""I think if we get this plan adopted, which I think we've got a good shot at doing, I will very quickly pivot my attention to working on that kind of stuff,"" Weyl said.    Economics    Lastly, Weyl said he entered this process with a nuanced goal in mind: marrying stringent public-health efforts with ways of mitigating the economic shock.      As the crisis unfolded, Weyl saw policymakers ""deal with the public health situation as if it were any other recession. That was a huge problem with the way we were initially responding to everything, that it was viewing these as two independent things – rather than as two sides of the same coin.""      While crypto users have long been critical of how the U.S. and its corporate class have stewarded the economy, sometimes arguing the country was due for another collapse, Weyl contends the impact of this crisis has been much too large to be wholly attributed to public and private balance sheets.      Read more: Corporate America Knows the Bailout Is Baked In      ""I'm sympathetic to the notion that we were due for an economic problem. The particular collapse we saw was very extreme. It's on a completely different economic level,"" Weyl said. ""This may well be the most severe dip in economic activity ever in reported history.""      And that severe dip relates not just to over-leveraged firms and too-plentiful dollars, but also stems from the fact that people are not really participating in the Main Street economy. This is having all sorts of bizarre effects in the so-called ""real economy,"" such as supply chains not finding ways to re-route to where they are needed and certain categories of insurance providers effectively printing money in a way no one could have anticipated.      While in crypto and beyond there's a ferocious debate about the legitimacy of orders for people to stay at home, the impact of quarantine will last beyond the orders, Weyl said. That's why TTSI is needed as soon as possible so people can feel reasonably safe participating again, he argued.      ""I think mostly people are staying at home because they don't want to kill their grandparents, honestly. I don't therefore think the solution is about removing stay-at-home orders,"" Weyl said.

Launched Thursday, the 7-Day Asset Price Prediction feed will give an outlook on future crypto prices based on purpose-built algorithms and the firm’s API, Nomics CEO Clay Collins told CoinDesk in an interview.      “There are a lot of poor signals out there that are getting a lot of clicks and we thought we could do a net positive for the space by just leveling up the quality of predictions,” Collins said.      The Nomics forecaster isn’t a standalone, investment-grade product, Collins added, but can help inform crypto investors based on curated exchange data.      The free tool currently lists 100 of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap. Collins said assets with longer histories and better data sources tend to lead to better predictions overall.      A subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning uses computer algorithms combined with data inputs to predict future events. Interestingly, machine learning services should get better given how these systems learn from past data and predictions.    How it works    Under the hood, the tool inputs “aggregate pricing data” from major exchanges that Nomics scrapes and cleans. That data is then fed into a purpose-built algorithm to spit out seven-day predictions in both a spot price and percentage change from the current price.      The feed, which has been in the works for the past six months, Collins said, relies on the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture known as long short-term memory (LSTM).      “LSTMs are relatively new in the machine-learning space, and financial data is notoriously difficult to predict, but we were able to get fairly reasonable predictions, and we are fully transparent about their historical accuracy,” Nomics CTO Nick Gauthier said in a statement.      Read more: Securitize Users Can Now Directly Trade Security Tokens With Just a Web Link      Of course, price predictions in any market, particularly crypto, can be exceedingly difficult to pin down.      Collins said the team wanted to add a touch of professionalism with its data-guided predictions. In the spirit of transparency, Nomics will also include a 30-day mean error rate with the new feature.      “We don't know when weird things are going to happen,” Collins said. “If the Yale endowment said they were going to allocate 30 percent in bitcoin – well, our models are not going to know that.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/23/nomics-machine-learning-tool-offers-7-day-price-forecast-on-top-100-cryptos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5f4a11538b1020d70f8a7bc28cf966dcc5dfa61-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The San Francisco firm – which received SEC approval last year – said Thursday the new ""Instant Access"" service allows users to directly trade security tokens, in a secure and regulatory compliant way. The system works on the Ethereum mainnet without middlemen adding costs and friction to the process.      Built on Securitize's Digital Securities protocol, the new facility speeds up a cumbersome process, by which security token holders try to sell without making a position on a public exchange. Carlos Domingo, Securitize co-founder and CEO, said Instant Access helped ""fulfill one of the core promises of digital securities – simply, compliant, and efficient transferability on a global scale.""      See also: Securitize Opens IRAs to Digital Securities Investors With Partnership      Instant Access was built with the team behind AirSwap, the Ethereum p2p network, which previously helped Securitize facilitate the first U.S. compliant security token transfer in November 2018.      Under the hood, the new offering works in pretty much the same way. As with AirSwap, Instant Access users communicate with one another off-chain. A seller expresses their intent to sell privately to prospective buyers by sharing a web link via text, email, or social media. The buyer then clicks on the link to initiate the transaction.      A Securitize spokesperson told CoinDesk trades can settle pretty much instantaneously, assuming buyers have already completed all the required KYC/AML checks set out by the security token's issuer.

42431802,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6Txh,1587642956,First Mover: Bitcoin Catches Almighty Dollar Even During 2020's Dash for Cash,"After swinging wildly for most of this year, the price of bitcoin is now back to roughly where it started 2020 – around $7,100.      And since bitcoin is priced in dollars, the flat year-to-date performance really just means it's keeping pace with the U.S. currency, which has become one of the world's most in-demand assets as the coronavirus prompts a flight by investors everywhere into cash.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      If bitcoin were a government-issued currency, it would be one of the world's top performers – beating not only popular emerging-market tenders like the Mexican peso and South Africa's rand, but also advanced-nation stalwarts like the euro, British pound and Canadian dollar.      ""Bitcoin is behaving as a store of value much the same as king dollar is behaving as a store of value,"" Paul Brodsky, partner at cryptocurrency and blockchain investment firm Pantera Capital, said in a phone interview.      Many cryptocurrency investors see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold. And many of those investors believe bitcoin will eventually benefit from the Fed's trillions of dollars of emergency money injections, which could spur inflation over the long term.      But guess what bitcoiners can already cheer about? Beating the euro during a year that the International Monetary Fund predicts will see the world's worst recession at least since the 1930s.      ""What you would expect to see going forward are hard assets, like gold and bitcoin, outperform as fiat currencies get depreciated,"" said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of cryptocurrency analysis firm Digital Asset Research.      Think about it this way: Dollars have been in such high demand from investors, businesses, governments and central banks around the world that the Federal Reserve has had to inject more than $2 trillion of new money into financial markets just to preserve stability.      There's no real comparison, of course, between the bitcoin market and the global market for dollars: The total outstanding value of all bitcoin ever created is currently around $130 billion, less than 1/100th of the $16 trillion U.S. money supply.      But as an investment, bitcoin is beating most world currencies and breaking even with the dollar.      One of the Fed's motivations for the massive money injections is, ultimately, just monetary policy: The U.S. central bank is trying to counteract the powerful deflationary forces of an economic contraction.      Oil, which is priced in dollars, is now trading at about $14 a barrel, down from $61 at the start of the year, based on the benchmark U.S. futures contract. That's deflation – a classic economic reaction to falling demand.      Bitcoin, by contrast, has held its value: One unit of the cryptocurrency now buys 507 barrels of oil, about five times what it could at the start of the year.      Any currency's ultimate value is its purchasing power. And bitcoin is holding its own against the almighty dollar.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $7,081 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $7,186 | 24-Hr Low: $6,943      Trend: Bitcoin is in the green again Thursday, after a small rally on light trading volumes.      The top cryptocurrency is currently trading near $7,100, representing a 2 percent gain on the day. The cryptocurrency continues to show no real sign of breaking from the recent narrow range between $6,500 and $7,300.      The MACD, an indicator used to judge momentum and change in trend, shows the potential for a move to the downside, courtesy of falling histogram bars hovering near the neutral 0 line.      Should a loss at the 50-day moving average occur (yellow line on chart) – currently around $6,771 – a deeper drawdown shouldn't be ruled out. A likely area of support in such a case would be toward the bottom of the range at $6,520 – a level that has held steady since April 2.      The relative strength index (RSI) is trending bullishly, however. Should the bulls defend the 50-day average and the RSI doesn't dip too far toward oversold, a bounce toward $7,300 is also plausible.      For now, traders will have to wait and see which direction is offered, as the all-important daily average should provide greater clarity moving forward.

42431800,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6Tvh,1587641421,"Digital Dollars Can Reduce Unemployment, Here's How","Marcelo M. Prates is a lawyer at the Central Bank of Brazil and holds a doctorate from Duke University School of Law. The views and opinions expressed here are his and do not reflect the position or policy of any of the institutions with which he is affiliated. @MMPrts      Early in the coronavirus pandemic, one particular limitation of government action became evident. After crossing political hurdles to provide economic relief to those most in need, governments realized they lacked a fast and simple way to send money directly to their citizens. In the United States, the initial idea was to mail paper checks to the population. Aid recipients would have to wait several days not only for the check to arrive in their right address but for the deposited check to clear, making the funds finally available.      As sending money electronically would be far more convenient, direct deposits were eventually adopted as the default payment option in the stimulus bill signed into law. The money that will be sent to households, however, could take several weeks to arrive. In the meantime, 22 million Americans, or 13 percent of the labor force, have filed for unemployment benefits in the first four weeks after a stricter lockdown was enforced. The potential for lasting hardship and social unrest is frightening, requiring governments to do better.      See also: Money Reimagined: As Tech, Politics and COVID-19 Collide, a Global Reset Looms      Against this backdrop, I propose a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that would be the mirror image of the money we have today because it would reverse the process by which money is created and put in circulation. The CBDC would be issued by employers when paying wages and would reach the central bank only after circulating among persons and businesses. This CBDC would need legislative action to be created and be considered legal tender, requiring some political heavy lifting along the way. But its implementation would be relatively straightforward. Let’s call it MoneytothePeople (MttP) while referring to traditional money as dollars ($).      Figure 1 shows a stylized model of the current monetary system. Money flows from a central bank to the banks, which then spread it out to the economy. One of the essential characteristics of this model is perhaps the most overlooked: The central bank has no direct contact with the public. The modern central bank depends on the banking system to perform all monetary functions, from getting currency into circulation to conducting monetary policy. That is the reason why the government institution entrusted with the mystical power to “print money” cannot, even when it needs to, put money in people’s hands.       Figure 2, in contrast, models the MttP system. MttPs are issued by institutions when paying wages, and their employees spread MttPs out by making payments for essential goods and services. Banks, in turn, must accept payments in MttP or exchange MttPs for dollar balances in bank accounts with no loss of value. Only at that point do MttPs reach the central bank, which receives MttPs from the banks in exchange for reserves. Reserves are also issued by the central bank but only used to settle payments among the central bank, the banks, and the government.      The MttP model directly tackles unemployment by granting the power to issue the new currency to public and private institutions responsible for paying wages. No existing asset has to be encumbered, and no liability is created when an employer issues MttPs to pay its employees. In this sense, MttPs are created out of nothing and only become an asset once they appear in the digital wallets of the employees.      Operationally, employers with an identification number for tax purposes (the EIN in the U.S.) would be required to set digital wallets for their employees holding a taxpayer identification number (either ITIN or SSN). These wallets could be developed by fintech firms, like PayPal or Coinbase, using technology that already exists. But the wallets would be validated and ultimately managed by the central bank. Moreover, as all users would be identified by their tax identification number, the wallets would be automatically compliant with anti-money laundering rules.      Once the local or national government declared a state of emergency, all affected employers would be automatically authorized to pay up to a certain amount of the next wages in MttPs – say, $1,000, which is close to the average weekly earnings in the U.S. In this case, employees who received $900 in cash every week would now receive 900 MttPs in their digital wallets. Employees who usually received a $2,400 weekly deposit would get 1,000 MttPs in the digital wallet and $1,400 in the bank account. For the U.S., with almost 160 million people employed before the pandemic struck, this individual cap would limit the monthly issuance of MttPs to the equivalent of about $640 billion.    By enabling the prompt delivery of a targeted stimulus program with deferred costs, the MttP system overcomes the limitations of the current monetary system when facing extreme circumstances.    Employees would then be able to use the MttP balance on their digital wallets to make payments for essential goods and services. For that to happen, it would be mandatory at least for institutional landlords, utility providers, grocery stores, and financial institutions to set up corporate digital wallets to receive payments in MttPs. These institutions could, in turn, make payments among them using MttPs or exchange MttPs for dollar balances in their bank accounts at a one-on-one conversion rate.      For market participants, MttPs would be a liquid asset to pay for goods and services. But when banks finally transferred MttPs to the central bank in exchange for newly issued reserves, a central bank liability, these MttPs would turn into a non-performing asset. For the central bank, MttPs would retain some value only to the extent they could eventually be shifted to the treasury with the corresponding reduction in the central bank’s liabilities.    The digital dollar we need now    MttPs would create an incentive for employers to keep workers on the payroll, thus avoiding extensive furloughs even in the face of store closures and plunging demand. But MttPs would be issued solely for wage payments. Other employers’ creditors, like suppliers and service providers, would continue to be paid in dollars. The MttP system aims not to substitute for the traditional monetary and banking systems but to offer a supplementary monetary channel that could be used to prevent massive layoffs and severe unemployment.      Although otherwise unencumbered for employers, MttPs should come with one condition to prevent fraud and abuse. As employers would self-declare the payroll, set digital wallets for their employees, and directly make the related payments, employers would have the legal obligation to hold the payroll unchanged for the same length of time the emergency lasted. After the emergency was over, the employer would continue to pay, now in dollars, the same wages paid during the emergency period, except for the employees who decided to quit the job.      For formal employees, MttPs would enable a direct and timely relief that would have positive externalities. If employees kept receiving their wages and, in turn, were able to meet their basic payments, the economy could still suffer a slowdown but would not grind to a halt. Without the burden of unpaid wages and the repercussions that follow, like loads of outstanding debts and broken contracts, commercial and financial markets as well as the judicial system could keep running more smoothly.      See also: How a Flurry of ‘Digital Dollar’ Proposals Made It to Congress      The MttP system would, moreover, allow the central bank to bridge what Agustín Carstens, the head of the Bank for International Settlements, recently called the “last mile.” As he rightly underscores, “central bank interventions to quell the crisis need to reach the individuals and businesses who are ultimately affected.” The MttP model could also reduce the need for the central bank to rely on unconventional measures to soothe financial and capital markets. With the trove of institutional and personal data generated by the digital wallets in real time, the central bank could make a more accurate decision on when and how to provide additional support for specific sectors or institutions.      MttPs could also serve as a sandbox for CBDCs. As I elaborate in another post, modeling a CBDC demands running cost-benefit analysis of several technological, social, economic, political, and legal issues. And it seems the more central banks agonize over these issues, the further away CBDCs get from implementation. Since MttPs would be limited in scope, they would be easier and faster to launch and would not disrupt the traditional monetary and banking systems or pose a significant privacy threat.      Finally, because MttPs would be issued by employers and would reach the central bank only after circulating in the economy, the government would have time to frame the crisis response and manage its costs after it had already started. Depending on inflationary and fiscal constraints, the government could design the MttP injection as a monetary stimulus, keeping MttPs on the central bank’s balance sheet for an extended period. Or it could opt for a fiscal stimulus, creating the conditions for the central bank to transfer the MttPs to the treasury at once. This feature of the MttP system could be particularly useful for countries experiencing tough economic times even before the pandemic.      The MttP model brings, thus, not only a more efficient sovereign money for times of crisis but also a powerful mechanism to promote the goal of maximum employment, directing help to people and, with that, benefiting businesses and the economy – not the other way around. By enabling the prompt delivery of a targeted stimulus program with deferred costs, the MttP system overcomes the limitations of the current monetary system when facing extreme circumstances.

Called SmartSessions, the Ethereum-based crypto paywall developed by 2key New Economics allows firms and ""solopreneurs"" to take advantage of crypto payments when offering services through Zoom.      The company told CoinDesk in an email the solution would help people pushed out of their normal premises – for example, teachers of activities such as yoga, advisers or mentors – a way to offer video sessions and still receive payments.      See also: Crypto’s Zoom Moment Is Coming      SmartSessions utilizes the Ethereum network and smart contracts, via 2key's existing SmartLink platform, to create a number of automated and self-managed features.      After a session is set up in the app, it generates a personalized Zoom link and sends it to the target audience, processing payments automatically. Session hosts can also view metrics for data such as ticket sales and invite views.      Tickets for Zoom sessions can currently be purchased with ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH). 2key said automated swaps between ether and dai, tether (USDT) and trueUSD (TUSD) are coming soon via crypto liquidity network Kyber. Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto options are slated to be available next quarter.      Ticket purchasers will be able to buy ether using a credit card within the app, paying with a choice of 17 different fiat currencies. Third parties are also able to earn ETH rewards for sharing the Zoom invites, getting a portion of any ticket sales they generate.      Currently, businesses wanting to take payment for Zoom sessions will need to use PayPal or bank transfers, with each attendee needing to be billed separately.      2key said problematic ""Zoom-bombing"" – whereby unwanted parties join a call for the purposes of disruption –would likely be a non-issue as only paying parties will have access to a session.

42431801,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6Tth,1587631500,dYdX’s Crypto Loans Hit $1B Amid Coronavirus-Led Volatility,"Decentralized margin trading exchange dYdX has seen loan originations spike in recent months as traders borrowed digital assets to exploit volatile market conditions.      The San Francisco-based project said Saturday it had lent more than a billion dollars worth of loans over the past 12 months. Until January, monthly volumes had been below $100 million, but a sudden spike in February and March, which together accounted for approximately $700 million, took dYdX's 12-month volumes up past the billion-dollar threshold.      dYdX is an Ethereum-based decentralized lending protocol backed by Andreesen Horowitz, Polychain Capital and Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong that allows users to lend, borrow and trade ether, dai, and USDC at up to four times (4x) leverage. Users can borrow at 1.25x the collateral value that is held in a smart contract, rather than by the exchange itself.      Data supplied by dYdX shows total trading volumes also rose from approximately $4 million to $20 million in the final part of 2019. Increasing activity then saw volumes surge above $150 million in February and further up to $202 million by March.      See also: Coinbase Custody Doubles Down on DeFi Governance Options      Founder Antonio Juliano told CoinDesk traders flocked to the exchange to use its margin trading facility when crypto volatility surged upwards because of the growing coronavirus pandemic. ""People like to trade (and especially trade with leverage) when there is volatility,"" he said via email.      dYdX's head of operations, Zhuoxun Yin, explained that borrowing increased with volatility because traders maximized exposure to fast-changing market climes. ""February and March saw much more volatility in crypto markets relative to recent months so we saw a corresponding increase in both borrowing and trading volume on dYdX – both were record months for us,"" he said, also in an email.      While volatility in some traditional asset classes, such as oil, have actually exceeded cryptocurrencies, the market turmoil created by the coronavirus outbreak nonetheless created a spike in activity on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.      Decentralized exchange Uniswap said its all-time high for volumes practically doubled in mid-March as traders jumped to take advantage of crazy price swings. dYdX was forced to keep changing its fee structures to deal with a considerable order backlog.      See also: Dai Lending Rates Rise to One-Month High on DeFi Platform Compound      Although Juliano admitted that dYdX trading volumes and new loan originations had already started to tail off as volatility levels have dipped, he said they were still way above where they were in January.

The Reformation and Development Commission of the Xiong'An district in Hebei province reportedly convened a meeting on Wednesday regarding the rollout of a pilot for China's digital yuan initiative, a local news outlet reported on Thursday, citing a government document.      The move signals China's wider efforts to test the digital currency project, with state-owned commercial banks already developing wallet applications for the digital yuan, also known as DC/EP.      The news outlet said the meeting involved representatives from government agencies, China's four state-owned commercial banks, Ant Financial, Tencent as well as 19 restaurants, entertainment and retail shops that will participate in the test.      Notable names include McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway, JD Supermarkets in the area, among others. The report does not specify when the test would likely start or how long it will last.      CoinDesk has reached out to the government agency, but had not heard back at press time.      It was reported last week the Agricultural Bank of China has already developed a test user interface for a DC/EP wallet that features how the digital yuan would be transacted.

42431792,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN6Tfh,1587616200,China's Rainy Season Is Coming. This Time Bitcoin Miners Aren't Investing,"Spring is usually a welcome time of year for bitcoin mining businesses in China. The upcoming rainy season brings excessive hydropower, making electricity cheap and mining more profitable ... all else equal.      This year, however, two key variables have changed, upending the calculus for operators of mining facilities and for miners themselves in the world’s hub for this activity.      After recovering from March’s brutal selloff, bitcoin’s price has been stagnating around $7,000. As a result, mining farms that offer hosting services are struggling to find enough customers to fill capacity.      Further, the standstill comes just before the network’s halving event, due in less than 20 days, which will put further pressure on revenues in the multibillion-dollar bitcoin mining industry.      Read also: Bitcoin’s Halving, Explained.      The situation presents a conundrum for miners: whether to buy new, more powerful equipment; and if not, when to switch off older models, and when to switch them on again. The winning move will depend on how things play out after the halving, which is far from certain.      “If bitcoin’s price doesn’t go up post-halving, then who’s going to buy new equipment to fulfill this capacity?” said Huang Fangyu, co-founder of ValarHash, the company behind the mining pool 1THash, which owns facilities primarily for self-mining in Sichuan and sells cloud mining contracts.    20 percent off    As they game out the scenarios, miners at least enjoy a glut of space to host their machines. Mining facilities in China’s water-abundant southwestern provinces during the summer are offering electricity prices for as much as 20 percent lower than what they did last year in order to attract investors, industry experts say.      Research firm CoinShares estimated in a December report that China accounted for 65 percent of bitcoin’s global computing power and the southwestern Sichuan province alone accounted for over 50 percent of the network’s total.      Huang said based on his observations, the average offer by facilities for hosting services now ranges between 0.2 to 0.22 yuan ($0.028 to $0.031) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). He estimates it could go below the lower end when the rainy season starts in May and June.      Charles Chao Yu, chief operating officer at the mining pool F2Pool, also said this year’s offer is certainly in the neighborhood of $0.031 per kWh following last month’s price crash as mining farms have to lower their margin to compete for customers.      For context, the average electricity cost last year in China’s mountainous Sichuan and Yunnan provinces was between 0.24 and 0.25 yuan, around $0.035 per kWh.      A seemingly negligible difference of even just 0.01 yuan, or $0.0014, makes all the difference for bitcoin mining. For a site that runs a capacity of 100 megawatt-hour (mWh), that difference would mean a daily cost saving of $3,360 and over $100,000 per month.      At a time when bitcoin mining’s block reward is about to drop from 12.5 units per block to 6.25 in less than 20 days, saving on electricity would be as important as using more efficient mining equipment.      China-based mining pool Poolin recently conducted a survey to scope out mining farms with hydro-power resources in China’s southwest regions. Poolin’s co-founder Chris Zhu Fa said based on the firm’s calculation, there will be 3 to 5 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of capacity during the summer this year with about 1 GWh that he believes is reliable in terms of pricing and qualification.      Huang estimates mining facilities in Sichuan overall have a capacity of about 4 GWh while Yunnan has about 2 GWh.    A complex equation    Bitcoin mining’s total average computing power has recently climbed to 113 million terahashes per second (TH/s), a rebound following a 16 percent drop last month. Assuming all of this computing power comes from widely used machines in the market like the WhatsMiner M20S, which has an average efficiency of 50 watt per TH/s, the total network could be consuming around 6 gigawatt of electricity worldwide in an hour. (For context, that is roughly what 600 U.S. households consumed in 2018.)      But if bitcoin’s price remains at its current level of $7,000 after halving, older mining equipment is expected to shut down, which would lead to decrease of the network’s hashing power, making it even harder for farms that need customers to fulfill their capacity.      That said, bitcoin mining is a dynamic market and game theory comes into play.      If bitcoin mining’s competition and total hashrate drop after the halving resulting from some operators shutting down older models, then those who stick around would be able to receive more mined coins, resulting in older models to come online again.      “It would be normal to see bitcoin network’s hashrate drop to 60 to 70 million TH/s after halving,” said Liu Fei, who manages self-mining facilities at Chinese bitcoin startup Bixin, during a recent online panel hosted by Chinese crypto media ODaily.      “But when the mining competition drops in June, with mining farms offering more electricity promotions and sourcing second hand equipment to fulfill their capacities, we may see the hashrate go back to 100-120 million TH/s again,” he said.    Buying spree cools    But what’s underneath these dynamics is the fact that the buying spree for new unused and more powerful equipment has cooled down, which is different from the situation last year and also one factor that leads to mining farms’ challenges in on-boarding enough customers.      For instance, at this time last year, bitcoin’s mining hashrate was not even 50 million TH/s. Bitcoin’s price, although lower than what is right now, was on an upward trend. These factors drove demand for new mining equipment to outstrip manufacturers’ supplies, boosting the network’s hashrate to 100 million TH/s by the end of December.      Then came the coronavirus outbreak, and eventually the March market meltdown.      “The March 12 sell-off also caused a lack of confidence among investors in purchasing new equipment at a large scale,” Liu said. “So it’s likely going to be a game for existing inventories during the entire summer season.”      Valarhash’s Huang echoed that sentiment. “The hashrate after halving will drop to a point that older miners like the AntMiner S9 could become profitable again with electricity promotions by mining farms,” he said. “Then the hashrate will go up and some will have to turn off again. That will be a headache.”      And the last month’s sell-off also forced liquidations by many miner operators who had pledged bitcoin for loans, leaving many short on cash at the moment, Huang said. Thus, at this point, investors are taking a step back to wait and see how the market will react after halving before they spend money on new equipment.    ‘Selling iron’    But as mining facilities struggle to sign customers, others may see opportunities in the secondhand market as older mining equipment is being sold at unprecedentedly cheap prices.      For instance, distributors on Alibaba.com are advertising used AntMiner S9s in the secondhand market for $20 to $80 per unit, depending on their conditions. At the height of the crypto market’s 2017 craze, a single unit of AntMiner S9 could cost over $3,000.      “Now it’s like selling iron with mining chips as a giveaway,” Huang said. “But those that have the access to extremely cheap electricity during the summer could still accumulate such stocks to either make a quick buck in the summer or to fulfill unused electricity at mining facilities.”      To be sure, at the bitcoin network’s current difficulty and price, the AntMiner S9 could still yield a gross margin of just under 50 percent at an electricity cost of $0.03 per kWh.      If bitcoin’s price remains at the current level after halving, S9s could still be marginally profitable once mining competition declines. And the option is available for miner operators to lower the voltage for these older models in order to improve their profitability.      “It all boils down to the price of bitcoin,” Huang said. “If it goes back to $10,000, problem solved. Almost every machine can go back running again.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/23/chinas-rainy-season-is-coming-this-time-bitcoin-miners-arent-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/579e9f1512b3b863c9563825d36058e64e1dd02a-1000x668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
