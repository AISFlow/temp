42426192,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk3dh,1418425120,Florida LocalBitcoins User Loses Bid to Dismiss Money Transmitter Charge,"A Florida circuit court judge has issued a ruling suggesting that individual bitcoin dealers could be considered money transmitters under state statutes.  Lawyers representing the defendant, 29-year-old Pascal Reid, had sought to strike down the charge, one of three, on the interpretation that a state resident would need to be a money services business (MSB) or operating on behalf of such an entity to be in violation of the law.  The decision, delivered today by Circuit Court Judge Fleur Lobree, argued that a ""plain reading"" of the statute infers that the state's definition of an MSB includes ""any person [...] who acts as a payment instrument seller, foreign currency exchanger, check casher or money transmitter"", and that such persons must be licensed to perform these activities.  Lobree's decision reads:  ""Florida statutes prohibits a person from engaging in a money services business without a license. Therefore, [...] the defendant meets the requirements to be charged with engaging in the money service business as a money transmitter without being licensed.""  The update is the latest in the case of Florida native and LocalBitcoins user Reid, who in February was arrested and charged with violating the state's anti-money laundering (AML) and money transmission laws.  Reid was arrested alongside Michell Abner Espinoza for agreeing to sell $30,000 worth of bitcoin to undercover officers at 20% above market value. Most recently in May, the judge struck down a money laundering charge issued in the case.  Notably, only Reid has moved to dismiss the money transmission charge, though both parties were charged with the crime at the time of arrest.  Opinion blasted by lawyer  Speaking to CoinDesk, Reid's attorney Ronald Lowy took aim at the decision, while emphasizing his belief that his client will be vindicated at a jury trial next year.  ""This law wasn't intended to apply against individuals who simply exchange bitcoins,"" Lowy said. ""It would be no different than if an individual were to sell rare coins, rare stamps or to conduct a garage sale and give anything of value in exchange for currency.""  Lowy argued that the judge's interpretation of the law is overly broad and unlikely to hold up in court, implying that it could capture those who hold anything of value and seek to exchange it for currency.  ""That would basically make everyone in our capitalist society in violation of the statute,"" he added.  Further, he stressed that the decision did not address the fact that bitcoin is not considered to be a currency under US law. Lowy asserted that such a definition should not apply as bitcoin is not listed as a currency or backed by a government entity, though the judge's statements suggest it could be considered a ""payment instrument"".  Impact unknown  What the case will mean for the bitcoin community is less clear. The Bitcoin Foundation had previously filed an amicus curiae in the case, arguing that the outcome would have a great impact on all bitcoin users in the US.  At the time, Brian Klein of the Foundation's Legal Advocacy Committee, wrote in a blog post :  ""The foundation’s position at its core is this: state prosecutors are improperly applying Florida statutes regulating 'money service businesses' to individuals conducting peer-to-peer sales of bitcoins.""  Lowy indicated that it remains too early to appeal the judge's decision, and expressed his belief that, ultimately, a jury would help overrule the determination.  ""We'll have to wait for the trial, but we're confident that we'll likely win the trial when the jury looks at the facts,"" he said.  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story.

42426197,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk3nh,1418400927,American Express CEO: Bitcoin Protocol Will Be Important,"The CEO and chairman of American Express spoke out on digital currencies at the New York Times DealBook conference in Manhattan on Thursday.  The day-long conference is an annual summit of top financial services and government leaders, who gather to discuss their outlooks on the political and economic landscape.  The eponym of the conference, the New York Times DealBook blog, quoted Amex's Kenneth Chenault acknowledging bitcoin's disruptive potential and taking aim at those who suggest bitcoin could displace the credit card industry.  While it may be that many in the traditional finance space have focused on bitcoin's perceived risks as barriers to adoption, Chenault offered a blend of balance and insight when considering the threat the new technology might pose to his industry.  Chenault said:  “The reality is, we compete with any form of payments.”  “There’s a reason credit cards were invented,” he pointed out, saying that over and above merely being able to make payments, consumers also want the ability to defer them.  Notably, cryptocurrency lending startups do already exist, such as BitcoinLendingClub and BTCJam, though they don't offer the instantaneous flexibility provided by a credit card.  Chenault has served in his position at American Express since 2001.  Eyeing the protocol  Proponents of bitcoin tout its low fees and speedy transactions as key advantages that should persuade user to adopt its use as a payment method.  Chenault said he sees more promise, though, in bitcoin’s underlying technology than in its use as a currency.  “The protocol of bitcoin is going to be important,” he said, likening digital currencies to the likes of Napster and iTunes, products that drove rapid change in the music industry.  While refusing to predict the how future competition between the payment systems might pan out, Chenault seemed unthreatened.  “I think there’s room for a lot of players,” he said.  Mixed views on bitcoin  A number of prominent figures in financial services have offered mixed views on digital currencies over the last year.  Within the last two weeks, Matthew Driver, MasterCard’s president for South East Asia, issued a strong rebuke of digital currencies, suggesting that they carry too many risks to be successful.  In March, US economist Nouriel Roubini aimed a flurry of heavily critical comments at the cryptocurrency and its supporters via Twitter saying:  “So bitcoin isn't a currency. It is [by the way] a Ponzi game and a conduit for criminal/illegal activities. And it isn't safe given hacking of it.”  However, other luminaries in the space have been more fair in their appraisal of the burgeoning technology.  Noted entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson voiced his support for bitcoin ahead of the Global Digital Currency Conversation in Brisbane, Australia, in November, saying, payments systems have ""a lot to gain from bitcoin’s presence"".  That same month former Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit came out in favour of digital currencies, stating they have ""promise of changing the world"".

42426194,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk3fh,1418395306,'Good Samaritan' Blockchain Hacker Who Returned 267 BTC Speaks Out,"UPDATE (15th December 11:15 GMT): Hacker johoe's transaction history indicates he has received a further 244.2 BTC from compromised Blockchain wallets since 8.23pm yesterday evening (GMT).  When contacted by CoinDesk, Blockchain president Peter Smith confirmed that johoe's funds had been taken from the same wallet addresses as before. This indicates that certain users are unaware of the hack or have continued to use their compromised wallets despite the company's warnings, he said.  Johoe has been contacted for further comment on the issue.      The 'Good Samaritan' hacker who recently returned 267 BTC he took from compromised Blockchain wallets has revealed how he was able to collect the funds and given advice to bitcoin holders wanting to secure their money.  The computer scientist and researcher, who goes by the handle 'johoe' on Bitcoin Talk, told CoinDesk that each day he runs a script he has written that scans recently added data from the bitcoin blockchain and looks for repeated 'R values'.  He said:  ""Every bitcoin transaction is signed by two values – 'R' and 'S' – which prove that the sender knows the private key. If the same R value is used twice, the private key can be easily computed from the signatures alone.""  Johoe has been posting examples of such 'broken' addresses on Bitcoin Talk for over a year.  Spate of broken keys  Upon running the script last Monday morning, he said he recognized immediately that it had found something. The script, which had discovered only about 500 such 'broken' keys in the bitcoin blockchain's five-year history, had suddenly unveiled 500 more in a single day.  A second script he wrote scanned the public ledger to see if any funds had been sent to those addresses, and was startled to see the amount.  ""I had prepared some scripts to assist finding and spending the money from the broken addresses, but I hadn't prepared it for this scale.""  He sorted the transactions, starting with the most valuable ones and sweeping the funds from the broken addresses into one he controlled.  The scripts prepared and signed the transactions, double-checking for correctness and transaction fees, about one every two or three minutes. Some, such as freshly mined bitcoins that can only be spent after 100 confirmations, took longer.  Collecting insecure balances  After nearly an hour, johoe had accumulated the first 150 BTC. He ran his scripts again on the entire 30GB+ blockchain, which took longer, but eventually netted a further 60 BTC.  Once all the transactions had been confirmed, johoe posted on Bitcoin Talk that he had the bitcoins and intended to return them to their rightful owners once the problem was fixed.  Why, when he could easily have kept the money all for himself, did he decide to do a good deed?  ""I decided this beforehand. I make enough money with my day job that I can live on it. Also this way I don't have to worry that someday someone will find it out. In hindsight, this was a very good decision.""  Running the scripts once more on the entire ledge swept a further 38 BTC into johoe's wallet.  After seeing Blockchain's public post announcing the security issue, he connected the dots and realized these accounts must be the source of all the compromised addresses he had found.  The company contacted him after he posted his message to Bitcoin Talk. He then provided Blockchain with copies of his scripts so they would be able to notify the affected users.  Blockchain safe 'in principle'  Johoe posted again on Bitcoin Talk, saying that the first 'buggy transaction' took place on 7th December at 21:53:26 UTC.  ""In principle, it should be safe to use Blockchain.info again, but I still see some bad transactions"", he wrote on yesterday. The continuing problems could be due to browser cache issues, he added, advising any users to clear their cache and visit their Blockchain account again.  Any users who sent money, or created a new wallet address on 7th-8th December should consider their addresses broken, he said. Even if it was not published on his list of 1,019 known addresses, he could not pinpoint exactly at what time the problem ended.  As an added caution, johoe said that anyone who visited their online Blockchain wallet during that period may have picked up the buggy script in their browser cache, which could potentially affect future address creation or transactions.  Users of Blockchain's mobile apps on iOS and Android, and the Chrome browser extension, were not affected.  For the past few days, Blockchain's team has been working hard to process claims and return funds – once the claims have been verified as being genuine.  Johoe said Blockchain had presented him with a ""reasonable reward"" for his efforts.  Hardware wallet security  Johoe's own wallet solution, as (now famously) evidenced by his Bitcoin Talk post, is a Trezor 'Vault' hardware wallet produced by SatoshiLabs.  ""It made me feel a lot safer than having the private key for 267 BTC on my computer,"" he said.  A hardware solution like the Trezor's isolates the private key from the Internet, meaning in principle it is impossible for a remote party to steal it. His only worry was that the device might somehow malfunction, but in the end it ""managed everything gracefully"", despite taking around one and a half minutes to sign the transaction returning the bitcoins.  The only disadvantage with the Trezor device, johoe said, is the only current end-user backup support is the myTrezor Web Wallet, which does not work on mobile devices.  Mobile and spending solutions  Otherwise, johoe recommends a client that employs HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets, such as Bread Wallet on iOS and Armory, Electrum or Wallet32 on Android.  These wallets generate key pairs (private and public) from an original seed phrase that needs only be saved somewhere safe once, and can recover balances from that seed even if a physical device is lost, stolen, or damaged.  Even so, portable solutions are best for spending money only, with larger amounts kept 'cold' or completely offline.  ""For larger funds, I would not recommend to keep the private key on a computer. There are too many trojans around that specializes on stealing bitcoin wallets.""  Even protecting keys with a strong password might not be enough, johoe concluded, if malware has installed a key logger on a user's computer that could grab the password and transmit it to a bad actor.  Cryptography image via Shutterstock      UPDATE: A previous version of this article stated that johoe had returned 255 BTC. He has since confirmed that this figure has risen to 267 BTC, attributing the additional 12 BTC to addresses that were only compromised later, due to a browser cache issue.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION | WALLET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/12/good-samaritan-blockchain-hacker-who-returned-267-btc-speaks-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e33f460b5068d7ac709d3d629cc85baa683a7da-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426209,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk4Bh,1418389692,Ledger Launches USB Bitcoin Wallet With 'Bank-Grade' Security,"The team behind a new affordable multisig bitcoin wallet say their product has security features that make it almost immune to hacking attacks.  The Ledger Wallet Nano is the result of a merger between three French startups: La Maison du Bitcoin, a bitcoin centre in Paris; BTChip, a hardware wallet manufacturer; and Chronocoin, an exchange platform.  Priced at €34.90 (or 0.1213 BTC), the USB device contains a banking-grade EAL5+ smartcard, the same as found in credit cards. Additionally, as a hierarchical deterministic wallet (BIP32), the Ledger can hold an infinite number of bitcoin addresses.  Connecting to each user's computer through their USB port, the device carries out cryptographic work, such as signing bitcoin transactions, inside its own protected environment. Once safely initialised, it can even be used without risk on an insecure or compromised computer, its makers claim.  Lessons from past hacks  Notable hacks  in the bitcoin space over the last year have highlighted the need for improved wallet security.  While two-factor authorisation, multisig and the other technological improvements being ushered in by online and mobile wallet providers do offer some peace of mind, the general advice is to keep any significant amount of bitcoin in 'cold storage', such as paper wallets or drives not connected to the Internet.  Dedicated hardware wallets are increasingly being pitched as solutions that offer equivalent or greater security with added convenience. Hence, the recent arrival of new devices such as the Trezor wallet, and the ongoing development of other solutions, such as CryptoLabs' Case.  In turn, the Ledger Nano is an evolution from BTChip's original multisig HW-1 hardware wallet.  Eric Larchevêque, co-founder and CEO of Ledger, told CoinDesk that, despite all its challenges, bitcoin brings many opportunities for startups. ""We had, from the beginning, identified consumers' bitcoins protection as critical,"" he said.  Producing affordable, more secure bitcoin storage was an obvious area for the firm to enter, Larchevêque added, explaining:  ""Hardware wallets are essential to the development of bitcoin. We strongly believe in decentralized, open and affordable products. This is one of the main reasons to have chosen smartcards. On top of the added security layers given by decades of research and development, production costs are extremely low.""  How it works  To use the Ledger Nano, all the user needs is the device itself, the supplied 'second factor card', a computer (with Windows, Mac or Linux OS) with a USB port and a recent version of Google Chrome.  The wallet interfaces with the user's computer through a dedicated Chrome app, which must be pre-installed. No additional software installation or account creation is needed, the team says.  After initialization of the Ledger, the user is provided with a deposit public address to which they will be able to send their bitcoins for storage.  To allow the wallet to be restored in the event of loss or theft of the device, a mnemonic seed for a master key is randomly generated when the device is initialised, which must be written on a paper backup and stored safely.  Importantly, the wallet does not need to be restored onto another Ledger wallet, any BIP39 compliant software solution will work.  Security features  To be able to access their bitcoin, Ledger users will need three things: the Ledger Wallet, a PIN and a second factor card. If one of these elements is missing they will not be able to sign a transaction.  This behaviour, the firm says, is guaranteed by the use of the smartcard, which offers a banking-grade ""walled garden"" that conceals any critical information and would ""take weeks"" to crack, even if a hacker had possession of the device.  The company's website states:  ""There is no known attack vector which could result in the exposure of your private keys or bitcoins. Even if your computer was totally compromised and was able to replace the sending address of a transaction on its own, the second-factor verification would prevent it from doing so.""  Even if malware on the computer could steal the PIN, the company says, it would still not possible to execute a transaction, since a second-factor verification is mandatory.  The 'second factor' is a unique security card (pictured above) that is paired with the device upon assembly in the factory, Larchevêque explained. It is used to verify the payment address (so users know malware didn't change it), or, in the near future, to pair a mobile app with the wallet, which will then act itself as the second factor. The mobile app option should become available in January, he added.  ""Malware cannot even reset the wallet by sending three wrong PINs, because before trying a new PIN it is necessary to unplug and replug physically the wallet to the USB port,"" the firm's website says.  A future version of the Ledger will sport even more features, according to Larchevêque:  ""We are in the process of assembling and testing 100 prototypes implementing various stages of our developments (NFC, BLE, screens etc). We think we'll be production ready in the next six months, soon launching a hardware wallet compatible with desktops, mobiles and POS for NFC one-tap payments.""  Importantly, that upcoming screen will address the one weakness that the team concedes with the device: if the Ledger is initialised on a compromised PC, the seed can be stolen. Hence, it says, it is absolutely essential to first use the Nano on a secure computer.  Bright future ahead  BTChip started working on the HW-1 in 2012 and launched the product back in September, before joining with its new partners on the Ledger project.  Larchevêque indicated that all Ledger's research and development has been self-financed so far. ""Now that we have a product ready,"" he said, ""we are focusing on growth and are in the process of raising a seed round to finance our expansion.""  In the conversation with CoinDesk, the company's CEO was extremely positive about the future for the Ledger product and hardware wallets in general.  He said:  ""Average users won't accept complex or insecure products. Horror stories about people losing all their funds due to malware attacks will be used as cautionary tales. Thus only one-stop-shop centralised services or seamless secure hardware-based wallets will gain massive traction. Insecure solutions will just disappear.""
