42402778,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcrF6,1554759009,Next Bitcoin Core Release to Finally Connect Hardware Wallets to Full Nodes,"It's a moment true bitcoin nerds have been waiting for.  In the coming release of Bitcoin Core, the 18th major version of the cryptocurrency's most widely used software, the code will finally, natively allow users to connect bitcoin full nodes to hardware wallets.  It sounds technical, but it's a big step for the security for users. Bitcoin full nodes allow users to verify that transactions actually took place, meanwhile, hardware wallets are considered one of the most secure ways to store bitcoin. Thus, making it easier to join the two together is a big win for users who want full control of their bitcoin – and don't want to lose it.  Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, who is in charge of coordinating the coming upgrade, told CoinDesk it's one of the features he's been most excited about for quite some time.  Still, the change is part of a much broader effort to make bitcoin full nodes easier to use for people other than just tech geeks. Casa, for example, has launched a node that works without much setup necessary, while developers of the bitcoin protocol are constantly trying to reduce how much data users need to store to run one (as users need to store every transaction ever sent on the blockchain, it's pretty weighty).  As Bitcoin Core contributor Andrew Chow, one of the lead developers on the project, put it on Twitter:  ""With this [pull request] merged, the upcoming Bitcoin Core 0.18 release will be finally usable with hardware wallets by using [Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI)].""  He admits it's ""still command line only and manual,"" but argued ""it's a big step forward"" because the functionality is finally there, even if in a somewhat clunky form. Developers will continue to make it easier to use down the line.  Eating your cake  So first off, why use a bitcoin full node in the first place?  In order to send a transaction on the bitcoin network, users need to connect to a bitcoin node. Full nodes now require a couple of hundred gigabytes of data, which is a lot, enough to fill a small laptop.  But it does serve a purpose, as rather than trust that someone else is feeding you the correct financial information, such as whether you really received a transaction or not, you're able to validate this information yourself.  As the value proposition of bitcoin is to not trust others, some developers go as far as to argue that using bitcoin in a way that removes the full node defeats the purpose of bitcoin.  Bitcoin Core contributor Sjors Provoost, for example, has argued that running a full node is helpful for ""knowing your bitcoin is real,"" offering the example of Segwit2x, a proposed bitcoin fork from 2017 in which some companies, miners, and users proposed upgrading bitcoin to a larger block size.  There was concern that in the case Segwit2x broke bitcoin into two, mobile wallets relying on Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) technology would be susceptible to trickery from miners.  ""That server can in theory also lie about your balance. In a scenario like SegWit2x, it could decide which side of the fork it wants to show you. With a full node you don't have to worry about that,"" Provoost told CoinDesk.  Then there's the issue of privacy.  ""The wallet software that normally comes with hardware wallets reveals your addresses to a third-party server,"" Provoost continued. The full node would replace this wallet software, giving users privacy again.  ""At the end of the day, it comes down to the trade-off between convenience and trust,"" Bitcoin Core wallet maintainer Samuel Dobson told CoinDesk.  These problems are what's fueling the idea that maybe one day ""everyone"" should run this full node software, so they don't have to trust anyone else to send them accurate financial information.  ""Yes, I believe that everybody will eventually run a full node. I wish a future where not having a full node will severely limit your user experience and the realm of things you can do with bitcoin,"" as BTCPay creator Nicolas Dorier wrote in a recent blog post.  Secure, offline bitcoin  The other piece is hardware wallets are considered the most secure way to store bitcoin. That's especially true when compared to storing them on internet-connected computers, which are often totally exposed to hackers.  ""PCs are a much larger attack surface than a small dedicated device to store your keys, designed specifically with security in mind. They're also less prone to random crashes or corruption which could cause you to lose un-backed-up keys on your computer,"" Dobson told CoinDesk.  With this new tech in place in the Bitcoin Core software, users can store their bitcoin on an offline hardware wallet, then use their full node to verify the data they're getting fed, such as transaction data, is correct.  The technology has been a long-time coming. Connecting hardware to a full node is also one of the key goals of Electrum Personal Server, pioneered by developer Chris Belcher. ""Hopefully this software can be part of the plan to get full node wallets into the hands of as many people as possible,"" he said in the project announcement post last year.  There are pros and cons to each project, though, Provoost admitted.  ""The HWI project should reduce the number of separate software components needed, though at the moment I think it's still less user-friendly [than Electrum Personal Server],"" he said.  And there's still a ways to go to get the graphical interface totally working. ""Maybe one day in the future we'll have this graphical picture that I showed you – and after that we'll have unicorns,"" Provoost said in his presentationhttps://vimeo.com/316634495 on the topic.  Further features  While hardware wallet support in 0.18 has generated much excitement, As usual, the release is filled with other contributions from the pool of global Bitcoin Core contributors.  Dobson told CoinDesk about a few features he finds ""exciting,"" including refinements to a new ""language"" that the groundwork was laid for in an earlier version of Bitcoin Core. New commands will allow developers to use this language to ""import descriptors.""  ""You can provide such a descriptor to Core [...] and it will parse it and import the keys, scripts, etc. into your wallet for you,"" Dobson said, explaining further:  ""This is the first step in a longer term goal to rework the wallet and support these descriptors natively within it, which will clean things up immensely and provide a much more natural behaviours, in line with how you would expect things to behave (and which don't exactly behave that way currently).""  Dobson also pointed to a new ""multiwallet"" command, which will allow users to pair with multiple wallets within their bitcoin core full node. While the ability to use multiple wallets at once has existed in the code previously, 0.18.0 plugs the feature in the graphical user interface for the first time, so people no longer have to be full-blown developers using the command line to take advantage of the feature.  ""Version 0.18 adds support to the GUI to do that, as well as a few improvements in how it works too,"" Dobson said.  As of now, version 0.18 is in the ""release candidate"" stage of the software development cycle, meaning passionate bitcoin developers and companies are still testing it, picking away at the code in an effort to eradicate any bugs, before it's released to the larger public to download.  According to project developers, it will be available for users to download in the coming weeks.

42402758,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdco5J,1554754670,QuadrigaCX Officially Enters Bankruptcy With Millions Still Missing,"Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX should transition into bankruptcy in the coming days, a judge ruled Monday.  The ruling by Nova Source Supreme Court Judge Michael Wood means that QuadrigaCX, which has been operating under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) since the end of January, will file for bankruptcy by next week, entering what is likely to be the final chapter in the exchange's history.  To recap, the exchange first filed for creditor protection under the CCAA on Jan. 31, saying at the time that it could not access roughly $136 million in cryptocurrencies and needed assistance reclaiming another $53 million in fiat held by third-party payment processors.  While EY reported making some progress in recovering assets from third-party processors and another crypto exchange, it is unclear just how much is still in limbo.  However, as Wood, who is overseeing the case, pointed out during a previous hearing, the exchange does not appear likely to recover. Last week, Ernst and Young (EY), the court-appointed monitor for the exchange, essentially agreed, saying that ""the possibility that Quadriga will restructure and emerge from CCAA protection appears remote.""  The transition to bankruptcy will give EY, which will become the exchange's trustee, greater investigative powers over the company's missing funds, as well as allow it to begin selling off assets such as its trading platform, which could generate some revenue to make its customers whole.  Despite the decision to place Quadriga in bankruptcy, the stay of proceedings protecting the exchange and its directors from lawsuits will remain in effect a short while longer. Another hearing to discuss extending this stay was previously scheduled for April 18.  Widow's assets frozen  Wood also ruled to approve an asset preservation order against the estate of Gerald Cotten, the exchange's deceased founder, and his widow Jennifer Robertson.  Last week, EY explained that Quadriga's funds ""may have been used to acquire assets held outside the corporate entity,"" suggesting misuse.  Robertson will retain the ability to send or receive funds through two accounts with the Bank of Nova Scotia, which include a personal account and a corporate account. However, EY will oversee any such activity.  All of Robertson's other assets, including those held by her firms Robertson Nova Consulting Inc., Robertson Nova Property Management Inc. and the Seaglass Trust, will be frozen.  In addition to ruling on Robertson's assets, participants during the hearing addressed third-party payment processors which may still possess funds belonging to Quadriga.  Billerfy, Costodian and 1009926 B.C. have until April 18 to work out how they want to share information with EY. Alto Bureau de Change and Black Banx (formerly WB21) are being compelled to return any assets they hold. Another processor, VoPay, said it will turn over all funds without asking for a service fee. EY has also been granted access to the systems of another processor, POSConnect.  A number of questions remain unanswered, including whether Quadriga actually holds the funds it claims to, how many creditors there are and whether EY has had any luck in accessing the exchange's databases. A fifth progress report from EY is expected to be published by April 18.

42402757,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdco7H,1554739236,Crypto Lender Dharma Officially Launches on Ethereum Blockchain,"Opportunities to earn interest on your crypto are increasing, and Dharma is the latest to enter the fray.  Announced Monday, lending startup Dharma is now open to everyone. Lenders and borrowers are matched peer-to-peer to set up crypto lending terms in a non-custodial fashion, governed by Dharma's smart contracts.  Dharma  will differentiate itself from others in the market by offering depositors a fixed rate of return on the crypto they make available to lend.  There's a catch, though: Deposits will only earn interest when the assets are put to use by a borrower.  ""We are doing fixed-term loans with fixed rates,"" Nadav Hollander, Dharma CEO explained to CoinDesk, adding that the company has also worked hard to improve the user experience for all parties.  He said:  ""There are a handful ways to earn interst on your crypto in a non-custodial manner, pretty much all of those require a high degree of technical knowledge.""  Originally announced as an open protocol, Dharma will pivot with this news, from a protocol to a company that's facilitating the marketplace it created.  ""We made a decision strategically as a company to go user-first rather than developer-first,"" Hollander said. ""With all that being said, the underlying smart contract is still primarily open source.""  Dharma has been facilitating loans already under a pilot that reached 2,500 users, Hollander said. According to a third-party explorer called Dharmalytics created by ConsenSys alum Matt Tyndall, $1.16 million in principal has been borrowed so far across 1,575 loans (as of Friday).  These users have come in under Dharma Lever, but as the startup pivots away from the protocol approach it's retiring that name. The whole product is now just Dharma.  Brendan Forster, co-founder and COO of Dharma, said in a press release:  ""We see the broader shift to blockchain-based financial services as the beginning of a much more efficient, programmable, and equitable financial system.""  How it works  It's a lot like LendingClub, in that one person lends to another, only in this case it is all crypto.  Dharma has changed a lot since its white paper, which described a platform where outside parties would set themselves up to underwrite loans and facilitate identifying borrowers.  The firm – backed by Green Visor, Coinbase Ventures, Polychain and others – has now re-oriented itself to serve as the sole underwriter.  From a user perspective, this should not change much.  Like the other collateralized crypto lending products out there, Dharma asks that borrowers put up 150 percent of the value of their loan as collateral. Because there is much more demand to lend crypto than to borrow it, borrowers should be matched with a lender fairly quickly. Once they do, they can borrow ETH or DAI on 28-day terms with a fixed interest rate.  It's at this moment that decentralized finance really stands out, Max Bronstein, the company's marketing manager, told CoinDesk, because ""borrowers get their principal in less than 30 seconds.""  If the value of collateral drops below 125 percent of the principal, the smart contract begins liquidating the borrower's collateral.  In fact, that's one of the two key risks that users face, what Hollander calls ""volatility risk."" If the price moves badly against a borrower, they could be liquidated or suffer a painful margin call.  The other risk is technical: that Dharma might have made a mistake in writing its smart contracts. Here users are somewhat protected by audits and also the ""wisdom of the crowd"" brought to bear on open-source smart contracts.  ""Those risks are all transparently understood,"" Hollander said.  Sourcing supply  Currently, more borrowers are needed to make it all work.  To supply demand on the borrow side, the company is putting in a lot more business development work. Hedge funds that have partnered with Dharma early on to source borrow demand include Passport Capital, Formosa Capital, Spartan Capital and Wyre Capital.  ""Although there is a lot of demand for market trading, we think that by making a much more useable interface we will be able to find more use cases,"" Bronstein said.  Bronstein argues there will be demand from well-funded ICO startups with large ETH supplies and staff willing to accept DAI in lieu of dollars.  Either way, ""There is much more interest in lending cryptocurrencies than there is in borrowing them,"" Hollander said.  For now, Dharma is subsidizing lenders somewhat, as rates paid for borrowing are lower than the return lenders receive. Borrowers only pay 2 percent while a lender earns 4 percent on ETH and 5.5 percent on DAI, when their capital is in a loan.  This state of affairs is not unusual in this category right now, however.  ""Dharma is far from the only project in the space currently subsidizing the market,"" Anil Lulla, a principal at crypto data firm Delphi Digital, told CoinDesk in an email, adding:  ""Even centralized options like BlockFi are offering a 6.2 percent return for anything underneath 25 BTC and 500 ETH. These projects are all competing for people’s crypto holdings and need to subsidize temporarily to attract new depositors and quickly gain market share.""  Bronstein struck a similar note.  ""We think the winner of that battle will be on identity and brand,"" he said. ""Prices will converge.""  The DeFi stack  Borrowing and lending sound simple, but in finance, small tweaks make for completely different product lines.  With Unchained Capital and BlockFi, users put up crypto and get back fiat. With Compound, users lend and borrow in crypto, but all the rates float continuously based on real-time demand. With MakerDAO, there's no loan term at all and an effective balloon payment whenever the user wants.  Dharma probably looks the most like the sort of financing most people are familiar with, but it's still not quite like personal banking, Hollander emphasizes – except that it's built to be easy for all participants to understand.  ""Our approach is to build a non-custodial DeFi product ... that can be used from any crypto wallet, including Coinbase,"" he said.  Right now the length of all loans is 28 days. ""We are working hard to allow more optionality,"" Bronstein said, adding that the startup plans to add three- and six-month loan terms soon.  A few other aspects will change over time. Right now, Dharma subsidizes all of the user's gas fees, but that may not continue forever. It also plans to eventually charge an origination fee, which will probably be the most notable illustration of its pivot from a protocol to a company.  Said Bronstein:  ""We will be a very standard revenue-generating business. A normal company, making revenue off of good software.""

The newly inked deal will see both international and domestic payments made via Western Union's network arrive directly into the digital wallets held by Coins.ph's ""over 5 million"" users, the startup announced late last week.  The service aims to offer ""quick and convenient access to remittances, in urban and remote underserved areas,"" Coins.ph said, adding that linking with Western Union's digital and retail networks enables customers to receive payments from virtually all nations and territories worldwide.  With possibly 10 million Filipinos working and living outside their home nation, the Philippines is one of the top destinations globally for remittances. It's also a growing industry. Coins.ph cited Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the country's central bank, as saying that monthly personal remittances from Filipinos living abroad had reached $2.7 billion last July and grown 3 percent year-on-year.  Molly Shea, senior vice president and general manager, Global Money Transfer, Asia Pacific, Western Union, said:  ""With this collaboration with Coins.ph, we are delighted to offer customers in the Philippines with an unmatched depth of services and capabilities, and convenience right at their fingertips.""  Coins.ph offers financial services for Philippines residents, including those who do not have a bank account, offering a mobile wallet enabling services such as remittances, bill payments and cryptocurrency purchases. The firm holds both Virtual Currency and Electronic Money Issuer licenses issued by the central bank.  “There are many overseas Filipino workers who send money back home regularly and are always looking for additional remittance options that will make it most convenient for their loved ones to receive money,” said Coins.ph co-founder and CEO Ron Hose.  The firm noted that users of the service must first complete an online Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process and, after successful completion, can then receive Western Union transfers into their wallets. There is also a monthly remittance maximum of 100,000 Philippine pesos per month (almost $2,000).  The tie-up between a crypto firm and the noted money sender is a notable one. While Western Union has previously teased possible relationships with both Ripple and Coinbase, neither came to fruition.

42402762,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdco9F,1554728438,"Sparkswap Raises $3.5 Million From Initialized, Pantera for Lightning-Powered DEX","UPDATE (April 8, 13:40 UTC): The funding round was led by Initialized Capital, not Pantera Capital. The headline has been updated.      A San Francisco-based decentralized exchange (DEX) called Sparkswap launched Monday, becoming the first North American exchange to fully integrate the lightning network, a bitcoin scaling solution.  Sparkswap is funded by a $3.5 million seed round led by Initialized Capital, with involvement from venture capital firms such as Pantera Capital and Foundation Capital. This lightning-powered DEX – which differentiates itself from traditional exchanges by requiring users to custody their own crypto – offers cross-chain atomic swaps between bitcoin and litecoin.  Explaining how these off-chain lightning trades work, Sparkswap co-founder Trey Griffith told CoinDesk:  “Our users download some open source software we’ve developed that includes widgets and LND, the lightning implementation, along with a wallet that can hold, in this case, litecoin and bitcoin. When they trade, they talk to a service that we run called a relayer, that broadcasts an intent to trade at a specific position … then other users can take the other side of that trade by communicating with the relayer.”  Due to the experimental nature of the nascent lightning network, Sparkswap imposed a $2,500 daily trading limit for the first few months, with plans to raise the limit and add more trading pairs in the near future.  Brett Gibson, a partner at Initialized Capital, told CoinDesk that Sparkswap was the first startup he’s seen that offers traders self-custody without sacrificing speed.  “[It has] the performance and other characteristics of a decentralized exchange [but] can perform like a centralized one,” he said.  Fellow investor Paul Veradittakit from Pantera Capital added that Sparkswap caught his eye because it’s one of the few DEX startups to focus, albeit not exclusively, on bitcoin rather than ethereum-based tokens.  “Institutional traders want speed, efficiency, optionality and security,” Veradittakit told CoinDesk. “I think if lightning [developers] continue to execute and provide scalability and cross-chain atomic swaps … [lightning] should be able to fulfill that promise of speed and efficiency.”  However, there’s a long road ahead before those lightning-enabled trades can be implemented on a wider scale.  Timing is everything  Griffith will be the first to admit that Sparkswap plans to observe user behavior and develop mechanisms to address lightning’s current limitations. This Sparkswap release is still in beta.  One of the key issues Sparkswap will need to address is what happens if one party pulls out of a trade mid-way because the price fluctuates during the process.  Lightning Labs engineer Alex Bosworth, who works on the LND implementation that Sparkswap leverages, told CoinDesk it’s not clear yet whether the technology will be consistently faster than fully centralized processes.  “If you actually look at the script, it says that it could happen instantly but it could also take longer,” Bosworth said. “You still have an issue of timing with the cross-chain swaps. This is a problem for making this into a service that works with a lot of money.”  To complicate matters, there is also a cultural gap between the institutional traders Sparkswap seeks to serve and the capabilities lightning currently offers. Many such traders swap millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency at a time, not just a couple thousand, and they often do so with pre-determined partners.  “Just from a business perspective, I know that a lot of trading that happens on exchanges is actually done through contracts and trust,” Bosworth said. “I actually see the industry going in a more trusted direction.”  Despite these challenges, Bosworth is optimistically curious to see how lightning channels add additional value throughout the trading process.  Growing the network  According to Griffith, Sparkswap’s offering for professional traders could impact the broader economics of the lightning network.  For example, imagine you’re a bitcoin standing in line at Disneyland to ride Splash Mountain. If you’re closer to the front of the line, then you have more value than a bitcoin farther back – or a bitcoin in another line for a less popular ride. Just as with amusement park lines, there is positional value with crypto in payment channels.  “If I have a channel that’s in a good position directed toward a high-value target, it’s worth more to me than bitcoin that is just sitting in a cold wallet, because I can earn money on it,” Bosworth said.  Speaking to how this applies to Sparkswap, technically Sparkswap wallets can be used to send payments to anyone using the lightning network, mirroring payment options offered by centralized exchanges like Zebpay. As such, Sparkswap users could become high-value participants in the broader network.  “Our application could help the lightning network grow both in terms of tools and in users,” Griffith said, adding:  “An application like Sparkswap could really push lightning toward higher transaction uses.

ETNs are unsecured debt securities that, like exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are traded on a stock exchange.  The blockchain note will initially have 20 stocks diversified across areas including technology, shipping, oil and gas, custody and industrials.  Kleinwort Hambros’ portfolio manager John Birdwood said:  ""We have seen increasing interest from clients in the area of blockchain and we are very excited to be able to cater to this demand with the launch of our first blockchain note.""  The product will provide its clients with the “diversified exposure to the promising growth prospects blockchain technology offers, while maintaining the rigorous active management,” Birdwood added.  It's worth noting that the ETN will be only available for Kleinwort Hambros’s existing and new clients, with a minimum investment of £1,000 ($1,305).  The centuries-old bank has assets under management of £14.2 billion ($18.52 billion) and over 900 employees as of last year, according to its own figures.

According to a report from Korea JoongAng Daily on Monday, the Seoul Special Judicial Police Bureau for Public Safety has arrested the CEOs of an online shopping website and a bitcoin firm, identified by their surnames Lee and Bae, as well 10 other people said to be involved with the Ponzi scheme.  The police bureau said that the CEOs formed a “members-only” shopping website and a cryptocurrency exchange in the Gangnam district of South Korean capital Seoul last year. From May to October 2018, the accused reportedly recruited members for an annual membership fee of 330,000 won ($288) or a “premium” membership fee of 990,000 won ($864), also offering 10-year membership that included discounts on items.  Notably, the police bureau used artificial intelligence (AI) ""investigator"" to track down the Ponzi scheme.  “Through keywords such as Ponzi, loan and recruiting members, we were able to teach the AI patterns of Ponzi schemes,” a member of the bureau’s investigation team told the news source.  As is typical of Ponzis, the shopping website provided rewards to members for recruitment of new victims: 60,000 won ($52) in cash for each new member and 120,000 won ($104) to the initial recruiter if a new member persuaded another person to join.  Members were also rewarded in a cryptocurrency called M-coin issued by the associated cryptocurrency exchange. Lee and Bae allegedly targeted investors with the token too, telling them that its price would rise from 200 won ($0.17) to 600 won ($0.52) and that they would profit “immediately” if they invested.  The exchange reportedly had about 200 offices, with the managers of each being given cash rewards for each additional member recruited above 20 members, according to the report. The scam allegedly targeted investors with little knowledge of cryptocurrencies, especially older people, to invest in the illegal scheme.  The CEOs – who made about 21.2 billion ($18.5 million) won from membership fees and token sales – further hid their firm’s accounting information on a corporate server in Japan. When the investigation began, they apparently moved their accounting office to a private premises and concealed a computer in an employee’s car for use when needed.

42402772,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcoEA,1554717623,Bitcoin Price Leaps Resistance Hurdle in Weekend Breakout,"View  Solid gains over the weekend saw bitcoin’s price rise $200/4.89 percent, defying overbought indicators on the daily chart with a strong candle close on April 7.  The hourly chart for bitcoin is printing an ascending triangle, signalling a continuation in price action.  The longer-term outlook remains bullish for bitcoin as long as prices stay above the prior daily candle close at $5,193.  Bitcoin’s breakout from $5,050 resistance has defied overbought indicators and set a new target of around $5,550 for the bulls.  Bitcoin (BTC) rose 4.89 percent during the weekend period beginning April 6, a move that added another $233 to its price tag. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at around $5,248 according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Looking ahead, there's potential for continuation of the bullish trend given that investors will likely be seeking to add to their current positions in case prices cross above a local wick high of around $5,350.  Given that the total market capitalization has just reached a 5-month high, the odds are rising that bitcoin could once more enter a long-term bull market in the coming months.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows a bullish market structure began to take shape on Dec. 16, 2018, with a series of significant higher lows and now – thanks to the April 2 breakout from the ascending triangle – a significant higher high above the 200-daily moving average (DMA).  The daily RSI continues to post overbought conditions, but investors are unlikely to pay much heed for fear of missing out on bitcoin’s next potential jump to $5,557 weekly resistance.  Hourly chart        The hourly chart presents a bullish case in the form of an ascending triangle measured from two resistance points at around $5,345 and $5,350.  While prices have pulled back slightly, footing has been found above former resistance levels now turned support – a bullish sign indeed.  If BTC can maintain a close above $5,200, that would add considerable weight for a continuation in bitcoin’s price.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

42402755,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdco6I,1554714038,"GM, BMW Back Blockchain Data Sharing for Self-Driving Cars","Car giants General Motors and BMW are backing blockchain tech as a way to share self-driving car data among themselves and other automakers.  It’s all part of a bid to unlock valuable data held in silos which will ultimately get autonomous vehicles on the road sooner. Exploratory work in this area is being done under the auspices of the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI), a consortium formed last year to harmonize the development of distributed ledger technology (DLT) across the ""smart mobility"" industry.  CoinDesk has learned that the next MOBI working group on so-called autonomous vehicle data markets (AVDM) will be chaired by General Motors (GM). The automaker has clearly been thinking about using blockchain to share data for some time, having filed a patent detailing such a system for fleets of self-driving cars at the end of last year.  The new AVDM working group chairman Michal Filipowski, manager global innovation of General Motors, told CoinDesk in an email:  “I am excited to chair the AVDM working group and kickoff the development of our collaborative efforts with the other OEM [original equipment manufacturers] and supplier MOBI members.”  And notably, BMW, a founding member of MOBI, has also expressed its interest in the data-sharing use case for the first time. (Previously BMW tested blockchain to track mileage of leased vehicles.)  The German manufacturer, like many others in the auto space, has realized that keeping self-driving data in silos is a “major barrier” to widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles.  “With the advent of blockchain, decentral[ized] data management can be implemented in a privacy-preserving and efficient way,"" Andre Luckow, blockchain lead at BMW Group, told CoinDesk. ""Further, emerging technologies, such as decentral machine learning, secure multi-party confidential computing, and decentral data markets, will provide the fabric for data processing in the autonomous age.”  Stepping back, the push to foster autonomous vehicles faces a key hurdle: the sheer volume of data self-driving cars must consume in order to “learn” how to drive in different places and scenarios. Driving around a test track is one thing, but negotiating a busy city center on a rainy day is quite another.  Crown jewels  According to a Rand Corp report, getting to the stage where AVs are safe in all conditions could take hundreds of billions of self-driven miles, a process by which data are gathered using cameras and Lidar (a detection system which works on the principle of radar, but uses light from a laser).  Pooling this data together to train artificial intelligence on might seem like a no-brainer, but autonomous vehicle companies - be they carmakers or Uber or Google-affiliated, Waymo - tend to think of their self-driving data as their crown jewels.  This is where blockchain comes in, explains Sebastien Henot, head of business innovation at the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance Innovation Lab in the Silicon Valley (who chairs MOBI’s vehicle identity working group). He told CoinDesk:  “The old fashioned way is that everybody thinks their data alone is so precious. The new way is to consider data sets like cooking ingredients: you need to be able to mix multiple ones to create something really valuable. Data marketplaces call technically for blockchain because you can create an environment where rules are clear in terms of who shares what data with who.”  Another MOBI member, Ocean Protocol (which went live Monday), is focused on the creating blockchain-based data markets and running a shared AI on them. Ocean co-founder Trent McConaghy is aiming to create a kind of enterprise data commons where everyone can benefit, yet at the same time, this data can be prevented from escaping beyond the firewalls of any one company.  McConaghy explained that Ocean takes “federated machine learning” (machine learning built without direct access to training data, where data remains in its original location, such as on a smartphone, for instance) and gives it an additional dose of decentralization.  Google and others have been “pushing pretty hard on centralized federated learning,” said McConaghy, where they control the whole process.  “The makes the holders of the data feel pretty uneasy. So if you can actually remove that creepiness and the process of learning if done from silo to silo to silo in a decentralised fashion, that is much better. Decentralised federated leaning is what Ocean unlocks,” he told CoinDesk.  And this more decentralized approach is what BMW and GM, as part of AVDM group at MOBI, seem to be enthusiastic about.  Michael Ortmeier of BMW Group IT communications said Ocean’s approach to data sharing is one the company is “following with great interest.”  “We used the opportunity of the MOBI colloquium to speak with Ocean and other members and we will definitely continue and intensify these discussions,” he said.  Waymo data  It’s no secret that Waymo, the self-driving technology development company owned by Google parent Alphabet, is further ahead than anyone else in terms of how much data it has collected.  However, if you run the numbers, says Chris Ballinger, the founder and CEO of MOBI, it could still take many years for Waymo get there on its own.  Ballinger, the former head of mobility at Toyota, estimates that Waymo is accumulating a million miles of self-driven miles a month, adding:  “So you can say in miles it's going to take millennia. Something has to be done and obviously it will speed up as more cars get on the road. Once everybody gets involved and once they start sharing it will be an order of magnitude increase.”  However, Vint Cerf, vice president and chief internet evangelist for Google, countered the claim the Waymo might way off when it comes to reaching its AV goals.  It depends what you mean by “driving data,” said Cerf. “We have billions of miles in simulation by generating direct inputs into the software that emulate what the sensors see,” he told CoinDesk by email.  Regards the possibility of car companies using blockchain networks to share data, Cerf added:  “I do not see additional value in the overhead of blockchain vs digital signatures.”  Toy car traffic image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/08/gm-bmw-back-blockchain-data-sharing-for-self-driving-cars,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/588bb01f93c3049bc6e0753eba5413f2775e46ba-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The university announced the news on Friday, saying that the donation is the “largest gift ever made in a digital asset” to a university in the U.S.  The funding will be allocated to the university's College of Business in order to support students in becoming “changemakers of local and global entrepreneurial and fintech ecosystems.”  Leslie E. Wong, president of San Francisco State University, said:  “This groundbreaking gift will position the College of Business as an evolving, distinctly diverse and industry-relevant epicenter of business innovation and entrepreneurship.”  The donation will also fund two new permanent faculty chairs, the Rippleworks Endowed Chair for Innovation & Entrepreneurship and the Lam-Larsen Endowed Chair in Financial Technology, according to a separate statement released Friday by the College of Business. The chairs will help focus the college on entrepreneurship, commercial incubation, financial technologies and digital currencies, it said.  In honor of the donation, the university is also planning to change the name of the College of Business to the Lam Family College of Business, pending approval from the California State University Board of Trustees, according to the announcement.  The university raised the funds through its “BOLD Thinking” funding campaign, which has so far reached over $136 million of its target of $150 million. “The pace of this campaign has exceeded our expectations, but not its reach,” said campaign chair John Gumas.  Back in 2014, Larsen committed to donating 7 billion XRP to an unnamed charitable cause amid controversy over large sums of XRP that had been awarded to Ripple founders.  XRP, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at around $0.36, largely unchanged on the day.

While that number has dropped slightly to $184 billion as of press time, the five-month high marks the 10th consecutive week with a bullish open above the prior candle close, meaning there has been a steady increase in value for crypto since the new year began.  The majority of the crypto markets experienced positive growth toward the end of the previous close for the week April 1–7, thanks in part to bitcoin’s breakout last week.  Over the last 24 hours, both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have experienced large increases, resulting in their market capitalizations rising $3 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.  Amid the overall crypto market increase, bitcoin's dominance rate has also dropped slightly to 50.6 percent at press time from the 52 percent seen early last week following bitcoin's price jump.  XRP, however, has only a minimal share of the pie among the top three cryptos, with $200 million added to its total value over the past 24 hours.  Perhaps more importantly, there’s been a greater flow toward the altcoin markets over the week beginning April 1 with Tron’s (TRX) total value rising more than $350 million, while Stellar (XLM) and Verge (XVG) rose by $400 million and $50 million, respectively.

42402765,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcoCC,1554697574,Is It Time for a Blockchain Brexit?,"Pindar Wong is the chairman of VeriFi (Hong Kong) Ltd and a member of CoinDesk’s advisory board. An internet pioneer, he co­founded the first licensed Internet Service Provider in Hong Kong in 1993.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      There is a crisis in governance. I’m not talking about bitcoin, but Brexit.  Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU) is not so much a technical crisis between a ‘hard fork’ and a ‘soft fork’ but a legitimacy crisis. Yet the solution to its core dilemma -- politically deciding between a ‘Hard Brexit’ and a ‘Soft Brexit’ -- may actually lay in harnessing blockchain technology’s great potential as an economic governance system for the digital age.  One thing’s clear: the current system is failing. The impasse in Britain requires a radical rethink.  Unless even more time is requested by the UK, and unanimously granted by all 27 member states of the EU, the default option is for the UK to chaotically crash out from the European trade bloc, by leaving without a legal agreement, on Friday, April 12.  As laws have borders, this lack of ‘legal certainty’ is particularly troubling as it risks disrupting cross-border supply chain networks which would be bad news for everyone.  Nations vs networks  Where blockchain can help is that its ‘cryptographic certainty’ avoids the need for bordered thinking in the borderless world created by the internet, a world where laws are difficult to enforce and collaboration difficult toincentivizee.Could thinking harder about what we mean by a ‘border’ be the key to unlocking the current political deadlock?  Let’s consider the 500km border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the failure to find a suitable ‘Irish Backstop.'  No one -- not in EU-exiting Britain nor in EU-remaining Ireland -- wants to return to the troubled times of physical checkpoints that might place lives at risk. All agree this insurance policy should be honoured regardless of the outcome of future EU-UK trade negotiations.  Even though it is never supposed to be called upon, the ‘backstop’ - a last resort to maintain the island’s open border -- risks creating a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which is unacceptable because Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of UK.  Yet Brexit is supposed to be what the acronym implies: an exit from the EU rules and self-determining the free flow of goods and services across international borders. How can policymakers come up with a solution that honors that change, reimposing tariffs and controls, while still protecting human lives?  The solution lies in rethinking the very idea of a border.  A border in time  In the internet age, the governance borders that matter most are not bound along geographical or political lines. They are based on time, an invisible metric that is fairer and arguably the hardest of hard borders. You can’t go back in time. And, if you get down to it, this concept of “border in time” is what a blockchain represents.  That is why today I’m calling for the UK and EU governments to participate in a bottom-up process to establish a ‘Brexit Blockchain’: where customs authorities use a blockchain architecture to take the friction out of tariff enforcement by agreeing on the provenance of economic activity on a temporal, not geographic, basis.  The key would be to use a government recognized stablecoin to lock/unlock product delivery, to incentivise deployment and to complement existing solutions for digitizing international trade from firms like the UK’s Provenance, Denmark’s Maersk and France’s Carrefour .  Individual per-product tariffs could be implemented, with automated payments made as products move back and forth across national borders. The tariffs could be dynamically adjusted as political demands dictate; with as many borders in time, and currency-pair stablecoins, as needed.  Initially, only a Euro/Pound stablecoin would be used with nominal or zero tariffs enforced. This would result in a ‘Customs network,' not a ‘Customs Union’, though initially, it would behave like one.  Don’t trust, verify  When the Withdrawal Agreement doesn’t mention the internet (a big zero), where does one even start a multi-stakeholder process? I would start the coordination game by listening to industry at next month’s Consensus conference (May 13-15) and learn from existing international governance organizations.  Then I’d take any output to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/ TC307 Blockchain meeting that will be held in Dublin, Ireland on May 27-31. Then I’d cross my fingers!  To be sure, for Britain and the EU to view governance in this manner is a pipe dream, but it’s my hope that the seemingly inevitable train wreck that lies ahead for Britain will lead to some more enlightened thinking about the real problem at hand: scaling governance.  I might not get my Brexit Blockchain next month, but in the spirit of “failing fast,” perhaps the powers-that-be will learn from this crisis and realize that they need to rewrite the rulebook -- quite literally. The top of this rulebook should read: ‘No one is above the Law, No Nation below Mathematics.'
