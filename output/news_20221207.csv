42413489,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9OCy,1670457423,First Mover Asia: Here’s What Might Happen to Sino Global’s Liquid Value Fund During FTX’s Bankruptcy Protection Proceedings,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos sink some, but not enough to disturb the calm of the past 10 days.  Insights: How will the fallout from FTX affect Sino Global's Liquid Value Fund?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 852.02 −13.5 ▼ 1.6% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,855 −206.6 ▼ 1.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,234 −35.9 ▼ 2.8% S&P 500 daily close  3,933.92 −7.3 ▼ 0.2% Gold  $1,799 +30.0 ▲ 1.7% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.41% ▼ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Dips, Albeit Not by Much  By James Rubin  In soccer World Cup terms, bitcoin's performance the past 10 days would be the equivalent of a 0-0 draw.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization isn't losing or gaining much ground. On Wednesday, BTC was recently trading at about $16,850. That was down more than 1% over the past 24 hours but didn't offer much variance from its perch since late November when bitcoin established support above $17,000.  In an interview with CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" TV program, Joe Orsini, vice president of research at digital asset management platform Eaglebrook Advisors, attributed bitcoin's toughness to an at least temporary slowdown in bad news stemming from the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and other crypto fiascos this year.  ""When it comes to the unexpected, no news is good news,"" Orsini said. ""We've had a few things play out since the FTX news, of course, the BlockFi bankruptcy that was relatively priced in knowing they kind of relied on that FTX-Alameda bailout, as well as now you have concerns with some of the lenders. But it's been slow to play out, and there hasn't been that second wave of shock.""  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,230, off 2.8% from Tuesday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of the day in the red, albeit not by much, as investors continued to gnaw on recent economic indicators suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy had not taken as big a bite out of inflation as was hoped. SUSHI, the token of the decentralized exchange SushiSwap was recently off more than 8%, while popular meme coin DOGE fell more than 3.5%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, tumbled 1.59%.  Cryptos roughly tracked U.S. equity markets, which were most down, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, amid inflationary fears, although stocks performance improved over the steeper drops of the previous two days. Markets received an extra whiff of encouragement on Wednesday when China announced it was dropping its harshest Covid restrictions. China's measures to limit mortalities from the disease have been slowing the economic growth of the world's second largest economy by GDP.  Eaglebrook Advisors' Orsini said that additional contagion could unsettle markets. ""The important thing to consider is if the news does come, and if there is real contagion, does it lead to forced selling or liquidations or stronger selling pressure?"" he asked, although he remained upbeat about a crypto rebound.  ""Price does have a knack for changing sentiment,"" he said. ""When things are on sale, people want them less. We believe in the long run that these event-driven declines have very little meaning to underlying technology. Bitcoin has specific characteristics that it a really attractive form of money, and potentially to take market share away from fiat. And with Etherium, the ability to automate transactions, and the quality of entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem is not changing.""  Orsini added: ""Cycles happen, and so we've been in a bear market for about 13 months, and those (bear markets) were where the opportunities lie for long-term investors.""

By Sam Reynolds  Connections between Sino Global Capital’s Liquid Value Fund, its first fund for outside investment, and Sam Bankman-Fried as well as Alameda Research, might mean the venture capital fund is mentioned in FTX’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings, according to a Hong Kong lawyer who specializes in asset tracing.  According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Sino Global’s Liquid Value counts Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda as general partners and co-owners of the fund.  In a prior comment to The Block, Matthew Graham, Sino Global’s founder, who has been historically closely aligned with SBF and FTX, said that a “substantial” portion of the Liquid Value fund’s $200 million had been committed by FTX and other partners.  According to a recent report by the Financial Times, which detailed all of Alameda’s investments, the Bankman-Fried-affiliated fund put $60 million into Sino Global’s Liquid Value Fund. An unknown amount was then contributed by SBF himself.  These events will complicate FTX and Alameda’s process in their bankruptcy hearings, says Stephen Chan, a partner at Hong Kong-based law firm Ince.  “If they are in a partnership, all partners share in the upside and the downside,” Chan said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The other partners may incur liability for the actions of SBF and Alameda.”  A material amount of Alameda’s balance sheet was made up of FTX’s FTT token, as CoinDesk previously reported, which it used for collateral on investments. If Alameda funded part, or all, of its contribution to Sino Global’s Liquid Value fund via FTT, then this pool of assets – and whatever they were invested in – would be a part of what’s available to creditors.  If it turns out that SBF and his cohorts were committing fraud and some of SBF’s partners were in knowing receipt of proceeds of fraud, Chan explained, there would be a slightly different route under Hong Kong common law (the fund is domiciled there, and FTX/Alameda had a significant presence in the territory).  “If SBF is a general partner, then the partnership may have liability,” Chan said.  In instances of fraud, liquidators working on the FTX-Alameda case may look to recipients of proceeds of fraud to see whether civil recovery is possible.  But all of this might be challenging, to say the least. Sino Global is heavily invested in Solana and its respective infrastructure.  CoinGecko data shows that Solana has suffered a 93% loss during the last year, and in the weeks following FTX’s collapse nearly $700 million in locked-in value has been wiped out from Solana decentralized finance protocols.  The token of Orca, a Solana-based decentralized exchange that is one of Sino Global’s leading portfolio companies, reached a high of $20 in October 2021; it is now worth just over 40 cents. Its total value locked went from $1.4 billion at its height to $43.15 million today, according to DeFiLlama.  FTX’s FTT token is currently trading at $1.51, up 14% during the last two weeks, but down 95% on the month. Recently, its contract deployer has dumped the entirety of the locked FTT tokens into circulation, effectively flooding the market with what is already a token of questionable value.

5280957,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511494,1670454019,Will This New Development Push The Chainlink Price To $7?,"The Chainlink price has not reflected positive changes despite a major development in the altcoin’s ecosystem. Over the last 24 hours, LINK has declined by over 4%. Even in the weekly window, the altcoin lost over 6% of its value. LINK had charted considerable gains in the month of November. The bulls, however, could not sustain the price action as the coin moved southward at the beginning of December. Chainlink’s price has dropped below the $7 mark. For the coin to turn bullish, it must break past the aforementioned price zone. Investor interest has yet to echo on the daily chart. Chainlink is a blockchain oracle network that has launched its staking feature. This shall help to enhance the economic security of the platform’s services as a whole. This development is supposed to be a vital part of its “Chainlink Economics 2.0” effort, which is aimed at promoting better security and ensuring sustainable growth within the ecosystem. The technical outlook has displayed a fall in accumulation, and at the current price, LINK is trading at an 87% discount from its all-time high secured in 2021. Related Reading: Hedera (HBAR) Continues To Consolidate Near Its Lowest Level This 2022 Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LINK was trading at $6.86 at the time of this writing. Although the altcoin was trading close to the crucial price resistance mark, it had to get past one important price ceiling to claim $7. Immediate resistance stood at $6.90. After breaking through the $7 mark, Chainlink may encounter a major barrier at $7.36, indicating a significant retracement. If LINK falls below the present price level, it could land at the $6.22 mark and then at $5.90. The amount of LINK traded in the last session witnessed a dip, which meant that sellers were still in charge and that price sentiment was bearish. Technical Analysis LINK had managed to secure more buying pressure this month, but with constant volatility and price swings, the bulls have finally worn out. The Relative Strength Index dipped below the half-line, indicating falling buyer interest. Reflecting the same sentiment, the Chainlink price peeped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which meant that sellers had started to drive the price momentum in the market. Buyers will be back for a considerable time period if Chainlink prices rise above $7.36. Regarding declining buying strength, other technical indicators also presented similar readings. The buy signal on the daily chart started to fall. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which reads the price momentum and trend reversal, noted that the green histograms were shorter in size. This is not good news for buyers, and buyers must refrain from accumulation at this point. Similarly, the Parabolic SAR, which depicts the price direction, formed a dotted line above the candlestick, signifying downward price action in the market.

5279607,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511522,1670453185,Key Support Line For Cardano Price Rests Here As The Coin Moves South,"The Cardano price has declined steeply over the past trading sessions. The altcoin currently trades within a descending triangle pattern. This means that the coin could be headed for further decline unless it manages to break past a few vital price ceilings. Over the last 24 hours, ADA declined by 1.3%. In a weekly timeframe, the altcoin price has been hovering around the same range. In recent weeks, the Cardano price has reached new highs. This reading is tied to bullish price action; however, the bulls lost vigor. It is safe to say that ADA is, at the moment, in a price correction phase. ADA mustn’t lose two of its essential price floors. This would mean that the bears could be taking over. Since the coin currently depicts a descending wedge, it could be possible that ADA might touch its closest support level. After revisiting the support line, it is likely to bounce back again. The altcoin’s market capitalization has also noted a decline, which corresponds with a fall in the asset price. Related Reading: Bullish Sentiment Spikes As Axie Infinity Price Propels 9%, What’s Next For AXS? Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ADA was exchanging hands at $0.31 at press time. The immediate resistance for Cardano was at $0.34; the bulls tested this level, but the altcoin met with selling pressure. The two major resistance levels for the coin stand at $0.34 and $0.36, respectively. ADA was trading extremely close to its crucial support line of $0.30. The bulls might lose stamina, pushing the coin to $0.28. Cardano’s price will plummet if it fails to stay above the $0.28 mark. The amount of ADA traded in the last session increased and was red, depicting bearish sentiment and selling strength. Technical Analysis Investor confidence in the altcoin has been steadily declining in recent months, and despite ADA making slight progress, demand has languished in recent weeks. The Relative Strength Index fell below the 40-mark and was nearing oversold territory. In this case, ADA could fall through at $0.28. Due to lower demand, the Cardano price moved below the 20-Simple Moving Average line. This meant that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Movement above the 20-SMA line will help buyers regain confidence. Even in a shorter time frame, the overall price momentum pointed toward negative price action. The Directional Movement Index, which depicts a trend’s price movement and strength, was bearish. The -DI (orange) line was above the +DI (blue) line. The Average Directional Index was moving below the 40-mark; this could indicate that the altcoin’s present price momentum could depict a turnaround. The Chaikin Money Flow remained positive as the indicator was above the half-line, displaying that capital inflows still dominated outflows at press time.

The token has experienced a relief rally that coincides with a roadmap update from the Axie Infinity team. The network demand for the game's assets is still at horrific lows. Given the token supply dynamics and the fundamental overvaluation, I think AXS is a sell. Axie Infinity ( AXS-USD ) is one of the original play-to-earn crypto games. Fundamentally, Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-like game that utilizes public-blockchain NFTs and the AXS currency; both can be used as in-game assets or swapped outside of the Axie Infinity ecosystem. Axie Infinity is notable because of its immense success during the 2021 crypto bull run. It has also served as something of a proof of concept model for other play to earn projects like STEPN ( GMT-USD ), among others. In this article, we'll explore what has likely caused the price increase in AXS, the supply dynamics of the AXS currency, and the market activity for the in-game NFTs. Why Is Axie Infinity Rallying? AXS isn't the only metaverse/NFT coin that has been rallying over the last week. There is some element of excitement in the market because of ApeCoin ( APE-USD ) staking going live this month. I've detailed why I think APE is a sell here . But beyond just rallying with other metaverse coins, Axie Infinity has created some buzz in the crypto market because of an update to the project's future roadmap. On Monday, the Axie Infinity team detailed the vision for ""Axie Core."" The roadmap for the future included details on character accessories, breeding, and avatar pictures with an emphasis on collectability to generate an emotional attachment to what is essentially the Axie Infinity brand: Only by harnessing unique game loops and mechanisms, that merge collectibility, ownership, and economics with amazing and immersive gameplay can we once again define the path forward for this nascent industry. 5 Day performance (Seeking Alpha) The market response to this news was very favorable and saw AXS rally from $7 on Sunday to over $9 Tuesday. While the market took the opportunity to bid the coin, the actual NFTs used for the gameplay have seen very little action. Network Demand One of the things that I generally look for in any crypto token is strong supply/demand dynamics. Because AXS is used as an in-game currency, it's important that there is demand for the in-game NFTs to justify a bid on the AXS coin. Despite the Axie Core roadmap update and AXS price pop, we've yet to see that excitement reflected in the actual in-game assets: Axie sales September to Now (CryptoSlam) Measured in USD the daily sales volume for the Axie NFTs is still nearly at the basement. On Tuesday, there was $33,500 in total sales volume for the day. That was actually below the volume from Sunday and well beneath the average from the last three months. And to be clear, the above chart is zoomed for a reason. I want to actually show the short term trend of the sales volume. When we look at the bigger picture, we can really get a sense for how depressed the Axie Infinity NFT market actually is: Axie sales Since Feb 2021 (CryptoSlam) There were times during the bull run when Axie Infinity was doing 8 figures in daily sales. On November 4th 2021, Axie did nearly $41 million in sales in one day. Axie hasn't cumulatively done that much in sales in the last 7 months and hasn't produced more than $41 million in a single month since February 2022. The demand for the NFTs is simply not there any longer. Axie Infinity (Dune Analytics/Zhai) However, November did produce a noticeable bump in new user accounts. There were 6,078 new Axie accounts in November - up from 3,449 in October. Still a far cry from the 48k during the 2021 summer months. Token Supply And Valuation The market demand for the in-game Axie Infinity assets is concerning enough. Taken with the token supply metrics, I think AXS is a serious avoid even with the recent rise. I don't think we've found a bottom yet in this coin. Circulating supply: 100.5 million Max supply: 270 million Circulating percent: 37% Not all crypto coins have a maximum supply, AXS is one that does. But there is a substantial amount of dilution remaining. AXS Release Schedule (Axie Infinity) According to the Axie whitepaper , the dilution will continue until all coins have been dispersed 65 months from the public token sale. That would put the max supply being reached in early 2026. Token supply metrics aren't necessarily the most important metric when trying to value a crypto coin. For tokens that live in specific applications like Axie Infinity, a good way to attempt to measure a token's valuation is through Token Terminal's price to fees ratio - or P/F ratio: Axie P/F Ratio (Token Terminal) The P/F ratio can be viewed sort of like a crypto-native price to sales ratio for a traditional market equity. The P/F ratio can be expressed either through the fully diluted market cap ratio or the circulating market cap ratio. The figure in the chart above is the circulating market cap of the token divided by the annualized fees of the Axie Infinity platform. This takes the activity on the network into consideration when valuing a coin. For Axie Infinity, it's a bad story. The current circulating P/F ratio is 438. This makes the circulating supply of the AXS token now trading at the most overvalued P/F ratio in the coin's history. Summary Like many other cryptocurrencies, AXS experiences large rallies and big busts. What makes AXS unique from some of the other crypto coins in the market is its ties to a specific ecosystem application - in this case a game. Unlike base layer or layer 2 blockchain native coins, cryptos that are dependent on one central application are far riskier than native currencies like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) or Solana ( SOL-USD ). Those networks can go through highs and lows but the best blockchain networks aren't dependent on one application or DeFi protocol to survive. Application-based tokens like AXS require perpetual user interest in whatever crypto protocol the token represents. In this case, AXS is benefiting from news in the short term but the long term trend of the coin's ecosystem network is still very negative. AXS only has value if there are market participants who want to use it to play the Axie Infinity game. Given the lack of interest in the game currently, this recent spike in the price of the AXS coin has created a scenario where AXS is arguably more overvalued now than it has ever been even though it is still 95% below its all time high price of $164.

42413494,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9OHe,1670450616,Crypto Markets Today: Gensler Restates SEC’s Crypto Authority,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler isn’t waiting for new powers from Congress to enforce securities laws against crypto companies, though he said Wednesday that it would be good to have more money and additional reach beyond U.S. borders.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Gensler, who declined to specifically talk about failed crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, said in an interview on Yahoo! Finance that the SEC has the basic disclosure and governance requirements in place to hold digital-assets firms accountable.  The SEC chief also didn’t directly address questions about whether his agency would push out tailored crypto rules next year, but he insisted that it doesn’t need any. “The rules are there,” he said. “The law firms know how to advise their clients to comply.”  FTX’s crash showed the dangers of running a global platform without walls between customer funds and investment operations, Gensler said. Crypto firms can’t do everything. “Your field will not last long outside of public policy norms,” he said.  The court case over whether Ripple’s XRP is a security has been seen as the major lingering question holding the agency back, but Gensler said Wednesday that a federal judge’s decision last month determining that crypto startup LBRY violated securities laws by selling its native LBC tokens was a “very big win” for the SEC’s legal campaign.  So far, the SEC hasn’t directly gone after U.S. exchange Coinbase (COIN) for listing what the agency believes are securities without registering as a national securities exchange. Still, the SEC has – in another recent enforcement action – listed several tokens it considers unregistered securities that were traded on the company’s platform.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,800, down about a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has held comfortably above $17,000 for much of the past nine days, despite ongoing investor jitters about contagion linked to the implosion of crypto exchange FTX and macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly signs since late last week that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to maintain its hawkish course on interest rate hikes through 2023.  SushiSwap (SUSHI): The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is facing a significant deficit in its treasury that threatens its long-term operational viability, according to a governance proposal from project developers. After reviewing expenditures, the project's annual runway requirement was reduced from $9 million to $5 million, but the treasury still provides for only about 18 months of runway, developers said.  Axie Infinity (AXS): The native token of the blockchain-based play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, has come out of oblivion this week with a double-digit price rally. Yet, leverage traders appear skeptical if AXS' turnaround from 17-month lows would be longlasting. That's because while open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active standard futures and perpetual futures contracts tied to AXS, has increased to a three-month high of $129.70 million, funding rates remain negative, according to data source Coinglass.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin’s High Correlation to Copper Does Not Bode Well for Short-Term Investors  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Absent a black swan or negative contagion event specific to a centralized entity, digital assets still seem very much connected to macroeconomic developments.  But, notably, yields for the federal funds rate, U.S. three-month and two-year Treasurys exceed the yield of 10-year Treasurys.  This condition, called an inverted yield curve, has predated past economic recessions. If viewed in isolation, an inverted yield curve does not bode well for bitcoin, or copper prices for that matter. Increased short-term rates and slower economic growth lead to lower demand and prices for physical and digital assets.  Read the full technical take here.  Other News  Coinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brian Armstong said the company’s revenue will be about half what it was last year as the crypto exchange struggles amid stark price drops in cryptocurrencies and continuing ripple effects from multiple bankruptcies this year, including the recent collapse of rival exchange FTX. Armstrong noted in an interview with Bloomberg’s David Rubenstein that Coinbase had done about $7 billion in revenue ($7.8 billion, according to FactSet) and $4 billion in positive EBITDA. “It's looking, you know, about roughly half that or less,” Armstrong said.  Genesis interim CEO Derar Islim wrote in a letter to customers Wednesday that resolution of his company’s lending unit’s withdrawal freeze is likely to be a matter of “weeks” rather than days. The lending arm of Genesis in November was forced to suspend redemptions following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. This morning’s note from Islim said Genesis is committed to being as “transparent as possible” with customers and that it is working in consultation with highly experienced advisers and in close collaboration with its owner, Digital Currency Group. DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  China removed harsh COVID-19 restrictions after weeks of protests nationwide that threatened to hobble its already struggling economy. The Chinese government had hoped its controls would zero out the infection rate, prioritizing public safety over declining productivity. But officials started to change their perspective amid mass demonstrations and growing acceptance that the latest COVID strains are less virulent.

42413482,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9O4Y,1670447419,Privacy-Focused Gnosis Chain to Undergo Its Own Proof-of-Stake ‘Merge’,"Privacy-focused Gnosis, one of the first sidechains to Ethereum, will conduct its own version of the Merge to replace its proof-of-authority (PoA) chain with its Gnosis proof-of-stake (PoS) beacon chain. The Merge will take place on Thursday, Dec. 8, when a certain predetermined Total Terminal Difficulty (TTD) is reached. While TTD is a measure that has typically been used for proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains, it can be used to time the fork for PoA chains.  This will be the second-ever “Merge” event in blockchain history, following the Ethereum blockchain’s Merge in September when it switched out its old PoW model for PoS. This time, however, the Gnosis “Merge” will be slightly different given that it is swapping out PoA for PoS.  Read more: The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain  Why switch from PoA to PoS?  PoA uses validators to add blocks to the blockchain. But instead of staking assets (e.g., Ethereum stakes ETH) under PoS, validators stake their “reputation,” meaning they need to meet certain requirements to be trustworthy and remain in good standing.  Since PoA depends on the reputation of the validator's identity, validators go through a complex process to ensure that “bad” validators are not included. This mechanism solidifies the system’s integrity and verifies that the participating validators are all reliable and follow the same rules.  Like PoS, PoA is already a less-energy-intensive consensus mechanism compared to PoW because there are fewer computational resources needed to deploy validators. However, PoA is much more centralized than PoS because only a select few validators are approved to participate on the network by a group of “authorities.” The authorities make the validators go through a rigorous pre-approval process, and they ensure these validators adhere to a set of requirements and check that transactions are not tampered with when adding them to the blockchain.  After Gnosis runs through the Merge, it will go from having fewer than 20 validators running the blockchain to over 100,000, making it the chain with the second-most number of validators after Ethereum.  “In the trilemma of scalability, decentralization and security, we focus on decentralization,” Stefan George, the co-founder and chief technology officer at Gnosis, told CoinDesk. “Contrary to many ‘Ethereum killers,’ which favor scalability over decentralization, cheap blockspace is a commodity whereas decentralized blockspace is a scarce resource.”  First Ethereum, now Gnosis. Who’s next?  Ethereum developers have said they hope the protocol’s switch to PoS would encourage others to retire their old models and move to staking, either for energy efficiency or centralization reasons.  “We were delighted to see that the Ethereum Merge was successful and also had increasing confidence that we can apply the Merge successfully to Gnosis Chain,” George said.  The success of Ethereum’s Merge confirmed that such a complex undertaking can be done, and encouraged the Gnosis Chain developers in their efforts to complete their own Merge.  “Initially, the goal was to do the Merge on Gnosis Chain before the Merge of Ethereum to show that it can be done safely on Ethereum,” George told CoinDesk. “It turned out to be more complicated on Gnosis Chain as we were not switching from PoW but PoA and had to customize the existing code.”  The Ethereum Merge has also inspired other chains, such as Dogecoin, to look into potentially switching away from their PoW models.

Bitcoin 7-Day MA Exchange Whale Ratio Has Rapidly Gone Down Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the metric also saw a similar decline during the end of 2018. The “exchange whale ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top ten transactions going to exchanges, and the total exchange inflows. The ten largest transfers to exchanges are assumed to be coming from the whales. So, this ratio tells us what part of the total exchange inflows is being contributed by these humongous holders right now. When the value of this metric is high, it means the majority of the inflows are made up by whales currently. Since one of the main reasons investors deposit to exchanges is for selling purposes, such values could be a sign that whales are dumping large amounts, and might hence be bearish for the price of the crypto. Related Reading: Glassnode: Bitcoin Holders Realized 14x More Losses Than Profits Recently On the other hand, the indicator having low values suggests whales are making a healthier contribution to the inflows, and could thus be either neutral or bullish for the value of BTC. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average Bitcoin exchange whale ratio over the last few years: Looks like the 70-day MA value of the metric has been sharply falling off in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio had a pretty high value just a few months back. However, since then, the indicator has been observing some rapid downtrend, and the ratio has now attained quite tame values. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Cohorts Now Have Close Cost-Basis, What Does It Say About Market? This means that whales have been reducing their inflow volumes recently, suggesting that selling pressure from them may be getting exhausted. The quant has also highlighted the trend in the exchange whale ratio during the previous Bitcoin cycle in the chart. It seems like a similar downtrend as now was also seen back in late 2018, when the bottom of that bear market formed. The analyst notes that while it’s impossible to say if the current sharp decline in the whale ratio means the bottom is in for this cycle as well, it’s likely that at least the volatility will now begin to cool down.

42420858,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVoz,1670444737,Bitcoin’s High Correlation to Copper Does Not Bode Well for Short-Term Investors,"Bitcoin's price now correlates more strongly to copper futures than to traditional equity indexes.  BTC’s correlation coefficient relative to copper has risen to 0.84 from 0.27 a month ago, reaching its highest mark since August.  The correlation coefficient measures the pricing relationship between two assets, ranging from -1 to 1. The former indicates an inverse relationship, while the latter implies a direct pricing relationship.  The tightening relationship poses a couple of questions.  Analysts often view copper as a proxy for overall economic growth, affectionately calling it “Dr. Copper” for its professorial ability to forecast trends. Does this imply that the macro narrative within the digital asset space will continue?  Why has traditional equities’ relationship with copper weakened over the last two months? As early as Oct 6, the S&P 500’s correlation was as high as 0.86 before falling to its current level of 0.14.  On question one, I would say, yes. Absent a black swan or negative contagion event specific to a centralized entity, digital assets still seem very much connected to macroeconomic developments.  But, notably, yields for the federal funds rate, U.S. three-month and two-year Treasurys exceed the yield of 10-year Treasurys.  This condition, called an inverted yield curve, has predated past economic recessions. If viewed in isolation, an inverted yield curve does not bode well for bitcoin, or copper prices for that matter. Increased short-term rates and slower economic growth lead to lower demand and prices for physical and digital assets.  Copper’s individual chart is not nearly as gloomy, however.  The metal's price has increased close to 3% over the last month on increasing momentum and steady volume. Its 10-day moving average is north of its 100-day moving average as well, which is a bullish sign.  On point two, equities may be trading at an unjustified premium at the moment. A CoinDesk article on Tuesday highlighted how equities trading has been unaligned to fundamental data, decoupling from its normal relationship with the two-year Treasury bond yield.  Given the decoupling and the price of copper itself, traders may be expecting a reversion to equities, and may place trades accordingly.  Unfortunately, bitcoin traders currently don’t have much cause for optimism about short-term price appreciation.  Prices have been noticeably range-bound for the last 30 days, and appear poised to continue that way.  Sentiment has followed the same pattern, and the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which has occupied extreme fear and fear territory for months, aligns with September figures.  For long-term accumulators of bitcoin, however, this is likely their season. The increased connection to macro factors has provided stable (if not sluggish) price activity for the asset, providing investors with additional opportunities for accumulation.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/07/bitcoins-high-correlation-to-copper-does-not-bode-well-for-short-term-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/967a9a15305676b5345f5ef10fc1999d37a2a51e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Another DAO Is Raising Funds to Buy a Copy of the US Constitution,"One month after Sotheby’s announced it would be auctioning off another original copy of the U.S. Constitution, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called UnumDAO, also known as “ConstitutionDAO2,” is trying to buy it.  The group’s name is an homage to ConstitutionDAO, a grassroots collective of crypto enthusiasts that managed to raise $47 million in one week to bid on a copy of the Constitution auctioned at Sotheby’s in November 2021.  The new DAO is not affiliated with the old group, which said in a Nov. 17 tweet it would not be attempting another crowdfunding campaign this time around.  In a Twitter message, ConstitutionDAO told CoinDesk that it was excited to see the work that its successor was putting in to finishing the project it had started.  ConstitutionDAO2 is a coalition of 16 separate organizations, including Juicebox, Nucleo, Aztec Network and MoonDAO. It also includes PeopleDAO, which governs the treasury of PEOPLE tokens originally created by ConstitutionDAO, now run by separate individuals.  ConstitutionDAO2’s mission is to “start a collection of civic artifacts that are totally run by the people,” according to a tweet. It has so far raised 27.8 ETH (around $34,000) as of Wednesday in public contributions from 120 wallets, though a representative said the amount raised privately is much greater. The new auction will be held live at Sotheby’s auction house in New York on Dec. 13.  The new DAO will use non-fungible tokens (NFT) to manage the artifact’s governance if it does end up winning the auction. Contributors can choose from four different NFT tiers: 0.1 ETH (around $122) for “Citizen,” 1 ETH (around $1,220) for “Representative,” 10 ETH (around $12,220) for “Senator” and 100 ETH (around $122,000) for “Executive.” The document itself would be legally owned by a nonprofit organization called UnumDAO.  New DAO, new strategy  ConstitutionDAO2 is taking additional measures to right the wrongs of its predecessor's attempt, such as allowing for donations to be made privately to mask the running total for its bid. Last time around, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin was able to outbid ConstitutionDAO at the last moment, in part by knowing the exact amount the DAO had raised prior to the auction.  Read more: ConstitutionDAO Outbid for First Printing of America’s Founding Document in Sotheby’s Auction  “For one whole year, the communities inspired by ConstitutionDAO have been building, developing privacy tech and experimenting with DAOs,” the group wrote on Twitter, appealing to its community for donations. “Do you believe in second chances?”  When asked if the DAO is worried Griffin could again swoop in with a winning bid at the last second, member Alex Turley told CoinDesk he wasn’t worried because “Griffin already has a copy.”  In the 24 hours since ConstitutionDAO2 announced its crowdfunding efforts, the price of PEOPLE, the original token of ConstitutionDAO, has fallen about 7%.  ConstitutionDAO2 is facing an uphill battle to raise the funds during an extended crypto winter compared to November 2021, when the crypto market was still in a bull run.  Among the DAOs taking part in ConstitutionDAO2 is also EmpireDAO, a crypto co-working space in downtown Manhattan, New York City. Mike Fraietta, EmpireDAO’s founder, says he wants to display the copy of the Constitution in his office if the group’s bid attempt is successful, saying the physical space could be “the Louvre to ConstitutionDAO2’s 'Mona Lisa'.”  According to the group’s website, If the DAO loses the bid, investors in the project’s NFTs will be able to refund their purchases or keep them as collectibles.

The estimated decline is hardly news to market participants. Analysts surveyed by FactSet prior to Coinbase’s third-quarter earnings release estimated Coinbase’s annual revenue in 2022 to be $3.3 billion. Currently they are estimating it to be $3.2 billion, which would be a 59% drop from 2021.  Coinbase’s stock is down more than 83% this year and is one of the worst-performing stocks on the Nasdaq. A growing number of investors are stepping away from crypto-related companies, particularly with the recent collapse of FTX.  While some high-profile investors, including Bill Ackman and Kevin O’Leary, have come out in recent days and said they believe former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried might be telling the truth, Armstrong recently tweeted he doesn't believe SBF's claim that FTX’s troubles were just the result of accounting errors.

42413476,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9Nzs,1670436006,Gensler Says SEC Is Fine Going After Crypto With Its Current Authority,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler isn’t waiting for new powers from Congress to enforce securities laws against crypto companies, though he said Wednesday it would be good to have more money and additional reach beyond U.S. borders.  Gensler, who declined to specifically talk about failed crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, said in an interview on Yahoo Finance that the SEC has the basic disclosure and governance requirements in place to hold digital-assets firms accountable. The SEC chief also didn’t directly address questions about whether his agency would push out tailored crypto rules next year, but he insisted that it doesn’t need any.  “The rules are there,” he said. “The law firms know how to advise their clients to comply.”  As the fiery crash of FTX taught harsh lessons about the dangers of running a global platform without walls between customer funds and investment operations, Gensler underlined that crypto firms can’t do everything.  “Your field will not last long outside of public policy norms,” he said. “Some of these platforms have come in and said, ‘We want to continue running a commingled platform. We want to continue doing lending, trading, hedge fund functions, an exchange function, a custody function.’ We said, ‘No, you have to separate it out.’”  Gensler has expanded his crypto-enforcement team, though the agency hasn’t yet dropped a bomb on a major cryptocurrency platform. The court case over whether Ripple’s XRP is a security – and within reach of SEC authority – has been seen as the major lingering question holding the agency back. However, Gensler said Wednesday that a federal judge’s decision last month determining crypto startup LBRY violated securities laws by selling its native LBC tokens was a “very big win” for the SEC’s legal campaign.  So far, the SEC hasn’t directly gone after U.S. exchange Coinbase (COIN) for listing what the agency believes are securities without registering as a national securities exchange. Still, the SEC has – in another recent enforcement action – listed several tokens it considered unregistered securities that were traded on the company’s platform.  ""If the SEC has the authority Mr. Gensler claims, why did he fail to uncover the largest crypto Ponzi scheme in US history?"" Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), said in a letter this week to the Government Accountability Office requesting a review of the SEC's role with FTX. ""One cannot have it both ways, asserting authority while avoiding accountability.""  However, Torres, a member of the House Financial Services Committee who is on the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, was also among lawmakers who sent a letter to Gensler earlier this year expressing concerns about how SEC investigators were gathering information from crypto companies.  Whether the SEC wants new laws or not, Congress has made crypto a new priority this year, and lawmakers from both parties are expected to push for the first major crypto legislation in the next session. Most of the preliminary efforts have sought to raise the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission into a prominent role in the oversight of crypto trading.  Gensler’s agency doesn’t need new crypto rules, he argued, adding that what would really help would be more resources and more powers over activity happening in other jurisdictions. The SEC already regulates $100 trillion markets – mainly in stocks, bonds and government securities – and no matter how much attention crypto is getting, he said Wednesday, it’s a relatively small market.  “Worldwide, it’s about $800-ish billion,” he said. “We don’t know the exact number in the U.S., but far smaller than the $800 billion.”  UPDATE (Dec. 7, 2022, 20:43 UTC): Adds letter from Rep.

42413488,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9OC2,1670435998,US Sen. Cynthia Lummis: Ether Is Now a Security; My Bill Might Have Stopped FTX,"CORRECTION (Dec. 7, 2022, 18:52 UTC): Corrects headline to say that Lummis views ether as a security.  The U.S. senator behind one of the more important pieces of bipartisan crypto legislation in the works said bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that can be considered a commodity because ether is now a security thanks to September's Ethereum Merge.  “It’s starting to look more like bitcoin is the only thing that would qualify as a commodity,” said Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), a longtime bitcoin holder and advocate. She told CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” program on Tuesday that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could be deemed a security.  “It’s a security because of the way [it] moved from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake,” Lummis said about the blockchain’s upgrade earlier this year. The “inability to [unstake tokens] right now makes it susceptible to being [considered] a security.”  Read more: US Sen. Gillibrand Says a Last-Ditch Stablecoin Bill May Still Emerge This Year  That could change, of course, she added. It is possible ether will become “sufficiently decentralized that it could later be deemed a commodity.”  A member of the Senate Banking Committee, Lummis, with Sen. Kirsten Gillbrand (D-N.Y.), is a sponsor of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, which was introduced in June. If passed the bill would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) the main power to set regulatory standards for crypto. Lummis told CDTV that among the goals of the bill is clearly defining what can be deemed a security or a commodity.  Had the bill already been law, Lummis said, the collapse of crypto exchange FTX might've been avoided.  “The type of rehypothecation that was going on with FTX and some of the other attributes of FTX which caused it to fail would have been prevented had the Lummis-Gillibrand bill been in effect,” Lummis said.  Lummis said the fall of FTX has only underscored a “more emphatic enthusiasm” to reintroduce the Lummis-Gillibrand legislation in the new Congress next month, and to set clear regulatory standards that will help consumers who take part in the digital asset industry.

The BoK’s report echoes concerns of jurisdictions across the world that are drawing up proposals to regulate stablecoins.  The report argues that stablecoin issuers should be required to have minimum capital and reserve assets to minimize the possibility that the risks of digital assets would be transferred to the payment and settlement system.  It also said that crypto-asset businesses should be registered and authorized to operate and be subject to regular external audits.  Cryptocurrency needs to be regulated through a special law because its issuance structure and market system are different from securities and fiat currencies, making it difficult to respond with existing regulations, the report said.  The country’s politicians are attempting to form a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets, but partisan gridlock over the national budget has stalled discussions on crypto-related bills.

The World Economic Forum estimates that the digital economy will reach a valuation of $20.8 trillion by 2025. A whopping 40% increase from the $14.5 trillion in 2021.  With that, as we enter this new era of digital transactions, there is a rapidly growing emphasis on the capabilities of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. While cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether are commonly referred to as asset classes by the mainstream, the underlying technologies of these coins are being used in many new and exciting ways.  In this piece, we’ll look at the three most influential adaptations of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology that have shaped the digital economy landscape and how they will mold our future.  1. Tokenization of assets  To simplify, the buzzword “tokenization” refers to the process of converting an asset into a digital token. This digital token is a small piece of software code that lives on the blockchain and serves as a representation of asset ownership. It can be transferred between users without an intermediary.  One use case of tokenization is real estate, where the total value of a property is fractionalized and re-distributed in tokens. These tokens allow investors to enter the market and acquire certain portions of a property quickly and at a low cost.  Put differently, tokenization can lower the barriers to entry, eliminate unnecessary fees and increase the liquidity of the underlying asset, all of which give investors much more flexibility and security with their investments.  Beyond real estate, the tokenization process can also apply to just about any asset, such as securities (shares), precious metals, intellectual property, licensing rights, ticketing and fine art.

The metaverse and artificial intelligence  The metaverse is a decentralized cyberspace that fuses the mechanics of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and the internet. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the functions that allow machines (our computers) to sense, understand, think, act and learn, just as we do.  While the metaverse has a great premise to build upon, it is limited to the capabilities of current available technologies (and the lack thereof). This is where AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) – a subset of artificial intelligence – become a significant building block.  In short, greater investment in AIOps like big data analytics and machine learning will help build out the metaverse infrastructure needed to support additional users. This includes processing quadrillions of bytes of data per second, troubleshooting issues and restoring them, and ensuring security. Without it, it would be equivalent to navigating metropolitans without a map.  Other than AIOps, the branches of AI that are integral to the development of the metaverse are Natural Language Processing (NLP), AI Bots, machine storytelling, creative AI and interface optimization.  3. Improving privacy with Web3  It’s no secret that our data and privacy are now at the mercy of Big Tech. It is largely up to these companies to decide what to do with our data, and we don’t really have a choice but to play by their rules. This is the price we pay in order to access Web2, a term that refers to the internet as we know it today.  Web3 represents the next iteration of the internet, promising to intrinsically bring transparency, decentralization and ownership back to internet users.  At its core, Web3 is open source (anyone can modify it), trustless (no need for a third party) and permissionless (anyone can join). Simply put, it reduces the control any single party has over your data because it will be stored on a decentralized network instead of centralized servers.  In practice, Web3 technologies come in the form of cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized apps (dapp), smart contracts, artificial intelligence as well as the metaverse.

42413480,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9O6Q,1670433620,Blockchain Entrepreneur Arrested in California on Fraud Charges,"The Justice Department has accused Rikesh Thapa of defrauding his startup tech firm of more than $1 million in U.S. currency, cryptocurrency and utility tokens, according to a press release on Wednesday.  Thapa, 28, was arrested on Wednesday in California and is expected to face a federal judge for the Southern District of California.  The Justice Department didn't name the victim company, but it appears to be New York-based Block Party Tickets, a company that developed a blockchain-based protocol for live event tickets. Thapa’s LinkedIn profile lists himself as a founder and chief technology officer for the tech firm from October 2017 to December 2019. (The indictment lists him as a co-founder.) He lists his current positions as CEO of crypto firm BitOverflow, co-founder of renewable-energy firm VerdeBlocks and co-founder of grocery delivery service Bazaar.  According to the indictment, in 2018, Thapa agreed to receive and hold $1 million of his company’s money in his personal bank account while the firm explored other banking options. Thapa soon began using the funds on personal expenses such as nightclubs, travel and clothing, despite reassuring the company that he was only holding the money “for safekeeping.”  Thapa even falsified bank statements to conceal his theft, and in 2019, he refused to return the $1 million, according to the indictment.  The San Diego native is also accused of embezzling at least 10 bitcoins (BTC) from his company, as well as stealing its utility tokens.  Thapa is being charged with one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 year in prison.  Thapa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42411302,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMmG9,1670433361,"Be Patient: Sam Bankman-Fried Could Go to Prison for a Very, Very Long Time","It has now been more than a month since the CoinDesk report that unraveled Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange, what could be one of the largest and most egregious criminal frauds in human history. But we’re still getting a steady stream of horrifying revelations, like desiccated victims being excavated from a serial killer’s basement on live TV. On the brighter side, we also have some fresh insight into the severe consequences Bankman-Fried and his co-conspirators are likely to face.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  There has been huge anxiety, particularly among crypto types, about when and whether Bankman-Fried will be brought to justice. Despite clear signs of fraud, he does not seem to have been detained by law enforcement. He remains in the Bahamas, giving interviews intended to obfuscate his actions and distract from the continuing drumbeat of grisly financial discoveries. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is not alone in regarding this as “baffling.”  The most paranoid observers (and the seemingly delusional Bankman-Fried himself) might suspect this to be light treatment, the fruit of his years of currying favor with U.S. leaders. But it’s more likely the delay is just part of the slow-grinding legal process, according to an in-depth new legal report from the excellent MacKenzie Sigalos at CNBC. The U.S. Department of Justice has requested an independent probe of the case, and former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti told CNBC that “it sure looks like there’s a chargeable fraud case here.”  And Bankman-Fried’s potential punishment is no small potatoes. He could be sentenced to life in prison, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission trial lawyer Braden Perry told CNBC. That’s according to U.S. sentencing guidelines, and taking into account the number of victims and the size of the apparent fraud at FTX and its closely related trading shop Alameda Research. The CNBC report goes into gratifying detail about exactly what books are likely to be thrown at Bankman-Fried, and how hard.  See also: What a Securities Lawyer Would Ask FTX's Bankman-Fried | Opinion  The bad news is that those sentencing guidelines are often “bent” to give softer penalties to white-collar criminals. That’s based on the implicit belief, still widespread in the U.S. court system, that things like financial fraud and embezzlement aren’t “real” crimes. Bankman-Fried’s youth, combined with his ongoing scheme to paint himself as an incompetent buffoon, could also elicit undeserved mercy from a court. It will take real and sustained public and political pressure to make sure that Bankman-Fried gets what’s coming to him.  Trigger warning: financial gore  Coming to him it most certainly is – and investigators just keep pulling up bodies. Recent days have seen the emergence of at least two leaks that suggest the fraud was even more depraved than previously understood.  Data shared with Bitcoin.com appears to show that Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison had a staggering $1.3 billion deficit on her personal FTX margin trading account as of May 2022. Accounting at both FTX and Alameda was clearly considered a detriment to organizational goals (that is, theft). But taken as read, this deficit would be in addition to the mind-bending losses Alameda proper was allowed to rack up on FTX.  These deficits, it must be emphasized, point to fraud at FTX more than malfeasance by Caroline Ellison or Alameda (though there was probably plenty of that, too).  It has become increasingly clear that part of Bankman-Fried’s strategy is to throw Ellison under the bus by blaming Alameda for losing funds. This was especially clear in an interview published Tuesday with Frank Chaparro at The Block. But the real crime here was not Alameda being terrible at trading – it was FTX’s failure to enforce fair liquidation rules for Alameda, Ellison and perhaps other allies. In effect, exempting them from margin controls enabled their use of FTX customer funds for speculative activities. Bankman-Fried’s backstabbing of Ellison (reportedly a former romantic partner) should be understood above all as an index of just how little character he has, despite his carefully crafted altruistic persona.  And the hits just keep on coming: The Financial Times has received a leaked copy of the investment holdings of FTX Ventures, the exchange’s venture capital (VC) unit. One number is paramount here: The total of investment outflows, tallied by the FT, runs to more than $5.4 billion.  Here’s the thing: It seems impossible that FTX could have afforded those investments, along with its other vast expenditures, simply from three years of exchange revenue and its own venture capital inflows of $1.8 billion. Maybe some of the FTX Ventures stakes used fake FTX money like FTT, so there’s more work to be done. But very simple arithmetic strongly suggests not only that FTX was dipping into customer funds, but that the people running FTX could not possibly have been ignorant of that fact.  Another detail from those FTX Ventures documents may or may not be criminal, but it is unambiguously disgusting. Among the entities receiving money from FTX Ventures were funds that themselves initially invested in FTX, including Sequoia Capital and Skybridge Capital. Why were they investing in their investors? The Skybridge deal in particular had an air of weirdness even back when it was announced in September. The FTX Ventures funding was earmarked for the Anthony Scaramucci-run venture firm to purchase cryptocurrency.  This likely meant buying and custodying crypto through FTX, which has been alleged as a condition of other deals by the exchange. So Skybridge (among others) first gave FTX money to attract more users. FTX then effectively sent those user funds back to Skybridge (and others). That left users with fictitious balances, while Skybridge funneled the cash back to FTX. The technical term for this is “shady as hell.”  And now we venture into the real basement. What follows is a hypothetical so shocking, so gory, so foul that only the most steel-stomached financial gorehounds should dare entertain it.  See also: Let's Talk About the Bankman-Fried New York Times' 'Puff Piece' | Opinion  The Skybridge announcement doesn’t specify what kind of crypto strategies the fund would pursue with the FTX Ventures money. The most horrifying, human-centipede scenario would be that Skybridge, and/or other funds that got tens of millions from FTX, used some of those rehypothecated FTX user funds to buy the exchange token FTT, which was created by FTX.  As I’ve detailed, the role of FTT as collateral in various loans was key to the entire house of cards. Re-re-re-hypothecating user funds by getting outside funds to use them to buy or hold FTT would have opened up further leverage for creative accounting. It’s a possibility that’s beyond grim, and beyond Machiavellian.  Maybe that’s all we should ask ourselves to stomach for now. Time to go enjoy some light entertainment, something to distract us from the depths of real-world human depravity. I would suggest a light romp like, say, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""",NEGATIVE,FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | FTT,David Z.

42411293,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMlwJ,1670429571,Why a Divided Congress Is Bullish for Crypto,"The midterm elections are over. Control of the U.S. Congress is divided. The crypto industry is under new scrutiny after recent company failures and broader market turmoil. In this environment, how should our elected representatives approach the outstanding crypto policy questions when they return to a new session in January?  While the sensational headlines of the past several weeks have led some officials to call for quick action to rein in the industry, the level-headed and judicious path is to proceed deliberately and build on the work, education and advocacy that’s already happened.  Kristin Smith is the executive director of the Blockchain Association, the Washington DC-based trade association representing the crypto industry.  While many on both sides of the aisle bemoan the fact that they do not have full control of Congress, a divided government may in fact be a boon to the crypto economy.  Of the most advanced crypto regulatory bills under consideration by the current Congress, all are bipartisan. While the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act needs major changes before moving forward, the nature of its bipartisan creation bodes well for Washington, D.C.’s approach to regulation.  Likewise, the Lummis-Gillibrand bill in the Senate and stablecoin legislation in the House of Representatives have been crafted with bipartisan backing, demonstrating the good faith engagement from lawmakers of both parties on these complicated issues. While serious, disqualifying issues remain, it is encouraging that the divided nature of Congress now reflects the bipartisan approach of major crypto legislation to date.  Of course, moving forward with bipartisan, tailored and fit-for-purpose legislation requires a careful reflection on recent events. The picture is clear: The failure of FTX International is defined by centralization, and a complete lack of basic corporate governance, accounting standards and basic morality. It is not a failure of crypto, its technology or approach to consumer finance.  As our representatives consider legislation in light of FTX's collapse we urge fact finding first to understand exactly what happened. The drive to “do something” is understandably strong, but passing imperfect legislation in the heat of the moment is not the prudent path.  Learning the latter lesson and seeking to punish the crypto-native ecosystem, rather than designing legislation and enforcing current law that would prevent this sort of collapse would be unfortunate. It is easy to criticize FTX and hold it up as a brightly blazing example of the sins at the heart of crypto, while a forensic and rather staid critique of loosely-applied corporate oversight is the right way to understand the crumbling of this derivatives market and exchange.  Congress should recall the policy and legislative response to past banking crises. The fall of Lehman Brothers did not kick off a ban on big banks, rather Congress decided that those banks should be put to more stringent stress tests to get a better sense of the health of their balance sheets.

The downfall of MF Global was further evidence that solid “Chinese walls” between trading and customer deposits should be enforced, not that there was a flaw in the very concept of bonds.  The same approach should apply to crypto: Target bad actors and illicit schemes while working with industry to promote the technology and make the industry more robust and safer for consumers. Crypto is here for good – using the collapse of a centralized exchange to sow doubt over the nature of decentralized finance will not prevent a similar collapse in the future.  As Congress kicks off the 118th session, it should pick up where it left off, carefully and considerately designing bipartisan legislation to ensure the United States remains a home for crypto innovation. While many of the bills under consideration need serious work, the fact that we have a strong platform to get the right results shows that the industry’s education and advocacy is having an impact.

Related Reading: Continued Upswing Of VIX Signals Doom For Bitcoin; But Friday Will Be Crucial As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $16,800 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous week, the cryptocurrency is holding onto some profits, but there is a chance the bullish trajectory will retrace back to the yearly lows. Bitcoin Miners Will Contribute With The Downside Price Action? On the macro scene, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is the biggest hurdle for future Bitcoin profits. The financial institution is trying to bring inflation down by hiking interest rates. This monetary policy has harmed risk-on assets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at moderating the monetary policy, but this possibility might become less likely. Recent robust U.S. economic data could provide support for further interest rate hikes. The market is pricing in another 75 basis points (bps) hike for December. In addition to the Fed’s tightening, the war between Russia and Ukraine adds to the market’s uncertainty.

Miners take out BTC to sell in the market and cover their operations costs. This selling contributes to BTC’s bearish pressure. Bitfinex noted the following while sharing the chart below: On the other hand, when the value of the indicator decreases, this indicates that miners are withdrawing coins from their wallets. Such a trend could be bearish for Bitcoin since the miners could be transferring their coins out of their wallets in order to sell them on exchanges. BTC exchange inflows have also increased slightly over the past week after declining significantly over the few weeks prior to that. Other Factors To Consider In addition to struggling miners, the market is seeing BTC holders sell their coins at a loss.

Investors have been caught in the “textbook definition of a bubble,” lured by the promise of ever-rising prices, Panetta said in remarks that echo earlier criticism that the unregulated sector is like a “Ponzi scheme” and a “Wild West.”  Though the collapse of crypto exchange FTX has revealed flaws in accounting and risk management, Panetta said crypto would likely “continue to attract investors looking to gamble” – a risky activity he wants to keep sealed off from traditional finance.  ""It is difficult to see a justification for the existence of unbacked crypto assets in the financial landscape,” he added, saying they are too volatile and inefficient to use for regular payments.  The FTX debacle will likely send investors toward decentralized exchanges, he said – adding that those exchanges will be harder to regulate and are liable to amplify financial shocks.  “Crypto assets deemed to have an excessive ecological footprint should also be banned,” he said, in a likely reference to platforms like Bitcoin that use an energy-intensive mechanism known as ""proof-of-work"" to validate transactions and secure their network.  The ECB's skepticism about crypto is nothing new. Two staffers last week said bitcoin (BTC) is on the “road to irrelevance.” Panetta is considering whether the central bank itself should issue a digital currency, and earlier Wednesday, he set out some of the criteria for apps and wallets using the digital euro.

The PSR, a fairly new regulator that became fully operational in 2015, would be authorized to regulate cryptocurrencies that are used for making payments if a proposed crypto-regulation bill called the Financial Services and Markets Bill becomes law. The bill is now being considered by Parliament.  “While we don’t expect to see digital currencies replacing traditional currencies in the immediate future, it’s important that innovation and competition in payments are balanced with strong safeguards to make sure people are protected when paying for things,” Davey, who advises the PSR, said.  Read more: UK Crypto Industry Welcomes New Stablecoin Rules, Awaits Guidance  The regulator, however, has already gotten a head start in regulating the sector. The Treasury put Fnality International, a still-being-tested payment system using distributed ledger technology, under its supervision. This would be the first wholesale payment system using central bank money with a decentralized network running 24/7, Davey said. The company already has 17 major institutions as shareholders, and it will be working with some of them.  Though Fnality isn't classified as a cryptocurrency because it doesn't have a token or coin – the ledger would instead represent holdings of central bank money – the PSR can still use the ledger to help it work out how it should approach regulating crypto, Davey said.  “The use of DLT in Fnality helps us to examine how our regulation may have to change because of the technology involved, and the emphasis on the distributed nature of products and services,” Davey said.  Before the project goes live, the PSR will be looking at how people can access the payment system, what products and services it will offer and what measures it has to prevent fraud, Davey said.  Davey said working with Fnality before it is fully operational has been “helpful.”  The PSR is also keeping an eye on bankrupt FTX exchange to “assess what wider implications there are on the crypto sector,” Davey said.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/07/the-uk-payment-systems-regulator-is-firming-up-its-approach-to-regulating-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2adff490ac03fb98c12e4bfd0bb27b2646a9b5b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The capital raise happened earlier this year, but the firm just announced it, a month after the collapse of centralized exchange FTX, which put a spotlight on the viability of all crypto projects.  Other investors in the round included Archetype, Scalar Capital, Robot Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, a.capital and a number of angel investors, according to a draft Medium post provided to CoinDesk.  Perennial enables the creation of two-sided markets made up of traders and liquidity providers. Traders deposit assets to get leveraged exposure to different price feeds, while the liquidity providers pool capital to earn fees for taking the other side of trader positions. The losing side of the trade pays the winning side. Perennial’s initial core features also include zero price slippage – trades happen directly at the current price regardless of size – and trades that are settled in U.S. dollars instead of crypto.  “Perennial is built as a non-custodial DeFi protocol that is fully on-chain with open source code,” Perennial operations head Jacob Phillips told CoinDesk in an email. “This means users always control their own funds and can easily verify any of the actions/behaviors of the protocol.  “At the protocol level, Perennial is starting with a guarded launch and conservative risk parameters,” he continued. “Perennial has a robust liquidation engine and uses battle-tested Chainlink oracles.”  The platform will be released initially on main network of the Ethereum blockchain, but Perennial will soon begin building out its layer 2 ecosystem. The startup will then ramp up the number of its tradable markets, Phillips said.  Perennial was co-founded by Kevin Britz and Arjun Rao, who previously co-founded the early smart contract wallet Astro Wallet that was acquired by crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Phillips, who previously worked as a researcher and crypto-focused venture-capital firm Polychain Capital, joined earlier this year as Perennial’s first hire.

The report from Mazars was meant to assure customers that their bitcoin is collateralized, exist on the blockchain and is in Binance’s control.  However, the assessment is not an official audit, according to Francine McKenna, lecturer in financial accounting at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""They did a comparison of balances per public key address from a list they got from management. They did not compare any balances in independent banks or custodians or depositories,"" said McKenna.  ""This is more worthless than even the Tether or USDC report,"" she added. In September, Friedman LLP, a New York-based accounting firm that provided auditing services for the stablecoin issuer Tether in 2017 was accused of “serial violations of the federal securities laws” and “improper professional conduct,” by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which fined the auditor $1 million. Tether hired BDO Italia to take over its regular attestation reports in August.  Mazars took a snapshot of Binance’s total reserves and liabilities on Nov. 22 to perform a collateralization analysis. Assets included were customers’ spot, options, margin, futures, funding, loan and earn accounts for BTC and wrapped bitcoin held on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain and Binance Smart Chain blockchains.

Launched in Bulgaria in 2014, OneCoin fraudulently branded itself as a cryptocurrency, telling investors that the token could be mined and had real value when in reality it didn't exist on the blockchain. The founder, Ruja Ignatova – known as the ""CryptoQueen"" – earned a spot on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list this past summer. She remains at large, with a recent investigation suggesting she has friends in high places.  A Luxembourg national whose intelligence firm did work for OneCoin, Schneider was arrested in France in 2021 and has been fighting extradition to the U.S.  Co-accused U.K. national Christopher Hamilton, who faces similar charges to Schneider, in August lost a plea in his home country to avoid extradition to the U.S., while his fellow countryman Robert McDonald managed to avoid extradition on human rights grounds.

And the team led by Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, continues to work hard to keep that hype going. Via Twitter, Nailwal shared a massively bullish news today. He wrote: zkEVM passing 99.5% of Ethereum test vectors putting Polygon zkEVM at extremely high EVM-equivalence. This is also reflected in the dev experience where 1000s of solidity smart contracts have been deployed on zkEVM without any changes whatsoever. Running towards mainnet soon! Narwal referred to David Schwartz, who is the project lead of the Polygon Hermez team. Schwartz announced in this thread that Polygon’s zkEVM is making tremendous progress. “Currently, we are passing 99.5% of Ethereum test vectors that apply to our type-3 implementation (9,650+ tests passed),” wrote the project lead of team Hermez. Related Reading: This Report Suggests Crypto Sector Bearing A Final Flush-Out Polygon zkEVM is a complete EVM-equivalent L2 zk-rollup Ethereum scaling solution. On it, users have deployed more than 3000 smart contracts without friction or transformation. “Their dApps work seamlessly, with over 20K transactions,” Schwartz added, further explaining that the test network zkProver has provided more than 12,000 complete proofs of validity for these arbitrary user transactions.

Of all the solutions, Polygon has forged the most notable and largest partnerships to grow the Ethereum ecosystem. And the zkEVM. a zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), could further cement this position for Polygon. The zkEVM is operating zk rollups. This smart-contract technology bundles transactions from the Ethereum ecosystem and sends them to the Ethereum mainnet as a single transaction.

A zero-knowledge proof makes it possible to retain full security without revealing the data necessary to do so. Remarkably, the Polygon zkEVM maintains full Ethereum compatibility. Until now, zk rollups with full Ethereum compatibility were deemed difficult to program. In this respect, the development of Polygon is a major milestone. Once the zkEVM mainnet comes online, there could be an explosion of dApps on Polygon. And the price of MATIC could profit big time from it.

42414771,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBKtuE,1670418467,Attacker Targets Wealthy Crypto Funds Using Telegram Chats,"In the latest type of crypto-focused attacks, an attacker known as DEV-0139 has targeted wealthy cryptocurrency funds through the use of Telegram group chats, Microsoft's (MSFT) Security Intelligence team said in a report on Wednesday.  Fees levied by crypto exchanges on transactions are a big challenge for investment funds and wealthy traders. They represent a cost and must be optimized to minimize the impact on margins and profits. As is the case with many other companies in this industry, the largest costs come from fees charged by exchanges.  The attacker or group of attackers capitalized on this specific problem to lure their crypto-fund targets.  DEV-0139 joined several Telegram groups, used by high-profile clients and exchanges for communication, and identified their target from among the group members. OKX, Huobi and Binance exchanges were targeted, data from the Microsoft report shows.  Posing as an exchange employee, DEV-0139 invited the target to a different chat group and pretended to ask for feedback on the fee structures used by exchanges. They then initiated a conversation to gain the target’s trust – using their knowledge of the industry and preparedness to lure victims gradually.  DEV-0139 then sent a weaponized Excel file containing accurate data on fee structures among cryptocurrency-exchange companies with the goal of increasing his or her credibility.  The Excel file initiated a series of activities, including using a malicious program to retrieve data and drop another Excel sheet. This sheet was then executed in invisible mode and used to download a picture file containing three executables: a legitimate Windows file, a malicious version of a DLL file and an XOR-encoded back door.  A DLL is a library that contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time. On the other hand, XOR is an encryption method used to encrypt data and is hard to crack by the brute-force method  The threat actor was then able to remotely access the infected system through the use of the back door.

42411294,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMlph,1670416200,What Does an AI Chatbot ‘Think’ About DeFi? We Asked ChatGPT,"Over the past month, my Twitter feed has been inundated with all things FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried. Between the apologies and interviews (why is Sam still talking?), my feed has been all fraud and no fun.  That is, until ChatGPT came along.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  If you haven’t played around with the new chatbot from OpenAI you really should. From movie pitches to programming queries to poetry, the AI reliably spits out human-like, logical responses to nearly any prompt you throw at it. Speaking with it has me feeling like I did when I first swiped to unlock the screen of an iPhone.  It’s a funny thing, AI. Like crypto, artificial intelligence has been held up by some as a paradigm shift in how the world ticks. But unlike crypto, which has yet to yield many real-world applications beyond finance, it’s hard to push back against the AI-everything thesis. At some point – probably soon, if not already – it will be difficult to think of an industry that hasn’t been completely upended by machines that can think.  For this week’s Valid Points, I’ve asked ChatGPT to speak a little bit about the impact that AI will have on DeFi.  Am I lazy for doing this? Yes. Do I still think it's interesting? Also yes. Someone at CoinDesk had to figure out whether AI is going to take our jobs, and I’m happy to have been that someone.  The AI prompt  We offered the following prompt to ChatGPT: ""Write a CoinDesk article about how AI might be used in decentralized finance."" The bot returned six paragraphs. We've included the first five paragraphs verbatim.  We replaced the AI's concluding paragraph with its response to our follow-up prompt: ""include risks as well as benefits."" This yielded three paragraphs, which we again recorded verbatim.  The response by ChatGPT  As decentralized finance continues to grow in popularity, many are looking to artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution to some of the challenges facing this emerging technology.  Decentralized finance, or DeFi, refers to a system of financial transactions that are performed on a blockchain network. This allows for the creation of digital assets and the creation of smart contracts, which enable the execution of financial transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks or other financial institutions.  One potential use case for AI in DeFi is the creation of more sophisticated and intelligent trading algorithms. These algorithms could be used to analyze market trends and make more accurate predictions about the direction of asset prices, helping traders to make more informed investment decisions.  Another potential application of AI in DeFi is in the creation of more advanced and efficient lending and borrowing platforms. By using AI algorithms, these platforms could automatically assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and set appropriate interest rates, reducing the risk of defaults and making the lending process more efficient.  Additionally, AI could be used in DeFi to improve the security of smart contracts and other blockchain-based financial transactions. By using machine learning algorithms, smart contracts could be automatically monitored and audited for potential vulnerabilities, helping to prevent hacks and other security breaches.  However, there are also potential risks associated with the use of AI in DeFi. One concern is that the use of AI algorithms in trading and lending could lead to the creation of ""black box"" systems that are difficult to understand and regulate. This could make it difficult for regulators to monitor and control these systems, and could also create potential risks for investors and borrowers.  Another potential risk is that AI algorithms could be subject to bias or manipulation, leading to unfair or inaccurate decision-making. For example, if AI algorithms are trained on biased or incomplete data, they could make decisions that are unfair or discriminatory. This could be particularly problematic in the context of lending and credit scoring, where the use of biased algorithms could lead to discrimination against certain groups of borrowers.  Overall, while the use of AI in DeFi has the potential to bring significant benefits, it is important for developers and regulators to carefully consider and address these potential risks. By taking a cautious and responsible approach, it may be possible to harness the power of AI to improve the capabilities of decentralized finance without creating unintended consequences.  Human here again  Pretty good, huh?  It took some trial and error at the beginning, but once I crafted the magic prompt, I think ChatGPT managed to string together a relatively convincing (albeit dry) argument for how AI might be used in DeFi.  That being said, I'm not sure ChatGPT is ready to take over this newsletter just yet. The bot sounds human, but it’ll frequently manufacture facts out of thin air, and I had to weed through some pretty weird responses before landing on something fit to print (ask me about the time it wrote – incorrectly, for reasons that probably don’t need explaining – that “Alameda Research is a quantitative trading firm that uses AI to make fast and accurate trades on decentralized exchanges”).  If you are interested in reading a human take on how AI intersects with DeFi, CoinDesk has you covered. While ChatGPT covered a lot of ground in its article, it did miss some key applications, such as insurance, and key risks, including how on-chain AI could be used to manipulate markets or harm users through malicious MEV strategies.  My job is still safe, but one imagines that it won’t be long before ChatGPT is explaining – I hope with a bit more color next time – not only how AI could transform DeFi, but how it already has.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/07/what-does-an-ai-chatbot-think-about-defi-we-asked-chatgpt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1270a6ed929c701176fffaa74e96a00550fb7b8a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Concern over the safety of assets held by customers on centralized crypto exchanges has come to the fore in the past month with the collapse of exchange FTX in November.  Zodia's service, named Interchange, ""offers an alternative to the pre-funding and margin models on exchanges,"" the firm said in an email Wednesday.

5259742,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511449,1670413674,Continued Upswing Of VIX Signals Doom For Bitcoin; But Friday Will Be Crucial,"As NewsBTC reported, the VIX experienced a trend reversal last Friday which could be significant for Bitcoin as well. The VIX volatility index shows traders the expected range of fluctuation of the S&P 500. Remarkably, there is an inverse correlation between the VIX index and the S&P 500. A rising VIX index usually means falling prices for the S&P 500, and vice versa. Rising VIX Threatens Bitcoin Bulls The VIX dropped below the level of 19 on Friday, a mark that has been highly significant over the last year. In August, the last time the VIX was this low, it subsequently rose above 34, dragging the S&P 500 down 15%. Bitcoin also experienced a significant downtrend, driven by its correlation with the S&P 500. On Monday, BTC bounced off horizontal resistance at $17,400 and fell below $17,000 as VIX initiated its trend reversal with a stellar market open. Yesterday, however, Bitcoin bulls initially appeared to have the upper hand. While the S&P saw another 1.4% plunge, the BTC price remained relatively stable at $17,000. Related Reading: Price Slump For Bitcoin Looming As VIX Rises Back Above 20 However, in the last few hours, BTC registered a retracement of around 2% and $350. At one point, BTC fell to $16,691 after the VIX continued its uptrend and rose to a level of 22.46. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $16,828. Investors should pay attention to the VIX. If the VIX sees another rise today, the BTC bulls could lose steam. Then, the support zones at $16,600 and $16,300 are going to be key. Will Friday Provide A Foreshadowing For Bitcoin? So, given Bitcoin’s high correlation with the S&P 500, another drawdown could be imminent. However, the VIX should not be used as the only indicator. The VIX relies on expectations based on past events. In addition, the VIX cannot account for sudden, unexpected events that may cause strong market reactions. Historically, it has always been the case that the VIX could not predict a bottom. Key events are determinants of when a bottom is reached. However, since the VIX is calculated based on expectations, it cannot be a key to detecting a change in trend due to sudden events in the market. And the all overshadowing event will be the next FOMC meeting of the US central bank on December 14, when the FED will decide on its further interest rate policy. Remarkably, the meeting will include a “summary of economic projections”. But even before that, there are two extremely important data that make predictions about how the FED will act. Related Reading: This Analyst Thinks Bitcoin Will Hit $5,000 in 2023, Any Possibility? While the new inflation data in the form of the consumer price index (CPI) will be published on December 13, the producer price index (PPI) will already be published on Friday, December 9. This will already provide an insight into how the CPI data might turn out. This is because the PPI serves as a leading indicator for the consumer price index. When manufacturers face input inflation, increases in their production costs are passed on to retailers and consumers. Thus, the PPI could be trend-setting. If the PPI and CPI continue to fall, at best more than expected, the chances of a Santa rally for Bitcoin are pretty high.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/upswing-of-vix-signals-doom-for-bitcoin-but-friday-is-crucial/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/5259742.jpeg

The revamp plan, which being called the Meteora plan, was formulated in response to recent events, including a collaboration with crypto exchange FTX and its closely related trading firm Alameda, which has left a ""toxic association"" among the three entities.  The firm set up a new token and will migrate current MER holders to the new setup. It is also setting up a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to give the community more leverage over essential decisions. Mercurial holds over $27 million across two products, DeFiLlama data shows, and held over $200 million at lifetime peaks.  The plan will see Mercurial launch its lending vaults and automated market maker (AMM) pools as a separate project under the name Meteora. An AMM refers to decentralized exchanges that rely on smart contracts to source liquidity from users and price the assets within the pool using algorithms.  Mercurial said funds raised from the initial exchange listing (IEO) for its native MER tokens on FTX represented over 10% of the total funds raised for the project.  Alameda’s involvement in MER was in the form of 3% of liquid MER for market making that was bought at private round prices of 7 cents. An 1.5% of locked MER for seed investment was bought at a seed price of 2 cents, Mercurial said.  “In summary, the only liquid tokens in the market came from Alameda Market Making (3%), IEO/IDO participants (0.3%), private investors (1.6%) and the liquidity mining rewards for our stable pools,” the team stated. This created constant sell-side liquidity for MER tokens on the open market, which is now deemed detrimental given the troubles at Alameda and FTX.  “There still needed to be more clarity and certainty over MER’s tokenomics. The uncertainty is further exacerbated by the exploit on FTX, resulting in over [$800,000] worth of MER tokens in the hacker’s wallet,” the team added.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/07/defi-project-mercurial-plots-revamp-and-new-tokens-following-toxic-association-with-ftx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d340ee01d408100797ad39aba3e8e2e082a95f9a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chainlink said it plans to scale up to 75 million LINK over time. Some 500 million tokens are currently in circulation.  The program, which opens for general access on Dec. 8, lets people earn rewards in order to maintain the protocol's performance and keep it more secure.  “What staking does is it allows us to scale the system by creating incentives that allow the system to grow,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Stakers will be unable to unlock or move their LINK rewards until the next version of the protocol is released. That is expected in nine to 12 months, the company said in a blog post.  At the time of publication LINK was trading at about $6.87.

42414791,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBKv1D,1670404807,Rally in Crypto Game Axie's AXS Token Faces Skepticism From Derivative Traders,"AXS, the native token of the blockchain-based play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, has come out of oblivion this week with a double-digit price rally.  Leverage traders appear skeptical if AXS' turnaround from 17-month lows would be long-lasting.  That's because while open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active standard futures and perpetual futures contracts tied to AXS, has increased to a three-month high of $129.70 million, funding rates remain negative, according to data source Coinglass.  Funding rates are the cost of holding bullish long and bearish short positions in the perpetual futures market. The negative rate indicates shorts are paying longs to keep their positions open, and the leverage is skewed to the bearish.  The combination of rising open interest and negative funding rates suggests an influx of new money on the bearish side, a sign of traders shorting the rally.  ""With a favorable environment for alternative cryptocurrencies far away, a rise in open interest implies a higher probability of increased shorts,"" Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said.  ""The continued nearly zero or negative funding fees indicate that traders have not yet shifted from their bearish sentiment,"" Ardern added.  AXS jumped to a three-week high of $10.40 on Monday after Axie Infinity announced plans for progressive decentralization of the game.  The decentralized strategy would focus on building an end-state where community members with meaningful contributions would play a pivotal role in decision-making progress, Axie Infinity said in the publication titled “Axie Contributor Initiative Kickoff.""  ""The AXS bounce is a typical event-driven move,"" Ardern noted, referring to Axie's announcement of the community decentralization plan.  At press time, the token changed hands at $8.40, representing a nearly 22% weekly gain.  The persistent bearish sentiment in the futures market can be attributed to the lingering FTX contagion fears and macroeconomic uncertainty that has weighed heavily over crypto prices this year.  That said, a continued rise in AXS might compel traders to reassess their commitment to the bearish trade, paving the way for a short squeeze – an extended rally fueled by the unwinding of shorts, the likes of which we have recently seen in U.S. stocks.  ""Considering the current low liquidity in alternative cryptocurrencies, a short squeeze cannot be ruled out,"" Ardern quipped.",NEUTRAL,AXS,AXS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/07/rally-in-crypto-game-axies-axs-token-faces-skepticism-from-derivative-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ae0cf36234cb9a01554bfd2d7d403c1320f73e5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

5261238,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511484,1670403610,Up Or Down? What To Expect From Solana (SOL) In The Homestretch Of 2022,"Solana is among the hardest hit by the demise of FTX, as the two companies have collaborated to establish Serum, a decentralized derivatives market. This led to Solana being closely associated with the Sam Bankman-Fried crypto exchange, with more than $900 million worth of SOL being held by FTX. Let’s have a quick overview: The company’s fundamentals are strong, therefore it should be able to start making money again soon. Constant pressure from technicals and bearish market circumstances keeps the price low. Metrics, though, suggest SOL is making progress in its recovery from the catastrophe. Founder and CEO of the IBC Group Mario Nawfal has stated that the token’s fundamentals are “strong,” noting the token’s development growth, a healthy NFT marketspace, and a relatively high daily transaction volume compared to other L1 chains as evidence. With SOL registering an increase in the weekly and bi-weekly timescales, is the token really recovering? Related Reading: Quant Shows Potential For Surge Beyond $150 – Can QNT Hit Its Target? SOL’s Fortunes Have Yet To Improve Despite Nawfal’s assertions, the data shows that token and ecosystem indicators are not looking well. Messari data indicates that the asset’s volatility is at an all-time high of 2.00, suggesting that the asset is more likely to move during this period, whether bullish or bearish. Sharpe’s ratio, which currently stands at -3.73, indicates a pessimistic near-term outlook. This indicates that SOL’s returns in relation to its volatility are close to or equal to zero. With a rising triangle, SOL technicals continue to support the bearish trend. The RSI is overbought on the 4-hour time frame, which drives the signal towards a bearish crossover. The MFI confirms the bearishness of SOL as it declines in tandem with the price. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $13.836 with a red candle. At of time of publication, the top and lower halves of the Bollinger band was $14.3602 and $13.3052. It also places SOL in a risky position, as a crunch zone appears to be building. Too much FUD around Solana. The fundamentals look solid: Dev growth second to ETH NFT volume surprisingly healthy FTX collapse makes SOL MORE decentralized Nakamoto Coefficient👌 SOL daily transactions higher than all other L1s Am I missing something? — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) November 27, 2022 SOL And FUD Even with excellent fundamentals, the EMA ribbon is in the midst of a bearish crossover, making recovery tough for SOL bulls. Solana struggles to deal with the fear, uncertainty, and doubt around its ecosystem and SOL coin. For a recovery to even be a chance, maintaining support at $13,0769 is beneficial. With a CMF of -0.07 and a bearish cross on the MACD, the price of SOL should decline to $13.0769 or below.

After reviewing expenditures, the project's annual runway requirement was reduced from $9 million to $5 million, but the treasury still provides for only about 18 months of runway, developers said.  To address the deficit, lead developer Jared Gray proposed setting Kanpai, a fee-diversion protocol, to 100% of fees diverted to the Treasury multisig for one year, or until new token distribution and reward schemes are implemented.  The proposal is a temporary solution to a long-term problem, and new tokenomics will take time to implement, developers said.  Community members showed mixed reactions to the proposal. Some said that depriving users of the “fees they are entitled to” felt like a breach of the project’s primary objections, while others criticized the “sensationalized” tone used by developers to highlight the urgency of the situation.  Developers, however, maintain that the proposal is to ensure the long-term operations of SushiSwap.  “Bear market environments present multiple challenges for projects and teams, and recently we’ve seen many notable projects lay off substantial personnel or go bankrupt,” Gray noted in the proposal.  “It makes little sense for Sushi to follow a similar path when it has an opportunity to capture its singular significant source of revenue and direct it back to the treasury for the benefit of all,” he added.  The Sushi team had increased its funding by securing several multi-million-dollar partnership deals, Gray said, cautioning that relying on such business development deals is only “part of a successful business model to secure Sushi’s future.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/07/defi-protocol-sushi-proposes-immediate-action-to-support-its-treasury,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fcc740e8fb3c6e450a6f3ead708799ac5ef77e6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But the crypto asset failed to keep up its momentum and gradually declined over time until it fell below the $0.10 marker on May 13 when it bottomed at $0.0870. HBAR continues to struggle in reclaiming the $0.10 territory Hedera technical indicators currently show no signs of an immediate reversal The crypto asset increased its market cap by $400 million in just 24 hours Since then, the altcoin struggled to climb back up and its woes were compounded by the negative effects of the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange platform. On November 10, Hedera recorded its 2022 low when it changed hands at $0.0439 and is not showing any signs of initiating a bullish run anytime soon. Its relevant technical indicators are also nothing to be excited about as they are not indicating an upward push that may happen over the next few days or weeks. Not Much To Look Forward To For Hedera? According to latest tracking from Coingecko, at the time of this writing, HBAR is trading at $0.0482 and is dangerously close to the lowest level it has been this year. The crypto has lost 2.7% of its value during the previous seven days and its bi-weekly gains only stand at 3.3%, although it managed to increase its market capitalization by $40 million over the last 24 hours and now has $1.20 billion in overall valuation. Sadly, the altcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is no better than its 12-month low despite some episodes of minor upticks in this particular department.

Source: TradingView Hedera’s Money Flow Index (MFI) is also leaning towards the bearish side as it signals a noteworthy accumulation rate over the previous two weeks. Finally, the weighted sentiment metric for the cryptocurrency has been on a status quo during the last few days, hinting that there is no significant level of demand for the asset to help trigger a surge in its price. Preparing Amid The Bear Market While Hedera failed to emulate the likes of Litecoin (LTC), ApeCoin (APE) and Axie Infinity (AXS) that recorded price jumps during this crypto winter, its network took advantage of the time to prepare for the long game. Using Twitter, HBAR Foundation shared a clip from the recent interview of the network’s VP for Ecosystem Acceleration, Rob Allen.

Although things might be looking a little bit good for Chainlink, investors and holders need to keep an eye on its whales as their market participation could easily pull the asset down once again. A Quick Glance At Chainlink Metrics It appears now that LINK holders have nothing to worry about especially that the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still hovering above the 50-neutral zone. However, the crypto’s Money Flow Index (MFI) has now settled in an overbought region after tremendous selling pressure was observed in the market. Meanwhile, over the last two days, the observed market outflows among exchanges were higher than the inflows, giving the cryptocurrency the ability to sustain its upward momentum during the same period. Source: TradingView The demand for Chainlink token seemed to have outweighed the on-going selling pressure as evidenced by the higher number of addresses receiving it as compared to the addresses sending it, 2,207 and 893, respectively. Although these point towards a bullish momentum, holders and investors need to be wary about LINK whales as those holding at least a million units are contributing to the selling pressure. If these large investors continue to reduce their balances by selling their holdings, there’s a big chance that the asset’s price will plummet once again. ⬡ Chainlink Adoption Update ⬡ This week, there were 20 integrations of 5 #Chainlink services across 7 different chains: #Arbitrum, #Avalanche, #BNB Chain, #Ethereum, #Fantom, #Optimism, and #Polygon.

42393931,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brcRu9,1670382607,Early Bitcoin Pioneer Ian Freeman Goes to Trial in New Hampshire,"CONCORD, New Hampshire — Federal prosecutors say early bitcoin pioneer and Libertarian activist Ian Freeman and a group of his associates helped scammers and other criminals launder more than $10 million using bitcoin through a network of bitcoin vending machines and in-person and virtual cash-for-bitcoin trades from 2016 until their arrests in 2021.  Freeman is standing trial in New Hampshire this week to face federal charges related to tax evasion and the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.  Freeman and a group of his associates – who have collectively been dubbed the “Crypto 6” – were arrested in a raid in March 2021.  Four of the Crypto 6, including Freeman’s fellow radio host Aria DiMezzo, his former girlfriend Renee Spinella and her husband Andrew Spinella, and Nobody (formerly Richard Paul) have taken plea deals. Though DiMezzo is not set to be sentenced until later this month, the other three defendants escaped with relatively lenient sentences, avoiding jail time. Another, Colleen Fordham, had all charges against her dropped.  But Freeman – the host of the ""Free Talk Live"" radio show and a one-time member of the Libertarian migration movement, the Free State Project – has maintained his innocence and has described the charges against him as politically motivated and the trial as a “sham.”  Freeman’s trial comes approximately a year and a half after his residence was raided in the middle of the night by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  In March 2021, gun-wielding agents surrounded the Keene, New Hampshire, home, crashing through a first-floor window with an armored car. They seized property from the residence, including $180,000 in cash, coins and bars made of precious metals, and two physical Casascius bitcoins worth a combined 101 bitcoins. Agents also seized several bitcoin kiosks owned by Freeman from restaurants and other local businesses.  The alleged crime  During their opening statements on Tuesday, prosecutors told the New Hampshire jury that Freeman was the ringleader of the illegal crypto selling business.  They said that Freeman began by installing several bitcoin kiosks (which have been described as distinct from bitcoin ATMs due to their local wallets) throughout the state of New Hampshire, and then eventually branched out into advertising for in-person and virtual cash-for-bitcoins trades on websites like localbitcoins.com.  Freeman didn’t ask a lot of questions of his customers, prosecutors told the jury, but charged his customers a premium (usually between 10% and 15%) for their privacy.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Georgiana MacDonald described Freeman’s “golden rule” of telling his customers that “what you do with your bitcoin is your business” and not to give him more information.  MacDonald said that Freeman’s bank accounts were often shut down, which is why he enlisted the help of his friends and colleagues, whom he asked to help him by opening bank accounts – sometimes in their own names, but also by forming religious entities.  Prosecutors say that DiMezzo (who described herself as a “transsexual Satanist anarchist” while running as the Republican candidate for Cheshire County sheriff in 2020) opened an account for the Reformed Satanic Church, and Nobody opened another for the so-called Church of the Invisible Hand.  MacDonald described the churches (of which a multitude are involved in Freeman’s operation, including the Shire Free Church, the entity that owns ""Free Talk Radio"") as “little more than letterhead” for Freeman’s operation.  Customers of Freeman’s virtual cash-for-bitcoins business (whom prosecutors say include scammers preying on the elderly with romance scams or “Nigerian prince” scams) were allegedly directed to send money to one of the bank accounts associated with the Crypto 6, using descriptions like “purchase of rare coins” or to avoid flagging the attention of the banks.  Defense hits back  When Freeman’s lawyer, Mark Sisti, addressed the jury during his opening statements on Tuesday, he told them that what they’d heard from MacDonald was “absolute nonsense” and accused the government of intentionally leaving out details that did not benefit their case against Freeman.  “Just because it's the federal government, and just because it is an Assistant U.S. Attorney saying it, doesn’t make it true,” Sisti told the jury. “Just because it’s an FBI investigation doesn’t make it credible.”  Sisti described Freeman as a gentle, non-violent man who helped victims of scams rather than perpetrating them, and had even helped with crypto-related investigations. The churches implicated in his operation were real institutions, Sisti argued, which had done things like set up an orphanage in Uganda and helped local businesses in New Hampshire set up bitcoin payment systems.  Freeman, Sisti said, operated his business in the open and kept records of his transactions (including pictures of his customers’ drivers licenses) on his computer.  “Why would you hold onto [licenses and pictures] if you’re scamming? You’d ditch that junk as quick as you could,” Sisti told the jury. “It makes no sense.”  Sisti said Freeman often declined to do business with suspicious customers, including an undercover agent who claimed to be a heroin dealer. Sisti said the agent put $20,000 in one of Freeman’s bitcoin kiosks even after Freeman told him he wouldn’t do business with him in person as he’d requested.  “[MacDonald] told you he said no before this clown went to a vending machine – without Freeman’s permission by the way – and dumped $20,000,” Sisti said. “What’s he supposed to do, put an armed guard in front of his vending machine?”  Sisti also pushed back against MacDonald’s assertions that Freeman ignored “red flags” in his customers and looked the other way when dealing with scammers. He referenced the case of one potential witness, a 76-year-old woman who, over six days, transferred her entire life savings – $755,000 – to a romance scammer who then allegedly traded the cash for bitcoins via Freeman, who charged a 10% fee.  What bank did the “little old lady” use, Sisti wondered aloud to the jury, that was “so highly regulated” yet missed the classic red flags of her pulling out enormous sums of money in less than a week?  “Show me that bank president,” Sisti said. “Because that guy should be sitting next to me [instead of Freeman].”  The tax issue  In addition to the unlicensed money transmitting business charges and two counts of money laundering (one that applies to his entire operation and one for allegedly selling bitcoin to an undercover FBI agent posing as a drug dealer), Freeman also faces four counts of tax evasion.  “Ian Freeman just doesn’t like to pay taxes,” MacDonald said.  Freeman would probably agree with her statement. Though he’s only being charged for attempting to evade taxes from 2016 to 2019, Freeman told New York Magazine last year that he hasn’t paid federal income tax since 2004.  He’s not alone. Libertarians, as a general rule, oppose federal taxes, and the phrase “taxation is theft” has become something of a political meme for many.  One trial attendee, who introduced himself pseudonymously as “Bear” (“You know, like the right to bear arms?” he explained), told CoinDesk outside the Concord courthouse that he does not pay federal income taxes and, based on the wording of the U.S. Constitution, does not believe anyone besides government employees are subject to taxes.  The question of how to get around taxes is a common one in libertarian circles, and bitcoin – at least in its salad days, before the development of sophisticated blockchain analytics and high-profile arrests of crypto criminals – was touted as a potential solution.  Read more: How Tax Protesters Set Off the Bitcoin Revolution  Many major figures in crypto, from ShapeShift founder Erik Voorhees to Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, were inspired by the libertarian use-case for cryptocurrency – but times are changing.  As the industry has matured and grown it has attracted the attention of both mainstream investors and regulators, and has subsequently undergone a makeover. “New” crypto is (at least in appearance) regulated and polished, and many industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong work hand in glove with the U.S. government.  Bitcoin-as-currency is increasingly uncommon, as is intentionally picking fights with regulators, making Freeman and those like him feel like relics of bitcoin’s crypto-anarchist past.  Crypto libertarians  Though they have been largely sidelined by the current iteration of the industry, crypto libertarians like Freeman are still active, especially in libertarian strongholds such as Keene, where ""Free Talk Radio"" is headquartered.  Many came out to Concord to show support for Freeman on the first day of his trial. Observers in bitcoin T-shirts peppered the courtroom benches, and an overflow room had to be set up for attendees after lunch.  “I’ve never seen the courtroom like that,” one security officer told CoinDesk, referencing the number of attendees.  Protesters also gathered in front of the courthouse. One man, wearing a custom-made bitcoin mascot costume, told CoinDesk he’d paid a quarter of a bitcoin to have a seamstress make it for the inevitable trial when the Crypto 6 were arrested in 2021. He said he and his husband had made the 29-hour drive from Denver, Colorado, to attend the trial.  The weeks ahead  Freeman’s trial, which began Tuesday, is slated to last approximately three weeks, with both sides listing dozens of potential witnesses.  Renee Spinella, Freeman’s former girlfriend and alleged accomplice, is expected to testify against him.  Though prosecutors dropped 17 of the initial 25 felony charges against Freeman ahead of the trial, the eight remaining counts carry a weighty 70-year maximum penalty if Freeman is found guilty.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/07/early-bitcoin-pioneer-ian-freeman-goes-to-trial-in-new-hampshire,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f518e4ffec6f4873717a7598837f6d337c982cc-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414787,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBKulI,1670378937,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Holds Its $17K Perch Amid Rate Hike Concerns,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos traded sideways, albeit slightly to the green.  Insights: Asia is ready for a scaled-up, crypto-friendly bank.  Prices  Bitcoin Watches and Waits From Its $17K Perch  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 866.79 −0.9 ▼ 0.1% Bitcoin (BTC) $17,054 +13.5 ▲ 0.1% Ethereum (ETH) $1,266 +1.5 ▲ 0.1% S&P 500 daily close  3,941.26 −57.6 ▼ 1.4% Gold  $1,782 +12.2 ▲ 0.7% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.51% ▼ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  By James Rubin  Bitcoin spent another day watching and waiting.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading just above $17,000, up a smidgen of a percentage point over the past 24 hours and roughly around its level of the past two weeks as investors continued to weigh economic indicators suggesting the U.S. Federal Reserve still had work to do on the inflation front. BTC has remained tethered to the $17,000 handhold it grabbed eight days ago when signs pointed to the Federal Reserve retreating from its ultra-monetary hawkishness.  But in a speech at the Brookings Institute on Dec. 1, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated the bank might raise interest rates higher than expected in 2023 even as it contemplated lowering its next rate hike later this month from its current fare of 75 basis points (bps) increases to 50 bps. ""The positive market response to the Powell speech suggests that macro conditions will still play a substantial part in BTC's price discovery onwards,"" Arcane Research, which provides analysis of digital asset trends, wrote in a newsletter on Tuesday.  Arcane added, however that separate from reaction to Powell's remarks, markets have stayed ""directionless ... as BTC has spent the first six days of December floating in a narrow trading range near $17,000. The market slowdown is reflected in severely reduced trading volumes in spot and derivatives markets, and the last month seems to have caused market participants to shy [away from] the crypto market.""  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,260, up slightly since Monday, same time. Most other major altcoins were recently in the green with AXS, the token of gaming platform Axie Infinity, rising more than 4.5% to continue a recent surge. SUSHI, the token of decentralized exchange Sushiswap, was off more than 10%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, climbed 0.33%.  In an increasingly common pattern, crypto prices veered from U.S. equity indexes, which sank amid inflationary worries and macroeconomic uncertainties that have plagued 2022. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 2% and the S&P 500, with its strong technology component, tumbled 1.4%.  Arcane wrote that the crypto market's more than week-long calm has stemmed from ""a trader exodus"" following the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX. ""The crypto market has mostly traded as one coordinated organism in the last week evident by all indexes trading in a very flat environment,"" Arcane wrote.  In an emailed market analysis, Mark Conners, head of research at digital asset manager 3iQ, noted that institutions have been ""doubling down on the promise of blockchain and digital assets, despite the FTX filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and other contagion. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Goldman Sachs (GS), one of the world's largest investment banks, was looking to spend tens of millions of dollars on crypto firms whose valuations have been hit hard by FTX's implosion.  3iQ's Connors also highlighted Fidelity's new retail-focused digital asset offering and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's comments on decentralized finance's potential. He also noted a Financial Times op-ed by BNY Mellon CEO Robin Vince, who called for an ""embrace digital asset innovation."" Vance also wrote that ""a comprehensive regulatory framework is needed, but much of the underpinning already exists and can be extended from the regulation of traditional assets. There is a path to be found.""

But while the bank’s exposure to the FTX exchange is limited, its problem is that it is wholly reliant on U.S. regulations.  While Silvergate doesn’t have any outstanding loans to FTX, the failed crypto exchange represents just 10% of the bank’s $11.9 billion in total deposits. It’s not a worst-case scenario, but the concentration of deposits is alarming to some short sellers: Coinbase, Paxos, Crypto.com and Kraken are the bank’s next largest customers.  Silvergate's smaller rival Signature seems to be cognizant of the issue, and recently announced that it intends to shrink its crypto exposure. Investors are signaling that it's as good as time as ever to reduce crypto exposure, as Silvergate's stock has underperformed bitcoin itself, and also KRE, a regional bank ETF that holds shares in many similar-sized banks.  And all of Silvergate's major customers are based in the U.S. For a bank that specializes in an asset class that is, in theory, decentralized, the bank’s book is heavily centralized around the U.S. regulatory regime.  The exact regulatory response to FTX’s collapse hasn’t been written yet. But lawmakers are eager to understand what happened, and there’s been talk of establishing significant guardrails to ensure that what occurred doesn’t happen again.  We can all agree that the FTX-Alameda structure was problematic, but lawmakers are bound to look beyond that and do what they can to heavily restrict future crypto trading in the U.S. Onshore crypto trading isn’t going to look the same in the U.S. in 2023 and beyond – and Silvergate is going to be stuck dealing with this much-more-regulated reality.  But the U.S. isn’t the only regulatory regime in town. Around Asia there are countries and territories with much more industry-friendly rulebooks that provide regulatory clarity, an absence about which many U.S. stakeholders have complained.  Sure, some such as Singapore discourage retail trading, but make up for it with a high concentration of institutions and family offices that trade. Then there’s Thailand, which bans meme coins and some non-fungible tokens (NFT), citing a lack of substance, but doesn’t discourage retail crypto trading if rules can be followed.  ""...To protect consumers, we need regulatory guidance for companies that ensures trust and transparency. There's a reason why most crypto trading is offshore – companies have 0 guidance on how to comply here in the U.S.,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse tweeted in mid-November.  ""Compare that with Singapore, which has a licensing framework, token taxonomy laid out, and much more. They can appropriately regulate crypto b/c they've done the work to define what 'good' looks like, and know all tokens aren’t securities (despite what [SEC Chair Gary Gensler] insists),"" he added in a follow-up tweet.  If crypto gradually moves offshore because of reactionary over-regulation in the U.S., Silvergate will have no exposure to this.  Instead, crypto-friendly banks abroad, like Thailand’s SCB (which is actively investing in crypto infrastructure) or DBS will take up this niche. It’s not hard to replicate, after all: Silvergate developed its position in the market by not being outwardly crypto-hostile like other banks. There have already been a few competitors pop up, like Hong Kong’s First Digital Trust (FDT), which directly names Silvergate as a competitor.  The market is ready for this to scale, reproducing Silvergate in an environment that is more conducive to crypto trading.

42414768,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBKtjc,1670375566,Crypto Audit Platform Sherlock Expects $4M Loss From Troubled Loans on Maple Finance,"Smart contract auditing platform Sherlock predicted a $4 million loss for its stakers, about a third of the capital in its staking pool, because of Orthogonal Trading FTX-induced loan defaults on crypto lending protocol Maple Finance, the firm said Monday in a blog post.  Sherlock said it had deposited some $5 million USDC of its $12 million staking pool on Aug. 31 to the credit pool on Maple overseen by M11 Credit.  Orthogonal Trading’s insolvency triggered $31 million of loans in the credit pool to default this week. The bad debt represents 80% of the credit pool’s outstanding loans. When Sherlock invested in the pool, however, Orthogonal’s borrowings only accounted for 14% of the pool’s loans.  In the post, Sherlock cited Orthogonal Trading’s outsized weight in the loan book as “one of the main reasons why the losses at Sherlock are so large.”  When FTX collapsed in early November, Sherlock wanted to withdraw funds from the Maple credit pool but couldn’t because Maple's 90-day lockup on new deposits had not ended, according to the firm.  Sherlock said it initiated removing funds at the end of November after the lockup expired, and was in the middle of the 10-day waiting period before reclaiming assets when Orthogonal Trading defaulted on Dec. 5.  Sherlock stakers would likely stomach a $3.75 million to $4 million loss, the platform predicted, as 20%-25% of the funds might be recoverable.  “Unfortunately, Sherlock is not in a financial position to compensate stakers for this loss if Sherlock wants to continue operations otherwise,” the statement said.  Losses for Sherlock’s stakers demonstrate the far-reaching tremors of crypto exchange giant FTX’s spectacular blowup. Orthogonal Trading, both borrower and credit pool manager on Maple, suffered losses because of assets stuck on FTX and defaulted on $36 million of debt. Maple also severed ties with Orthogonal for misrepresenting its financial woes for weeks.

5238230,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511308,1670371204,"Bitcoin Investor Cohorts Now Have Close Cost-Basis, What Does It Say About Market?","Data shows the different Bitcoin investor cohorts now have their cost-basis packed together in a tight range. Here’s what this may tell us about the current market. All Bitcoin Investor Groups Have Cost-Basis Between $18.7k And $22.9k According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the cost-basis of the wider BTC market is currently around $20.2k. Here, the “cost-basis” refers to the price at which the average investor in the Bitcoin market acquired their coins. The entire market can be split into two main investor cohorts, the “short-term holders” (STHs) and the “long-term holders” (LTHs). The STH group includes all investors that acquired their coins within the last 155 days. The LTHs, on the other hand, are made up by holders that have been holding their coins since more than 155 days ago. Statistically, the LTH group is the cohort that’s least likely to sell their coins at any point, since the longer investors keep their coins the less probable they become to break their dormancy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Undervalued For 170 Days, How Does This Compare With Previous Bears? The cost-basis of either of these two groups is the price at which the average investor belonging to said cohort bought their coins. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the cost-basis of both LTHs and STHs, as well as that of the wider Bitcoin market: Looks like the price was rejected by the STH cost-basis not too long ago | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 49, 2022 As you can see in the above graph, the cost-basis of the Bitcoin STHs has declined as the bear market has gone on, something that makes sense as this cohort only includes investors who bought recently. Naturally, the “recent” prices during the bear have been lower and lower. The LTH cost-basis has slightly trended up as investors who bought during the higher prices are now a part of this group. Currently, this metric has a value of $22.9k. Related Reading: For First Time Ever, Bitcoin Hash Ribbon Golden Cross Has Failed This isn’t too far from the $18.7k cost-basis of the STHs and the $20.2k cost-basis of the wider market. This means that the different investor groups in the current market have acquired their coins at similar prices. The implication of this is that the perceived risk and opportunity among all the holders, whether short-term or long-term, is the same. “As such, it is more likely that the aggregate market will start to behave in a more cohesive manner in response to volatility,” notes the report. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $17k, up 3% in the last week.
