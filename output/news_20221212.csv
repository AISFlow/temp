Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin returned to its perch comfortably above $17,000 after dipping earlier in the day amid a news report that Binance was the subject of a U.S. federal probe.  Insights: QCP Capital founder Darius Sit told a Tapei Blockchain Week audience that he does not see a recovery before 2024.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 863.60 +2.5 ▲ 0.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $17,235 +140.3 ▲ 0.8% Ethereum (ETH) $1,277 +13.0 ▲ 1.0% S&P 500 daily close  3,990.56 +56.2 ▲ 1.4% Gold  $1,792 −5.7 ▼ 0.3% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.61% ▲ 0.0 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Continues Its Side Ways  By James Rubin  A day before they will have a clearer view of the inflation landscape, investors had to reckon with the crypto industry's latest storm clouds: a report that Binance is the subject of a U.S. Justice Department probe, and later Monday, the arrest of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  Bitcoin tumbled below $16,900 at one point before recovering to recently trade at about $17,235, up slightly over the past 24 hours. BTC has spent much of the past two weeks clinging to support above $17,000 and seems likely to continue its tenacious ways for at least another day when the Bureau of Labor Statistics announces November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.  Inflation has shown signs of continuing its downward trend of recent months. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely drop its latest interest rate increase to 50 basis points (bps) from its current streak of 75 bps hikes, although markets are likely to remain nervously watchful for the time being.  ""It's a strong risk-off environment, not just in crypto but across every industry and in every country around the world,"" Hany Rashwan, CEO of 21.co, the parent company of crypto exchange-trading fund firm 21 Shares, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""The easiest way of thinking about this is [in] the last 10 years money has been cheaper to acquire, to borrow. As interest rates go up, the value of money becomes higher, so it becomes harder to get, and as a result people spend more carefully.""  Yet, Rashwan added that his firm has ""been comforted internally by the plateauing of the bitcoin price within a specific band.""  Ether followed a similar pattern to bitcoin, falling earlier in the day before rebounding. The second-largest crypto by market value was recently changing hands at about $1,275, a small gain from Sunday, same time. Most other major cryptos were in the green, with MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, and SUSHI, the token of the Sushiswap decentralized exchange, recently rising about 2% and 1%, respectively.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was recently up 0.23%.  U.S. equity indexes closed in an upbeat mood about inflation and the Federal Reserve's expected dovish turn. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively.  Meanwhile, according to Reuters, the Justice Department has discussed possible plea deals with Binance's lawyers. Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle began investigating Binance in 2018 after a spate of cases that saw criminals use Binance to transfer illicit funds, according to Reuters. Other prosecutors believe that more evidence needs to be gathered before a criminal case can be filed, causing a split within the Department of Justice.  Late Monday, the Bahamian Attorney General's office announced the arrest of Bankman-Fried. ""SBF's arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against SBF and is likely to request his extradition,"" the office wrote in a release. ""As a result of the notification received and the material provided therewith, it was deemed appropriate for the Attorney General to seek SBF's arrest and hold him in custody pursuant to our nation's Extradition Act.""

But there are still uses for the asset class, and ""green shoots"" are emerging.  “We are in a credit crisis triggered by LUNA and UST,” QCP’s Darius Sit said on stage, referring to the Terra token and algorithmic stablecoin. “This means there are cascading effects on everyone that had credit risks, and there are still some landmines in the space.”  Sit said that he sees a great reset and washout caused by the credit crisis, which won't end until investors see whether Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its Genesis Global Trading unit are going to collapse or stay together. (DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk).  “If this comes apart, there’s another round of defaults,” he said.  Sit pegs a recovery happening around 2024, but macroeconomics will also play a role in this. He noted that the most successful appreciation of digital asset prices came during the COVID-19 pandemic when the U.S. Fed was enlarging its balance sheet. But now the opposite is happening.  As far as the use cases and green shoots go, Sit points to the strength of the stablecoin industry, which Sit says has record revenue. There’s also the continued institutional adoption of the crypto options and derivatives market, where QCP is the most active.  “The trading teams are all former [foreign exchange] people,” Sit said.  If there’s one thing that not even a “dot-com bubble and 2008” can change, it's that everyone is now talking about crypto, Sit said. Meaning, from the cab driver to the banker to the former FX people now trading crypto options and derivatives. Things like NFTs and Web3 gaming will survive this market cycle – but just at a lower valuation.

42413430,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9BkG,1670888120,FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Arrested in the Bahamas,"The Royal Bahamas Police Force arrested FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, a press statement said.  The arrest came after the U.S. filed criminal charges against Bankman-Fried, the statement said, and the nation expects the U.S. to request the Bahamas extradite Bankman-Fried in short order.  ""As a result of the notification received and the material provided therewith, it was deemed appropriate for the Attorney General to seek SBF’s arrest and hold him in custody pursuant to our nation’s Extradition Act,"" the statement, attributed to Attorney General Ryan Pinder, said. ""At such time as a formal request for extradition is made, The Bahamas intends to process it promptly, pursuant to Bahamian law and its treaty obligations with the United States.""  A tweet from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York confirmed that prosecutors in the U.S. indicted Bankman-Fried, though the indictment remains under seal.  According to the New York Times, the charges could include wire fraud, securities fraud, money laundering and related conspiracy charges.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also plans to bring charges, a statement from Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said.  ""We commend our law enforcement partners for working to secure the arrest of Mr. Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas on federal criminal charges,"" he said. ""The Securities and Exchange Commission has separately authorized charges relating to Mr. Bankman-Fried’s violations of our securities laws, which will be filed publicly tomorrow in the Southern District of New York.""  In the Bahamas' statement, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said the country would continue pursuing its own investigation into FTX's collapse, alongside the U.S.'s criminal charges.  Bankman-Fried was set to testify virtually before the House Financial Services Committee about the exchange's collapse on Tuesday. In a statement, committee Chair Maxine Waters said she was ""surprised to hear"" of the arrest at the U.S. Attorney's office's direction.  ""It’s about time the process to bring Mr. Bankman-Fried to justice has begun. However, as the public knows, my staff and I have been working diligently for the past month to secure Mr. Bankman-Fried’s testimony before our Committee tomorrow morning,"" the California Democrat said. ""We received confirmation this afternoon from Mr. Bankman-Fried and his lawyers that he was still planning to appear before the Committee tomorrow, but then he was arrested.""  In a separate news release, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said officers with its Financial Crimes Investigation Unit arrested Bankman-Fried around 6:00 p.m. local time.  ""He was arrested reference to various Financial Offences against laws of the United States, which are also offences against laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas,"" the document said.  Bankman-Fried will appear in court on Tuesday in the Bahamas. Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's attorney, did not immediately return a request for comment.  FTX fell last month after a CoinDesk report revealed that Alameda Research, a sister company also founded by Bankman-Fried, held a large number of FTT tokens, which are issued by FTX.  FTX filed for bankruptcy just over a month ago. Its new CEO, John J. Ray III, said in court filings and prepared Congressional testimony that he had never seen anything quite like the corporate governance and documentation failures that he found at FTX.  Among other issues, he found that FTX had heavily commingled customer and corporate assets, losing billions along the way. In his prepared remarks, published earlier Monday, he said his new team had managed to secure about $1 billion of company assets to date.  For his part, Bankman-Fried went on a press tour after leaving his company, speaking to The New York Times, New York Magazine, Vox and numerous other news outlets. He spoke at a Twitter Spaces and in a live Forbes interview earlier on Monday.  UPDATE (Dec. 12, 2022, 23:45 UTC): Adds additional comment.

5459302,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512148,1670886035,"Bullish Divergences On Ethereum Chart, What’s Incoming?","The Ethereum price is trading laterally on its daily chart. The coin has moved south by 1.8% in that timeframe. Both the bulls and bears are trying to take over the market as the altcoin remains within a congested price zone. If the altcoin price is rejected at higher levels, the chance of a reversal might increase. This would mean that bulls represented an upper hand. Moving sideways, however, will bring the asset close to its local support line of $1,220. The current technical outlook indicates that the bulls have not exited the market. If the bulls remain in the market, a breakout above the $1,300 price mark can be predicted. In the event of continued consolidation, the chance of a move upward cannot be completely ruled out. The significant recovery often allows the traders to replenish their losses before the altcoin starts to trade southward. Traders might be presented with an opportunity to enter the market at $1,220 before ETH attempts to revisit the $1,300 price. Ethereum is trading at a price nearly 74% below its all-time high secured in 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stuck In Key Range, Why The Bulls Remain In Action Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ETH was exchanging hands at $1,251 at the time of writing. The coin has been swaying between the $1,220 and $1,300 marks. However, indicators have continued to side with the bulls as buyers have shown interest in the asset. Overhead resistance for the Ethereum price was at $1,260. After breaking through that barrier, the coin will face a new one at $1,300. On the flip side, falling from the $1,251 level will drag the altcoin to $1,200 and then to $1,170. The amount of ETH traded in the last session declined slightly, indicating some loss in buying strength. Technical Analysis The chance of Ethereum registering an uptick increases owing to the several bullish divergences on the chart. Bullish divergences are tied to the coin picking up momentum. The Relative Strength Index also spotted a bullish divergence, indicating that buying strength could get stronger. The RSI was just above the half-line, meaning buyers were more than sellers on the chart. The Ethereum price was spotted slightly above the 20-Simple Moving Average Line. This denoted that buyers were still in charge of driving the price momentum in the market. Other technical indicators for the altcoin continued to exhibit buying strength. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence portrays that price momentum continued to form green signal bars. The green histograms were the buy signal for the coin, which could further mean an entry point for traders. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicates investor interest by capturing capital inflows and outflows. CMF was positive as it was above the half-line, meaning capital inflows exceeded outflows.

In a recent YouTube interview, he claimed that the planned integration would help establish a confidentiality network of smart contracts. According to him, Midnight aims to resolve the paradoxical issue of having privacy and disclosure of a protocol’s rules simultaneously. Related Reading: Quant Explains How This Nasdaq Support Retest Could Also Help Reverse Bitcoin The announcement yielded positive results, evident with a spike in on-chain activity. Data from Santiment on Cardano’s Age Consumed showed a movement of over 107 billion ADA (including old coins) on December 7. Cardano’s Growth Booster: New Privacy Protocols And A Surge In On-Chain Activity Below are the critical remarks made by Charles Hoskinson in the interview streamed on Corey Costa’s Crypto Coins YouTube channel. From a regulatory perspective, you’re not actually allowed to use blockchain systems [for privacy]. Why? There’s [the] Bank Secrecy Act, GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation], you have all these privacy departments. He continued: Anytime you could engage in a regulated business, there’s a privacy requirement because regulated business requires you to give away some personally-definable information, and there’s a privacy law on the other side of it that says you have to keep it a secret. Hoskinson further added, The problem is that if you try to do it in a blockchain setting, your private information becomes public to everybody… so it made sense to me to find a way to… create a confidentiality network, so like what Ethereum did to Bitcoin, where Ethereum said ‘we have programmability,’ Midnight does to [Cardano], where instead of having a privacy coin, what you do is you have a confidentiality network, you have smart private contracts. Cardano’s Midnight targets a general issue—concurrent privacy and disclosure legislation—that most blockchain protocols face. And the result is a surge in on-chain activity, which many experts believe would add more value to the network. Should You Buy Cardano Now? Please note ADA has a fixed maximum supply of 45 billion tokens maximum supply. This figure would eventually have an impact on the cryptocurrency’s value in the future when it reaches its max supply. The future value of this coin may depend on its new privacy technology.

Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Monday in a joint statement. “He has declined in an unprecedented abdication of accountability.”  Bankman-Fried, who has made a number of remote public appearances in recent days and will testify at a House Financial Services Committee hearing this week, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the Senate complaint.  Earlier on Monday, he told a Twitter Space that he would be testifying virtually before the House committee because he is “overbooked,” and had some concerns about his security were he to travel from The Bahamas, where he resides, to the U.S.  “I'm quite overbooked and was not planning to be testifying until like very recently,” he said.  The statement argued that congressional oversight only works when the CEOs, regulators and other government officials they invite to testify actually show up.  The lawmakers said Bankman-Fried’s counsel has “stated they are unwilling to accept service of a subpoena.” So the lawmakers will “continue to work to have him appear.”  Their earlier statement on Dec. 8 said that the collapse of the company Bankman-Fried founded and ran “has caused real financial harm to consumers,” and the lawmakers wanted answers from him about his “misconduct at FTX.”",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/12/us-senators-rebuke-sam-bankman-fried-for-refusing-invitations-to-testify,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9c8dd4952d8e66c4ade36f894bc2accf213241a-3084x2313.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite crypto winter, first-time and returning buyers per day in Polygon’s non-fungible token (NFT) market reached new all-time highs during the last month of the year, per data from blockchain analytics platform Nansen. The surge comes even as NFT ecosystems on other chains such as Ethereum and Solana have a decreasing number of users per week.  Solana’s NFT users per week dropped from over 160,000 users in late September to less than 60,000 users today, while Ethereum’ users per week dropped roughly 250,000 users to some 183,000 users in the same time period.

Polygon x Reddit  Polygon’s NFT market in the past 24 hours had 10 collections with over 180,000 holders and four collections with above 500,000. For juxtaposition, Ethereum’s NFT market in the past 24 hours had four collections with over 100,000 holders and one collection above 500,000. Solana’s NFT market didn't have a single collection above 30,000 holders in the past 24 hours, Nansen data suggests.  Out of the top 10 collections in the past 24 hours for Polygon’s NFT market, four of them are connected to Reddit, which were airdropped in late August as part of Reddit’s initial push to integrate blockchain technology.  Referring to Polygon’s collaboration with mainstream brands such as Nike, Starbucks and Reddit, Polygon Studios CEO Ryan Wyatt, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover,” “We’ve built this great funnel for partners to come through and make the onboarding to Polygon really seamless.”  Users per week and transactions per week  Additionally, the number of users per week in Polygon’s NFT ecosystem grew more than 500% since early August, resembling buyers per day. Between Dec. 5 and Dec. 12, the blockchain had over 240,000 users, an all-time high for the number of users per week.  Polygon’s transactions per week for the past four weeks totaled roughly 24.36 million transactions, with the majority coming from mints, showing increased activity compared with previous weeks in 2022.  Even though the most recent week ending on Dec. 12 had a lower number of transactions compared to the previous three weeks, transactions in this past week, which stand at some three million, exceed almost all other weeks in 2022, according to Nansen data.  Volume  Year to date, Polygon NFTs have had a total of 338 million MATIC, worth $305 million, in trading volume across 2.27 million unique wallets.  Even though buyers, users and transactions per week are posting new highs, trading volume per week in recent months is near the lows, “suggesting most activity are free mints/low value purchasing,” tweeted Martin Lee, senior data journalist at Nansen. The increase in adoption has not yet translated into an increase in trading volume, data from Nansen shows.  “My view is that the current adoption path largely led by @Fwiz [Ryan Wyatt, CEO of Polygon Studios] and team at @0xPolygon helps to remove the current stigma and idea that NFTs’ main value is speculation,” tweeted Lee in an original Twitter thread about the growth adoption in Polygon’s NFT ecosystem.",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Sage D.

Ray III, the new CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ), is set to tell U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday that the once-mighty firm spent some $5B -- prior to filing for bankruptcy on November 11 -- on different investments and businesses, many of which may be worth just a fraction of what was paid, according to his prepared remarks dated Monday. Another $1B was said to have been loaned out to insiders. In addition, Ray, who oversaw Enron's high-profile bankruptcy in 2001, and his new team have discovered a number of other issues that ultimately led to the demise of FTX. In explaining why FTX US filed for bankruptcy along with the rest of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire, Ray explained that ""FTX US was not operated independently of FTX.com. Chapter 11 protection was necessary both to avoid a 'run on the bank' at FTX US and to allow our team the time to identify and protect its assets."" Of note, SBF said recently that FTX US was solvent . On a somewhat brighter note, he will tell the House Financial Services Committee that his team has thus far secured more than $1B in digital assets, though that represents just a fraction of what FTX owes its creditors. ""In the absence of cooperation from responsible parties or any appropriate system to track and protect crypto assets, we are continuing our painstaking forensic efforts to account for all of the assets, both as to the FTX US and FTX.com exchanges, as well as Alameda,"" he will say. Overall, Ray pointed to FTX's shortage in effective security controls, commingling of assets, the lack of documentation, Alameda's ability to borrow funds held at FTX and the absence of reliable financial statements as only some of the ""unacceptable management practices"" that took effect under SBF's leadership. ""Although our investigation is ongoing and detailed findings will have to await its conclusion, the FTX Group’s collapse appears to stem from the absolute concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company that is entrusted with other people’s money or assets,"" Ray will say.

42413432,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9BlC,1670883345,Crypto Markets Today: Binance a Target of Federal Probe,"U.S. prosecutors are considering criminal charges against crypto exchange Binance and individual executives, including founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao, Reuters reported, citing two people.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  The Department of Justice has also discussed possible plea deals with Binance's lawyers, the report added.  Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle began investigating Binance in 2018 after a spate of cases that saw criminals use Binance to transfer illicit funds, according to Reuters.  Other prosecutors believe that more evidence needs to be gathered before a criminal case can be filed, causing a split within the Department of Justice.  Binance refuted the Reuters article in a statement. Tigran Gambaryan, the exchange's global head of intelligence and investigations, said Binance has ""responded to over 47,000 law enforcement requests"" since November 2021.  According to a Binance spokesperson, “As has been reported widely, regulators are doing a sweeping review of every crypto company against many of the same issues. This nascent industry has grown quickly and Binance has shown its commitment to security and compliance through large investments in our team as well as the tools and technology we use to detect and deter illicit activity.”  Gambaryan added that Binance has increased its security and compliance headcount by more than 500% and that its team is ""possibly even the strongest in the entire financial sector.""  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH): The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rebounded above the $17,000 level after dipping below this threshold earlier Monday amid traders’ anticipation of the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Tuesday. BTC traded as low as $16,882 over the past 24 hours. Ether followed a similar pattern, sliding below $1,250 before regaining ground to trade at about $1,275, up slightly from Sunday, same time.  Tron's decentralized algorithmic stablecoin (USDD): The USDD stablecoin, championed by Tron's founder Justin Sun and managed by Tron's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), fell to slightly below 97 U.S. cents Monday, hitting its lowest level since June 22, according to data source CoinGecko. The decline violated the DAO's 3% price fluctuation threshold for price fluctuations to be considered de-pegs.  Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink’s new “staking” program was intended to be broad-based by limiting each wallet to 7,000 LINK tokens. But blockchain data shows one large holder – a “whale,” in crypto parlance – recently was able to get around the limits by creating more than 150 addresses – and then staking the full 7,000 LINK allotment from each of them. Chainlink’s LINK token was recently trading around $6.60 Monday, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Atypically Bearish Early December Bodes Poorly for Bitcoin Investors  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Historical pricing data on bitcoin suggests crypto winter will likely worsen next month. So far this month, bitcoin investors have suffered an average 0.08% daily loss, which is far lower than the 0.20% historic average for December.  Spread over 30 trading days, investors would lose 2.4% compared to the 6% gains they notched for bitcoin in past Decembers.  Since 2014, bitcoin's average daily returns have historically been the lowest in January. What's made these dips less troublesome in past years is that December and February have traditionally been strong months for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

5456048,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512087,1670882430,Why The GBTC Discount Could Lead To A Bitcoin Sell-Off,"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) remains the largest bitcoin trust in the world with billions of dollars worth of BTC, but in the last year, the trust has had a hard time keeping up with the market. The result of this has been a large premium that has continued to widen through the bear market. Currently, the GBTC is trading at a record-high premium, which has sparked speculations of a potential BTC sell-off in the pipeline. GBTC Nears 50% Premium The month of November was fraught with adversity for the crypto space and this is mirrored by the GBTC premium. It shows a near-steady increase in the discount or premium to NAV which has carried on into the month of December. On Dec. 7, the GBTC premium to NAV saw one of its largest jumps when it move from 43.61% on Dec. 6 to 47.27% on Dec. 7. This has brought the premium to new all-time highs and even though the following days did not see as large of an increase, a near 1% increase each day saw the GBTC close out last week at a premium to NAV of 48.62%. Related Reading: Inconsistent Metrics Indicate Further Struggle For SUSHI – Colder Winter Ahead? Now, what this means is that the price of ‘one BTC’ is trading for 48.62% lower on the GBTC than it is on the spot market. Normally, this would present as an opportunity to buy for cheap but GBTC investors are not buying any actual bitcoin, and with the issues that Grayscale’s parent company, DCG, has been facing, it has become increasingly obvious to investors that the fund may be headed for trouble. Will This Lead To Bitcoin Sell-Off? The GBTC currently holds more than 640,000 BTC worth around $11 billion at today’s prices. As such, the speculations about a potential collapse do not stem from concerns about Grayscale itself but about its parent DCG company. DCG is reportedly in a $2 billion debt, most of which stems from Genesis Trading which had limited withdrawals a few weeks ago, and Eldridge. Rumors circulating on the interwebs are that DCG actually GBTC shares to collateralize its loan from Genesis, which makes up the large majority of its loan. GBTC share price at $8.01 | Source: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) on TradingView.com On a recent episode of ‘The Chopping Block’, Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner at Dragonfly Capital, said that the $1.1 billion promissory note to Genesis could be “callable. What this means is that if Genesis were to be liquidated or go into bankruptcy, then DCG would be required to pay the total value of the loan. The problem is that DCG does not have the needed amount to honor it if this does happen. Subsequently, DCG could look towards GBTC for a bailout if this were to happen.

42413429,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9BiO,1670881443,SEC Strikes Back in Grayscale Suit Over GBTC ETF Conversion,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a brief last week defending itself against claims its denial of Grayscale Investment’s application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was “arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory.  Grayscale filed suit against the SEC on June 29 – the same day the SEC rejected its application – and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC’s order. Grayscale is a sister company of CoinDesk.  The suit was followed by a flurry of support from the wider crypto industry and beyond, and five amicus curiae (friend of the court) briefs were filed in the case.  But the SEC is sticking to its guns. In the regulator’s first response brief since Grayscale filed suit, the SEC reiterated that its reasons for denying Grayscale’s applications were consistent with its earlier decisions to deny every other spot bitcoin ETF application it had received.  Read more: Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin ETF Rejections  ‘No inconsistency’  In its lawsuit, Grayscale pointed to the SEC’s approval of several bitcoin futures ETFs to argue that greenlighting one type (futures ETFs) of instrument while rejecting the other (spot, or bitcoin-holding ETFs) was arbitrary, and thus a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The SEC pushed back in its filing, arguing that “the two products are not the same” and have “fundamental differences in the ability to detect and deter fraud and manipulation,” that “reasonably support treating the two products differently.”  Futures ETFs, unlike spot ETFs, are tradable only on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which the SEC pointed out is overseen by federal regulators and performs “extensive surveillance of the trading activity on its market.”  The SEC also pointed to prior statements made by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that its permission to trade bitcoin futures “does NOT provide for … value judgements about the underlying spot market.”  An issue of surveillance  The SEC has long maintained that its denial of the ETF applications is largely due to the lack of regulatory oversight of the spot market, including surveillance-sharing agreements between a “regulated market of significant size” and a regulated exchange.  Without proper oversight, the SEC has argued, spot ETFs could be vulnerable to “fraudulent and manipulative conduct,” including wash trading, price manipulation by “whales,” “malicious control of the bitcoin network,” hacking, insider trading, “manipulative activity involving purported ‘stablecoins’” and fraud at crypto exchanges.  Grayscale and would-be spot ETF applicants that came before the SEC have argued the surveillance-sharing agreements the regulator wants aren’t necessary in the case of bitcoin, which they have argued has “novel protections” against fraud.  But the SEC disagrees. In the filing last week, it pointed to statements made by Grayscale itself in its registration statement, which warns customers of the “unregulated nature and lack of transparency” surrounding the operations of spot-trading platforms, the risks of hacking and the risk of “fraud and manipulative activity” at bitcoin trading platforms.  The SEC also highlighted a statement from the New York Stock Exchange that “fraud and manipulation may exist and that bitcoin trading on any given exchange may be no more uniquely resistant to fraud and manipulation than other commodity markets.”  “Given these prior statements and the risks the Commission identified, the Commission concluded that NYSE Arca failed to substantiate its assertions regarding bitcoin’s purportedly novel anti-fraud properties,” the SEC wrote.  Next steps  Grayscale’s reply to the SEC is due on Jan. 13. The SEC’s response to Grayscale is due on Feb. 3.  After all briefs have been submitted, the judge will review the SEC’s decision to reject Grayscale’s application and make a determination.  As the lawsuit progresses, shares of Grayscale’s largest fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), are trading a record 47% discount to the value of the underlying cryptocurrency.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/12/sec-strikes-back-in-grayscale-suit-over-gbtc-etf-conversion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5778d4d8ee03c102e3d7aed047acfa7e06c1bd1-4952x3244.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company bills itself as Terra’s “trusted security provider” and says it has conducted white-hat cybersecurity work across the Terra ecosystem and worked directly with Terraform Labs.  “We believe everything is hackable over time as technologies and attack vectors become more sophisticated too,” Vinicious Marino, CEO of SCV, wrote in the proposal.  Marino said SCV would take a “proactive approach” to securing the Terra network by actively monitoring projects to achieve a “bare minimum” of security.  While Terra experienced a death spiral earlier this year, its creator, Do Kwon, scrambled to revive the network with Terra 2.0, a fork of the original fallen chain. The community of token holders in this new network have voted to airdrop LUNA to users, create a social know-your-customer (KYC) protocol and fund a new stablecoin.  In the proposal, SCV requested about 500,000 LUNA, or $900,000, to perform its security measures.

FTX was among OpenFortune’s clients and helped craft ill-timed musings stuffed inside the cookies such as, “You will soon feel a renewed sense of optimism for the future,” “There’s so much more to come,” and “In retrospect, it was inevitable.”  Although the phrases have aged poorly in the wake of the company’s collapse, OpenFortune hasn’t confirmed whether the partnership has been suspended, telling CoinDesk to direct all future questions to FTX, which did not respond for comment.  The partnership, which is likely the exchange’s smallest, is also one of its last remaining. While FTX was previously the powerhouse sponsor behind stadium namings and Super Bowl ads, brands have been eager to scrub any associations with the tattered exchange. The National Basketball Association’s Miami Heat, University of California Berkeley athletic department and esports franchise TSM all cut ties with the exchange in November, ending multi-year deals worth a combined $400 million.  Even if OpenFortune doesn’t honor the remainder of its contract with FTX, the company’s fortune cookies will be on the menu for at least a few more months. A representative of Hua Ting in Hillsdale, Illinois, a Chinese restaurant that works with OpenFortune, said that it still had over three months of FTX cookies left in stock as of late November. OpenFortune distributed more than 400,000 of its cookies to Bradenton, Florida, alone in March.  Morgan Polikoff, who dined at Hua Ting in November, can still remember his FTX fortune off the top of his head.  “My fortune was, ‘There’s a price to waiting,’” Polikoff told CoinDesk. “Pretty ironic given that in the case of FTX, the price to waiting was losing all your money in crypto.”  On OpenFortune’s website, it pitches to clients that nearly 6% of its cookie eaters share their fortunes on social media. In the case of FTX, it may have gotten its money's worth; hundreds of cookie eaters have shared their FTX fortunes to Twitter and Reddit in the last several months alone.

42420855,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVkr,1670878833,Atypically Bearish Early December Bodes Poorly for Bitcoin Investors,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors should remain cautious.  Historic pricing data for BTC suggests crypto winter will likely worsen next month. So far this month, bitcoin investors have suffered an average 0.08% daily loss, which is far lower than the 0.20% historic average for the month.  Spread over 30 trading days, investors would lose 2.4% compared to the 6% gains they notched for bitcoin in past Decembers.  Since 2014, bitcoin’s average daily returns have historically been the lowest in January. What’s made these dips less troublesome in past years is that December and February have traditionally been strong months for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Bitcoin has been hovering above $17,000 for the past two weeks, except for a two-day dip last week as investors mulled over the latest fallout from crypto exchange FTX’s collapse, and concerns about inflation.  The price invariability and declining trading volume have highlighted investors’ fretfulness. They have been unwilling to forge more strongly into the market until they see firmer signs of macroeconomic improvement. Caution and risk aversion are the flavor du jour and bitcoin’s status as a hedge asset seems antiquated.  Ether’s different path  By contrast, ether has generally performed well in January. Daily returns for the asset have averaged 0.49%, dating to 2017.  This difference between ether and bitcoin is counterintuitive, given their normal tightly correlated pricing relationship.  Moving from monthly to quarterly data offers a more mixed picture. Since 2014, January’s drag on BTC prices has led to a negative performance during the year’s first three months. However, from 2019 BTC’s performance has been positive in three of the four first quarters during this timeframe. Ether has generated positive average daily returns for every first quarter.  Regardless, a weak December ahead of a traditionally weak January doesn’t offer great hopes for bullish bitcoin or ether investors.

The price of the asset has been consolidating over the past few weeks. SOL has been struggling to get past its immediate resistance mark, which is further fueling the coin’s downslide. In the last week, the altcoin depreciated by over 4%. The bulls tired out the moment Solana attempted to breach the $14 price mark. The technical outlook suggests that sellers have taken over the price action in the market. After a brief bullish run up to the $13.98 mark, this could be the coin correcting again. The coin, however, lacked any bullish reversal signs on its daily chart. The only way for SOL to register some gains would be if the altcoin overturned the $15 price ceiling as a support level. Solana has also been trading in a descending trendline, overruling the chance of a price reversal at the moment. A breakout from the descending trendline looks difficult, as buying interest was bleak on the chart. Bears can only be invalidated if SOL moves above the $29 resistance line. The market capitalization of the asset had also declined at press time, indicating bearishness for the altcoin. Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Down 19% In Last 7 Days – No Fireworks Ahead Of Christmas? Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was trading at $13.19 at the time of writing. Ever since SOL lost the $15 price floor, it has been a free-fall for the asset. Immediate resistance for SOL stood at $14 and then at $15. Breaching the $15 mark looks unlikely as long as the coin remains consolidated. However, continued lateral price movement can push the Solana price to a fresh low on the chart. If the coin loses its $13 support, it will fall straight to $10. The inability to remain above the $10 price level can also drag the altcoin to $4, which means a 70% downfall for the altcoin. The amount of Solana traded in the last session was low, indicating bearish movement. Technical Analysis The altcoin recently visited the oversold zone in the last month. The recovery from that point has not been substantial, as for the most part of December, the altcoin was under the grasp of the sellers. The Relative Strength Index dipped below 40, confirming selling strength on the chart. Similarly, the Solana price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating low demand for the altcoin. It also meant that the sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Other technical indicators pointed at a buy signal for the coin, albeit one that is declining. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence demonstrates price trends and momentum. MACD depicted declining green signal bars, which were tied to the buy signal. Buyers would not act on it given how the signals were declining in size. Bollinger bands that display volatility remained constricted, denoting a tight trading range for the coin and the possibility of a price breakout. With indicators siding with the bears, the breakout could likely be on the downside.

John Ray III, who assumed leadership of the company last month hours before it filed for bankruptcy protection, will tell the House Financial Services Committee that his new team has so far secured over $1 billion in digital assets, though that's only a small portion of the billions the company owes customers and other creditors.  In his remarks, Ray again denounced FTX's former leadership as being inexperienced, repeating comments from FTX's bankruptcy filings that he had never seen anything quite like the company's recordkeeping and asset management failings.  ""A substantial portion"" of FTX's assets remain ""missing, misappropriated or not readily available,"" the prepared testimony said, which also implied FTX's former leadership was not being helpful to the new leadership.  ""In the absence of cooperation from responsible parties or any appropriate system to track and protect crypto assets, we are continuing our painstaking forensic efforts to account for all of the assets, both as to the FTX US and FTX.com exchanges, as well as Alameda,"" he said.  For the first time, Ray provided some explanation as to why FTX US filed for bankruptcy alongside the rest of the company. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who is also set to testify Tuesday, has previously said that FTX US was solvent and should be able to process customer withdrawals.  ""Questions have been raised as to why all of the FTX Group companies were included in the Chapter 11 filing, particularly FTX US. The answer is because FTX US was not operated independently of FTX.com,"" Ray said. ""Chapter 11 protection was necessary both to avoid a 'run on the bank' at FTX US and to allow our team the time to identify and protect its assets.""  In the document, Ray said FTX's lack of security controls, allowing Alameda to borrow FTX's funds ""without any effective limits,"" commingling of assets and the lack of documentation, ""reliable financial statements"" and independent governance are just some of the issues he identified.  He also confirmed that FTX spent around $5 billion on various investments and acquisitions, with another $1 billion going to insiders as loans and other payments. The acquisitions and investments in particular may no longer carry the same value they originally held.  ""Although our investigation is ongoing and detailed findings will have to await its conclusion, the FTX Group’s collapse appears to stem from the absolute concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company that is entrusted with other people’s money or assets,"" he said.

42420798,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYHAz,1670876578,Chainlink Whale ‘Oldwhite’ Used More Than 150 Wallets to Avoid Staking Limits,"Chainlink’s new “staking” program – where participants can earn crypto rewards for helping to secure the network – was intended to be broad-based: The price-feed provider imposed a limit of 7,000 LINK tokens per wallet to “promote greater inclusion and reduce the risk of a few participants dominating the pool in the early stages,” according to the project team.  But blockchain data reveals how one large holder – a “whale” in crypto parlance – was able to get around the limits by creating more than 150 addresses – and then staking the full 7,000 LINK allotment from each of them.  The elaborate effort allowed the whale, nicknamed “Oldwhite” by the OpenSea platform, to stake some 1.06 million LINK ($7 million worth).  Chainlink officials have claimed success in drawing broad participation in the new program, arguing that more than 3,300 “unique Community stakers staked a median amount of about 2,100 LINK.” Overall, about 7,800 addresses staked some amount of LINK tokens.  But the individual whale’s ability to shepherd resources and blockchain savvy to garner nearly 5% of the staking program’s overall community allotment of 22.5 million LINK tokens shows just how difficult or impossible it can be to police participants intent on gaming the system.  “There is no perfect solution to 100% prevent whales from staking without trade-offs,” Chainlink Community Ambassador ChainLinkGod.eth acknowledged in a Dec. 8 tweet.  How Oldwhite pulled it off  On the Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan, the whale is labeled as 0xC54.  In the days before Chainlink opened an early-access period for qualified participants, the whale started getting their LINK tokens into position.  From Dec. 3 through Dec. 7, the 1.06 million LINK tokens were withdrawn from decentralized lender Aave in three transactions (Tx1, Tx2 and Tx3) and transferred to the Oldwhite wallet.  Then, Oldwhite sent 7,000 LINK each to more than 150 unique wallet addresses.  Once Chainlink opened up its general-access period for staking, on Dec. 8, each of the 150-plus wallet addresses staked their full allotments of 7,000 LINK tokens.  The rapid subscription binge helped to max out the Chainlink staking program’s overall community capacity of 22.5 million LINK in just three hours.  One possible hint at the whale’s motive for transferring the tokens off of Aave and into the Chainlink staking program: extra interest payments. Aave’s Ethereum Market is currently paying an annual yield of 0.27% on supplied LINK tokens, whereas Chainlink’s LINK staking pays out rewards at a rate of 4.75%.  Requests for comment sent by CoinDesk to the 0xC54 wallet via a Blockscan chat weren’t returned before press time.  Based on the reaction from Chainlink officials, there may not be much they can do about Oldwhite’s activities at this point.  Chris Barrett, Chainlink’s head of public relations, told CoinDesk that the program’s design “provided ample additional opportunity for a diverse group of Community Stakers to participate.”  Including one very wave-making whale.

42407215,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJkd2,1670875436,Birth of the Network Nations,"December 2021. Eche Emole couldn’t sleep. He was staying at a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya, and his mind was on fire. He thought about all of Africa’s problems – the poverty, the inequity, the troubled history. He paced back and forth in the hotel room.  He thought about how, for centuries, the countries of Africa were created by outside forces – often through violence. European powers carved up the continent. Africans rarely had a voice. He thought about how, as he would later put it, “African American brothers and sisters feel like second-class citizens in the U.S.”  This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 package.  But he knew that across the globe Africans had economic muscle. He knew that in 2019, in what’s called the “Year of Return” – which marked 400 years since the first slaves arrived in Jamestown, Virginia – more than one million people from the African diaspora visited Ghana, and drove $2 billion in economic activity.  Emole kept pacing in that hotel room, his partner still asleep. He thought about how, since he was a law student at U.C. Hastings in 2016, he had been organizing events, concerts, and parties that celebrated African culture, launching the group “Afropolitan,” which now has 200,000 informal members. He knew the group had clout. He knew the group had money. They might be scattered across the globe but they had shared values, shared roots and the potential for collective action.  And in that late-night bout of insomnia, Emole even thought about Alexander Hamilton, the Federalist Papers and the birth of the United States. In Federalist Paper #1, Hamilton wrote, “The important question [is] whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force.”  Two words stood out to him: Reflection and choice. Africa has not enjoyed this privilege. “No modern-day African state has been formed by reflection or choice,” Emole says now. “It was always action and force.”  Read more: Marc Hochstein - Pinning the Idea of ‘Network States’ on the Map  It was then that he had the wild idea. What if Africans across the globe could somehow, through collective action, create some kind of network that truly leveraged their power? What if they could act – with their own agency – out of reflection and choice?  The idea hit him with full force. Now it was 5 a.m. His partner woke up and asked him what’s wrong.  “I think I finally see what Balaji was saying,” he told her.  She asked him what he meant.  “I think we need to start a new country.”  The ‘Network State’ thesis  Earlier in 2021, Emole had read an online manifesto from Balaji Srinivasan, “How to Start a New Country,” which was later expanded into the book “The Network State: How to Start a New Country” – a heady mix of philosophy, Web3, history, politics and Galaxy Brain ideas. Srinivasan defines the network state as a “highly aligned online community with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states.”  Stripped down to the basics, the idea is you start with an online community – one that’s economically prosperous, engaged and has shared values – and then manifest it into the physical world. Srinivasan considers the current nations of the world to be “geographically centralized” but “ideologically disaligned,” and given the entrenched polarizations of the United States, for example, this is a tough point to argue. The network state is the inverse: “ideologically aligned but geographically decentralized.”  Crypto is essential to this. A network state, Srinivasan explains, can use Web3 for governance – such as conducting their census on-chain, and using cryptocurrency wallets to prove their economic viability. And where would the network state actually exist? Srinivasan acknowledges that, realistically, a network state is unlikely to obtain a swath of real-estate that’s large enough for a homeland. But it can begin with distributed clusters of actual in-real-life properties. “It can connect a thousand apartments, a hundred houses and a dozen cul-de-sacs in different cities into a new kind of fractal polity with its capital in the cloud,” Srinivasan writes.  All of this, of course, can sound a bit half-baked. How can a bunch of internet geeks actually make a country? Although it might require fewer geeks than you’d think. “A new state with a population of 1 million to 10 million would actually be comparable to most existing states,” Srinivasan explains. The data bears this out. Of the 193 United Nations-recognized sovereign states, writes Srinivasan, “20% have a population of less than 1 million and 55% have a population of less than 10 million.” The list of these smaller nations includes countries we think of as legitimate and even thriving – Ireland, New Zealand and Singapore.  Srinivasan points out that Facebook has 3 billion users, Twitter has 300 million users and plenty of individual influencers have more than 1 million followers. So “it starts to be not too crazy to imagine we can build a 1 million to 10 million startup society with a genuine sense of national consciousness, an integrated cryptocurrency, and a plan to crowdfund many pieces of territory around the world.”  Perhaps this isn’t “too crazy,” but what will strike some as even crazier is that the network state is no longer just an abstract idea – the network states are already here. Or at least they’re getting started.  Network states in action  On an online dashboard, Srinivasan keeps track of start-up societies that have already begun the journey. As of now there are 26. These include Emole’s Afropolitan; Satoshi Island, which is “Building a crypto community in Vanuatu”; Culdesac, which is “building a car-free neighborhood” in Tempe, Arizona; Kift, which is “building a van-life community”; Cabin, which is “building a decentralized city for creators”; Figment, which is “building a club in the metaverse;” and W3ST, “building a solarpunk society.”  It’s tough to tell what’s legitimate and what’s vaporware. (A common problem in crypto.) And these 26 projects, of course, are not the world’s first “startup societies,” and the lure of a new utopia did not begin with Web3. In 1804, a religious zealot named George Rapp convinced 600 believers to start a new, independent, God-fearing society in Pennsylvania. In the 1830s, the religious “Shakers” – which practiced both celibacy and ecstatic (shaking) dancing – formed 18 bubble communities scattered throughout the United States. Then 30,000 Mormons, in the 1840s, formed their own utopia in Nauvoo, Illinois.  More recently, tech and crypto entrepreneurs – often white, wealthy and male – have tried to create their own libertarian mini-societies. Crypto bros claimed crypto turf in Puerto Rico. On a chunk of disputed land between the borders of Croatia and Serbia, crypto enthusiasts have worked to create a sovereign (and blockchain-fueled) nation called “Liberland,” with a motto of “To Live and Let Live.” (I visited and reported on Liberland way back in 2018.) Peter Thiel is trying to create floating cities in the ocean.  There are skeptics. “I get it, people feel lost and disoriented so they want to create the feeling of clubs to belong to,” says Douglas Rushkoff, author of “Survival of the Richest: Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires,” via email. “It all looks very ‘next generation,’ but it's actually a conservative movement for people who need a sense of boundary, who need something symbolic to feel like they have agency.”  Referring specifically to this new batch of network states, Rushkoff says they’re “pre-colonizing a virtual space – but it's not a society. It's closer to a website. It has no topsoil … It's about pretending you can escape. The utopia is more like [novel] ‘Ready Player One,’ with people in the real world living in stacked trailers.” Ultimately, these remind Rushkoff of when “the Little Rascals would build a little clubhouse and put up a sign saying ‘No Girlz Allowed.’”  The founders of these network states, of course, would bristle at the idea that there’s “no topsoil” or that the communities are just a glorified website. Most are trying to build something on actual strips of dirt.  Colin O'Donnell, for example, launched the KiftDAO as an experimental mix of digital nomadism, van life, co-living, Web3 and decentralized cities. This began when COVID-19 normalized remote work.“We saw this opportunity for letting people live better lives, frankly,” says O'Donnell. The people in the KiftDAO are not just on a website; they’re living together, cooking together, hiking together.  It all looks very ‘next generation,’ but it's actually a conservative movement for people who need a sense of boundary.  Roughly two hours north of San Francisco, Kift members co-live in a sprawling house called the “Octolodge.” They each pay less than $500 a month for lodging, food, internet, utilities. There are also Kift locations in Joshua Tree, California, and Discovery Bay in Washington state, and the plan is to keep expanding as the community grows.  The real lure of the KiftDAO? “We have this connection that cities once provided and don’t anymore,” says O’Donnell. Unlike a typical co-living space, he explains, Kift could wed the connective tissue of the internet with the warmth of in-person companionship – and do it in a way that modern cities can’t. “Cities have not done a good job with human connection,” says O'Donnell. “If you ask a kid to draw a picture of a city, they draw a skyline. And those are office buildings. That isn’t a community. They’re not drawing a park bench. They’re not drawing a piazza where people come together.”  Some are launching startup societies to find community, some are trying to create a better and Web3-ier version of cities. Take Scott Fitsimones, who started a parking garage company while in college. This gave him a crash course on how cities actually worked – zoning, land use and the minutiae of bureaucracy. He felt like the process could be improved. Then Wyoming passed legislation that allowed DAOs to be classified as LLCs, and this gave Fitsimones an idea. “Okay, a DAO can govern an LLC, and an LLC can buy and lease property,” says Fitsimones. “So there’s probably a lot of cool stuff we can do here.”  The cool stuff would eventually become CityDAO, which now has 7,000 members and raised $5 million in its treasury. CityDAO purchased 40 acres of land in Wyoming, which is collectively owned and managed by the DAO. Anyone can camp on it and visit it, and the plan is to eventually build out infrastructure and a Web3 city.  A Web3-imbued city, says Fitsimones, will be more transparent and efficient than normal cities. Like many champions of the network state, he’s drawn to the idea of experimenting with new modes of government. That’s something we rarely get to do. “Right now we have around 190 countries,” says Fitsimones. He thinks of these as “little miniature monopolies” that define the rules of life. Some of them are dictatorships, some are democracies and many of them look quite similar. “Really, 190 isn’t that many options,” says Fitsimones. “Imagine if it was easier to create these little governments and self-organizing systems?”  Much of this philosophy is shared by Jon Hillis, a former product designer at Instacart who, in 2021, wanted to build a cabin in the woods and do some science fiction writing. So he built a makeshift home out of a shipping container. Hillis invited a group of friends (part of his “creator co-op”) to the cabin just outside of Austin, Texas, and this evolved into a creative residency program which eventually spawned CabinDAO – “an experiment in decentralized cities.”  CabinDAO is up and running. If you’re a member of the DAO, you can drop into a cabin and work and live there for as long as you want (with payment varying accordingly). The original cabin is in “Neighborhood Zero” by Austin, and the DAO’s plans for expansion include Puerto Rico and Portugal and Bangalore. Like O'Donnell and Fitsimones, Hillis feels that traditional governments are, to borrow a tech cliche, ripe for disruption. “The last century was all about car-based cities. We believe that the next century is about internet-based cities,” says Hillis. “The internet’s not in one place, and so we’re not all in one place. That’s sort of the high-level vision.”  Okay, but is Web3 really necessary for all this? In his blueprint for how to start a country, Srinivasan explicitly mentions blockchain features including an on-chain census, DAOs and cryptocurrency wallets.  Not all are going that route. One of the projects on Srinivasan’s dashboard is Porta Norte, described as “Building a European town integrated with nature.” The initiative is starting in Panama. “There are very few public spaces in the majority of Panama City,” says Henry Faarup, the founder of Porta Norte. So Faarup’s team is trying to create a new city-within-a-city – one with more trees, more sidewalks, more nature.  Faarup plans to invest in fiber-optic cables that will provide “the best internet in Panama.” He wants to do a normal city, but better. “We’re basically taking the role of the government and municipality, and providing first-class infrastructure and security,” Faarup says.  This sounds an awful lot like the other network states, but he’s doing it without crypto. Porta Norte is not a DAO, it’s a company. Faarup raised capital through a joint venture with 50 shareholders. Faarup says he’s open to experimenting with DAOs and blockchain in the future, but “we haven’t gone that route, as of yet.”  Perhaps Faarup can get away with this because the project (at least as of now) is completely centralized, focused on a hyper-local section of Panama City. For that you don’t really need a DAO. The real superpower of the network state, in contrast, is harnessing all of the talents, resources and creativity of those who are scattered across the planet – and then manifesting that vision into the physical world.  This is now Eche Emole’s goal. This is the goal of Afropolitan. In some ways it has been Emole’s goal for years, well before he ever heard of Balaji Srinivasan.  Afropolitan  Emole grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area just before high school. He was the only Black kid in his class. He moved from a country where “race was nothing” (because all his peers were Black) to a world where “it’s staring me in the face.” His new classmates assumed that, as he puts it now, “I knew everything that has to do with blackness.” He knew Nigerian culture but not African American culture. Kids would ask him about Jay-Z and other rappers and, he now says with a laugh, “I didn’t know who these people are.”  This nudged Emole to do research. He watched videos, listened to music, read books and learned everything he could about African American history. These interests snowballed. In college and later at U.C. Hastings Law School, he organized African festivals, concerts, parties and events that would help bring Afrobeats (such as Burna Boy) to a mainstream American audience. These events would coalesce into Afropolitan, founded in 2016. Now the concept of Afropolitan, the sovereign country, has $2.1 million in early seed-funding, including an investment from Srinivasan himself.  His message is this: Why can’t Africans do something entirely new?  Emole thinks of building the nation in four phases. The first phase is cultivating the online community, which he has been doing for years. Using a 10,000 non-fungible token (NFT) drop, Emole and partners will then filter these NFT owners for people with “high alignment” and select the 500 “founding citizens.” (The NFT drop happened on Nov. 1; this is very much in motion.)  These citizens will then launch the DAO and the sub-DAOs. That’s Phase 2. “We want to build our own tech stack. What would it look like to have an Afropolitan super-stack where you’re able to do things like remittances powered by crypto?” Phase 2 also involves setting up the tokenomics, agreeing upon the rules and norms, and signing the Afropolitan Constitution.  Phase 3 is what Emole calls the “minimum viable state.” What needs to happen for them to obtain diplomatic recognition? There are already glimmers of progress. On Sept. 13, Afropolitan was recognized by the New York Stock Exchange as the first ever internet country. As Emole says, “So today it’s the New York Stock Exchange, tomorrow it’s the United Nations.”  And Phase 4, finally, is the manifestation of Afropolitan on actual land. A new country on real turf. “We want not just one particular land piece as a country,” says Emole, “but land that stretches across the world.”  How would that help the average Afropolitan citizen? For many crypto bros, perhaps a DAO is just a lark or a fun intellectual experiment. For Emole and his Afropolitan co-founder, Chika Uwazie, the network state is a way to reduce inequities and empower Africans.  As Uwazie points out, the investment rate for Black founders is lower than the industry average. “Tech companies have been trying to diversify, and they’ve barely made a dent in it,” says Uwazie. “The system is going to take a very long time to change.”  With an Afropolitan network state, members could have easier access to loans – through DeFi and the DAO – refinancing, or investment capital. Maybe they could make payments with Afropolitan tokens. “My number one goal is to empower my community economically,” says Uwazie. ""That’s how things changed. When you’re economically empowered, it changes people's lives. It changes generations.”  Emole knows that “utopia” projects court skeptics. “I’m aware of those projects,” says Emole. One thing he thinks separates Afropolitan from others is that “in the West, it feels like a nice-to-have. In Africa it’s a need to have.” Then he gets more candid. “We don’t have [stuff] that works,” he says, contrasting the infrastructure of Africa to that of, say, Switzerland. He says that if he’s a citizen of Switzerland and wanted to start a new country, the first reaction would be, “What’s wrong with this one? Why do you need to start a whole new country?” But when he brings this up to other Africans, the reaction is always, “It’s needed.”  And what will it take for Afropolitan to actually become a reality? Ultimately, says Emole, the biggest hurdle is not tech or capital or politics. The biggest challenge is getting people to believe. “People get scared when they hear this vision,” says Emole. He wants Africans to be more audacious. To believe. “I’m used to African founders coming to Silicon Valley and saying, ‘Hey, I’m building Stripe for Africa’ or “I’m building Uber for Africa””  His message is this: Why can’t Africans do something entirely new? Instead of bringing San Francisco ideas to Africa, why not be the first to truly execute this bold idea? “We’re used to playing it very, very safe,” says Emole. “We need to shoot for the stars.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/12/web3-network-state-balaji-srinivasan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4675c603d22cf0cc4119d6bcc8bcfbbc8b9d765e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407214,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJkWQ,1670875313,"Adoption of DeFi, ZK Tech, NFTs and More Will Continue to Increase in 2023","This year has certainly been a series of highs and lows for the crypto industry. After the 2021 bull run, we kicked off 2022 with a correction as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) dropped around 20% and 31%, respectively, in January alone. Macro factors, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, high inflation, layoffs and generally slowing economic growth have led to much uncertainty. Rough market conditions largely became the standard for much of the year, but that didn’t stop crypto from many incredible technological achievements.  Improvements in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector like the protocol Compound’s version (v)3 and the march of the zero-knowledge (ZK) ecosystem continued regardless. Institutional adoption of crypto has also occurred at a rapid pace, with Disney, Starbucks, Adidas and many other household brands quietly embracing blockchain. Large banks have also shown increasing interest in the sector: Fidelity launched a crypto service for investors, BlackRock partnered with Coinbase to bring its institutional clients crypto access and Goldman Sachs is creating a crypto data service.  One industry highlight this year was the Ethereum Merge in September, where the blockchain transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, reducing Ethereum’s energy usage by an incredible 99.9%. Secondly, many amazing engineers continued to build through this bear market, and some of the strongest projects came out of it. Another benefit for the industry, though rough in the moment, was the lessons learned from each of the disasters that 2022 brought. Many projects – and even entire categories in crypto – have shown their resiliency in light of these events. If crypto has proven anything through its existence, though, it has proven that it can survive unfavorable times. Because of this, the industry will enter 2023 with a level of strength and durability that 2022 has given it.  Paul Veradittakit is a general partner at investment firm Pantera Capital. This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.  Here are my top predictions for the crypto industry in 2023:  DeFi will continue to grow while CeFi consolidates: This past year exposed many of the problems of centralized finance (CeFi), while DeFi at large functioned flawlessly. In light of 2022’s many CeFi collapses, I expect the industry to consolidate into highly regulated players such as Coinbase and Bitstamp.  In the period following the FTX collapse, DeFi transactions have already spiked, with volumes up 68% (to $97 billion) from October to November. Events like these prove the case for DeFi: governing assets via secure smart contracts enables users to better understand liquidity flows and have more control over their investments.  Come 2023, I believe we’ll see more complex and interesting applications of DeFi increase. A few exciting examples are GMX, a decentralized perpetual exchange, and 1inch Pro, a regulatory-compliant platform that connects traditional finance (TradFi) to DeFi. Next year will also likely bring more traction for use cases like self-custody wallets, synthetic assets, and prediction markets.  Despite market conditions, the sector’s true strengths lie in its foundational infrastructure that powers transactions in a trustless and efficient way. These properties will greatly accelerate DeFi’s adoption and growth in 2023, especially in light of CeFi’s struggles this year.  We will see tremendous ZK adoption and use cases: As the question of privacy comes to the forefront of the crypto industry, zero-knowledge technology has been particularly notable this year. ZK technology essentially uses a prover, a verifier and mathematical algorithms to prove something without revealing underlying information about the proof. Because blockchains are inherently transparent, this application is huge for the industry and allows many more interactions to take place on-chain in a private way. ZK proofs are also extremely lightweight, making on-chain interactions much more scalable and efficient.  With projects such as Succinct Labs, Risczero and Espresso Systems emerging, we’ve seen use cases for ZK proofs, VMs and rollups explode. ZK technology has particularly beneficial applications for identity as a crypto vertical. With ZK proofs, users are able to prove their identity on-chain without having to reveal sensitive data. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also noted in a recent piece how huge ZK technology is for solving the on-chain information problem – but that the category is “something that will actually need to be worked on.”  ZK technology is also valuable for bridges, which are able to transmit messages and tokens while guaranteeing security and correctness via succinct proofs. There are also exciting applications for TradFi systems like credit scores and taxes.  Institutions will increasingly tokenize financial assets: Real-world assets (RWA) are financial primitives that represent a claim on an underlying asset and often produce yield for that asset. The emergence of the category has unlocked huge amounts of liquidity and utility so far, and 2023 will likely bring more assets represented on-chain in an accessible manner.  Stablecoins are arguably the most popular application of a RWA in today’s market, with the category constituting three of the top seven tokens by market capitalization. Circle’s USDC and Maker’s DAI have been top-tier stablecoins and have both seen almost no volatility throughout the bear market.  On-chain communities have demonstrated demand for RWAs: for example, MakerDAO decided in mid-2022 to invest $500 million worth of DAI into U.S. treasuries and corporate bonds. Goldfinch, a company that provides loans that are collateralized off-chain, currently has an active loan value of ~$100 million. Jia allows business owners to take out blockchain-based loans and generates substantial yields for liquidity providers backed by real-world businesses and assets. I expect 2023 to bring the growth of interesting applications of RWAs, such as flash loans and real estate. In-line with the real world asset trend, I also expect to see a surge of startups focused on bringing TradFi institutions into crypto in a regulatory-compliant way.  More companies will emerge to leverage blockchain data: Arguably, rich and open-source data is one of the blockchain’s best features, as it allows for deep analysis of on-chain activity. Leveraging this data in an efficient and responsible way is integral to the expansion of blockchain dapps and their use cases. Data reveals a massive amount about how blockchains are used, emerging trends, user behavior, and on-chain money flows.  Blockchain analytics platforms like Nansen will continue to be critical for understanding on-chain analytics through wallet activity. Companies such as nxyz are also tackling blockchain indexing by providing data APIs with no rate limits. Definitive emerged in 2022 to provide user acquisition tooling and insights for both on-chain and off-chain activity. Even with the growth of these companies, blockchain data is still largely untapped and I expect to see significant developments in the sector during 2023. To understand where crypto is going next, we need to get granular with our level of data analysis of the state of the industry as it is right now.  The developer tooling stack will continue to grow as blockchain engineers increasingly seek easy and efficient ways to deploy Web3 projects: Developer tooling eliminates many repetitive and tedious parts of the job and encourages more engineers to experiment with creating on-chain protocols. Companies including Alchemy and Tenderly have been particularly critical players in the sector this past year.  Despite the bear market, developers have experimented with on-chain applications more than ever. Alchemy recently stated that it saw the number of engineers using its platform soar three times since the start of the year. In September 2022, monthly verified smart contracts were up 2.6 times, year over year. Impressively, 2022 also saw 36% of total smart contracts ever deployed and verified.  As a greater number of Web3 developers get involved in the ecosystem, it is critical to provide them with sturdy tooling as they begin to build. Cross-chain tooling is particularly relevant, as it provides composable software that makes launching projects on multiple chains easy. By serving as the backbone for many crypto projects, developer tooling will continue to grow in 2023 as more crypto use cases arise and an increasing number of engineers seek to enter the industry.  Non-fungible tokens that provide some kind of value to their holder, such as gaming NFTs and identity NFTs, will expand: Utility NFTs, such as in-game NFTs, identity tokens, and token-gated communities, software, and events will expand in 2023. This year, we’ve seen the sector start to develop technologically and creatively, but the space is nowhere near mainstream adoption. While the digital (pure) art industry is undoubtedly a massive vertical, using NFTs to permit specific privileges has the potential to disrupt many incumbent sectors.  We’ve seen some exciting applications and developments of these ideas so far. Proof Collective allows its NFT holders to access future Proof drops (one of which was the popular Moonbirds NFT project) and access to Proof community initiatives, such as in-person events and a private Discord. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also released a formative paper on soulbound tokens (NFTs that hold on-chain identity information), which some projects have already adopted. Gaming transactions also skyrocketed in 2022, at one point composing over half of all blockchain activity. Further, NFTs are starting to be explored in the context of entertainment, specifically for fan engagement.  Traditional companies have been exploring adoption of NFTs at an increasingly rapid pace. A few highlights: Tiffany’s released a collection of pendants for CryptoPunk holders, Instagram announced that it will incorporate NFTs into its platform and Nike acquired metaverse fashion company RTFKT. Royal has redefined music revenue streams and ownership by allowing fans to invest directly into songs. In addition, sports players including Cristiano Ronaldo have dropped NFT collections to drive up fan engagement and potentially give access to other future perks.  In 2023, I’m excited to see industry disruption and ideas for utility NFTs fleshed out even further. Cryptonative applications, as well as traditional companies, will likely start to experiment more with using NFTs to bring something valuable to their owners.  How were my predictions for 2022?  At the end of 2021, I made predictions about the growth of six sectors listed below. Here’s how I score myself on accuracy, with 1 being the least accurate and 5 being the most accurate.  Layer 2s and Rollups, both ZK and optimistic, will continue to expand in the coming year  Accuracy: 4  Layer 2s have seen incredible growth this year. Though Ethereum underwent the Merge, its gas fees were essentially unchanged, meaning layer 2s are still critical for decreasing the financial barrier to entry to interact on-chain.  Layer 2s account for an impressive 30%-40% of Ethereum transactions, and around $250 million flows into layer 2s monthly. Arbitrum and Optimism have been particularly dominant players – both of the networks saw their TVL surpass Solana’s this year. Arbitrum also had an incredible 516% growth in active developer teams since January. Further, cumulative volume traded on all StarkEx platforms has skyrocketed to $775 billion since launch. However, the sector wasn’t completely immune from the effects of the bear: total value locked on layer 2s on Ethereum was down 30%+, from ~$7.3 billion in January to ~$5 billion in late October.  Non-Ethereum/Bitcoin chains will become larger players in DeFi, gaming, and more  Accuracy: 4  Ethereum’s share of TVL versus alternative layer 1 chains (altchains) has mostly stayed flat between ~50% and ~58% throughout 2022. 2021 saw explosive growth of alternative chains, with Ethereum’s share of TVL dropping ~20%. 2022 has been flatter, with Ethereum retaining around the same share for the year versus competing altchains. Part of this may be due to the Ethereum Merge, where the network switched from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and subsequently made the chain a more attractive option.  Though Ethereum maintained its TVL share, many layer 1s did emerge in 2022, promising higher transaction fees and lower gas fees. Two notable examples are Sui and Aptos, both founded by ex-Meta developers (specifically Diem). The projects collectively raised $450 million+ in funding in 2022 and have seen huge amounts of attention and ecosystem growth since launch.  I noted last year that Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) platforms have allowed Ethereum dapps to seamlessly launch on other EVM-compatible chains. This technology continues to show its strength, as it essentially eliminates the need to rebuild a dapp from the ground up to ensure that it is compatible with a given layer 1’s tech stack. In 2022, EVM has driven efficiency and interoperability on the development side as well as improved functionality and more seamless liquidity flows for users. Recent data also shows that EVM-compatible chains experienced more activity than non-EVM compatible chains.  Composability and Web3 will continue to gain traction as crypto’s use cases grow  Accuracy: 4  Last year, I speculated on the growth of the Web3 sector, which in general is a blanket term which refers to blockchain and crypto-enabled technologies. This prediction was largely accurate as we saw composability/interoperability popularize massively in 2022. Projects like Succinct have done a fantastic job reducing friction by allowing for seamless communication between protocols.  Web3 also made huge strides as companies including CreatorDAO, Arpeggi Labs, and Arkive redefined ownership, collaboration mechanisms, and monetization streams. Developers are continually experimenting with fresh use cases for crypto: Ethers.js was downloaded ~948,000 times so far in 2022, a 212% increase since 2021, and web3.js was downloaded ~587,000 times, a 137% increase since 2021. In addition, powerful new revenue streams for creators, financial mechanisms like co-ownership, and identity and social tools were brought to the market in 2022. Companies including Farcaster and Lens Protocol made Web3 social a less complex and more palatable sector by providing users better UI/UX and offering unique, crypto-enabled ways to interact.  Expansion of NFTs will be a dominant trend in 2022  Accuracy: 2  NFTs were definitely all the buzz in 2021, but the sector didn’t fare quite as well in 2022. From the fourth quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022, the total number of NFT sales was down ~46%, from ~14 million to 7 million. Another notable stat reveals that NFT trading volumes have decreased 97% from all-time highs. Additionally, in Sept. 2022, OpenSea saw trade volume decrease 99% since May highs. Many metaverse NFT companies have been struggling as well; for example, digital fashion giant RTFKT saw sales decrease from roughly 14,000 ETH in February to 154 ETH in November.  However, the year definitely did see expansion in utility, gaming, and music NFTs, as well as creative new applications for utility NFTs, such as soulbound tokens, token-gated communities and events, and co-ownership mechanisms. In addition, 2022 saw the launch of Sudoswap, a novel and permissionless NFT exchange for trading NFTs via an AMM design. The royalty-free platform saw more than 7,000 transactions in one day at its peak in August, representing over $3 million. Uniswap also recently introduced NFTs on their platform with an aggregator that supports OpenSea, Sudoswap, and X2Y2, among others. Overall, the year brought many creative new takes on how NFTs can be used, despite the category’s sluggish transaction volume.  The DAO space will continue to see growth in complexity and use cases  Accuracy: 4  Both the number of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) – and the number of companies tackling DAO tooling – have grown significantly in 2022. The total number of DAOs skyrocketed from 700 in May of 2021 to more than 6,000 in June of this year, and companies such as Utopia Labs, Coordinape, and Layer3, among others, have made it easy to deploy and manage a DAO.  The total market cap of all DAO tokens was roughly $21 billion in Jan. 2022, with the top five DAO tokens constituting $13.2 billion of that number – revealing that value is largely concentrated in only a few quality DAOs. Uniswap, the leading DAO in terms of treasury size, saw its treasury decrease from $2.9 billion at the end of 2021 to $2.3 billion in late Nov. 2022. Most DAO treasuries have followed suit during the bear market, but the sector has shown resilience. Analytics reveal that more than 2,850 DAOs began governance activities from May to Oct. 2022, and in general, more DAOs were created this year than last (on a month-by-month basis). Because incentive structures, use cases, and governance look different for every DAO, the sector is still evolving rapidly and we’re continually seeing fresh takes on what it means to operate as a DAO.  Security will be integral for strengthening the DeFi ecosystem  Accuracy: 3  The Ronin bridge hack in March 2022, where attackers stole $625 million, constituted a higher amount than the roughly $610 million stolen in malicious DeFi exploits in all of 2021. In total, 2022 saw more than $3 billion worth of digital assets stolen, as of Nov. 1. The sheer number of DeFi security companies has certainly increased in 2022, and their tech stacks have improved; however, explosive DeFi growth led to more targeted hacks than ever as the industry expanded.  We’ve undoubtedly seen more innovation in the sector as companies such as Quantstamp, CertiK, and OtterSec continually secure the industry via mechanisms such as formal verification, smart contract auditing tooling, and white-hat hacking.  However, the spotlight remains on crypto security. In the midst of continued exploits, the FBI cautioned investors of potential platform hacks and asked DeFi platforms to improve security measures. Crypto cannot go totally mainstream unless it becomes secure; 2022 was largely disappointing in terms of hacks, but we did see more companies emerging and strengthening to tackle the issue.  My final takeaway from 2022  Despite some painful hacks and CeFi crashes, the crypto industry as a whole made huge technological strides in 2022. Even through the harsh crypto winter, Web3 has reached an incredible amount of individuals – and the technology is clearly here to stay. Our job as an industry is to make that technology accessible, reliable and safe for users around the world in order to usher in an era of financial transparency, dependability, and autonomy. Web3 continues to redefine how we think about money, ownership (of both physical and digital assets), identity, and community. I’m very excited to see what 2023 brings as we continue to accelerate the adoption of an economic layer to the internet.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Paul Veradittakit,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/12/pantera-paul-veradittakit-crypto-2023-predictions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fded34709416f27a4cfbefb59aa7d7775cd4cc5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411287,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMidJ,1670874207,10 Questions for FTX CEO John J. Ray III From a Securities Lawyer,"The House Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing on the FTX collapse on Tuesday, Dec. 13. It should be a fascinating show. Not only will Sam Bankman-Fried attend (by video) but so will the new CEO at FTX, John J. Ray III.  If the questioning of Ray is handled properly, Bankman-Fried could be put in an extremely difficult position. If I [a securities litigator with decades of trial experience] were on the committee, here are the 10 questions I would ask Ray, a storied lawyer who helped liquidate Enron.  The ‘Original Sin’  There have been numerous reports that Bankman-Fried transferred billions of dollars of assets from FTX customers’ accounts to Alameda. He has repeatedly said that “he never intended to commingle client assets.”  Can you resolve this issue once and for all – have you seen sufficient evidence to conclude that Bankman-Fried did, in fact, misappropriate FTX customer assets for the benefit of Alameda?  The coverup  You filed a declaration in the bankruptcy case that said someone at FTX “used software to conceal the misuse of customer funds.”  Was that someone Bankman-Fried?  Something fishy in the Bahamas  FTX filed papers in the bankruptcy court that stated: “The Bahamian government is responsible for directing unauthorized access to the Debtors’ systems for the purpose of obtaining digital assets of the Debtors – that took place after the commencement” of the U.S. bankruptcy cases.  This is obviously a very serious charge. Tell us, what evidence do you have that Bahamian authorities essentially misappropriated assets belonging to the FTX debtors after the bankruptcy case was filed?  Disappearing crypto  In your bankruptcy court declaration, you stated that $372 million of unauthorized transfers of the debtors’ cryptocurrency took place on or about Nov. 11, the day the bankruptcy was filed.  Have you figured out who was behind the unauthorized transfer of all that cryptocurrency? Any suspects?  See also: FTX Hack or Inside Job? Blockchain Experts Examine Clues  The Alameda piggy bank  In the bankruptcy filings you show a balance sheet for Alameda. That balance sheet shows loans from Alameda to insiders at FTX in the following amounts:  Sam Bankman-Fried, personal loan: $1 billion  Paper Bird, a company controlled by Bankman-Fried, loan: $2.3 billion  Nishad Singh, FTX director of engineering, personal loan: $543 million  Ryan Salame, FTX executive, personal loan: $55 million  So, that’s right around $4 billion drained from Alameda by Bankman-Fried and his colleagues. Where did all that liquidity come from for Alameda to have $4 billion in cash to lend to Bankman-Fried and the others?  Was that $4 billion taken out of Alameda during the same period when Bankman-Fried was illegally transferring FTX customer funds to Alameda? And have any of these “loans” been repaid?  So then would it be fair to say that Bankman-Fried and the others taking $4 billion out of Alameda contributed to Alameda’s insolvency and the necessity of filing bankruptcy?  Campaign contributions and clawbacks  Bankman-Fried told New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin in a recent interview that the money he contributed to candidates for public office came from “trading profits of Alameda.”  Are you able to confirm Bankman-Fried’s story – that trading profits generated by Alameda were distributed to Bankman-Fried and that he, in turn, donated that money to political candidates?  Do you intend to pursue clawbacks of Bankman-Fried’s political contributions?  Perfect timing  A blockchain research group called Arkham Intelligence published a report listing the largest  withdrawals from FTX in the days leading up to the FTX bankruptcy. That report shows a trading firm called Jane Street managed to withdraw $24 million from FTX on the eve of the bankruptcy.  As you know, Bankman-Fried and [former Alameda Research CEO] Caroline Ellison both got their start at Jane Street. That is quite a coincidence. Have you seen evidence of Bankman-Fried or other FTX insiders tipping off favored customers to get their money out of FTX before it was too late?  FTX.US – not dead yet?  Bankman-Fried has repeatedly declared in interviews that FTX.US is not insolvent, that all customer assets are in safe-keeping and, as far as he is concerned, customers of FTX.US should be permitted to withdraw their funds immediately.  My question is whether FTX.US is solvent and if customer assets are secure right now?  The secret customer list  You have filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking to keep the creditors list secret. This is highly unusual. According to the U.S. Supreme Court, the public has a First Amendment right to know what is going on in our court system, and secrecy of this kind can lead to cynicism about what might be happening behind closed doors.  Your declaration in the bankruptcy court states that FTX had the worst corporate governance you had ever seen and that it lacked meaningful regulatory compliance systems, record-keeping and financial reporting systems. It sounds like FTX was the absolutely ideal platform for bad actors to hide proceeds of illegal activities or engage in money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes.  See also: What a Securities Lawyer Would Ask FTX's Bankman-Fried  So, here is my question: Has your team discovered any FTX customer accounts that were used by drug cartels, terrorist organizations, illegal arms dealers, Russian government officials or oligarchs, Chinese Communist Party officials, government officials of other repressive regimes, entities subject to sanctions, or Biden or Trump family members or any of their related companies?

After a deal for $27 million fell through in October, the firm warned it might soon have negative cash flow.  Argo has built a mega bitcoin mining facility in West Texas, dubbed Helios. The facility started operations in May with a plan to reach 800 megawatts (MW) of energy consumption and 20 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power. This would have made Argo one of the world's biggest miners.  However, problems quickly emerged, and the firm found costs from the facility outpacing revenue, such that margins narrowed in the following few months. That has been a common issue in the industry as the price of energy has soared and the price of bitcoin has slumped. Argo felt the effect of soaring energy prices particularly hard as it didn't have a fixed-rate power agreement for the Helios facility.  Argo also has two smaller facilities in Canada's Quebec province.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,"Eliza Gkritsi, Nelson Wang",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/12/bitcoin-miner-argo-blockchain-says-its-close-to-restructuring-without-having-to-declare-bankruptcy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c0ce54eb88a6c8241481752b6264687adc96676-3000x2250.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The parliament's president, Roberta Metsola, confirmed that a meeting will be convened Tuesday to begin the process. Kaili, a member of the parliament from Greece, was suspended from her Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats party on Friday following the allegations.  “I have stripped the Vice-President mentioned of any tasks and responsibilities related to their role as Vice-President,” Metsola told lawmakers Monday, without mentioning Kaili by name. A meeting of political group leaders will be convened early Tuesday morning “to bring their term as vice-president to an end in an effort to protect the integrity of this house.”  Parliamentary rules allow a term of office to be terminated early for “serious misconduct,” if approved by a supermajority of two-thirds of lawmakers. A vote is due to take place on Tuesday afternoon, European time.  “The European Parliament is under attack” by “enemies of democracy,” Metsola said of allegations that Qatar sought to buy influence, which culminated in a series of raids by Belgian police on Friday. A proposal for Qataris and Kuwaitis to gain visa-free access to the bloc was subsequently booted back to committee.  Metsola stressed that the presumption of innocence applies during the investigation. She confirmed that Kaili was no longer sitting with the Socialists and Democrats political party.  Kaili has long been a champion for crypto and blockchain technology, and was due to pen the Parliament’s views on non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the coming weeks. In March she pleaded for softer anti-money laundering rules to apply to transfers of crypto assets from self-hosted wallets, saying in a tweet that her approach would enable the bloc “to fight crime and corruption while remaining tech neutral and innovation friendly.”  Kaili's office did not respond to a request for comment.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/12/pro-crypto-eu-lawmaker-eva-kaili-set-to-lose-vice-presidency-amid-corruption-probe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4cb08b154cbc6989753c41c85028c28fb2a0bca-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393929,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brcRel,1670865243,The NFT Launch Guide: 6 Steps to Building a Successful Project,"For every successful non-fungible token (NFT) project there are hundreds more that have failed to impress. While some may argue that it all comes down to luck, most successful NFT projects share key similarities when it comes to strategy. Here are tips for successfully launching and running an NFT project.  What makes an NFT project successful?  The measure of a successful NFT project revolves around its ability to maintain a high level of buzz even after launch. This is only possible when an NFT collection or project offers additional utility or valuable features, constantly evolving to keep up its appeal so as not to fizzle out into oblivion. Examples of the popular features among successful NFT projects are:  Membership passes to exclusive events and content  Early access to upcoming NFT launches  The ability to use the NFT in existing or new games  So when creating an NFT project, your goals should go beyond attracting buyers at the minting stage.  ""The real work starts after you sell one or all of your NFTs,” Kristopher Webster, founder of the Avatar Convention Center, told CoinDesk.  6 steps for creating a successful NFT project  1. Build a desirable product  The first thing you should do is research your target audience and determine what type of theme will appeal to them. For instance, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) depicts a future where crypto millionaires are bored out of their minds. So, they laze around and hang out in an ape-themed club. This theme quickly resonated with crypto holders and helped BAYC attract a large following.  You should find one or more utilities that will tie into your chosen theme. For example, you can offer users special privileges, including the option of owning intellectual property rights over their NFTs.  Alternatively, you can enable functionalities that allow users to import their NFTs into play-to-earn games. With this feature holders can use their NFTs as in-game assets and generate additional revenue.  As Web3 expands, so too do the potential use cases of NFTs. Therefore, when choosing utilities, be open-minded to the new concepts and trends constantly emerging in the Web3 space.  You can also attract the attention of your target audience by partnering with an artist who appeals to them. This is similar to how Reddit partnered with artists within the Reddit community. As a result, users feel like they are supporting one of their own when they buy Reddit Avatars. This same strategy can help you boost the support for your project.  2. Build a community  Note that you are competing with thousands of other NFT projects for market visibility. Therefore, it’s crucial to build a network of individuals who share and believe in your vision and can help take on the project as their own. This is how projects birth communities.  As Crass Kitty, head of product at Degenerate Ape Academy, told CoinDesk: ""Art matters, utility matters, but the most important thing is finding your product market fit – who is going to buy/mint your NFT?""  3. Consider working with Web3-native agencies  In most cases, Twitter and Discord are the most popular social networking platforms among NFT enthusiasts. Hence, when choosing a marketing strategy you need to find individuals and agencies that know how to build followings on these platforms.  The most effective way to build and manage an online community is to hire a marketing consultant or marketing agency that has experience with Web3 because they know the most effective ways to reach Web3 audiences. They also know the importance of adopting innovative and compelling promotional campaigns, especially when competing with projects that already have a head start or a strong following.  Alternatively, you can hire an in-house team consisting of PR experts with experience in community building and management. A team that constantly engages with community members will quickly understand the different dynamics of the community and how to ensure that every member is actively participating.  It’s worth noting that you may have to pay above the market rate to get talented community managers who will agree to focus solely on your project.  4. Create a potent roadmap  To maintain a high level of buzz after a project or collection launches, you have to offer more to users than just the NFTs themselves. For instance, BAYC's creators released Serum, an NFT that lets BAYC holders generate mutated versions or variants of the original Bored Ape NFTS. This was followed by the launch of a utility token, ApeCoin, that gives holders the right to participate in project governance.  It’s helpful to create a road map that outlines the types of applications that will become available to NFT holders in the future.  ""By thinking long term, you can create an NFT that evolves over time, provides more utility and has enduring, and even increasing, utility value,"" Wyeth Ridgway, co-founder and chief technology officer of Random Games, told CoinDesk.  5. Set a fair mint price and royalty  The initial price of your NFTs could make or break your project. It is important not to price out the core members of your community and leave the future of your project in the hands of profit-chasing holders who do not share in your vision. If long-term success is the goal, ensure that your NFTs are reasonably priced.  One of the perks of launching an NFT collection is that it allows you to earn a share of the revenue generated whenever the NFTs are resold on the secondary market. Depending on the longevity of your NFT project, you can generate more earnings from royalties than launch. However, it’s important to ensure the royalty amount is reasonable so that NFT holders can still generate enough profit when they sell their NFTs.  6. Build a foolproof ecosystem  When it comes to blockchain technology it is imperative to build a foolproof ecosystem that is unsusceptible to the security risks associated with NFTs, including theft. So, how do you create a viable ecosystem? You can start by following these steps:  Launch your NFT ecosystem on reputable and viable blockchains: The sustainability of the base network where your NFTs exist indirectly determines the viability of your project. As such, it is advisable to consider speed, security and decentralization when choosing a blockchain network.  Audit your software: It is imperative to hire a reputable software auditing firm to confirm that your codes do not have loopholes.  Launch NFTs on reputable NFT marketplaces: NFT marketplaces provide the tools required to create, sell and buy NFTs. Depending on your preferred blockchain network, you may have the option of choosing among two or more NFT marketplaces for the launch of your project. If this is the case, consider an array of factors, including user experience, security and trading volume when choosing an NFT marketplace.

His remarks come as over a million FTX users were estimated to have been unable to access their funds. The crypto trading platform, which was at one point the world's second largest, filed for bankruptcy along with its more than 130 affiliates on November 11 after the discovery of its unstable financial health resulted in a colossal amount of outflows. ""I'm going to be thinking about how we can help the world and if users haven't gotten much back, I'm going to be thinking about what I can do for them. And I think at the very least I have a duty to FTX users to do right by them as best as I can,"" Bankman-Fried said, as quoted by BBC. The interview occurred a day after SBF came out in support of a proposal to revive the exchange by issuing a new version of FTX's native crypto, FTT ( FTT-USD ). ""I continue to think that this would be a productive path for parties to explore! I *hope* that the teams in place will do so,"" SBF took to Twitter in response to the revival plan proposed by Crypto Banter founder Ran Neuner. That sent the price of FTT surging some 50% shortly thereafter, though it's still trailing well below levels since the FTX mess started last month. The 30-year-old, who was described to have run FTX as his own ""personal fiefdom,"" said last week he's ""willing to testify"" on Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, while noting limitations on what he would say given a lack of access to data.

Data from CryptoQuant suggests that LINK reserves on exchanges are low, while estimates from exchange netflow suggest users are depositing LINK tokens. Is this a precursor to much greater market turmoil?

A bullish order block that emerged on November 28 can potentially provide support for a potential price increase. However, on a daily timetable, the situation remains unclear. The RSI values are neutral, followed by the formation of a Bollinger band crunch point. This suggests that a continuation or reversal of the current price movement will occur within the next days. Due Diligence, The Name Of The Game The negative order block established on November 7 will also impede the impacts of a potential bullish reversal, limiting LINK bulls to the $7.190 resistance level and not higher. Although LINK’s risk barometer is quite modest, investors and traders should be cautious still. A spike in exchange net deposits may signal that individuals are preparing to sell their tokens, possibly pushing the price past $6.62. Nonetheless, if the net deposits have no effect on the price, a market-price long position with a stop loss at $6.4146 will earn some returns.

42413431,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9BjK,1670860800,Bermuda Digital Bank Jewel Issues ‘Fully-Backed’ Stablecoin,"Bermuda-based Jewel Bank said Monday it is issuing a fully backed stablecoin called Jewel USD (JUSD) that can be accessed through the Polygon network.  In a press release, Jewel said JUSD will maintain a reserve ratio with a minimum of 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, ensuring the bank will always have funds in its reserves to support each JUSD in circulation. The bank said it will also conduct regular audits of its stablecoin reserves, and will provide reports on a monthly and quarterly basis.  Given the recent turmoil surrounding the fall of crypto exchange FTX, bank-issued stablecoins, which are usually pegged to a fiat currency, could offer the market some stability for those that are fearful of the volatility of cryptocurrencies. Audits of major exchanges, such as the recent proof of reserves report for Crypto.com, have been released in order to provide some confidence that clients' assets are fully backed one to one.  Jewel’s partnership with Polygon will mean the blockchain will be used for JUSD transactions, and the bank will leverage the Polygon ecosystem for future commercial and retail stablecoin-based payment solutions.  “Our partnership with Polygon Companies helps power a key part of our long-term stablecoin infrastructure, which brings bank-grade safety, speed, and security to stablecoins,” Jewel Bank’s founder and chairman, Chance Barnett, was cited as saying in the release.  In June, Jewel Bank received its full bank and digital asset business licenses from the Bermuda Monetary Authority, becoming the country’s first digital asset bank.

42407209,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJkFt,1670859021,Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions Season,"Before 2022, sanctions in crypto sounded somewhat extravagant. While governments around the world have been after this industry for quite a while, it still seemed that cryptocurrencies, by their initial promise of privacy, freedom and censorship resistance, wouldn’t become as politicized as the fiat system.  Then 2022 showed how naive those expectations were.  This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.  “It became very clear that crypto needs to pay attention to sanctions and the consequences of not doing it can be significant,” says Daniel Tannebaum, partner at the Oliver Wyman consulting firm. He believes we will see more enforcement actions related to sanctions, and the mainstream crypto industry will need to keep adjusting to that reality.  Crypto felt its first chill of sanctions in 2021 when Virgil Griffith, an Ethereum developer, arrested earlier for speaking at a North Korean blockchain conference, pleaded guilty to helping the rogue regime evade sanctions.  The same year, Ethereum projects’ incubator ConsenSys banned Iranian students from a blockchain coding course, and fundraising platform Gitcoin shut down a campaign aimed at Farsi-speaking Ethereum coders.  This April, Griffith finally got his verdict: a sentence of 63 months in prison.  The ripples of Tornado Cash  For the Ethereum community, Griffith’s case was just the beginning. In August, Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based mixer, was blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The reason: The mixer was used by the Lazarus hacker group linked to North Korea. It was not the first mixer sanctioned this year. But because Tornado Cash is a noncustodial, open-source tool, the incident provoked outrage in the crypto community.  Probably the most high-profile crypto sanction case to date, Tornado Cash sanctioning provoked a backlash. The think tank Coin Center and U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase sued OFAC, claiming it had overstepped its authority and deprived Americans of their right for private use of cryptocurrency.  OFAC, for its part, believes that neither the open-source nature of the Tornado Cash code, nor the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) managing the protocol’s updates is a reason not to deem it a money-laundering entity that must be sanctioned.  “OFAC also kept the door open for DAOs and other decentralized organizations to be viewed as ‘entities’ for sanctions designations and enforcement actions. We are likely to see this come up again if OFAC targets the [decentralized finance] space,” says Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at blockchain intel firm TRM Labs. The sanctions severely hurt the popularity of Tornado Cash, with monthly deposits to it falling by 68%, Redbord added.  The crypto community noted that innocent people who used Tornado Cash ended up with their money locked in the sanctioned wallets. In response, OFAC published a guidance, suggesting such users apply for a license to withdraw funds – in other words, deanonymize themselves and their wallets, effectively defeating the whole point of using a mixer.  The success of such a procedure, however, is not guaranteed. The users of the sanctioned Russian exchange Chatex, whose money got frozen in the custodian wallet in 2021, applied for their licenses one year ago and are still waiting for resolution.  We have yet to see what happens when you ask OFAC to release your crypto from a sanctioned wallet – and what happens afterwards. Tornado Cash is a test of the promise.  In jail for code  Tornado Cash was also the first case when a blockchain coder went to jail for his product. Alexey Pertsev, a Tornado Cash developer and one the founders of PepperSec, a company that created the mixer, was arrested in the Netherlands in August and remains in custody as of today.  The Dutch public prosecutor voiced the position of law enforcement: Pertsev and his co-founders knew Tornado was used by bad actors, they owned a majority of protocols’ governance tokens and therefore could enforce anti-money-laundering measures but chose not to.  While Tornado Cash had a website with user-friendly interface, on which, technically, it was possible to implement know your customer/anti-money-laundering (KYC/AML) features (even considering the absurdity of such an idea for a crypto mixer), its smart contracts code is open source. Users can deploy it without going to a specific website as well as copy it and clone the service, using other, not-yet-sanctioned wallets.  This poses the most critical question of the case: Can releasing an open-source code, which can be used by bad actors, be a criminal offense? And, if yes, what does that mean for software developers around the globe? The nature of open-source software means the creator only puts it out there and has no power or responsibility over how people use it.  Whether creating the Tornado Cash code will be a part of Pertsev’s final charges (and not just maintaining the website and wallets) and whether the court decides it is a valid accusation will mean a lot for the future of open-source development.  “It became clear that the U.S. government is not fond of mixers,” Tannebaum, at Oliver Wyman, said.  The Russian wave  The war in Ukraine precipitated another wave of U.S. sanctions, this time against Russia, which started the conflict in February, provoking global outrage. As the Western countries have been trying to help out Ukraine and limit Russia’s capacity to wage war, financial sanctions have been applied to both high-profile Russian individuals and the country as a whole.  In particular, global payment providers Visa and Mastercard, as well as payment services such as Western Union, stopped sending money to and from Russia, to a significant extent isolating the country’s financial system from the world. In October, the European Union banned crypto exchanges from serving Russian citizens and residents.  Immediately, a bunch of services licensed in the EU, such as Blockchain.com, LocalBitcoins, Crypto.com, Dappers Lab and Kraken, informed their Russian users they’re no longer welcome.  As with any blanket sanctions, a number of people not involved in anything nefarious got thrown under that bus. Among them, some independent journalists and human rights activists protesting the war, who left Russia when the war started and now are using crypto as a remittance tool of last resort.  Now, a number of U.S. crypto businesses are discussing banning Russian nationals from their platforms, even though the U.S. law doesn’t require it at this point, Tannebaum said  The discussions go this way, Tannebaum explains: “The EU, U.K. and U.S. sanctions on Russia are not perfectly aligned. So to operate across these jurisdictions, do we even want to go through the headache to navigate what is permissible and what is not permissible? We may just ban the clients outright.”  Broad net  Russians I spoke to believe this is unfair; Ukrainians insist that whatever inflicts pain on Russia and Russians is helping to stop the war. Without discussing the gruesome reality that led to this whole situation, it’s worth reminding that Ukrainians themselves have been indiscriminately shadow-banned from U.S. crypto services recently.  For several years, U.S.-based exchanges have refused to serve Ukrainians because Ukraine had a sanctioned territory within its borders. That was the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and therefore sanctioned by the West. It is still considered a part of Ukraine by most of the world.  So Ukraine, in addition to losing a part of its territory, was effectively penalized for formally owning it! The country’s deputy minister of digital transformation had to write to then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking him to do something about the anomaly – to no avail for at least another year.  If you remember the case of Iranians banned from learning to code Ethereum blockchain by the cautious U.S. companies, you might see the problematic nature of blanket nation-wide crypto sanctions, and even more problematic implementation by crypto entities that would always prefer the public outrage to the ire of an (already not too friendly) regulator.  2023 will show if we are about to see more black spaces on the crypto map.  The initial thesis that Russians might use crypto en masse to evade sanctions were proved unfounded, says Tannebaum. “The firms that are doing analytics in this space haven’t found evidence of any sort of mass movement out of the traditional banking sector,” he added.  However, the sheer proportion of risk and reward from servicing a citizen of a sanctioned nation might encourage exchanges to err on the side of caution.  The future is sanctioned  “We are likely to continue to see OFAC engage in enforcement actions against exchanges that do not have the right tools in place to mitigate the risks of sanctions exposure and see OFAC use sanctions offensively as well to deter hacks and the laundering of hacked funds,” TRM Labs’ Redbord believes.  There is no sign the sanctions pressure on crypto will get any lower in foreseeable future – on the contrary, the U.S. government, for one, believes crypto services must be proactively banning users when they see “clearly observable red flags” and not to wait for the government agencies to guide their hand.  An approach like this might soon make crypto exchanges and other services very similar to banks, effectively excluding “risky” clients and leaving many people frozen out of the financial system.  And it looks like the exchanges will be given the strongest incentives to “de-risk” as hard as they can. Only this fall, two U.S. exchanges, Bittrex and Kraken, had to settle with OFAC and pay fines for failing to prevent Iranians from using their exchanges.  Major U.S. exchanges have been hiring compliance professionals from the banking sector for a while now, Tannebaum said, so it is no surprise “they’re starting to look at how to quantify risk in a manner consistent with the banking sector’s more mature practices.”  Does it mean crypto will be purified of crime and the political untouchables? Chances are, it won’t be. There will always be a market of shadow over-the-counter (OTC) brokers willing to process crime-related and sanctioned crypto. That has been the way the infamous Conti ransomware hacker group used, for example.  Those brokers, in turn, still need big exchanges with lots of liquidity to operate, and the exchanges would look the other way only until a certain point. That was the case with SUEX, the sanctioned Russian OTC that used Binance – and was banned.  However, AML tools, based on blockchain analytics systems, still allow some space for covering traces, which “will inevitably have some success no matter how sophisticated the controls,” Redbord says.  Blacklisting a blockchain address does not automatically mean freezing money on it: the owner of the addresses’ private key still can move funds, sell them peer-to-peer and swap on decentralized marketplaces that do not implement KYC/AML procedures.  In February, Canadian authorities blacklisted 34 blockchain addresses with funds raised by the so-called Freedom Convoy truckers. But it didn’t prevent the owners from moving the funds and at least trying to cash them out through exchanges like Crypto.com and Coinbase (the exchanges declined to comment on the fate of the funds).  Another example: The arrest of people behind BTC-e, the exchange linked to the Mt. Gox hack, did not prevent someone from spending money from the long-asleep BTC-e wallet in November.  In the near future, compliance tools will be getting more sophisticated, making life for sanctioned users harder and harder, Redbord said.  So the cat and mouse game will likely only get more intense in the years to come. Only the hunter will get ever hungrier, and the population of prey ever larger and more heterogenous.  Protocol-level sanctions?  At the start of the war, Ukraine tried to block another money channel for Russians. The country’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, asked Tether to freeze any transactions related to Russia. Tether did not abide.  It’s not clear whether it’s even technically tangible to locate and freeze all funds and transactions belonging to owners of a certain nationality or territory (given the existence of anonymizing tools). But Tether, which maintains tether (USDT) stablecoin smart contracts in a centralized fashion, can blacklist addresses and block funds on them.  Another, earlier attempt of protocol-level implementation of sanctions was an initiative of one single American miner Marathon, which announced last May its “OFAC pool” will only mine sanctions-free transactions. The idea was immediately ridiculed by bitcoiners and abandoned in less than a month. However, it doesn’t mean ideas of this sort won’t be entertained – and successfully implemented – in the future.  Economist John Paul Koning believes that stablecoins, which by design are mostly centralized, will be the primary target for sanctions in the future.  “Going forward, I'd suspect that a greater share of OFAC digital currency designations will explicitly target stablecoins rather than ether or bitcoin, since stablecoins have become the preferred medium of exchange in the crypto ecosystem,” Koning told CoinDesk.  Sanctions on the level of protocols would be much more powerful than on the level of service providers. We have yet to see whether the regulators will be pressing developer teams to do it and whether protocol maintainers will abide. That would create a whole new reality where you may not only get banned from an exchange but also find your crypto wallet frozen, just like a bank account.  Government authorities would probably love that level of control. And in this case, fully decentralized networks like Bitcoin would seem to regulators like an odd inconvenience once again. There might be a big temptation to go after bitcoin and discourage people from using it.  Crypto has to brace for more various and complex battles ahead, with odds not always in its favor. It will require a lot of integrity on the part of the crypto community to preserve at least islands of privacy and personal sovereignty in this future world.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/12/crypto-sanctions-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc8468f778f353eab5bea8ab2db73a31c6efdead-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

TeraWulf raised $10 million via a $6.7 million registered direct offering of common stock and $3.4 million of convertible promissory notes to some of its largest shareholders. In November, TeraWulf announced it had raised $17 million via equity and debt.  The Maryland-based mining company also said it has restructured a previously announced agreement with bitcoin miner manufacturer Bitmain to add 8,200 new machines to its fleet at no additional cost by also using remaining unused deposits with Bitmain  ""With the incremental delivery of 8,200 miners, the Company is increasing its estimated Q1 2023 self-mining target to 44,450 owned miners deployed (5.0 EH/s) from its prior estimate of 36,250 owned miners (4.3 EH/s),"" TeraWulf said.  TeraWulf's shares were down roughly 37% to $0.76 in early trading on Monday. WULF had rallied from less than $0.80 to $1.21 last week prior to the initial announcement of its purchase agreement with Bitmain. The negative sentiment in early trading today could therefore be a correction to its big jump last week.

42407244,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJwT4,1670855201,What the IMF Can Teach Binance About Crypto Bailouts,"In the midst of the FTX fallout, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s proposal to create an “industry recovery fund” has been the focus of significant attention. According to an announcement, the $2 billion Industry Recovery Initiative (or IRI) will support projects that “through no fault of their own, are facing significant, short-term, financial difficulties.” Some $50 million has been committed by venture capital firms, while Binance will ostensibly provide the rest, as well as general administration.  This announcement is the latest step in the crypto industry’s attempts to establish a mechanism for bailing out firms facing liquidity issues and heading off the systemic risk from their collapse. Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine observed that establishing the IRI would solidify Binance’s role as a de facto central bank for the crypto industry by establishing it as the industry’s lender of last resort.  Stephanie Hurder is a founding economist at Prysm Group and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. This piece is part of ""Crypto 2023""  Designing a system to bail out firms in financial crises and to mitigate systemic risk is not a new problem. Domestically in the United States, a combination of government organizations, such as the central banks and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), frequently play this role for banking systems via emergency lending programs and deposit insurance. This year’s Nobel Prize-winning research detailed how such programs can help avoid widespread financial crises.  But the crypto industry is far more like the hedge fund industry than a system of retail banks: token-denominated liabilities and assets are in a variety of currencies whose relative values are volatile. How can a backstop be designed in light of this additional complexity?  Read more: Crypto Needs an FDIC-Like Protocol to Prevent Liquidity Crises | Opinion  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has spent decades serving as the lender of last resort in a global economy where countries must grapple with a wide variety of unique currencies and financial circumstances. And while the experience of countries bailed out by the IMF is not exactly idyllic, and fierce debate among economists continues about how the fund can improve, it provides a reference point for the crypto industry. Crypto today is taking its first steps toward establishing institutions to promote systemic stability.  What can the crypto industry learn from the IMF when it comes to bailouts?  First, no single entity should supply or control the use of funds in the context of bailouts. It must be a consortium endeavor. The IMF is composed of 190 countries, who contribute funds and participate in different ways, such as through voting and in various sub-committees. At a high level, the IMF governance structure is composed of the Board of Governors and the Executive Board. Each country has one seat on the Board of Governors and a specified voting power based on their pro-rata funds contribution in a quota system. The single-highest voting power – the United States – is only ~16% of total voting power. Moreover, the Executive Board is composed of 24 executive directors, with a portion of seats rotating and representing multiple nations while seven countries have permanent seats.  Overall, no single country controls any of the IMF’s plethora of economic support vehicles and facilities.  Positioning any single entity – including Binance – as the crypto industry’s lender of last resort fails to reduce systemic risk and creates a host of new problems. The recent collapse of FTX and its widespread impacts on other players have begun to reveal the full nature of the complex interdependencies that existed between the exchange and other entities in the crypto industry.  These relationships, as currently publicly known, have been summarized by publications like CoinDesk. If an entity functioning as the lender of last resort in the crypto industry were a participant in such a complex interdependent network, a myriad of conflicts of interest would arise. For example, they could wield funds as anticompetitive weapons or use access to proprietary information to their own private benefit. A lender of last resort isn’t actually a lender of last resort when its own solvency and institutional trust is fragile and highly correlated to the same players it is meant to backstop.  Just as the IMF distributes power and responsibility across many entities, crypto should aim for a similarly distributed structure.  Second, bailout provisions must depend on systemic risk, not on the allocation of blame. Binance’s IRI announcement said the IRI will support projects that “through no fault of their own, are facing significant, short-term, financial difficulties.” This confuses the primary function and economic logic that creates a defensible scope for bailouts.  Read more: The Role Regulators Played in the FTX Fiasco  The purpose of a bailout is to both make whole the firm’s lenders and customers, and to the greatest extent possible to prevent widespread liquidity crises from spreading and developing into broader financial crises. Whether an emergency financial scenario arises from prior malicious risk-taking activity or blameless behavior is inconsequential at the point when swift action is required to ensure market stability.  For example, after the 2008 global financial crisis, the IMF helped bail out Greece even though the Greek government had partially caused the scenario by incorrectly reporting debt levels. Ultimately, the IMF gave relief funds and even violated some of its own internal rules in the name of preventing a widespread crisis.  In crypto, a similar dynamic may develop if a structurally significant player becomes hacked or compromised. Sure, the protocol should have done all it could to avoid the scenario in the first place, but at the point in time that it has a spillover impact on the entire crypto industry, the priority is to guarantee stability, not attempt to assign ultimate responsibility or make funds conditional upon the court of public opinion.  Moral hazards  This brings up a third point – how to avoid moral hazard? The obvious problem with a bailout fund that bails out each entity with sufficient systemic risk is that it’s too easy for firms to be careless with risk management and then turn to the fund for ex post relief. While bailouts can’t be conditioned on whether management behaved badly, ex post punishments and economic restrictions certainly can.  The IMF is known for imposing onerous debt service and other structural conditions on bailout recipients, even when these restrictions might prevent the country from rebounding quickly. Indeed, these are so unpleasant that countries will do almost anything to avoid using the IMF’s resources. There are typically ~20 structural conditions imposed by the IMF when a country accepts a bail-out package, though in 2012 Greece had as many as 97 structural conditions imposed by the IMF. The message is that while the lender of last resort won’t let a country collapse, it won’t be easy or pleasant for the country in the following years.  This brings us to the crux of the matter: In order for crypto to have any hope of solving this same problem, the cost to individual project teams of needing bailouts must be severe. Importantly, these punishments will need to be imposed by other members of the crypto industry. With an industry as globally distributed and borderless as crypto, agencies of individual governments will forever be playing whack-a-mole.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried, CZ Battle It Out on Twitter Over Binance's Exit from FTX  Schemes for such punishments haven’t yet been developed, but could include a subset of the consortium members assuming immediate control over the project or taking board seats. Key members of the management staff may experience sanctions, penalties or difficulty raising funding for ongoing or new projects.  Overall, the messaging from the lender(s) of last resort to the management of failed crypto firms must be swift and severe: We’ll help save your creditors and ensure you avoid collapse, but you are not going to enjoy it and your reputation will be severely damaged.  In light of the fallout from FTX’s collapse and this year’s insolvencies, bailouts and recovery funds have become a hot topic. Although it is much easier said than done, an independent IMF-style organization is the crypto industry’s best chance at implementing a financial backstop to mitigate systemic risk and protect consumers. Letting any single entity, especially a crypto industry competitor, assume this role will ultimately increase crypto’s systemic risk and leave the industry vulnerable to yet another FTX-style collapse that hampers the industry’s growth and adoption.

42407213,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJkT7,1670854934,Where Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine Headed in 2023? (Hint: Beyond Ethereum),"Ethereum pioneered the general-purpose smart contracting layer on top of its blockchain, so it’s no surprise that the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, for short, has attracted and retained a huge portion of Web3 developers.  What’s less well-known is that the EVM is not intrinsically bound to Ethereum. It’s already deployed on several other blockchains. With that in mind, here are three predictions for where the EVM space will grow and evolve in the coming year.  Federico Kunze Küllmer is the co-founder and director of Evmos. This story is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.  A growing collection of EVMs will become increasingly specialized  The EVM is by far the most popular execution environment among smart contract developers. The proliferation of decentralized apps, or dApps, on Ethereum and Layer 2s is a testament to this vibrant building scene.  At the same time, users may be a bit disillusioned when they see that many of the dApps on these different EVMs are simply forks. The many instances of decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or Sushiswap and lending protocols like Aave are perfect examples of this phenomenon.  Read more: The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups  These forks aren’t created pointlessly – Uniswap on Polygon generally has lower transaction costs than Uniswap on Ethereum – but when you consider that liquidity is fragmented across these multiple versions of the dApp and then consider that developers have to maintain each of these forked applications, the case for multichain deployments isn’t very strong.  As the Web3 application space, and especially decentralized finance (DeFi), matures, applications will consolidate into one or just a few instances and interoperate with other ecosystems.  In tandem with this consolidation, we’ll also see increasing specialization among the various EVMs to cater to specific kinds of applications. These are called application-specific EVMs, built to cater to categories of applications like DeFi, ReFi [regenerative finance] and infrastructure. Some of these applications will mature and migrate to their application-specific blockchains (appchains), like what thhe blockchain of blockchains, Cosmos, enables.  Already decentralized derivatives exchange dYdX is building its appchain within the Cosmos ecosystem – a decision its developers made to take greater control over the platform’s entire stack. Other Ethereum-native apps may soon follow.  Read more: Ethereum Developers Target March 2023 for Release of Staked Ether  However, different dApps have different amounts of contributor resources and developer expertise behind them, so don’t expect all of them to become appchains overnight. Building and maintaining an application, especially when it has been deployed to multiple chains, is hard enough for many teams.  So in addition to the broad, general-purpose EVMs like Ethereum, Polygon and Arbitrum, there is also plenty of room for EVMs with unique functionality. There will be more conservative EVMs (like granddaddy Ethereum) and others that build out innovative new capabilities enabling next-generation dApps.  EVMs will prioritize interoperability and composability  A key component of Vitalik Buterin’s Endgame vision for Ethereum is a flourishing multi-rollup ecosystem. This may very well pan out, but there will be much more than just EVM rollups involved. There will also be many independent but interoperable EVM blockchains, some of which, like Evmos, are going to develop unique, extended EVM functionalities.  This expanding collection of EVMs will be diverse and will see the most value creation when they’re fully composable. This would allow dApps on one chain to use and interact with dApps deployed on other chains, effectively creating cross-chain “money legos.” In my mind, this is how Ethereum scaling (both mainnet and L2 rollups) and Cosmos, each of which has seen rapid growth, will come together in a greater Interchain.  Ethermint will become the preferred library  Developers will converge on solutions that enable them to launch new EVM blockchains as easily as possible. An open-source EVM library like Ethermint, which is built for interoperability, great developer experience and extensibility, fits that bill perfectly. (Full disclosure: Evmos leads the development and maintains the Ethermint library.)  The beauty of Ethermint is that it brings together the EVM and the Cosmos SDK [software development kit]. This means that blockchains built with Ethermint can enable EVM smart contracts to use the core Cosmos modules.  I’ve already touched on the importance of interoperability, and IBC, the non-custodial bridging protocol that has made Cosmos famous, is just one of many unique capabilities enabled by Cosmos SDK modules that Ethermint can allow dApps to leverage.  Read more: Ethereum’s Rollup Race: What is a ‘True’ zkEVM?  Additional building blocks like Interchain Accounts and Interchain Queries are making cross-chain app development a reality. These two modules allow chains to relay and act on messages, as well as control assets on each other’s chains.  For example, a cross-chain version of vault-style products like Yearn could move/trade/LP assets on interconnected chains on Cosmos. This is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to IBC-enabled dApps, and I’m excited to see this design space explored.  The future is bright for EVMs. They’re proliferating, they’re expanding their feature sets, and they’re bringing together Ethereum and Cosmos. In 2023 we’ll see years of infrastructural development bring this to life for users as EVM applications become more powerful and more connected than ever before.

42407243,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJwWN,1670854802,How Crypto Can Repair Its Reputation in Washington,"You don’t have to be a close observer of the crypto industry to recognize an uncomfortable truth: Crypto’s reputation in Washington, D.C., is damaged. While the industry has developed enduring relationships with a growing group of bipartisan lawmakers over the past several years, recent market turmoil and the ongoing saga of the collapse of FTX International taint the broader industry.  Many national lawmakers and regulators have become increasingly wary of the industry, and many have called for stricter regulations and oversight. While this is a challenging situation, it is also an opportunity to return to the key benefits of decentralized systems – privacy, transparency and economic freedom – helping to reboot the industry’s relationship with Washington.  Kristin Smith is the executive director of the Blockchain Association, a Washington D.C.-based crypto industry lobbying group. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023.  The key to re-energizing the conversation on crypto’s core benefits is the myriad merits of decentralization, which happens to be the core reason that many in this industry chose to embrace this technology in the first place. It’s the heart and soul of crypto, the ability to transact between individuals without the need for a centralized intermediary. It also happens to be the answer to much of the recent turmoil, including FTX and Celsius Network, to name a few.  Each of those failures was a failure of centralization, not the underlying technology that powers crypto.  We recognize that trusted intermediaries, like exchanges and custodians, play an essential role on the path to decentralization. But a core goal of this industry isn’t just to make minor tweaks around the edges of the legacy financial system or Web2. It’s to rebuild today’s flawed infrastructure from the ground up. Some may have gone too far down the path of centralization, and we’ve seen the results: spectacular crashes and business failures that echo past events from legacy industries.  Read more: Exploring Biden’s Executive Order on Crypto, 6 Months In  Crypto is here for good – but can and should be better than the system we are trying to replace.  Following the failure of FTX International, it’s understandable that lawmakers want to do something, but they should be wary of passing legislation in haste that would do more harm than good.  Instead, Congress should take its time to investigate the issues we’ve seen and work closely with the crypto industry to find solutions that benefit everyone. But it’s not just lawmakers who need to do their due diligence. The crypto industry has a significant role to play in alleviating concerns and rebuilding trust. So how do we do that?  Rebuilding trust  First, we must continue investing in our Washington presence. We have a strong advocacy apparatus in place, but we’re still far behind our competitors in traditional finance. With greater investment in teams of advocates, both internally among individual companies and in advocacy associations, we will have greater success at getting in front of lawmakers and promoting smart policy solutions.  Second, we need to double down on education and show the societal benefits that crypto networks provide. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, has the power to expand financial access to underserved communities, streamline business functions and democratize the digital ecosystem. By sharing that story through briefings and meetings with key policy stakeholders, we can show that crypto is truly here for good and promote a positive regulatory environment.  Read more: Bank of America Says Regulation Is Key for Mainstream Adoption of Crypto  Finally, we need to continue building relationships with lawmakers. This is done by meeting lawmakers where they are, answering tough questions and being transparent about our operations and values. Additionally, we need to come to the table with good policy ideas to prove our commitment to a mutually beneficial policy framework.  The collective voice of crypto – a voice that has been here for years and will remain for years to come – represents something far greater than one man or one company. We represent the innovators, the builders, and the investors in our future working to build a better internet for all.  While our reputation has taken a few body blows, we have to double down on rekindling relationships and restoring trust to ensure we advance policies that will set us up for future success.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Kristin Smith,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/12/crypto-regulation-washington,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1db40dbe7d9e324e36091e361a63101bd2c2251-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

5430829,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512097,1670853887,Bitcoin Bottom Or More Pain? Here’s What BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes Thinks,"Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of crypto derivatives platform BitMEX and Bitcoin pioneer, has spoken out about the current state of the market in an interview with Scott Melker. Despite the threat of a looming recession in the U.S., Hayes believes Bitcoin is in a bottom phase. According to him, the origin of the boom-and-bust cycle is the rampant monetary policy. “If we take a step back and look at why BTC went up so high because [… ] the biggest economy in the world printed the most money they’ve ever done. Obviously a lot of money flowed into crypto,” the BitMEX founder said. The excess needs to be reversed now. Notably, it also contributed to the “behavior of Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX, Kyle, Zhu and all of the centralized money platforms. All bankrupt and insolvent.” Bitcoin Bottom Is In Looking forward, this is the key bottom indicator for Hayes as “pretty much everyone who could go bankrupt has gone bankrupt”. Remarkably, the collapsed entities sold Bitcoin and Ethereum first, indicating the health of the market. By contrast, “dog and shitcoins” are still left on their balance sheets because they are super illiquid, Hayes noted. He added, “if you look at Alameda’s balance sheet, there’s no BTC on there. They sold Bitcoin as they were going bankrupt. The shitcoins are left.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops Below $17,000 Pre-CPI And FOMC – Scenarios To Prepare For This Week That’s another reason why BTC will be ringing the bell for the end of the bear market, while some altcoins will remain depressed, Hayes asserted: [Bitcoin is] the most pristine and most liquid asset, and that’s why it will lead us off the bottom too. And obviously the shitcoins will follow. But there’s a lot of bags held by bankrupt companies who need to liquidate them. But at least for Bitcoin, I am very confident that the largest, most irresponsible entities have sold all the Bitcoins to diamond hands. In the addendum, the BitMEX founder went on to say that he can’t prove that all the BTC held by these failed entities were sold during the crashes, but it looks like it. In his recent blog post, Hayes added that he currently sees no reason why people should not hold Bitcoin unless they have a “pressing need for fiat money.” The Real Test For BTC Will Come In 2024/2025 Looking further into the future, the BitMEX founder believes BTC will bounce back next year as the U.S. treasury and bond market will become dysfunctional sometime in 2023 due to the Fed’s tighter monetary policy. At that point, Hayes expects the Fed to fire up the money printer. Then, Bitcoin and all other risk assets will skyrocket. However, Bitcoin will serve as an indicator and will decouple from the S&P500 beforehand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stuck In Key Range, Why The Bulls Remain In Action Moreover, the BitMEX founder does not expect the true test for Bitcoin, a recession, until 2024 or 2025 when he forecasts a “generational collapse” to happen. “Hopefully it’s better than the 1930s, but depression-like. And then the question is, can Bitcoin outperform the 10-year treasuries and really high inflation?”, Hayes said. Until then, the dollar and BTC markets will be correlated. Whether Bitcoin is truly an inflation hedge and will show any usefulness remains to be seen then. “That’s the real test”, Hayes concluded. At press time, BTC was recording a small loss of 1,1% over the last 24 hours. The price stood at $16,973.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bottom-or-more-pain-heres-what-arthur-hayes-thinks/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/5430829.jpeg

42413447,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9F7o,1670853600,Crypto Insurance Firm Evertas Bucks Bear Market With $14M Raise,"Evertas, the cryptocurrency insurance firm that received a nod from Lloyd’s of London earlier this year, has raised $14 million in funding, underlining the need for assurances within the turbulent, unpredictable digital asset space.  The $14 million Series A round, which was led by Polychain Capital, adds to a $5.8 million seed funding secured last year, bringing the company’s total outside investment to $19.8 million.  Insurance of cryptocurrency wallets against hacks, thefts and natural disasters hasn’t convinced all the major exchanges to be worth the squeeze, thanks to things like high premium, combined with unclear policy definitions. But in these uncertain times, having insurance over assets guarantees a third-party professional underwriting firm has scrutinized a firm’s systems and controls, said Evertas CEO J. Gdanski.  Moreover, Gdanski pointed out that Evertas has been in communication with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about how insurance can be an effective proxy for regulation when it comes to a rapidly evolving technology such as custodial crypto – a need that will be ever more pressing in the wake of the recent FTX collapse, he said.  “There are things that come out of these massive crises in the space that we’ve had in our underwriting for three or four years,” Gdanski said in an interview with CoinDesk. “That includes things like trust accounts, segregation of assets, clear delineation of ownership in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency, having appropriate boards in place.”  Also included in the Series A round were: SinoGlobal Capital, CMT Digital Ventures, Foundation Capital, Morgan Creek, Bloccelerate, network0, Matrixport, and HashKey. Individual investors include Balaji Srinivasan, Andrew Keys, Colleen Sullivan, Patrick McDonald and David Roebuck.  Outside of Evertas, the crypto insurance space has almost no true and dedicated expertise, according to investor Andrew Keys, co-founder of advisory firm Darma Capital.  “The incumbent carriers and reinsurers writing the occasional crypto policy are staffed by insurance generalists analyzing these very specialized risks, part time; they’re in way over their heads and that’s unsustainable,” said Keys in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/12/crypto-insurance-firm-evertas-bucks-bear-market-with-14m-raise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b80b0d3827cfa993e539057697f1e7c092a4fe7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The anticipated pump from the beginning of the 2022 FIFA World Cup on November 21 has done little to stem the negative tide in this post-FTX timeframe. Chiliz bulls took confidence on November 10 as CHZ rebounded from the range lows to near the range highs. Despite the overwhelming anxiety on the market, the token posted gains of 72% from November 9 to November 18 within 10 days. But then, that’s a different narrative. Related Reading: How Litecoin (LTC) Outperforms Other Top Cryptocurrencies In This Department Let’s take a quick glance of how the token is performing thus far: Since FTX and throughout the World Cup, CHZ has been performing rather sluggishly The oversold RSI and falling reserves in the exchange both point to a favorable direction for the token’s price In theory, a long position taken at the current price level would yield a profit According to data compiled by CoinGecko, CHZ is trading at $0.136387, down nearly 19 percent in the last seven days. As Christmas nears, investors might be wondering if the token has any gas left to create some fireworks in terms of price increase. Metrics relating to the asset’s risk have also been unfavorable. Messari reports that CHZ has a -4.78 Sharpe’s ratio alongside 1.11 volatility. Considering CHZ’s past performance, these numbers are not what investors want to see. Somewhat Bullish Technicals? A Pearson’s R score of 0.8342 in the regression channel indicates that a more pronounced downward trend is imminent. On the other hand, CHZ’s RSI readings are currently oversold, which could provide CHZ bulls a foothold. But the break of the support line at $0.1540 propelled the price to its current level. The Bollinger band has also been extremely negative, with its moving average creating an additional resistance at $0.1623. Chart: TradingView The bullish order block that emerged way back in August could provide investors and traders with some guidelines. According to CryptoQuant statistics, a bullish price reversal may be imminent because of the dwindling reserves. However, investors and traders should remain vigilant. The bullish order block is the only obstacle preventing the bears from continuing their downward movement. As prior price moves have created a XABCD harmonic frame, the support at $0.1373 may serve as a launching pad for bullishness. Although the CMF figure is negative, it is only -0.01. This provides CHZ bulls with the opportunity to recover. Profitable Long Position And Stop Loss Surprisingly optimistic indicators could prompt a retest of the $0.1540 resistance by buyers. The current market price of CHZ is deeply discounted, suggesting that investors and traders may wish to purchase the drop. A profitable long position would have a stop loss at $0.1289. However, given the persisting bearishness in the market, traders and investors should exercise caution with longer-term CHZ plays.

42413449,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9F9g,1670849365,"Goldman: Regulators Should Protect Crypto Investors at the Point of Trust, Not the Blockchain","The demise of FTX is a story as old as financial markets and does not reflect a failure of blockchain technology, but the lack of regulation around the “point of trust” – where money is exchanged on the promise of a future return, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a research report Friday.  Recent crises in the crypto market follow a well-trodden path, the report said: “A highly volatile and relatively new asset creates the potential for instant riches, drawing in many unsophisticated investors looking for the opportunity to make millions.”  New financial instruments are lightly regulated because they are not covered by existing rules and regulators have yet to identify the potential for harm, the note said. That’s the reason the crypto bubble of recent years involved more widespread fraud than the dot-com boom at the turn of the century, which happened in the well-regulated equity market.  “Regulation is needed at the point of trust, where money is exchanged on the promise of some future return, because it is the time component that creates the opportunity for fraud,” analysts Jeff Currie and Daniel Sharp wrote.  To access the market, investors must go through a gatekeeper, such as a crypto exchange like FTX, and speculative investors are willing to give money to these institutions in the hopes of getting rich quickly.  Despite the crises of 2022, Goldman says cryptocurrencies are likely to flourish, and the key to their success depends on rulemakers correctly identifying what to regulate.  In crypto, it’s “the point of trust, not the trustless blockchains themselves,” Goldman said. Once the financial features of digital assets are sorted out, regulators should not interfere with the blockchains themselves, the bank added.  When a token is used as a financial instrument, as when Terra’s UST stablecoin was lent out on Anchor for a 20% yield, it should be regulated like other securities, the report said, and until regulators can classify which tokens fall into this category, the “opportunity for fraud in crypto will persist.”  Goldman notes that decentralized financial (DeFi) lending systems, in which financial applications are carried out on a blockchain, don’t pose the same counterparty risk as traditional banks. In DeFi lending, collateral is visible to all members of the pool and is automatically liquidated if the value approaches the value of the loan. Collateral can be retrieved without the need for court proceedings or at a discount to the loan, by using smart contracts.  “This resolves the question of trust, the very thing regulation to safeguard investors would be intended for,” the bank said.

The Department of Justice has also discussed possible plea deals with Binance's lawyers, the report added.  Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle began investigating Binance in 2018 after a spate of cases that saw criminals use Binance to transfer illicit funds, according to Reuters.  Other prosecutors believe that more evidence needs to be gathered before a criminal case can be filed, causing a split within the Department of Justice.  Binance refuted the Reuters article in a statement. Tigran Gambaryan, the exchange's global head of intelligence and investigations, said Binance has ""responded to over 47,000 law enforcement requests"" since November 2021.  ""As has been reported widely, regulators are doing a sweeping review of every crypto company against many of the same issues. This nascent industry has grown quickly and Binance has shown its commitment to security and compliance through large investments in our team as well as the tools and technology we use to detect and deter illicit activity,"" a Binance spokesperson said.  Gambaryan added that Binance has increased its security and compliance headcount by more than 500% and that its team is ""possibly even the strongest in the entire financial sector.""

5424155,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512072,1670839628,"Bitcoin Drops Below $17,000 Pre-CPI And FOMC – Scenarios To Prepare For This Week","A week could not be more important for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market! On Tuesday, at 08:30 ET, there will be the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Just one day later, on Wednesday, December 14 at 14:00 ET, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will hold its last meeting of the year. For the fourth time this year, there will be an updated forecast for inflation and interest rates (dot plot). Generally, there is a simple base case scenario: if the numbers are better than expected, there will be a rally for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. If the CPI falls short of expectations, Bitcoin could face a new bear market low. Did Bitcoin Overreact To The PPI? To assess how likely both scenarios are, it is also worth looking back at the recent producer price index (PPI) release. The PPI was higher than expected. However, expectations were relatively high. The core PPI was forecast at 7.2% in October, but actually fell to 6.7%, a 0.5% month-to-month decline. Related Reading: Upcoming FOMC Meeting Is The Most Important Ever For Bitcoin – Watch Out For The Dot Plot The core PPI November forecast was 5.9%. In reality, though, the PPI came in at 6.2%. While this looks bearish at first, it really wasn’t. This still represented a 0.5% decline month-over-month. The PPI shows the same story. The value fell for two consecutive months, 0.5% and 0.6%. The expectation was a 1.1% decline in one month, which was extremely unrealistic. The markets’ projected target was an extremely low number, and the failure to meet that expectation was, in a sense, an overreaction. Inflation has continued to fall significantly, just less than less than expected. Ultimately, expectations were a bit out of touch with reality. In addition, the PPI is fundamentally more volatile than the CPI, and also fluctuates seasonally. With the Christmas and gift-giving season, fluctuation is not uncommon. A Game Of Expectations So what are the expectations for the CPI? CPI fell 0.5% in October to 7.7%, while 8.0% was predicted. Tuesday’s expectations are now 0.4% lower. The forecasted CPI is 7.3%. Core CPI is expected at 6.1%, which would represent a 0.2% decline. The October reading was 6.3%, while the expectation was 6.5%, creating a positive surprise. The forecast for the CPI and the Core CPI are thus much more moderate and less unrealistic than for the PPI. Unlike the PPI, there are no extremely high expectations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stuck In Key Range, Why The Bulls Remain In Action Even a “small” surprise could be enough to turn the market bullish. In a best-case scenario, we see a number of around 7% for the CPI on Tuesday. Moreover, a renewed drop in the CPI could confirm that inflation peaked. If the CPI falls for the sixth month in a row, fears of a second wave of inflation would also be allayed for now. All Eyes On The FOMC Meeting Last but not least, the CPI numbers will be quite crucial for the FOMC decision on Wednesday. The market has priced in a 78% probability that the Fed will slow the pace of rate hikes to 50 basis points at that meeting. However, the words spoken at the FOMC press conference are likely to be even more important, as well as the forecasts of updated economic projections. For the first time since September, the market will see an updated dot plot, an extremely important piece of information, as NewsBTC reported. Banking giant ING, meanwhile, laid out some potential scenarios that could put the market in risk-off or on mode. ING’s base case is that the Federal Reserve will hike rates by 50 bps, with 5% end 2023. As the monetary policy works with long & varied lags, ING expects a slowdown in future rate hikes, and clear cuts in 2024. This scenario could provide the bulls with the powder they need to start a rally.

42413433,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9Ewa,1670835900,"Terra's Do Kwon Is in Serbia, CoinDesk Korea Reports","Do Kwon, who is wanted internationally in connection with the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, has moved to Serbia through Dubai, CoinDesk Korea reported on Monday.  Kwon was the co-founder and CEO of Terraform Labs, which was behind the stablecoin terraUSD (UST) that was deppeged from the U.S. dollar in May. The depegging quickly sent luna (LUNA), the token that was used to stabilize UST, on a downward spiral. The Terra domino was the first to fall in a crypto winter that most recently saw the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  South Korea, where Kwon is from, had issued an arrest warrant for the founder. Interpol had also reportedly issued a red notice for the co-founder, which is a request to law enforcement around the world to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action.  The Seoul Southern District Prosecutor's office said Monday that Kwon was in Serbia, and the local Ministry of Justice was in the process of asking Serbian authorities for their cooperation in the investigation, CoinDesk Korea reported.  Kwon left South Korea in April for Singapore, and went to Dubai in October, from where he went to Serbia, CoinDesk Korea reported. Authorities are concerned that he might have already moved to another country; his passport has been invalidated so authorities cannot check official records, according to the report.  Bloomberg had earlier reported that Kwon was in Europe.  Prosecutors asked for an arrest warrant for Terra's other co-founder, Daniel Shin, but courts denied the request as they don't believe he will flee or try to destroy evidence.

42413451,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9FAc,1670834444,"Tron's USDD Stablecoin Falls to Under 97 Cents, Lowest Level Since June","The Tron network's algorithmic decentralized stablecoin's search for a stable U.S. dollar peg continues even as the broader crypto market holds steady in the face of widening FTX contagion.  The USDD stablecoin, championed by Tron's founder Justin Sun and managed by Tron's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), fell to slightly below 97 U.S. cents early Monday, hitting the lowest since June 22, according to data source CoinGecko. The decline violated the DAO's 3% price fluctuation threshold for price fluctuations to be considered de-pegs.  USDD deviated from a supposed 1:1 exchange rate with the U.S. dollar last month as the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, formerly the world's third largest, dented investor confidence in digital assets. Other leading stablecoins such as tether (USDT) wobbled following the FTX debacle, but quickly regained their peg.  USDD's prolonged de-pegging is accompanied by a steady increase in the stablecoin's dominance rate in the USDD/3CRV liquidity pool based on the decentralized exchange Curve.  At press time, USDD accounted for 86% of the pool's total liquidity of $34.5 million, up from 80% seen on Nov. 10. The heavy imbalance suggests users are increasingly swapping USDD for the pool's other components – DAI, USDC and USDT.  In an attempt to calm market nerves, Justin Sun announced on Twitter that he is deploying more capital to defend USDD while stressing that the algorithmic stablecoin has a collateral ratio of 200%.  USDD's inability to regain the peg has Crypto Twitter wondering whether the dollar-pegged coin modeled after Terra's now-defunct algorithmic stablecoin UST is the next to go down.  UST crashed in May, destroying billions in investor wealth. However, before the crash UST's market capitalization was $18 billion – or 18 times bigger than UST's going market value of less than $1 billion. In other words, the fallout from a potential USDD collapse might be less severe than UST.

Today, SUSHI has lost more than 5% of its value, following the trend of other major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Here’s a quick glance at how SUSHI is performing: Optimism manifested itself as an acceleration in development activity and an increase in whale demand for SUSHI Technicals and metrics imply significant bearishness SUSHI could wrap up 2022 in a bumpy ride Related Reading: How Litecoin (LTC) Outperforms Other Top Cryptocurrencies In This Department The token’s dismal showing is in contrast to some positive trends, such as rising developer engagement (as reported by Santiment) and rising whale interest (as reported by WhaleStats). Metrics and technicals, however, suggest that SUSHI may close out the year with negative numbers. JUST IN: $SUSHI @sushiswap now on top 10 purchased tokens among 100 biggest #ETH whales in the last 24hrs 🐳 We’ve also got $MOH, $QRDO, $QWLA, $aDAI & $BOBA on the list 👀 Whale leaderboard: https://t.co/N5qqsCAH8j#SUSHI #whalestats #babywhale #BBW pic.twitter.com/TWNaSe2p5T — WhaleStats (tracking crypto whales) (@WhaleStats) December 10, 2022 SUSHI Technicals Not Looking Great The coin has found support at $1.013 and is presently trading at $1.119. The price is at a red candle, supporting a further drop in the near future. Money Flow Index verifies the decline that has started despite RSI readings near neutral levels. This pessimism is bolstered by the gloomy data from CryptoQuant. Exchange reserve data have grown over the past few days, despite increased development activity and whale interest being incredibly favorable indicators. The oversold level of SUSHI’s stochastic relative strength index (RSI) may serve as a catalyst for a pullback, notwithstanding the stock’s bearish sentiment. The Bollinger band is in a position that is close to neutral, but its moving average acts as resistance at $1.263. However, the present price action is persistently pushing the bottom half of the range, which could result in a negative outcome for the token. Drastic Measures Required? Currently, the price is attempting to settle near $1.114, which could indicate that bulls and bears will remain in a prolonged deadlock. CMF data for SUSHI may suggest a turnaround. Messari’s revealing of a major decline in SUSHI’s volatility could help investors and traders gain some momentume. Sharpe’s ratio indicates that the token’s performance indicates very low returns relative to its volatility. The current state of the crypto may be the result of recent reports that the DEX’s finances are not in good shape, and its CEO Jared Grey is considering severe measures to remedy the situation. With DeFiLlama observing repeated reductions in TVL for SUSHI, investors and dealers of the token may have a colder winter this year.

42388279,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRCVv1,1670817206,Maple Finance's $54M of Sour Debt Shows Risks of Crypto Lending Without Collateral,"The blockchain-based lending protocol Maple Finance started in May 2021 with a bold concept: Build a decentralized credit marketplace for cryptocurrencies, where lenders and borrowers could come together.  Unlike many other decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms that have cropped up in recent years in the nascent digital-asset industry, Maple’s model would not require extra cryptocurrencies to be deposited as collateral that could be seized or quickly liquidated in the event of a default. Instead, underwriters of various lending “pools” would make the decision on whether to grant loans – essentially evaluating the borrower’s ability to pay based on their creditworthiness alone.  But this year’s trauma in crypto markets has provided a brutal stress test that now has Maple facing the biggest crisis of its 18-month history.  In just the past two weeks, some $36 million of loans have defaulted with another $18 million distressed. The soured debt represents 66% of the total outstanding in Maple’s four active lending pools, with some of the biggest borrowers acknowledging they were devastated by the spectacular collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange. Maple’s native token, MPL, has tumbled 50% over the period to an all-time low.  Now analysts and participants in the Maple project are grappling with what went wrong and how the rules and procedures might be tweaked to make the platform more sustainable. Because Maple merely serves as the operator of the project and not as a lender to the various pools, it’s not facing its own credit crisis. But with depositors to Maple’s lending pools scarred by the recent losses, a key question is whether participants will stick around.  A major focus of analysts is on what appears to be the Achilles' heel of the business model of uncollateralized crypto lending. Poor protocol design choices combined with dubious human-made decisions left depositors unprotected and facing up to 80% losses.  “Uncollateralized loans in DeFi are still reliant on centralized parties for underwriting, antithetical to the ethos of transparency and decentralization,'' said Walter Teng, vice president of digital assets at market research firm Fundstrat.  Read more: TrueFi's $4M Bad Debt in Limbo Shows Risk of Crypto Lending Without Collateral  Crypto credit crunch  Maple rode the wave of the crypto lending boom, growing its loan book to $900 million in a year. The protocol was initially popular among crypto trading firms and market makers hungry for liquidity to borrow. Depositors include average retail investors and institutional players who seek yield. In Maple's decentralized model, the depositors are actually the lenders.  Maple’s loan process is governed by computer-coded smart contracts. However, the protocol has centralized elements.  Every credit pool has a delegate, a financial firm that underwrites the loans and supposedly makes sure the pool’s money is lent to entities that can pay the loans back.  The credit pool manager role is crucial on Maple and its rivals because loans are undercollateralized. It means that borrowers post less assets in value, often nothing at all, to secure a loan. So there's not much to be seized if the loans go bad; it's like a mortgage without a lien on the home.  Earlier this year, after the Terra blockchain’s collapse triggered a wave of cascading losses and a crypto credit crunch, deposits and loans on Maple shrank quickly. FTX’s swift unraveling in November dealt another blow. Outstanding loans fell to $82 million, according to data by Token Terminal.  Two former credit pool managers, crypto lender Celsius Network and FTX sister trading firm Alameda Research, are now in bankruptcy and getting tarred in court and in the media over allegedly unsavory business practices.  A third credit pool manager, Orthogonal Trading, allegedly misrepresented its financials to hide losses from FTX and was booted from Maple on Dec. 5.  One of the two remaining pool managers, M11 Credit, a subsidiary of investment firm Maven 11, has come under fire recently for allowing bad debt to pile up in its three lending pools.  Orthogonal Trading was a large borrower from Maple credit pools managed by M11, and it defaulted on $36 million in loans.  Auros Global missed a payment on a $3 million loan, but M11 chose not to declare default and pursue restructuring. Even before that, M11 Credit had let the troubled borrower extend the maturity for a total of $10 million loans on Nov. 13 by two weeks instead of repaying. Then, on Nov. 27, the debt was extended again.  “If arbitrary extensions are given, what is the point of using blockchain tech other than to watch the goal post move?” one user complained on Maple’s Discord channel.  'Far from perfect'  When asked about the extension, M11 Credit told CoinDesk in an email that it decided to refinance the loans “only after receiving very strong assurances” and “extensive conversations with stakeholders.”  The email added that the “terms are decided at the discretion of the M11 Credit team,” in accordance with Maple’s design.  “Because of this reliance, unfortunately there is no way for outsiders to discern if Auros can service their refinancing or if they are buying time until their inevitable demise,” Fundstrat’s Teng said.  Maple announced Thursday that it will release an overhauled version of the protocol called Maple v2 next week.  The upgrade will include updates in the withdrawal process, an overhaul of the pool cover mechanism and more data on the public pool dashboards, Charlotte Dodds, head of marketing at Maple, said in an email.  “We are far from perfect,” Maple co-founder Joe Flanagan said during the community call Friday. “We are continuing to build for the future.”  First-mover advantage in getting out fast  Pool managers also ought to aim for a diversified portfolio of loans to multiple borrowers to prevent any systemic risk.  The liquidity crunch and plummeting appetite for borrowing after the FTX crash in November created an extremely difficult situation to sustain a balanced loan book. In the past month Maple’s loan book shrank by two-thirds from $260 million, according to data by Token Terminal.  In the wake of FTX’s bankruptcy filing, most borrowers including Nibbio and Folkvang paid down their loans early and pool managers de-risked their loan books, according to an update by Maple on Nov. 17. Meanwhile, M11 decided not to issue new loans to keep cash deposits high.  The prematurely closed loans freed up ample cash in the credit pools, which allowed depositors unnerved by the FTX drama to withdraw funds. (Per Maple’s code, there’s a 10-day waiting period from initiating withdrawals until users can remove any funds.)  In the end, this led to highly concentrated pools with bad debt to distressed borrowers, and mostly depleted cash deposits in the three problematic pools, according to Maple’s credit dashboard.  As of Dec. 9, one of M11’s USDC stablecoin pools has 80% of all loans to one borrower – Orthogonal Trading. This number was 14% as of Aug. 31, below the threshold, according to Sherlock’s statement.  The M11-led pool for wrapped ether (wETH) – another popular cryptocurrency in DeFi – has 55% of all loans outstanding to embattled Auros and Orthogonal. In M11’s permissioned USDC pool, almost half of the outstanding debt is to Auros.  As one Twitter user pointed out, allowing cash withdrawals and depleting pools meant that those who weren’t fast enough will take most of the losses, instead of spreading the losses among many creditors.  Faulty design  Seasoned bankers know that defaults are inevitable in the lending business; that’s why there are built-in safety checks for when it eventually happens. In Maple's case, there may not have been enough precautions taken.  Every credit pool on the platform has a separate fund called “pool cover” that acts like insurance to cover the first losses – or at least a part of it – in the event of a default. To make sure that the pool’s manager acts responsibly and does their best to prevent any defaults, they must lock up assets in the pool cover.  Angry users now question whether the underwriters had enough skin in the game.  M11 Credit has assets worth less than $1.2 million altogether in the pool covers while being responsible for three pools of $74 million of loans and collecting fees for managing.  Any investor can add to this insurance fund by depositing USDC and Maple’s own token, MPL, and earn rewards for taking the risk of first loss.  Still, savvy investors sniffing trouble may move fast to withdraw from the pool cover before a default, depleting the fund to compensate creditors.  At press time, all three M11-managed pools’ pool cover have mostly been depleted, covering only a small percentage of the bad debts.  “Faulty design,” as Fundstrat’s Walter Teng described it.  It’s also problematic that investors in the pool cover deposit a mix of USDC stablecoins and Maple's MPL.  If the funds that are supposed to cover the bad debt are earmarked in the protocol's native token, “the value of this insurance goes lower when the protocol itself is in trouble,” said Kyle Doane, a digital-asset trader at Arca.  MPL dropped 35% last week, which may have contributed to depleting funds to compensate creditors.  What happens now with Maple Finance  The full picture isn’t yet clear, but potential losses amount to tens of millions of dollars.  Based on major creditor Sherlock’s prediction, assets lent to Orthogonal Trading are likely gone for good or could end up in a lengthy litigation.  M11 struck a hopeful tone about restructuring the loans to Auros and salvaging lenders’ money. Alas, hopes are dim following similar struggles at rival uncollateralized lending platform TrueFi, with Blockwater’s loan restructured, only to default a few months later.  Alarming news for lenders is that there’s less than $2 million altogether in the three troubled credit pool’s covers to compensate depositors. Some $1.2 million of that is from M11 Credit.  Maple also mulled seizing another $1.2 million from the Orthogonal-managed credit pool’s insurance fund that the insolvent trading firm posted to boost the fund.  Still, this leaves creditors who were unable to flee in time likely to stomach most of the losses. Two crypto firms, decentralized finance (DeFi) insurance alternative Nexus Mutual and smart contract auditing platform Sherlock, are among the victims, as well as many retail investors.  A similar thing happened at the first default in Maple’s history. In July, when Babel Finance defaulted on a $10 million loan from Orthogonal’s credit pool, creditors booked a $7.9 million loss. However, that meant only a 3.8% haircut because of a much larger pool size.  Because of its design, Maple doesn't stand to lose materially on the defaults. However, the reputational damage and loss of trust may hurt in the long run.  “Maple, the protocol, will likely be fine,” Dustin Teander, analyst at Messari, said. “The key thing that could be done to prevent this is to make credit decisions directly tied to open cash flows and assets instead of general trust.”  “Where Maple’s model could succeed is offering companies a real-time view of collateral and accounting, meaning underwriters can adjust accordingly,” said Timo Lehes, co-founder of Swarm Markets, a regulated DeFi infrastructure provider.  According to Arca’s Doane, two crucial things to improve are “the process of how losses are socialized” and the makeup of assets that are pooled to cover losses.  The coming upgrade on Maple could be an “opportunity to implement some features to better manage risk on the protocol,” Teander said.  Maple's fast-shrinking business might show that such changes can't come soon enough.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/12/maple-finances-54m-of-sour-debt-shows-risks-of-crypto-lending-without-collateral,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94a378f0fce91f5c56b3ac7ffdd4ad56b4ad5865-3668x2438.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

5413073,https://newsbtc.com/?p=512036,1670812304,"Bitcoin Price Stuck In Key Range, Why The Bulls Remain In Action","Bitcoin price failed to clear the $17,300 zone and corrected lower. BTC could find a strong buying interest near $16,900 or $16,700 in the coming sessions. Bitcoin failed to gain pace for a move above $17,300 and $17,450. The price is trading below $17,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $17,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could bounce back if it stays above the $16,900 and $16,700 support levels. Bitcoin Price Remains Supported Bitcoin price was able to clear the $17,000 resistance zone. However, the price failed to gain pace for a move above $17,300 and $17,450. A high was formed near $17,292 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a clear move below the $17,100 and $17,000 levels. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,700 swing low to $17,292 high. Bitcoin price is now trading below $17,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $17,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is now approaching the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,700 swing low to $17,292 high. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $17,050 level. The first major resistance is near the $17,150 zone and the trend line, above which the price may perhaps start a fresh increase. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price could rise towards the $17,300 resistance. The next major resistance is near $17,450, above which the price rise towards the $18,000 zone in the near term. Downside Break in BTC? If bitcoin fails to clear the $17,150 resistance, there could be more losses. An immediate support on the downside is near the $16,900 level. The next major support is near the $16,700 zone or the last swing low. A downside break below the $16,700 support might call a drop towards $16,500. Any more losses might push the price towards the $16,200 zone in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now in the oversold zone. Major Support Levels – $16,900, followed by $16,700. Major Resistance Levels – $17,050, $17,150 and $17,450.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-stuck-17k/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/5413073.jpeg
