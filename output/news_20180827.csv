Technology firm Anquan, consulting giant Deloitte and stock exchange operator Nasdaq will work with the MAS and SGX to develop a Delivery versus Payment (DvP) platform for tokenized assets, including tokenized digital currencies and securities assets, according to a press release.

The work will be a part of Singapore's Project Ubin, the nation's ongoing blockchain initiative.  The companies involved will examine Project Ubin's existing protocols and determine how to leverage them for a DvP platform. The companies will then release a report by November 2018 explaining how to best launch a DvP system.  MAS chief fintech officer Sopnendu Mohanty said in a statement that ""blockchain technology is radically transforming how financial transactions are performed today, and the ability to transact seamlessly across blockchains will open up a world of new business opportunities.""

New marketing models for selling software on a cloud platform require new methods of tracking usage, and a blockchain may be able to efficiently store this information, according to a patent application released last Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The filing outlines how a blockchain would track transactions across a given platform, where each transaction represents an instance of a customer using the company's products.  As the application explains, ""software products have often been licensed on an annual basis. A predetermined fee is paid, and the fee allows usage of the software product for one year.""  However, software products are now likely to be licensed based on either time or a use count. As a result, ""fees are thus based on a number of uses of a software product, and/or a total amount of time the software product was used, over a particular period of time.""  The application goes on to say:  ""The examples record, in a blockchain, a billing rules transaction that identifies usage rules for one or more software instance types for a timeframe. Authorized transactions that identify software instances that have been authorized to execute during the timeframe are also recorded in the blockchain.""  ""Because blocks in the blockchain, for practical purposes, cannot subsequently be modified so long as a sufficiently robust consensus method is used to create the blocks, the blockchain accurately records both the actual software instance usage and the rules under which the usage occurred,"" the application continued.  This type of system could help vendors track usage across different networks without requiring the customer to build new infrastructure to enable tracking, saving both parties time and money, the application noted.

42401854,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2eEu,1535367604,Upside Calling? Bearish Bets on Bitcoin Futures Hit Record Low,"The bearish sentiment in the bitcoin (BTC) futures market hit a record low last week, indicating that the worst of the leading cryptocurrency's price plunge just might be in the past.  The non-commercial futures contracts of bitcoin, traded by large speculators and hedge funds, totaled a net position of -1266 contracts in the week ended Aug. 21 – the lowest on record, according to the data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday.  The futures data indicates that the speculators are the least bearish on BTC since the futures were first listed back in December.  A negative total represents net short positions (bearish bets) and a positive tally indicates net long positions (bullish bets).  The sharp drop in the bearish sentiment, as represented by the steady decline in the net short positions from the high of -1945 seen ten weeks ago to -1266, adds credence to the signs of bearish exhaustion indicated by BTC's defense of $6,000 since mid-June.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,715 on Bitfinex.  Weekly chart  As seen in the above chart, BTC printed lows below $6,000 three times in the last 10 weeks, but the drop was short-lived, that is, all three weekly candles closed (Sunday's close as per UTC) above the psychological mark.  So, it seems safe to say that for BTC, the path of least resistance is on the higher side. The short-term technical charts are also echoing similar sentiments.  Daily chart  The upward sloping 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) indicate a short-term bullish setup. Further, the 50-day MA is about the cross the 100-day MA in a bull-friendly manner.  4-hour chart        The ascending trendline and the rising 50-candle MA and 100-candle MA favor a move higher toward $7,000.  That said, BTC's inability to cross the psychological hurdle of $6,800 over the weekend is a slight cause for concern. However, only a break below the channel support, currently seen at $6,600, would abort the short-term bullish view.  View  The bearish net positions in the bitcoin futures markets hit a record low last week, validating the argument put forward by the technical charts that the cryptocurrency has likely bottomed out around $6,000.  A break above $6,800 (psychological resistance) would bolster the already bullish technical setup and would open the doors to $7,000.  A move below the ascending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart would weaken the bullish case and could yield a drop to $6,230 (Aug. 20 low).

42401819,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2dyB,1535356829,"With Nearly $200 Million on the Line, EOS Is Building a Voting System","There's an account on the EOS blockchain with $35 million worth of tokens in it that no one can touch – and its balance is growing constantly.  At the end of EOS' first 12 months as a live blockchain, this account (called eosio.saving) will be worth close to $192 million, assuming the recent EOS market price of $4.79.  In theory, that money is being set aside to fund all sorts of initiatives that might be beneficial to the EOS community: building out new tech features, conducting security audits, sponsoring meetups, hiring lawyers and lobbyists.  But there's one problem: there's currently no system in place to actually allocate the funds.  The EOS blockchain network was incomplete when it went live in June, with much of the functionality stipulated in the network's ""constitution"" and white paper remaining unbuilt. A key aspect of the EOS protocol was, according to the white paper, ""a defined governance process"" which avoided other blockchains' ""ad hoc, informal, and often controversial governance processes that result in unpredictable outcomes.""  That governance process included the ability for token holders to vote in referenda based on the number of tokens they held. But that process of voting doesn't exist yet, and as such, EOS' governance system has been in flux since launch.  The referendum system, as the voting mechanism is known, seems to be at the heart of the question about where the eosio.saving money will eventually go.  While the white paper doesn't mention referendum voting, the EOS constitution explicitly requires the process for making decisions that affect the entire network, like setting up a system to spend the eosio.savings account funds. Also, in a twist of circular logic, a referendum is needed to ratify the still-provisional constitution itself.  Highlighting what needs to be done to push EOS forward, Daniel Keyes, the co-founder and COO of EOS Nation, a standby block producer, told CoinDesk:  ""There was no referendum system built in at launch, so it's up to us as a community to come together and build that.""  And moving on that advice, Keyes is acting as project manager for a team composed of different block producer candidates, who are working together to build the referendum system.  At the same time, a group known as the EOS Core WPS Working Group is developing the ""worker proposal system"" or WPS, a mechanism described in the EOS white paper that would be used to submit proposals and allow token holders to vote on whether to fund them using tokens from the eosio.saving account.  And already, the working group has published the back-end code for the WPS. Although, as mentioned, the WPS code must be approved in a one-token, one-vote referendum, so the working group is waiting for the referendum system to be put in place.  Spend it  That said, the WPS carries added significance now as the EOS community is split on what to do with the funds.  While some, including members of the working group, would like to see the money used for the benefit of the community, prominent voices are urging the community to scuttle the WPS, remove its source of funding, and perhaps ""burn"" or destroy all the tokens currently held in the eosio.saving account.  Stepping back, the money currently accruing in the savings account is funded by ""inflation,"" which in this context refers to a predictable increase in the total supply of EOS tokens.  Every year, the supply rises by 5 percent, and four-fifths of that increase automatically goes into the account. This process is made possible by a funding mechanism that was coded into the EOS protocol at launch.  With that, the working group suggested in a recent blog post that one million EOS tokens (around $4.8 million) be transferred out of the eosio.saving account and used to fund high-priority projects like the EOS arbitration body – which rules on disputes among token holders – security tests, and an online portal for the WPS.  They also want to set up an ""emergency committee"" to assess project proposals, though they promise to dissolve the committee once the ""emergency"" situation has passed. Proposals approved by the committee will then be put up for votes by token holders (these will be similar to referenda, but have a lower minimum threshold for token holder participation).  According to Orchid Kim, a community builder at the block producer candidate EOSYS and a member of the working group, creating the referendum voting mechanism and allocating the savings to future projects is the only way ""for EOS to live up to its expectations.""  ""We should not rely on Block.one, the block producers or continued volunteerism,"" she continued.  Block.one is the company headed by Dan Larimer that developed the code behind the EOS protocol and conducted the $4 billion ICO, but did not participate in the network launch.  Kim concluded:  ""Bootstrapping any decentralized process is a complicated and daunting task. There are many things to build and fix.""  Burn it  Some community members disagree with Kim, though, arguing that EOS should ditch the WPS and the token inflation that funds it. Most notably, Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer endorsed this view in late July.  At the time, Blumer was responding to a Twitter user's observation that ""even with the wonders of compounding,"" the 1 percent inflation that top block producers – those that verify transactions on the network – divvy up among themselves, might seem insufficient.  As such, the user expected ""whale"" block producers –those that hold a large number of tokens – to go after the larger 4 percent inflation by awarding WPS contracts to themselves.  ""We already saw how the voting system works,"" another user commented on Reddit, referring to the perception that whales vote friendly block producers into the top spots in exchange for a cut of the earnings.  Unlike the referendum system, the voting system for electing block producers is already in place. Because the system is based on the one-token-one-vote approach, many of those both inside and outside the EOS community see accounts with large numbers of tokens as determining the outcomes of votes.  The user then added: ""Getting rid of [the WPS] completely is the only best option.""  Yet Kim said that EOS Core WPS Working Group members ""recognize the fears that some in the community have"" and have put in place numerous checks and balances to safeguard the system.  For example, the working group proposes burning half the tokens in the eosio.saving account on an ongoing basis.  It's likely that the situation will come to a head soon, though, since Keyes told CoinDesk that testing on a minimum viable product for making referendum proposals and conducting votes could begin as soon as next week. The full rollout of the implementation will follow sometime after that.  Much like the debate around the WPS, there remains a continued debate around the EOS constitution, which is currently in ""interim"" status because it has not been ratified through a referendum (again, there is no referendum mechanism available on EOS right now).  As such, Keyes underscored the importance of using the new referendum system to solve EOS' lingering questions, telling CoinDesk:  ""We've got this worker proposal fund collecting a million dollars a day that we can't do anything with, we've got an interim constitution that people are eager to make changes to, so we want to get something to market as soon as possible.""

42401848,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2eCw,1535342429,$31 Million NEX Project Could Be Biggest Casualty of Blockchain Cuts,"Project Infinity, launched in May 2017 by NEX Group (formerly ICAP), could be the biggest bloodletting the distributed ledger sector has seen to date, having cost roughly $31.7 million and hemorrhaged dozens of jobs, former employees say.  Spearheaded by Jenny Knott, former head of NEX Optimisation, the project had a grand vision of bringing the company's entire post-trade services portfolio onto one interoperable blockchain architecture. However, NEX issued a profit warning in October 2017 and just two weeks later Knott left the company.  In a blow for the nascent project, the results statement specifically said the investment in blockchain had reduced margins by 4 percentage points.  Sources say a deal to sell the business to CME for $5.5 billion, announced by NEX boss Michael Spencer in March 2018, was a driver in the cost cutting at the firm.  A former NEX executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told CoinDesk: ""They scaled it back significantly. [Spencer] was not going to invest another penny that wasn't going to get him short-term revenue.""  A blockchain industry source who said his company had been hiring former staff from Infinity, went further, alleging the project had not just been scaled back but had actually been ""canned.""  ""They got rid of Knott and then they quietly canned the project about two months ago; 47 out of 50 staff were fired,"" said the source.  CoinDesk spoke to five former NEX employees, who all confirmed the extent of severe staffing cuts, if not the specific figures. One reported that, in his particular division, nine out of 10 jobs were lost, adding that there were a few divisions like his; another affirmed the figure.  ""The people doing the strategic work mostly all disappeared,"" he said.  In terms of the spiralling cost of the project, one former employee said NEX made a mistake when it decided to make Infinity a ""program,"" which brought added costs and expectations.  ""When you make something into a 'program' it means hiring all these people who plan things and do tons of spreadsheets and so on,"" said the former employee.  ""There was an enormous group of people doing business requirements, managing user groups for opinions. Some of that stuff is necessary, but not at the scale it was done,"" he continued.  Another cost factor related to Traiana, the division of NEX most closely linked to the project, they said, which was doing a upgrade of its infrastructure that ended up on the project's books, thus increasing perceived costs.  It's alive  Still, NEX itself is disputing the claims of former staffers.  Andres Choussy, CEO of Traiana, said Project Infinity had absolutely not been shelved. On the contrary, he said it has entered the execution stage in a live environment with blockchain builder Axoni. However, he admitted the project had been scaled back.  ""[Infinity] had a vision; the vision is a sound vision which we still would love to try and get to one day. But we are being realistic,"" said Choussy.  ""You see this from a lot of the DLT initiatives, moving the market into something completely new is not an easy task, so what we have done is focused our efforts into specific applications, specific use cases that really are plan-driven,"" he said.  NEX could not comment on the number of jobs shed at the project, but confirmed the number of staff involved had been reduced. No specific numbers were provided by the company.  Choussy said the DLT part of the project had been narrowed down to focus on post-trade FX.  Indeed, NEX was a returning investor in the recently announced Series A funding round in Axoni, which is said to be building ""a massive FX post-trade data network.""  NEX is also an investor in DLT provider Digital Asset and was one of the early members of the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) project, although a source involved in USC said they have fallen out of communication with the group.  Blockchain blues  A former engineer on the project painted a picture of the tough challenge to meet the use case requirements with DLT, followed by a missed opportunity to get a product out the door.  Axoni was selected at the outset because it provided a unique partitioning capability that few of the other vendors out of the box did, said the former NEX engineer. Throughput had been an issue to begin with but transaction processing speeded up as the project evolved, he said.  In addition to the work done with Axoni, the engineer said a Hyperledger implementation was built which achieved privacy partitioning by creating different networks, as well as an internally constructed ledger, ""basically a glorified replication scheme, but with cryptographic proofs and enforced privacy controls"" which could handle very high throughputs.  ""We were really right at the razor's edge of getting this stuff out the door when there was a just a massive set of layoffs and the entire team in London was let go,"" he said, adding:  ""The politics around the situation changed, also the company was preparing to try to make things look good for the CME acquisition.""  Machine learning  Infinity's DLT architecture was to anchor and immortalize an extremely rich data set coming from multiple parties – brokers, banks, buy-side – which would serve as a backbone for a one-stop financial cloud offering machine learning and AI as a service on top.  In the end, this became a stinging irony. An anecdote recounted by one former employee told how the day after the entire machine learning team was laid off, Spencer returned from Davos enthused about machine learning and AI and asking what NEX was doing in that area.  A proposal for a firm-wide AI strategy was even put together, said the ex-staffer.  Opinion seems to be divided about how well the remains of Project Infinity's blockchain might fair once NEX becomes the property of U.S. exchange giant CME. The former NEX technology team member said the original vision of an all-purpose post-trade ledger with data analytics platform still has great value and may even be the ""crown jewels"" in CME's eyes.  However, the former executive was doubtful about Infinity's progress, saying, ""CME have got their own distributed ledger strategy.""  CME Group declined to comment when reached.
