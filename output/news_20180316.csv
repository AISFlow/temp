And much like gold, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal conjectures that the cryptocurrency is destined to be a store of value rather than a means of payment.  ""It's like bars of gold in a vault that never move,"" he told a CNBC¬†reporter during a conversation at the Economic Club of New York last week, adding:  ""It's sort of hedge of sorts against the whole world falling apart.""  He also struck a bullish tone on bitcoin in particular ‚Äì versus other cryptocurrencies ‚Äì suggesting that the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization will maintain its position.  ""There will be one online equivalent to gold,"" he reportedly claimed, ""and the one you'd bet on would be the biggest.""  Despite his prediction, Thiel did not express complete confidence in bitcoin, and speculated that there is a 50 to 80 percent chance that it will have no value in the future. Nonetheless, he also noted that on the flip side, there is a 20 to 50 percent chance that it will increase in value.  ""Probability weighted, it's good,"" he told CNBC.  Thiel's investments suggest he may be even more bullish on bitcoin than he lets on. As previously reported by CoinDesk in January, Founders Fund, of which Thiel is the co-founder, recently purchased between $15 million to $20 million worth of bitcoin across several of its funds.  He has also publicly stated that he believes critics are ""underestimating"" the cryptocurrency.

Additionally, Kodak received 50,000 shares of WENN common stock, which the report said was worth $1.25 million.  Further, Kodak is set to receive 3 million KODAKCoins following the completion of the yet-to-be-finished initial coin offering, which, as reported previously, was delayed (though a private pre-sale is said to be in progress). Those tokens will be valued one year after they are received, though the total assessed value will not exceed¬†$3 million, according to the filing.  The payments will count as a form of upfront royalties, Kodak said, explaining in the filing:  ""The cash, deemed value of the WENN stock, and deemed value of the Tokens serve as an advance royalty to be credited against sales-based royalties in the future ‚Ä¶ The advance royalty is non-refundable. No future sales-based royalty payment will be due until the advance royalty has been depleted.""  Going forward, Kodak will receive 3 percent of any tokens issued by WENN if the total number of coins is greater than 100 million, according to the report.  In early February, the KODAKCoin team said the ICO was ""moving full-speed ahead,"" even though¬†""in light of the increased worldwide regulatory interest in ICOs,"" the project's backers were moving to ascertain the token sale's compliance with relevant regulations.

42380476,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8e4f9,1521219615,Security Settles on Ethereum in Blockchain Post-Trade First,"In a first-of-a-kind transaction happening Friday, all it takes to switch from the old world of centralized clearing houses to the frontier of decentralized blockchains is the press of a button.  A company called Chartered Opus is issuing two separate structured notes. Both notes were created using ResonanceX, an investing platform founded by¬†Guillaume Chatain, a former managing director at JPMorgan Chase. The first note will be settled the old-fashioned way, on Clearstream, the European clearing house.  But the second, otherwise identical note will be registered, cleared and settled on the public ethereum blockchain. All the issuer has to do to change this parameter is select a different option from the drop-down menu on ResonanceX's dashboard.  The parallel issuance will test the idea, on an apples-to-apples basis, that blockchain offers a less expensive way to clear and settle financial instruments. And if that proves true, ResonanceX will allow future issuers to pick one over the other as easily as if they were changing an order on Amazon.  At stake is more than just the business model of Clearstream, but of centralized clearing houses around the the world.  Nevertheless, in interview with CoinDesk, Chatain balked at the idea that anyone was necessarily being disintermediated. Instead, he said his product simply changes the rules of the game.  ""The current system is working very well, it's a well-oiled machine,"" said Chatain, who previously worked with JPMorgan's private risk management. ""But you have so many intermediaries that it takes time and it's not necessarily the cheapest way to do things."" He added:  ""I believe blockchain can fix that.""  In spite of removing more than a couple intermediaries in today's issuance, the structured product was far from simple.  First of all, it's important to note that the private placement note, the value of which is not being disclosed, was not denominated in ether, the native token of ethereum.  Instead, British pounds were ""tokenized,"" using blockchain startup Nivaura's technology, meaning tokens representing pounds were issued to the investors and the cash itself was¬†stored in accounts at Bank of New York Mellon and the U.K.'s Metro Bank. Private key custody for the blockchain clearing and settlement was provided using Nivaura's custody permissions.  The investment itself is linked to the FTSE 100 index and is a principal protected note. That means that if the FTSE is up 2.5 percent when the note matures in two months, the investors get their principal back plus a return equivalent to 13 percent per year. If the index does not increase 2.5 percent, the investors still get their principal back, but no return.  While the note was executed on the public ethereum blockchain, Nivaura hopes to add new options to its dropdown menu, including the bitcoin blockchain, zcash, Quorum, and Chain.  ""It's quite exciting that you can now leverage any clearing system, and it's legally enforceable on even a public blockchain,"" said Avtar Sehra, founder and CEO of Nivaura, whose technology was used last year to issue an ethereum bond.  Sehha says it's unclear with the note being issued Friday exactly how much will be saved on the overall cost of the transaction. But he added that in the ethereum bond last year the final cost was reduced from an estimated 40,000 pounds to about 50 pounds, ""which is pretty awesome,"" he said.  Further, law firm Allen & Overy helped ensure the note was compliant, the London-based investment services firm Marex Solutions provided issuance services, helping fix and execute the note within a ""sandbox"" created by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  As revealed for the first time to CoinDesk, on March 14, Nivaura also received full regulatory approval from the FCA that removed some restrictions and allows the company to operate commercially. Nivaura charges per transaction for what it considers ""utility"" services for other platforms to issue and administer financial instruments.  For future instruments using the ResonanceX platform, the composition of the note itself and each of the participants can be customized using the same drop-down menu that lets users toggle between ethereum and centralized settlement systems.  In interview with CoinDesk, the CEO of Marex Solutions, Nilesh Jethwa, said his company has been offering structured notes using the ""traditional approach"", but that he sees this successful real-world use of the ethereum blockchain as a cheaper, faster, more transparent alternative.  Jethwa said:  ""We see blockchain as the future of this product.""  However, there is still a long way to go before the trillions of dollars transacted on central clearing houses around the world can move to ethereum, or any other blockchain.  Nivaura CEO Sehra says the biggest limit of the current technology is its interaction with fiat currency, which relies on the services of traditional financial institutions.  ""This is the only part of the inefficiency that we've got at the moment,"" said Sehra.  A new kind of competition  Participants in today's issuance on the ethereum blockchain are quick to point out their technology does not make anyone irrelevant.  Rather than speak of cutting out the middlemen, Chatain and Sehra both focus on a shift in the way financial infrastructure providers and startups compete.  Clearstream parent company Deutsche B√∂rse Group is already exploring blockchain along three different use cases and the U.S. Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is expected to launch a live version of its Trade Information Warehouse using venture-backed Axoni's technology at its core.  From the startup side, traditional investment firm Solidum has already side-stepped Euroclear by issuing a reinsurance note using the open-source Multichain blockchain. And Axoni has raised capital from Citi, Wells Fargo and Nex Group (formerly ICAP), and is targeting a number of use cases.  In a year expected to be filled with live enterprise blockchain launches, Chaitain says the Marex note is most significant, not because it was done without a central clearing house, but because it's cheaper.  He concluded:  ""Assuming clients and banks will be willing to adopt the technology, it's something that could work and be commercially viable already.""

Introduced in January,¬†LBChain¬†is intended to assist both Lithuanian and international companies in acquiring knowledge of the blockchain and in conducting blockchain-focused research.  Bank of Lithuania said at that time that the project would ""provide a technical platform and consultations on applicable regulations"" to selected companies. The institution also indicated that the project would be financed by EU funds.  ""Software developers have already shown considerable interest in LBChain,"" said Marius Jurgilas, a member of the Bank of Lithuania board, in an announcement.  He further commented:  ""Created by a financial regulator, it is one of the first platforms of its kind, offering a unique chance for businesses to trial and implement their state-of-the-art fintech innovations to bring benefits to both customers and the financial system.""  The project is part of a broader attempt to create a ""fintech-conducive regulatory and supervisory ecosystem, as well as innovation fostering in the financial sector,"" according to the announcement.  Although the central bank said in January that it expected the platform to launch in 2019, it now indicates that that the implementation stage of the project is expected to be underway this summer.  Lithuania's central bank has involved itself in the blockchain space since the autumn of 2017, when it first issued initial coin offering (ICO)¬†guidance.

The 2018 Joint Economic Report ‚Äì an assessment of the nation‚Äôs economic status and recommendations for the upcoming year ‚Äì notably includes an entire section dedicated to cryptocurrencies and blockchain. This is the first known instance of the technology being mentioned in such a substantial way in the annual publication, which is produced by¬†Congress' Joint Economic Committee and draws on members from both the House of Representatives and the Senate.  The comprehensive report, dated March 13, tracks cryptocurrencies' rise to prominence, noting that bitcoin and ethereum, in particular, saw significant price growth, outpacing both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500.  The report's recommendations are, perhaps, the most notable aspect of the release, stating that blockchain technology can serve as a potential tool for fighting cybercrimes and protect both the nation's economy and its infrastructure. It's this area of application, the report notes, that should be a priority for lawmakers and regulators.  The report's authors recommend that lawmakers and the public become more familiar with both cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology, due to its ""wide range of applications in the future.""  It goes on to argue:  ""Policymakers, regulators, and entrepreneurs should continue to work together to ensure developers can deploy these new blockchain technologies quickly and in a manner that protects Americans from fraud, theft, and abuse, while ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.""  It adds that ""regulators should continue to coordinate among each other to guarantee coherent policy frameworks, definitions, and jurisdiction,"" concluding that government agencies ""at all levels should consider and examine new uses for this technology.""  The report is just the latest sign that the U.S. government is taking the subject of blockchain and cryptocurrencies seriously.

The total value of all cryptocurrencies fell to $316 billion on Thursday ‚Äì down 61.9 percent from the record high of $830 billion set in January, according to data source CoinMarketCap. As of writing, the total market cap stands at $327 billion.  The sell-off in bitcoin appears to have dragged the entire crypto universe down with it. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization neared the $10,000 mark on Monday before falling to a one-month low below $7,700 ‚Äì a decline largely in line with the bearish technical setup, although¬†Google's decision to ban cryptocurrency-related ads may have added fuel to the fire.  Week-on-week, BTC has registered an 11.9 percent drop. Meanwhile, other heavyweights like ether (ETH), Ripple's XRP and litecoin (LTC) also suffered double-digit losses.  Despite the broad-based risk aversion in the markets over the last seven days, Binance Coin rose 9.26 percent to become the biggest gainer among the top 25 cryptos as per market value.

The news garnered lots of attention from the investor community.  BNB clocked a seven-week high of BTC 0.001215 on Tuesday and was last seen changing hands at BTC 0.001097 on Binance. BNB's USD exchange rate rose to $11.00 on Wednesday, as per CoinMarketCap ‚Äì the highest since Feb. 28. Notably, total trading volume more than doubled on a weekly basis.  The sharp rise in trading volume, increased investor interest, and positive news flow indicates the rally is here to stay. The daily chart of BNB/BTC shows falling wedge reversal (bullish pattern). So, in the near-term, BNB will likely make it to the winner's list more often.

Meanwhile, on March 13, it also entered into a partnership with LogSafer¬†‚Äì leading supply chain risk management and a major logistics insurance platform in China.  The positive news flow seems to have lifted the price ofVeChain's VEN token by 3 percent week-on-week.

In an announcement from the¬†New York State Public Service Commission on Thursday, its chair, John B. Rhodes,¬†said¬†that upstate municipal power authorities are allowed to charge higher electricity use for cryptocurrency mining businesses starting from March.  The ruling states:  ""Commission will allow municipal power authorities to create a new tariff focusing on high-density load customers that do not qualify for economic development assistance and have a maximum demand exceeding 300 kW and a load density that exceeds 250 kWh per square foot per year, a usage amount far higher than traditional commercial customers.""  The decision comes as a result of a petition filed by the New York Municipal Power Agency (NYMPA), a body consisting of 36 municipal power authorities in New York state, raising concerns that crypto mining businesses would increase the utility bills of local residents while not bringing enough economic value in return.  According to the announcement, the NYMPA said that, while some mining firms in the area make up for 33 percent of the municipal utility load, they ""have few associated jobs, and make little to no capital investment in the local community.""  Cryptocurrency mining is an energy-intensive process that generates tokens and¬†validates transactions on a blockchain by running processor-intensive computations, normally using specialized chips.  The decision comes at a time when disputes over cryptocurrency mining farms in New York State have already been seen in public debates.  As reported by CoinDesk, the Plattsburgh city, an area also covered by the NYMPA, is currently weighing a decision that could halt new bitcoin mining operations in the area for 18 months, citing similar power consumption concerns.

42380455,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8e4Q3,1521201651,Airdrop Attack? Monero Fork Condemned as Privacy Threat,"Giving away free crypto might not be as easy as it sounds.  By gifting new assets to existing cryptocurrency users, so-called ""airdrops"" are proving explosive, enabling the sudden creation of massive amounts of value almost overnight. But as the method is perhaps being hastily adapted, unexpected hazards are beginning to emerge.  Planning to launch on April 30, monerov is one such example. Seeking¬†to correct what it sees as an error in monero's value proposition, it aims to offer a variation on the software behind the 11th-largest cryptocurrency that alters the rate at which coins are created.  But there's a catch. While monerov activates¬†like all forks (by copying another crypto's codebase), its design threatens to undermine one of the core privacy mechanisms of the protocol it's splitting from. In short,¬†because of the way it impacts monero's privacy features, a single data leak could cause a chain reaction, one that potentially damages its future transactions.  Given the risks to the original blockchain, the idea¬†has been met with an icy reception.  Researchers affiliated with monero are now speaking out, seeking to brand the giveaway, in which monero holders would receive free money, an attack.  ‚ÄúForking an existing blockchain without taking into account the effects is a reckless disregard for user privacy with no real benefits,‚Äù a cryptographer at the Monero Research Lab, who goes by the pseudonym ""Sarang Noether,"" flatly told CoinDesk.  That said, the airdrop only threatens one aspect of monero‚Äôs privacy model ‚Äì other devices, that conceal transaction quantities as well as destination addresses, would be unaffected.¬†But, there are concerns that it could set a precedent for further airdrops in the future.  As monero core developer ""binaryFate"" told CoinDesk:  ‚ÄúIt is much easier to bootstrap a community by distributing ‚Äòfree‚Äô tokens to an existing user base than starting from a genesis block and convincing new users to join based solely on the merit of your technology.‚Äù  What actually is an airdrop?  A newly popular method for distributing new cryptocurrency, it's notable that the attack vector exposed by monerov hinges on the very process of airdrops.  Rather than using code to calibrate a new blockchain, an increasing number of forks are choosing to inherit the former chain, allocating a time for when the the codebase will split off and continue.  ‚ÄúOne must distinguish forking a codebase and forking a blockchain,‚Äù binaryFate said.  Typically, at a predetermined ""block height,"" a numbered block in the chain, the new cryptocurrency will create a ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù of who owns what on the former chain.  This information is then replicated onto the new blockchain, giving users two wallets, and potentially, a crypto stash that has doubled in quantity.  On the bitcoin blockchain, participating in an airdrop can have privacy faults of its own. As highlighted by author Andreas Antonopoulos, claiming airdropped coins with a bitcoin key pair can risk linking an entire transaction history, even if a bitcoin user has been diligent.  The technique can also cause more systemic problems, such as the well-known ""replay attack"" ‚Äì in the wake of a fork, there‚Äôs a risk that money spent on one blockchain will also transact on the other chain, sacrificing the integrity of the ledger.  Linking key images  But this particular attack is specific to monero. To achieve anonymized transactions, monero relies on three mechanisms: stealth addresses, ring signatures and ring confidential transactions.  Together, these code functions form a robust privacy model, as stealth addresses protect the identity of a user that receives funds, ring signatures protect the sender and ring confidential transactions obscure the quantities that are being sent in a transaction.  The fork attack impacts only one of these devices, the ring signatures.  In ring signatures, transaction outputs, or the information about what is being sent, is aggregated into a ‚Äúring‚Äù that obscures information by mixing it up with the randomly selected transaction outputs of other monero users.  However, this presents a problem: ‚ÄúYou never know if an output is actually spent or not,‚Äù binaryFate explained.  Because transaction outputs are hidden, nodes cannot verify that an exchange took place, meaning that a malicious user could spend the same XMR repeatedly.  To correct this, monero relies on what is called a ‚Äúkey image,‚Äù which is a proof that one piece of data within the ring signature is genuine. But while this remains privacy preserving as a one-use item on a single blockchain, if a key image is repeated, it can expose the original transaction output.  ‚ÄúThis defeats the point of using ring signatures at all for that particular output,‚Äù binaryFate said.  But there‚Äôs a further risk arising from the airdrop, as well.  Because old transactions are sometimes included (a ‚Äúdecoy‚Äù to further secure the privacy of ring signatures), the exposed transaction could have an unpredictable impact across the monero blockchain, damaging the privacy of multiple users as an increasing number of fragments of a ring are revealed.  And, due to the nature of the attack, the deanonymization process would happen exponentially.  Sarang explained:  ‚ÄúIf a substantial fraction of monero users claimed funds, the statistical likelihood that real inputs could be identified begins to increase.‚Äù  Mitigation measures  However, Sarang continued, to pose a serious risk, a large portion of monero users would need to participate in the airdrop. So, the fix is fairly simple: users could stay away from forks in which their private keys might be reused.  Toward this, monero developers and community members are coordinating to warn others of the risks posed by the upcoming airdrop.  ‚ÄúThere is a social, voluntary-based component to the general mitigation: educate monero users to protect themselves,‚Äù binaryFate told CoinDesk.  However, warning users away from a free crypto can be a hard sell, and the monerov Twitter and Telegram groups have a growing numbers of users.  ‚ÄúThe promise of free money is compelling. If someone mailed me an envelope of cash, it would be tempting to keep it,‚Äù Sarang admitted.  Against this, there's two major steps that the monero team has taken. First, because the attack effectively decreases the ring size by revealing certain outputs, monero will increase the ring size in response.  Additionally, monero has coded up a mitigation that protects the exposure of outputs by insuring that key images are contained to a single ring signature. By deploying this, which Sarang described as ""the safest approach,"" data leaks can be avoided.  Monerov¬†has said it is researching privacy protection for the upcoming fork, however, it is unclear whether the team intends to deploy the fixes recommended by the monero core team.  In an email to CoinDesk, monerov's developers said they intend to raise the size of its ring signatures and deploy a ‚Äútime gap‚Äù between the snapshot and mainnet release, to protect against information exposure.  However, the coordination necessary to stave off the attack between the two groups has been limited.  Speaking in an online chat, monero developer ""moneromooo"" warned that if the airdrop fails to implement the recommended fixes alongside monerov's own methods, ""It appears to be not a mitigation, but a worsening.""  As such, speculation is spreading among monero developers as to whether the airdrop is a deliberate, sophisticated attack.  BinaryFate told CoinDesk:  ""It doesn't really matter whether the attack is malicious or simply a greedy money grab, the threat is the same anyway.""

42380467,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8e4bN,1521196210,Israel Bars Crypto Firms from Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Indices,"Israel's securities regulator has said that cryptocurrency-related firms may not be listed on the¬†Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) indices.  According to an announcement from the¬†Israel Securities Authority (ISA) on Wednesday, the watchdog¬†said it will bar the entry of public companies who mainly hold, invest in or mine cryptocurrencies from the indices, citing high volatility as a risk for passive investors whose portfolios track the indices.  Crypto-asset firms can still be traded on the exchange itself, however.  The ISA said the the move comes after it had noted significant stock price swing upon announcements of public companies' involvement in cryptocurrencies.  The authority said:  ""In some cases, the companies' reports (about cryptocurrency) led to a sharp rise in the share prices, even before they have real activities. The extreme volatility of trading in cryptocurrencies is also reflected in the trading in these companies, whose value rises and falls sharply, sometimes for no apparent reason.""  As such, the ISA indicated that the new rule is intended to ensure that passive investors will not be exposed to these public companies unless they actively choose to. The restriction will last for one year initially, subject to further examination at a later date.  The new policy also comes as a result of months-long consideration over possible measures to limit the effect of firms' blockchain pivots on public stocks and stock investors. The topic first emerged in December of last year, when the authority's chief proposed banning public companies on TASE from trading cryptocurrencies.  Elsewhere in the announcement, the ISA also noted that an interim examination report on initial coin offerings (ICOs) is expected to be published in coming days, following the establishment of a committee last August to provide recommendations for oversight of token-based fundraising activities.  Through a separate notice the same day, the ISA also warned the public on the risks of investing in ICOs, as they issue misleading or fraudulent promises of high investment returns. It further highlighted that ICOs ""may be considered as a public offering of securities,"" which, the agency stated, must be registered with Israel's Securities Law.

42380473,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8e4dt,1521194405,"Bitcoin May See Relief Rally, But Bottom Still Elusive","Bitcoin (BTC) may see a corrective rally following losses this week, but it's still too early to call a bottom, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency has spent a better part of the last 24 hours trading in a roughly sideways manner in the narrow range of $7,900‚Äì$8,400, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). As of writing, the BPI is seen at $8,152. Meanwhile, the global average price, as calculated by CoinMarketCap, stands at $8,169 ‚Äì up 0.15 percent in the last 24 hours.  The consolidation may have brought a little to the battered bulls and suggests a temporary low is in place at $7,676. Further, the shorter duration technical charts (prices as per Bitfinex) show potential for a relief rally.  1-hour chart  Bitcoin has created a bull flag pattern on the hourly chart ‚Äì a continuation pattern ‚Äì meaning an upside break to above $8,370 would signal a continuation of the rally from $7,665 (Wednesday's low) and open the doors for $9,170 (target as per the measured height method).  The relative strength index (RSI) also shows a bull flag pattern, adding credence to the bullish setup on the price chart.  However, the 50-hour MA (moving average), 100-hour MA, and 200-hour MA are still all bear biased (sloping downwards), so the rally will likely be short-lived.  Further, on the way towards $9,170, BTC will face stiff resistance around $8,710 (bear flag support).  Daily chart  The daily chart also shows that the 5-day MA and 10-day MA are trending lower in favor of the bears. So, the primary trend is bearish.  That said, a close today (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA at $8,964, currently, would mark a positive follow-through to yesterday's long-tailed doji candle, signaling a short-term bottom is in place at around $7,665.  View  A corrective rally to $9,000‚Äì$9,170 is likely as per the setup on the hourly chart.  A close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA would signal the sell-off from the recent high of $11,700 has ended, although a sustained rally to $10,000 and above looks likely only after the 10-day MA has bottomed out.  In the¬†larger scheme of things, only a close above $11,700 would invalidate the bearish set up on the weekly chart and signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  Bearish scenario: Repeated failure to hold above $8,342 (last Friday's doji candle low) could yield a sell-off to $7,000. Note that bitcoin has already failed twice in the last 24 hours to keep gains above $8,342.

42380454,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8e4On,1521190846,Singapore Central Bank Touts Blockchain for Payments,"The chief of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state's de facto central bank, has spoken of blockchain's potential in international payments.  During a speech on Thursday at a financial industry event, MAS managing director¬†Ravi Menon doubled down on his belief that one of the ""strongest"" use cases for crypto tokens is to¬†facilitate cross-border settlements.  Menon said:  ""This is the challenge that Singapore‚Äôs Project Ubin has set itself to solve: to use blockchain technology to enable entities across jurisdictions to make payments to one another.""  He continued to say that, following two ""successful"" proofs-of-concept, MAS has partnered with the Bank of Canada ""to test and develop a cross-border solution using crypto tokens issued by the two central banks.""  The comments follow Menon's earlier remarks that, while he thinks crypto tokens are not entitled to be called currencies given a lack of payment, storage and accounting features, he believes ""we can never say never"" that they will not become a currency in the future.  That said, he also raised concerns during the latest speech over the growing risks associated with the emerging fiscal technology, saying that MAS has been increasingly watching areas such as fundraising, money laundering and affects on financial stability.  In particular, on the investor-protection front, Menon reiterated MAS's previously reported initial coin offering (ICO) guidance, cautioning that certain tokens could be regulated as securities.  He said:  ""Investor protection is another immediate concern arising from the crypto mania. Where the crypto tokens represent ownership or a security interest over an issuer‚Äôs assets or any property, or a debt owed by the issuer, they may be regarded as securities under the Securities and Futures Act.""  Under this rule, initial coin offering issuers must meet securities rules before launching token sales. Further, secondary markets that facilitate trading of ICO tokens should also be registered and approved by the MAS, according to Menon.  And yet, the¬†managing director also stated that MAS does not wish to stifle innovation around blockchain technology by introducing burdensome regulation, although he conceded that striking the right balance remains a challenge to the authority.

42380448,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8e4Jl,1521187233,"So Long ICOs, Hello Airdrops: The Free Token Giveaway Craze Is Here","Imagine getting $1,000 just for joining a newsletter.  Well, that's effectively what happened for those that subscribed to Onchain's mailing list early on in the project's lifecycle. The company, which is building a distributed network designed to connect real-world institutions, gave 1,000 of its ""ONT"" crypto tokens to people who signed up to receive its emails prior to a certain date.  Those crypto tokens were distributed earlier this month and are now trading for a little over $1 per coin, according to CoinMarketCap. As you may have noticed, there was no ""sale"" involved.  ""Ontology just raised a private round and then didn‚Äôt need to do a [public] crowdsale, so they just airdropped to eager NEO hodlers,"" Keld van Schreven, a partner at blockchain investment company Kryptonite1, told CoinDesk.  Van Schreven's comment speaks to a broader trend among token issuers. More are raising the money they need in private initial coin offerings (ICOs) and then skipping the public sale for what's being called an airdrop. Effectively, these are just token giveaways to broader interested community members  Justin Schmidt of Translunar VC told CoinDesk:  ""As a non-accredited investor, it is proving to be very difficult to find public sales to participate in until the tokens are traded on an exchange.""  Whereas the idea around public sales was that the people who buy in are those that understand the platform's value and will promote the token, airdrops look to accomplish a similar goal, yet expecting that if people hold tokens, they'll be interested in seeing the network, and the token's price, grow and promote the platform just the same.  An internet search for ""airdrops"" or ""free tokens"" yields lots of websites, subreddits and Telegram channels that people can follow to gather up crypto tokens. And there's even a Pokemon Go imitator under development that would allow companies to distribute free tokens to people playing an augmented reality game.  But these airdrops might not only be about building a community, they likely also have something to do with an uncertain regulatory environment.  For instance, in the U.S., many ICO issuers and investors have become convinced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will eventually declare that all crypto tokens are securities and as such,¬†need to be registered under cumbersome laws.  But even outside the U.S., completing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance for public sales takes a substantial amount of work and time.  Speaking to token issuers stepping away from public sales, Minhui¬†Chen, a partner at Global Blockchain Innovative Capital (GBIC) told CoinDesk, ""Raising money from private sales is so easy.""  Tokens, away!  According to Jun Hasegawa, CEO of Omise, the company pioneered the airdrop concept on ethereum in August last year, after announcing it would airdrop its ""OMG"" tokens to every wallet that held more than 0.1 ETH.  Omise decided to conduct an airdrop to raise awareness about the project, but Hasegawa spoke to the broader benefits of the distribution model, writing in an email to CoinDesk ‚Äî via a spokesperson, ""The real value of ethereum projects doing airdrops to all ETH holders is that it's a crypto economic mechanism designed to incentivize ethereum project communities to maintain alignment with the entire ethereum community.""  The OMG token's price has since been volatile (many crypto tokens are), but it has trended up overall.  Yet because of the ease to airdrop, many, including¬†van Schreven, think crypto wallets are starting to feel ""like spam in email.""  Indeed, in China, many people refer to these offerings as ""candy,"" Chen said, continuing:  ""Low-quality projects are taking advantage of airdrops to make a fake community.""  And Schmidt echoed that, saying, ""Not having the choice to decline these airdrops can, in my opinion, cause some issues in the future.""  As such, many investors, who nonetheless support the larger phenomenon also believe the mechanism could be used more effectively.  Brayton¬†Williams of Boost VC, a fund that favors crypto projects with a strong focus on community, thinks issuers could do a better job of targeting with airdrops. For example, he'd like to see issuers focus airdrops on people based on geography, demographics, etc. to cultivate the best market for the future platform.  Williams told CoinDesk:  ""Airdrops combine the best of paid referral programs with stock options. Potential users get paid for joining or using the network and have the potential upside if the network increases in value.""  Some crypto companies are taking heed of this advice.  Swarm, a blockchain for tokenizing private equity, just announced a few airdrop promotions, two of which encourage referrals, although by far the largest token sale on the platform is one that just drops tokens to existing cryptocurrency holders.  And Earn.com (formerly 21.co) has offered a standalone product for startups to distribute tokens directly to its members since the end of January.¬†Startups that want access to Earn.com members pay small amounts of bitcoin to get users to sign up. But many are willing to pay a fee since the company validates every member, linking a wallet to one distinct person.  ""The unique thing that Earn.com offers really is the validation side of things,"" Dave Bean, from Earn.com's sales team, told CoinDesk.  He added that while many platforms that allow token issuers to airdrop might have a lot of email addresses, many individuals could be gaming the system by signing up multiple times with different addresses.  Firewall USA  That said, issuers in the U.S. are still skittish about doing airdrops to promote platforms.  Stream, a blockchain-based video streaming platform, has delayed its airdrop indefinitely¬†because of concern that airdrops could also be in violation of securities law.  ""We can't be sure,"" said Todd Kornfeld, counsel at the law firm Pepper Hamilton LLP, pointing to SEC actions from 1999 which targeted companies giving away free traditional equity.  ""Perhaps the SEC thought there was some kind of quid pro quo in giving those securities away and that resulted in a benefit to the issuer,"" Kornfeldt said. ""And that fact pattern is similar to the fact pattern of an airdrop.""  This will definitely affect token issuers since the U.S. is the largest market both for investment and technology users.  But until the regulatory environment in the U.S. becomes more clear, token issuers may experience far less hindrance in the rest of the world.  Although some aren't letting the regulatory environment hold them back. For instance, Onchain isn't done using airdrops to promote its platform.  ""The next community reward opportunity will be for active participation in Ontology after the release of the mainnet in Q2 2018,"" Daniel Assab, a spokesperson for the company, said. ""It won‚Äôt be for anything like a newsletter subscription, but no further details for now.""  Still many advise against airdrops for now.  According to Chen, ""We advise [token issuers]: Don't do airdrops. Please do public sales.""  In his mind, public sales actually engender a more authentic community. In other words, it brings in people¬†who understand the project well enough that they're likely to actually hold some of the tokens they buy to use in the future, instead of just dumping them on price rises.  Schmidt tends to agree, but hedges saying:  ""It's very early to see how this trend will result, but I do believe you need the actual users to have access to the tokens.""

42401291,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWWL,1521180109,Crypto Escapes Scrutiny at Annual China Investor Event,"Cryptocurrencies were not brought up for criticism at an annual Chinese consumer protection event, despite rumors to the effect.  Multiple sources had shared rumors with CoinDesk in early March that major policy changes would be announced on Mar. 15 night during a national TV program to curb cryptocurrency activities in China, such as trading and disguised initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The annual show is hosted by China Central Television, the country's official broadcast mouthpiece, in celebration of the World Consumer Rights Day, during which questionable company conducts are exposed for the sake of public safety.  It is further co-hosted by major Chinese government agencies including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology,¬†Ministry of Public Security,¬†Supreme People's Court and¬†Supreme People's Procuratorate.  The rumors had suggested that the program would expose initial coin offerings that still exist in China, some of which may operate so that certain people with access to ICOs would act as agents to invest on behalf of other Chinese investors.  ""Everyone was waiting to see what would happen during the night,"" one source commented.  Indeed, the rumors appeared to have sparked uncertainty within the cryptocurrency community in China, which had already started circulating a leaked rehearsal list of the program prior to the event in a¬†bid to spread an assurance that no discussion of ICOs was on the list.  In the event, the absence of cryptocurrency or ICO related topics promptly killed the talk of crypto scrutiny for now, yet it still remains to be seen whether China will move to enforce further regulatory measures on cryptocurrency activities, following its existing oversight efforts.  As reported before, while China's police force has been expanding its internet monitoring work to cover overseas cryptocurrency activities, regulators have also moved to reportedly block¬†the domestic accounts of cryptocurrency exchanges on social media channels.

42401321,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcSWeD,1521172804,If Crypto Exchanges and ICO Teams Only Had a Brain...,"David Silver is the founder of Silver Miller, a plaintiffs' law firm that represents investors in cases against cryptocurrency exchanges and investment offerings. The views expressed here are his alone.  You can reach him at DSilver@SilverMillerLaw.com or @dcsilver on Twitter.      While there are many different interpretations of The Wizard of Oz, I see a new one as it relates to the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain.  Dorothy represents the early adopters and believers. The Tin Man represents the Baby Boomer generation, designed for a different era, and slowly getting rusty. The Cowardly Lion represents both the economically depressed working man, weighed down with debt and mortgages, and a monetary system clinging to the industrial economy and hesitant to change.  And the Scarecrow . . . well, I‚Äôll get to him in a minute.  But as Dorothy sings, ‚Äúsomewhere over the rainbow‚Äù there is a better place, and for us that is the blockchain:  Before you can get there, though, you have to go through the Wizard in Oz. And in this parable, the Wizard is the almighty government. In a slight departure from L. Frank Baum's tale, this Wizard is every bit as powerful as he appears. But he's still nothing to be scared of, as long as you're doing the right thing.  Because the obstacles that exist in Oz are a fabrication ‚Äì an unnecessary layer of contradiction. Dorothy and her companions simply needed to look inward, and all the traits they needed to overcome the obstacles holding them back were inside them all along.  The same could be said of cryptocurrency and blockchain.  There is nothing that governments, including the U.S. government ‚Äì whether it be Congress, the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, or state regulators ‚Äì can do to stop the growth and development of blockchain technology, provided that blockchain innovators are transparent, act responsibly, and stand accountable for their actions.  But just like in The Wizard of Oz, you need to take the journey to complete self-discovery and realize those abilities are already within you.  The regulators are coming, and so too is regulation. Therefore, to be prepared for the Wizard, one has to understand what regulators are thinking and how to prepare for the next phase of the blockchain.  Scarecrow #1: Exchanges  On March 7, the SEC released a statement on potentially unlawful online platforms for trading digital assets. One group of Scarecrows in the space misinterpreted it badly.  Foolishly clinging to the notion that they are better and smarter than government regulators (if only you had a brain, you‚Äôd realize you are not as smart as you think), these Scarecrows concluded the SEC‚Äôs statement was limited to exchanges that trade ICO tokens.  Look at the statement. Read it carefully. The SEC is coming after U.S.-based exchanges without such limitations:  Online trading platforms have become a popular way investors can buy and sell digital assets, including coins and tokens offered and sold in so-called Initial Coin Offerings (""ICOs""). The platforms often claim to give investors the ability to quickly buy and sell digital assets. Many of these platforms bring buyers and sellers together in one place and offer investors access to automated systems that display priced orders, execute trades, and provide transaction data. [Emphasis added]  There is only one smart way for exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Bittrex, Poloniex, Gemini, and HitBTC to react to this: put your money where your mouth is and demonstrate that you are accountable, transparent, and responsible for what happens on your platform.  I have my doubts about certain exchanges, and recently, the lawsuits have been piling up. Whether they be the ones filed by my firm or others, the U.S.-based exchanges are being exposed for what they are: startups that were unprepared for the inflow of customers when fear of missing out (FOMO) hit the average user.  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Kraken CEO Jesse Powell have both been extensively quoted about their inability to handle the influx of new users. Both are working to right the ship.  Now that the SEC is knocking on the door, the companies that can demonstrate that their systems are compliant will be the survivors and leaders in the next phase of this revolution.  While some exchanges have been claiming for years that they have a professional quality protocol, 2017 proved that to be false. Those that adapt, adjust, and comply with state and federal regulations will dominate.  In June 2017, when former federal prosecutor Kathryn Haun (whose amazing 2016 TedX talk inspired me to do what I do ‚Äì protect investors from cryptocurrency-related fraud) joined Coinbase‚Äôs board, the company stated that it was the safest, most trusted exchange on which to buy digital currencies, citing a commitment to regulations and compliance.  The question is whether Coinbase and its brethren have lived up to that standard. Private lawsuits and government regulators are going to provide those answers in 2018 and beyond.  As recently reported, the SEC has issued a blitzkrieg of subpoenas on exchanges, ICO promoters, attorneys, and other crypto professionals who aroused the wrath of the great and powerful Oz. The silence from the recipients of those subpoenas, as well as in response to the SEC statement on exchanges, has been deafening.  Kudos to Bittrex, the fourth largest exchange by profit (almost $2 million a day, according to Bloomberg) for being one of the few to pipe up. The company claimed that as a U.S.-based digital currency exchange, Bittrex uses a robust digital token review process to ensure the tokens it lists are complaint with U.S. law and are not considered securities.  But as in most statements written by corporate lawyers, look for the wiggle room. Bittrex goes on to say that it requires outside counsel for the issuers, not counsel for Bittrex, to determine that the tokens are not securities.  So when the inevitable happens ‚Äì and the SEC determines the tokens Bittrex has been selling are unregistered securities that Bittrex was never licensed or legally authorized to sell ‚Äì Bittrex will blame the companies and their outside lawyers for the issues, not itself.  Scarecrow #2: ICO teams  In a short amount of time, companies who thought they were going with the safer, more conservative route ‚Äì utilizing the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), which was endorsed by several high profile lawyers and law firms ‚Äì are now concerned that the SEC has placed a target on their backs.  Likewise, they are feeling the heat from the U.S. Treasury Department, whose FinCEN division recently declared that any developer that sells convertible virtual currency, including in the form of ICO coins or tokens, in exchange for another type of value that substitutes for currency is a ‚Äúmoney transmitter‚Äù subject to proper registration with the Treasury Department, anti-money-laundering rules, and other regulatory and licensing requirements -- requirements that, if not satisfied, could result in imprisonment.  In a call-out to the second group of Scarecrows, those who thought they were clever enough to sidestep government regulations by using a SAFT, a highly-regarded lawyer at the Posinelli law firm recently made a concise statement to the crowd at a New York conference: SAFTs ‚Äúare garbage.‚Äù  While I happen to agree with that assessment, a SAFT by definition isn‚Äôt a thing. Each and every SAFT is unique and written differently.  Just because everyone else did one, however, does not mean it is legal or responsible for attorneys to endorse or ICO promoters to rely upon. The SEC and IRS will have to examine each and every ICO that utilized the generic SAFT framework and determine the regulatory compliance of each issuer.  And regardless of what the SAFT looks like, the SEC in particular is also going to be looking at the marketing used to promote the ICO and what investors were led to believe to procure their funds. We all know that in the frothy ICO market of 2017, investors were led to believe they were going to be rich.  The SEC and IRS are also likely looking at how the ICO-enabling lawyers, accountants, and advisors were paid. Did they accept tokens as a form of payment?  Quite tellingly, many of the law firms that embraced the SAFT have recently taken a step back and acknowledged that the pre-sale of a tokenized service needs to be done in compliance with securities laws even though those lawyers previously advised their clients that was not the case. While most people do not believe that investors have a target on their backs, everyone else who worked on ICOs that utilized the SAFT should be concerned.  Back to the Wizard of Oz: In the book, Dorothy‚Äôs slippers are not ruby red as in the film; they are silver (my favorite color). It turns out that all she needed to get to the comfort and security of home was the help of these silver shoes.  While achieving compliance with the law may not be as simple as tapping your heels together three times, it‚Äôs certainly within the industry‚Äôs power. Try it, and you might find there‚Äôs no place like home.

In a patent application released Thursday, the bank outlines a platform built on a blockchain that would automatically generate credit ratings using a borrower‚Äôs historical and predictive data. The application as described proposes a system that would utilize more data sources than existing credit rating systems, improving the loan process while creating an immutable record.  Notably, the RBC patent application indicates that it would redesign the credit rating system to provide more transparency for users to understand how their scores are calculated. Further, adding this new level of transparency would help users improve their scores more quickly than is possible at present, according to the filing.  One way the system could work is by using marketplace information to analyze loan offers based on existing credit histories.  The application explains:  ‚ÄúIn another aspect there is provided a system for credit and digital identity records with a distributed ledger of a plurality of nodes, each node including at least a computing device, and the distributed ledger having a plurality of blocks, each block comprising identification data linked to a set of identifiers for an individual, transaction data, a timestamp indicating when the block was created, and a hash reference for the distributed ledger.‚Äù  If a loan application is submitted, the system would automatically determine what sort of loan and creditor would be appropriate before generating a unique smart contract that contains the terms of the loan.  In other words, the blockchain-based system would automate every step of the credit rating process through a more transparent system, according to the filing.  At press time, it's unclear if the system would use one single blockchain or multiple networks, or whether RBC would be ready to build the system if the patent is granted.

The Crown Prince of Liechtenstein said last Friday that his family is considering investing some of their $5 billion fortune in cryptocurrencies.  Crown Prince Alois Philipp Maria told¬†CNBC¬†that investing in cryptocurrencies can help bolster the royal family's fortune, which, though it is sizeable now, was much reduced after World War II.  ""Particularly this whole new digital economy, it is something to look into more into the future,"" he said.  Despite this interest, the Crown Prince went on to say that his family currently lacks ""the internal expertise"" to invest directly in crypto, and that he was unsure about the future of cryptocurrencies in general, explaining:  ""I think we would rather do that or are currently doing that through our general exposure via private equity, venture capital funds where we are investing. Where cryptocurrency will move to, I think that's very open still. So I think one has to really see that it's a very risky asset class.""  As for blockchain, Alois is more bullish.  ""I think particularly the whole blockchain technology is very interesting ... blockchain will change a lot of areas, a lot of businesses in the future.""  He also suggested that his government could potentially utilize the technology, saying that ""I think the attractive elements of blockchain technology could be used to make the state more efficient in the way it's administered.""  The royal family is not the only party in Liechtenstein, a small country situated between Austria and Switzerland best known for its low corporate tax rates, to be interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  Bank Frick, a family-run institution located in the town of Balzers, announced in early March that it now allows clients to invest directly in cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, XRP and ether.
