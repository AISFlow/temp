42381849,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pvRv,1557273436,Hackers Steal $40.7 Million in Bitcoin From Crypto Exchange Binance,"Hackers stole more than 7,000 bitcoin from crypto exchange Binance, the world's largest by volume, the startup reported Tuesday.  Binance announced  that a ""large scale security breach"" was discovered earlier on May 7, finding that malicious actors were able to access user API keys, two-factor authentication codes and ""potentially other info,"" the exchange's CEO, Changpeng Zhao, said in a letter. As a result, they were able to withdraw roughly $41 million in bitcoin from the exchange, according to a transaction published in the security notice.  The disclosure comes hours after Zhao tweeted that the exchange was undertaking ""some unscheduled server maintenance,"" writing that ""funds are #safu."" After the disclosure announcement, Zhao tweeted that the exchange would ""provide a more detailed update shortly.""  The exchange may not yet have identified all impacted accounts, he said. And according to Binance's statement, the breach only impacted Binance’s hot wallet, which contains roughly 2 percent of the exchange’s total bitcoin holdings.  ""All of our other wallets are secure and unharmed,"" he said, adding:  ""The hackers had the patience to wait, and execute well-prepared actions through multiple seemingly independent accounts at the most opportune time. The transaction is structured in a way that passed our existing security checks. It was unfortunate that we were not able to block this withdrawal before it was executed.""  The withdrawal triggered internal alarms after it was executed, and Zhao said the exchange froze withdrawals following the discovery. While deposits and withdrawals will remain suspended for the next week, trading will be re-enabled, though he cautioned that “the hackers may still control certain user accounts.”  Binance will conduct ""a thorough security review"" encompassing its systems and data during the next week.  The exchange will use its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU fund) to cover the loss, which won't impact users, according to the notice.  The fund consists of 10 percent of all trading fees absorbed by the exchange, and was initially launched to protect Binance's users ""in extreme cases,"" according to a previous notice. It is stored in its own cold wallet.  ""In this difficult time, we strive to maintain transparency and would be appreciative of your support,"" Zhao said Tuesday.  He concluded the note by saying he would participate in a previously scheduled Twitter ""ask-me-anything.""  Markets react  Prices have so far responded with bitcoin, the world's premier cryptocurrency, dropping $290 alongside most other cryptocurrencies, which are down between 1-10 percent at press time.  Litecoin and ether both experienced between 4-6 percent losses while bitcoin managed to resume in the green, thanks largely to its bullish rally yesterday that saw prices reach as high as $5,972 on the Coinbase exchange.  Binance's native crypto, Binance Coin (BNB), is also down 8.05 percent and unable to escape the controversy from today's news.  BNB's price is continuing to search for a bottom after it broke from a range it had held for 18 days between $22 and $25.40, with a new all-time high at $26.44 on May 3.

42381851,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pvTB,1557264926,New App Lets You Create Instant Crypto Collectibles,"Whether you're a crypto cat person or a doge fan, at some point you're going to want to give crypto collectibles a try. A new app called Editional by former Facebook employees John Egan and Zac Morris wants to create a place where you can create - and even sell - your first one.  The app basically allows you to create and distribute non-fungible token-based crypto collectibles. To use the app you create a work of art - like this picture of a picture - and set a limited number. Users can grab and keep your art and even resell it. One recent work sold for $300.  Each NFT exists can only be passed from user to user and cannot be copied. In short, when you grab a piece of art you own it.  ""Every collectible created, traded, or owned on Editional is written to a custom, self-funded NFT contract on the Ethereum blockchain, guaranteeing provable ownership, provenance, and portability,"" said Egan. ""We're by far the easiest experience out there for NFTs today. Other solutions are web based, require you to have a third party browser extension installed, and require you to purchase cryptocurrency first to be part of the community.""  The company raised $1.5 million from ConsenSys, FirstMark, DCG, CoinFund, Unusual, and Raptor.  Egan and his team saw that the market was still wide open for crypto collectibles.  ""We had previously built a mobile wallet called Vault that had basic support for NFTs purchased from dApps and from that we quickly learned that people were really excited about these collectible things,"" said Egan. ""They were fun to own and trade and all our friends who were creators wanted to make some themselves but the barrier to entry was too high for most of them to get involved.""  Given the ease with which I created and gave away my art, it's clear that this might be a better way to manage these sorts of collectibles. Egan envisions a time when artists can sell their art online and require gallery visitors to own a piece in order to visit a show. And, since the art is registered on the ethereum blockchain everyone will know you own this dog and baby forever.  ""With Editional, anyone can create long-term relationships with creators and their work, and they don't have to be a blockchain engineer to do it,"" he said.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny_En1bNh1Y  Images courtesy of Editional",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/07/new-app-lets-you-create-instant-crypto-collectibles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b3a59d11d77b0f139c8252451d632ba83a29ced-1768x866.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381844,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pvJ7,1557259032,Orchid Tops $43 Million Raised in Token Sale for Crypto Tor Alternative,"The project behind a blockchain protocol designed to enable private internet browsing has raised another $7 million in funding, CoinDesk has learned.  According to the company, Orchid Labs has now raised a total of $43 million on an offered $125 million in a pre-sale of a token that will power its still-in-development technology.  ""Orchid Labs’ mission is to build open-source software that keeps the Internet open and accessible — a natural resource for everyone, everywhere,"" Steven Waterhouse, a co-founder of the company, wrote in a blog post announcing the funding.  CoinDesk reported in April 2018 that the firm had sold $36.1 on the offered $125 million. Along with a previously reported $4.7 million in another token sale, from major investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Blockchain Capital, this brings the company's total to roughly $48 million.  Orchid is designed to give internet users an incentive to share their bandwidth with other users. By doing so, the protocol can break up traffic and route it through various nodes on the network, making it extremely difficult for an adversary to determine who is visiting the website, much as the TOR system works now.  The idea behind Orchid is that it can build a bigger network by offering people micropayments for sharing bandwidth. To that end, Waterhouse also said that the first consumer-facing Orchid product, the Orchid App, is coming soon: a mobile VPN on iOS and Android that will mask users' internet traffic by routing it over the nascent Orchid network.  Waterhouse writes:  ""We also hope to play a part in driving the VPN market towards more transparency, privacy and fairer pricing.""  Users interested in updates about the progress of the protocol are encouraged to sign up for announcements about its beta release, on the Orchid website.

42430473,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuw1h,1557256503,Bitmain Discloses 88% Reduction In Own Bitcoin Mining Power,"Bitmain's internal bitcoin mining operations are generating 88 percent less computing power than a month ago, suggesting that the industry giant has cut back on capacity.  According to the hashing power disclosure that the company releases each month, as of May 7, the hash rate of all Bitmain-owned hardware running the SHA265 algorithm – which the bitcoin and bitcoin cash networks are based on – had dropped to just 237.29 quadrillion hashes per second (PH/s). Just a month ago, it was at 2,072 PH/s.  Bitmain, based in Beijing, manufactures mining equipment that it sells to others and also mines coins for itself. The firm started disclosing the hashrate of the machines it owns on a monthly basis in July of last year. Archived pages available online show that the hash rate was 1,692 PH/s that month, and then increased to 2,339 PH/s in October.  This figure then dropped below 1,700 PH/s in March, in line with the overall decline of the bitcoin network’s total computing power since November of last year as bitcoin's price plunged below $4,000 during the same period. It then climbed slightly in early April before the latest steep drop.  Partly as a result of that drop, Bitmain’s share of the bitcoin network’s total computing power has also shrunk from four percent to now just 0.4 percent.  Assuming all the hashing power comes from the more widely used AntMiner S9, each with a hash rate of 14 tera hashes per second (TH/s), Bitmain may have ceased using more than 130,000 machines to mine for itself.  The cutback is notable since many miners in China have been gearing up to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power during the coming rainy season. As recently as March, Bitmain was said to be planning to deploy $80 million worth of its own machines this summer.  Smaller slice, bigger pie  To be clear: none of this should be taken to mean Bitmain has shut down all its mining equipment.  Even as the company's share of computing power on the network has declined, the denominator has grown: bitcoin’s total hash power just reached a six-month high over 58,000 PH/s on May 2, according to data from blockchain.info.  Meanwhile, the hash rate of the bitcoin cash network – which Bitmain has vocally supported – has been steady around 2,000 to 2,500 PH/s since early this year, data shows.  When contacted by CoinDesk, a Bitmain spokesperson would not say what exactly led to the decrease in the firm’s hash rate.  “It is [in the] natural course of the mining business where the hash rate owned by one body at one instant may be owned by someone else at another instant,” the spokesperson said.  Also, Bitmain has been advertising a contract cloud mining service for retail customers called BitDeer that uses the company's flagship AntMiner S15, S17 and S11 equipment, with many plans marked on the website as sold-out.

The complaint states that Douglas Monahan and his company iBackPack of Texas, LLC, raised $800,000 from consumers to ""develop a handful of products"" including a smart backpack that contained batteries to charge phones and laptops.  Instead of supplying the iBackpack, the FTC said that Monahan allegedly spent the money on ""personal purposes."" The FTC then claimed that Monahan threatened complainers online:    ""Despite Defendants' repeated assurances, Defendants have not used contributions to produce and distribute completed products. Instead, Defendants have used a large share of contributions for Defendant Monahan's own personal purposes, such as making bitcoin purchases and ATM withdrawals and paying off personal credit cards; for marketing efforts to raise additional funds from consumers; and for other business ventures.      ...    Hundreds of consumers have complained about Defendants' failure to produce the products. Some consumers have also complained that Defendant Monahan sent threats to try to silence their criticism, including by telling one consumer that he knew where the consumer lived and had other personal information about the consumer, and by threatening to sue another consumer and his employer for libel and slander.""    “If you raise money by crowdfunding, you don’t have to guarantee that your idea will work,” said Andrew Smith, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “But you do have to use the money to work on your idea — or expect to hear from the FTC.”  The FTC is asking Monahan to ""for permanent injunctive relief, rescission or reformation of contracts, restitution, the refund of monies paid, disgorgement of ill-gotten monies.""

The news, shared during a weekly meeting of developers, is notable, as Grin came to market touting what it called a ""fair launch,"" meaning project leaders did not raise any funds via an initial coin offering (ICO) or a private sale of the tokens that would power the technology.  This means development of the Grin protocol has been entirely reliant on voluntary donations and crowd-funding. A relatively new cryptocurrency launched back in January, Grin leverages novel technology to obfuscate transaction information.  One developer, Daniel Lehnberg, said about the large monetary gift:  ""A really big and heartfelt thanks. We'll ensure [we] put that to good use.""  Users can donate funds at any point in time to five different public addresses accepting Grin, bitcoin, ethereum and zcash. The most recent donation of 50 BTC was placed in the Grin bitcoin SegWit address and mined on the bitcoin blockchain Sunday.  Still, the donation is also a sign that Grin's funding model may be working.  According to a recently released financial report, funding for the project has increased almost two-fold over the past four months from an estimated $65,237.35 to $123,423.73. Now, with the additional 50 BTC donation, the project holds roughly six times the amount of funds it started out with at the top of 2019.

For the effort, the coffee chain is working with Microsoft to harness its Azure Blockchain Service in tracking coffee shipments from across the world, bringing ""digital, real-time traceability"" to its supply chains, according to an announcement from Microsoft.  With the partnership, Microsoft's blockchain service will record all changes along the journey of the coffee on a shared ledger, providing participants with a ""more complete view"" of the supply chain.  Starbucks will use all that information to bring a new feature to its mobile app, giving consumers details on where the coffee was sourced and roasted, as well as on tasting notes.  As part of its commitment to ethical sourcing, it's also hoping that the blockchain system can help benefit growers too, by providing them with data such as where their beans end up in consumers' cups. According to the release, Starbucks sourced beans from over 380,000 coffee farms in 2018.  “I firmly believe that by empowering farmers with knowledge and data through technology, we can support them in ultimately improving their livelihoods,” said Michelle Burns, SVP of Global Coffee & Tea at Starbucks.  The app will also inform consumers of how Starbucks is supporting these growers, Microsoft indicated.  “This kind of transparency offers customers the chance to see that the coffee they enjoy from us is the result of many people caring deeply,” said Burns.  While a date for the launch of the new service has not been revealed, the digital traceability concept was demoed to shareholders at Starbuck's annual meeting in March.  The firm is currently talking to coffee farmers in Costa Rica, Colombia and Rwanda to find out more about how the project can best benefit them, Burns added.  Starbucks is notably working with the Bakkt digital assets and bitcoin futures platform being developed by Intercontinental Exchange, the parent firm of the New York Stock Exchange. The coffee company was said last August to be working to develop “practical, trusted and regulated” applications for consumers to convert digital assets into U.S. dollars.

42430471,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuvxh,1557234048,'Predatory' Bots Exploiting Decentralized Crypto Exchanges: Report,"Arbitrage bots are exploiting ""inefficiencies"" in decentralized exchanges (DEX), according to a report.  Citing recent research from Cornell Tech, Homeland Security News Wire said on Monday that such cryptocurrency platforms are being used by ""predatory users"" to profit from everyday trades, “siphoning millions or possibly billions of dollars a year in cryptocurrency.”  In some cases, high fees are paid to prioritize certain transactions, posing a security threat to entire blockchains, the piece said.  According to the article:  “Like high-frequency traders on Wall Street, these bots exploit inefficiencies in DEXes, paying high transaction fees and optimizing network latency to frontrun, i.e., anticipate and exploit, ordinary users’ DEX trades.”  The researchers spent 18 months tracking trades on six unnamed decentralized exchanges and found bots were exploiting time delays on these exchanges to make trades faster than is possible by human users.  Study author Philip Daian, a doctoral student in computer science at Cornell Tech, said that, in a traditional system, users have a broker or someone they are trading through and have a relationship based on trust.  In a decentralized system, however, the broker is replaced by blockchain tech, “which seems like a trusted third party, but in reality there are a lot of different moving parts in the blockchain that can be manipulated,” Daian said. “So you have to be very careful about what the blockchain is actually giving you.”  Daian further said that cryptocurrency miners have a “tremendous” amount of power, being able to accept higher fees to prioritize certain trades, “making the entire system vulnerable, or they may even rewrite blockchain history to steal funds already allocated by smart contracts.”  It's worth noting that, to do so, miners would need to control the majority of a blockchain network's hashing power – a so-called 51-percent attack – which brings with it great cost. However, such attacks have become more common in the last year.  The study adds that such arbitrage tactics may also be used on centralized exchanges, which is likely a “billion-dollar issue.”  Correction (14:47 UTC): This article previously attributed the news to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The messaging giant updated its Payment Service Protocol on April 30, indicating that merchants using its service shall not, among other things, ""either directly or indirectly,"" be involved in ""any initial coin offering activities or operating virtual currency trading.""  With the new policy taking effect on May 31, WeChat will terminate its payment services for merchants that are found of violation. However, the policy update did not label crypto-related activities as ""illegal transactions,"" a fact misinterpreted by various Chinese crypto media.  The new policy could have an impact on over-the-counter (OTC) traders in China who are using WeChat Pay as one of the options for transacting Chinese yuan. Exchanges like Huobi and OKEx both offer their platforms for OTC market makers as well as individual users to place bid and ask orders to exchange fiat to crypto, vice versa.  However, it's also important to note that the payment policy update is addressed to merchants on WeChat Pay, referring to account holders who have registered as a merchant or corporate user, as opposed to retail individuals.  That said, the policy update follows WeChat's long-time stance of banning users from using its platform to engage in crypto-related transactions.

They built the prototype as part of the central bank’s digital currency project, called lnthanon. Wipro and blockchain enterprise software firm R3 on Corda platform provided development services.  The solution will enable decentralized interbank real-time gross settlement (RTGS) using a wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) for faster payments, Wipro said, adding:  “The prototype has successfully demonstrated that DLT [distributed ledger technology] can significantly enhance payment efficiency by enabling 24/7 interbank settlements.”  The BoT first revealed the project in June, seeking to create its own blockchain-based cryptocurrency to make interbank transactions both faster and cheaper.  In August, the central bank said that the ultimate goal of the effort is to also “enhance efficiency of the Thai financial market infrastructure.”  The project's banking partners include Bangkok Bank Public, Krung Thai, Siam Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank (Thailand) and HSBC, among others.

Through its newly opened Customer Development Environment (CDE), ASX customers can connect to the system via a blockchain node and experiment with the tech, the exchange announced Tuesday. Once connected, users can design, build and test system changes, as well as access some of the new business functionality.  Peter Hiom, deputy CEO at ASX, said:  “It represents the first time market participants anywhere in the world can experience the benefits of ‘taking a node’ and establishing direct connectivity to a golden source record of real-time data via distributed ledger technology.”  The ASX – Australia's top securities exchange – further said that it is expecting to release additional features to the CDE every eight weeks and a full feature set by mid-2020.  The system is planned to replace the ASX's existing decades-old CHESS clearing house system, and has been under development with the exchange’s tech partner Digital Asset since 2017.  Digital Asset CEO Yuval Rooz said in the announcement that the opening of the client test environment is an “important milestone” for everyone involved in the CHESS replacement project, which is progressing as per ASX’s timeline.  ASX first showed interest in blockchain tech as far back as 2015, as it sought to cut the cost and time it takes for messaging on its CHESS system. The exchange's managing director and CEO, Dominic Stevens, recently said that the new system could help the industry save as much as $23 billion by ushering new efficiencies.  In Tuesday’s release, the exchange said it is “on-track"" to go live with the blockchain system in March or April 2021, a year later than had previously been planned.

42430481,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuwHh,1557227719,"Bitcoin Price Eyes Break Above $6,000 Ahead of New York Blockchain Week","View  Bitcoin's quick recovery from levels below the former resistance-turned-support of $5,627 (April 23 high) seen on Monday, coupled with a break above the stiff resistance at $5,780 (June 2018 bottom) seen today, indicate fairly strong bullish sentiment.  BTC looks set to breach the psychological hurdle of $6,000, as suggested by April's bullish close, and may rise to $6,200 in the next few days. The bullish case is backed by a diamond breakout on the 4-hour chart.  Bulls still need to observe caution, as the 3-day chart shows a bearish divergence of trading volumes. A case for a deeper pullback to $5,000 would strengthen if the price falls below $5,686 (daily opening price) in the next 24 hours.  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain altitude in line with the recent bullish developments on the technical charts and could soon rise above the psychological resistance of $6,000.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization crossed key resistance at $5,780 earlier today to print a high of $5,970 on Bitstamp – a level last seen on Nov. 14.  Bullish sentiment is evidently strong, as evidenced by bitcoin's quick recovery from the break below the former resistance-turned-support of $5,627 (April 23 high) on Monday.  As a result, the cryptocurrency looks set to break above $6,000, as suggested by April's bullish close above the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA).  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,920 on Bitstamp, representing a 43 percent rise from the low of $4,120 seen on April 2.  The rally, confirming a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change in the weeks, comes in the lead up to Blockchain Week NYC and CoinDesk's Consensus 2019 event, which is set to take place May 13–15 at the New York Hilton Midtown.  The cryptocurrency may remain better bid post the event, as seen in some years previously.  Back in 2017, BTC rose from $1,233 to $1,207 following the conclusion of Consensus on May 24. Further, prices also rallied 21 percent and 3 percent in one month following the blockchain week in September 2015 and May 2016, respectively.  In last year's bear market, however, prices dropped from $8,700 to $5,780 in five weeks following the blockchain and crypto gathering in mid-May, indicating that broader market sentiment is the greater driving factor.  Daily and 4-hour charts  BTC is trading well above the crucial resistance of $5,780 (June 2018 low) on the daily chart (above left). It's worth noting that the cryptocurrency has failed three times in the last four trading days to secure a UTC close above that level.  The focus, therefore, is on the UTC close. The case for a sustained rise to $6,200 and above would strengthen if the price closes today above $5,780.  However, a pullback to $5,000 could be seen in the short-term if we see a UTC close below $5,686 (daily opening price), leaving a candle with a long upper shadow in its wake – an early sign of bearish reversal.  A bullish close looks the more likely if we take into account a diamond breakout seen in the 4-hour chart (above right), indicating the rally from the April 25 low of $4,991 has resumed and the next major resistance band of $6,100–$6,200 could soon come into play.  That said, a move above $6,000 could be short-lived or remain elusive, with the long duration chart below questioning the sustainability of the recent gains.  3-day chart  On the 3-day chart, volume bars have consistently printed lower highs, contradicting the higher lows and higher highs on price.  Further, trading volume (red arrows) on red candles (drop in prices) has been bigger than the volume on green candles (uptick in the price), which could be considered a sign of weakening buying pressure.  Validating that argument is the bearish divergence of the Chaikin money flow index, which is yet to challenge the high of 0.231 seen on April 2, despite prices being at near 6-month highs.  The Chaikin money flow index measures the money flow volume over a set period of time (usually 21 days) to gauge buying and selling pressure.

42430465,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuvhh,1557223245,'One-Stop Shop' for Crypto Mining and Trading to Launch Spot Market May 23,"UPDATE (May 7, 2019, 14:00 UTC): This article was updated to note that Bcause is operating under bankruptcy protection.    ---------    Cryptocurrency exchange and mining startup Bcause LLC says it's a few weeks away from launching its spot market, despite operating under bankruptcy protection.  The Chicago-based company has tentatively set May 23 as the go-live date for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, and litecoin, co-founder and chief marketing officer Thomas Flake told CoinDesk. In anticipation of the launch, it has obtained money transmitter licenses in eight states, with 20 more applications pending, Flake said.  Among the first states where Bcause will be available are Illinois, Virginia, Washington and Texas. Bcause has also applied for New York’s BitLicense, but the team doesn’t expect to launch in the state any time soon as the process can take up to two years, Flake said.  Bcause also registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). And earlier this year, the firm announced that it would be using Nasdaq’s matching engine, clearing and market surveillance tech when it launches trading.  Ultimately, Bcause aims to be a one-stop shop for crypto mining and trading, including derivative contracts, and it's applied to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to become a registered designated contracts market and a designated clearing organization. This is going to take some time, too, so the futures market will be launched later. The company is served by a “bank in Illinois,” Flake said, declining to name it.  It entered bankruptcy proceedings last month after a supplier of equipment to its mining facility tried to garnish its bank account, according to a letter to shareholders explaining the Chapter 11 filing. The resulting freeze of those funds caused the company to fall behind on payments to utility Dominion Energy, which is its largest creditor, owed $1.5 million.  However, the company's general counsel told Crain's Chicago Business it is continuing operations and seeking to restructure, not liquidate. Companies regularly emerge from Chapter 11, sometimes as quickly as a few months.  When asked about the situation, Flake said: ""We continue to move forward with the process and at this point all creditors have shown a willingness to work together for a positive outcome.”  Bcause also took advantage of the Prairie State's “substantial history in the derivatives market and a good pool of talent,” Flake said; in December it quietly hired George Sladoje, a former executive vice president of the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Stock Exchange, and later a COO of a Nasdaq subsidiary, OMX Commodities Clearing Company. Sladoje is now Bcause's chief financial officer.  More certainty for miners  Currently, Bcause operates a data center in Virginia Beach, Virginia where it hosts miners for clients. It believes combining this service with spot and eventually derivatives trading will give customers more confidence: they will be able to sell the crypto they mined on Bcause's facility easily on the spot market or secure futures contracts to sell them later at a comfortable price.  Flake explained:  ""You get rid of some of the uncertainty, which makes investors much happier. If you go from saying, 'I don't know what the price of bitcoin will be in nine months,' to saying, 'I'll be able to liquidate it because I have options at $6,500 in December next year,' suddenly, a lot of uncertainty is off the table.""  This model will help make the mining business more attractive for financial institutions, Flake said.  Bcause is not mining crypto for itself at this initial stage; it's only hosting customers' miners. However, it's investigating possible proprietary mining in the future, Flake said.  Right now, the data center in Virginia has miners with a joint capacity of 50 megawatts, mostly Antminer S9 machines manufactured by Bitmain. The demand for mining power is low now, Flake admitted, especially compared with a year ago:  ""In the first quarter of 2018, we had to turn away $250,000 of contracts — we just didn't have capacity. In the last quarter of 2018, that demand dried out completely. But in the last six weeks, we started seeing one or two inquiries a week.""  When the bitcoin price eventually rebounds to $7,000, demand for miners ""will take off again,"" Flake said.  In January 2018, Bcause struck a deal with the city of Virginia Beach, which granted $500,000 to the company for building the mining facility in town and creating new jobs there.",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/07/one-stop-shop-for-crypto-mining-and-trading-to-launch-spot-market-may-23,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The new Azure Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum will help developers create and deploy ethereum-based apps on Azure Blockchain Service or the ethereum blockchain, Chris Pietschmann, Microsoft MVP (most valuable professional) and founder of BuildAzure.com announced in a blog post on Monday.  The ethereum development kit comes as an extension to Microsoft’s source-code editor Visual Studio Code, allowing developers to create and deploy ethereum smart contracts and utilize open-source blockchain tools such as Solidity and Truffle.  On its GitHub page about the kit, Microsoft explains: “Azure Blockchain service is a managed Ethereum service that you can deploy and interact with Solidity contracts as well as integrate into other Azure based services such as Azure Flow, Logic Apps or storage services like SQL Server or Cosmos DB.”  The extension is supported on both Windows 10 and macOS, Pietschmann said, adding that it can also run within a Virtual Machine in Azure.  He further noted:  ""Sure, there have been Solidity and other Blockchain technology extensions for Visual Studio Code published by others in the community, however now there is also an official set of tools published by Microsoft.""  Last month, Microsoft launched a token-building kit in association with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, aimed to help businesses design and create the suitable cryptocurrency tokens for their particular needs. It's also rolled out “proof-of-authority"" ethereum consensus on Azure, which replaces the proof-of-work mining process that is commonly used by public blockchains.

QEDIT’s investment round was led by MizMaa Ventures, with participation from Ant Financial and RGAX as well as Meron Capital, Collider Ventures, Jovono and Target Global. QEDIT has received a total of $14 million in funding to date, comprising the A round, a previous $3 million seed round and $1 million in grants.  Geoff Jiang, a vice president and the general manager of Ant Financial's technology and business innovation group, said in a statement:  “Ant Financial shares a common vision with QEDIT to protect data privacy and security. Robust privacy measures are critical to the ongoing development of the wider finance sector. Together with QEDIT, Ant Financial is committed to providing such capabilities as part of our blockchain services.”  Jonathan Rouach, CEO and co-founder of QEDIT, said the ZKP schemes his Tel Aviv-based company builds are compatible with most varieties of enterprise blockchain, and this has led to the company gaining traction in Asia.  Rouach told CoinDesk:  “We have been getting our product out to large providers in Asia and one of them is Ant Financial, the largest fintech in the world. So our product is compatible with the Ant Financial blockchain offering.”  He pointed out that Ant Financial has launched production blockchain efforts and is very familiar with the need for privacy when moving assets around. (The company, formerly known as Alipay, has applied blockchain to remittances between Hong Kong and the Phillippines and tracking the provenance of rice grown in China.)  “We hear about it less in the West, but there is a lot of progress happening between companies and countries in East Asia,” he added.  Parallel performance  Stepping back, zero knowledge schemes provide a way of proving possession of a secret without revealing the secret itself. Many have tried to apply this technology to restore privacy on blockchains, which in their default state err on the side of broadcasting data.  For instance, QEDIT has demonstrated on the public ethereum blockchain how to prove an individual falls within a certain tax bracket without access to the fundamental data, Rouach said. A later proof of concept (PoC) with BNP Paribas around collateral management for trade finance prevented fraud which can occur when a trader uses the same collateral to get financing twice from two different banks.  “The banks have no way of knowing whether collateral has already been accounted towards other finance because the banks cannot collaborate on private information,” Rouach said. “We worked out a mechanism on a blockchain where the banks can check collateral has only been used once without having to share client information.”  Outlining how QEDIT's zero knowledge tech could be used by the likes of Ant Financial and VMware, Rouach said when a network operates across multiple cloud environments, ZKP solutions allow cloud deployment of blockchain without revealing any sensitive information outside of your chosen cloud provider.  “We are increasingly seeing industries employing enterprise blockchain as their collaboration backbone, where competitors are joining the same network. Our integration to enterprise blockchain stacks from Ant Financial and VMware lets clients pick a Blockchain-as-a-Service provider and have QEDIT’s privacy layer solution included by default,” he said.  When applied to the insurance industry, ZKPs help fight claim fraud, where claimants have been able to exploit information asymmetries between insurers to make more than one claim on the same loss or event (insurers have been unable to combat this due to restrictions over data-sharing between one another), Rouach said.  “Using ZKPs, insurers can prove an event took place without revealing the underlying secure information. QEDIT enables reliable use of each insurer’s claim event data without handing over the data itself to anyone, thus making claim fraud impossible,” he said.  A practical impediment when it comes to using ZKPs is the amount of computation these proving schemes can consume, which can hamper a blockchain's performance. Like many of the projects in the space, QEDIT is working hard on solving scaling and performance challenges around zero-knowledge schemes.  To this end, Rouach and his team have devised a scaling mechanism called “proof chaining” which can generate proofs in parallel. “This lets us take a proof and cut it into smaller pieces and then parallelize those pieces on different machines and to do this in a way that scales,” he said.  In addition to making the technology more practical, QEDIT backs efforts to standardize ZKPs so they can be sold to the enterprise world, said Rouche, concluding:  This is what will move blockchain from a test PoC to actually deployable network; it's what allows competitors to be part of the same network without having to rely on some central authority.""

42430487,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMuwJh,1557202833,"Bitcoin Miners Send Message at Fidelity: We Run on Clean Energy, Not Dirty Coal","Bitcoin miners made the case for their industry as a driver of clean energy adoption, rather than the ecological disaster depicted by critics, at Fidelity’s Mining Summit Friday.  The venue for the daylong event was as notable as the talks. The Fidelity Center for Applied Technology, an R&D division that has dabbled in bitcoin mining, hosted the conference at the financial services giant's global headquarters in Boston. Fidelity has embraced the crypto markets more than most incumbents; this year it launched Fidelity Digital Asset Services, which handles custody of bitcoin for institutional clients and is expected to roll out trading in the coming weeks.  But aside from welcoming the 300 or so attendees and a brief overview of mining history by Jurica Bulovic, innovation manager at Fidelity Labs (a different R&D unit), Fidelity mostly ceded the stage to guest speakers. In their presentations, these miners and others sought to disprove the popular perception that the copious amount of electricity devoted to securing the bitcoin network – 0.26% of world consumption, according to Digiconomist – is an environmental threat.  Miners are constantly searching for cheaper energy, and this is why they will be a catalyst for renewable power development in the near future, said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. His company is building a large wind power generating farm in Morocco: the primary consumer of that energy will be Soluna’s miners, but the rest will go to the country's electricity grid, Belizaire said.  “Bitcoin is at the center of the next great infrastructure that we’ve never seen before. We’re going to go to places that have incredible renewable energy sites,"" he said, predicting that the industry's image will change as a result:  ""In a decade we will start referring to bitcoin completely [differently].”  Mining will help monetize the building of global computation networks around the globe, as well as new renewable power sites, he said, and, unlike in the past, it will not require government subsidies.  Rivers, not coal  The widespread notion that “bitcoin is mainly mined with dirty Chinese coal” is not true, said Chris Bendiksen, the head of CoinShares research department. His team has recently conducted research on the main regions and energy sources for mining.  Miners are located mostly in mountainous regions with big rivers and a high share of renewable power in the overall energy mix, CoinShares found: 48 percent of all global mining happens in the Chinese province of Sichuan where renewable energy is prevalent (90 percent of the overall energy mix), and 12 percent takes in other parts of China that together get around half of their energy from renewables.  Another 35 percent of mining is done in various parts of the Western world including British Columbia and Quebec in Canada, Washington State in the U.S., and Iceland. The rest of the world is producing the remaining 5 percent, the report says. Most of these places have high shares of renewable, especially hydro-generated energy in their power generation mix.  In addition, a lot of hydropower in the world is “heavily underutilized,” Bendiksen says, as hydropower dams are built the regions that have suitable landscapes and big rivers, but are not necessarily heavily populated. Miners can put this capacity to good use, he said.  Asked how the data about miners’ concentration was gathered, Bendiksen acknowledged that it mostly comes from miners themselves.  “We just trawled the entire internet, including forums of miners, we talked to miners themselves, read news articles,” he told CoinDesk.  While miners’ communities, for example, in China, might be very “insular” and uninterested in what the West thinks and knows of them, they still willingly answered questions, Bendiksen said.  Catching the waste  Another source of readily available, cheap energy can be the natural gas released during oil mining (so-called associated gas), said Stephen Barbour, president of Upstream Data. Oil companies need to get rid of the gas, which they aren’t using, so they burn it. As a result, 140 billion cubic meters of gas are wasted every year, according to General Electric’s data.  Barbour said his company developed a system that captures gas at an oil drilling site, transforms it into energy and then uses it for bitcoin mining. According to him, a prototype set up on one such site in Canada, has already helped to reduce carbon emissions there by over 10,000 tons in a year.  “It’s been mining since 2017 and it’s been running on vent gas,” Barbour told CoinDesk. In the prototype phase, using a 45-kilowatt power plant and Antminer S9 mining machines manufactured by Bitmain, the system mined around 20 bitcoins over two years.  Upstream focuses mostly on oil producers in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, which are rich in oil. There are also plans for Texas, Barbour said: a small oil drilling company, the name of which he said he couldn't disclose, purchased a mining data center for an unfruitful drilling site.  “A company was searching for oil, it didn’t find any. They did find a lot of gas, but the gas is worthless, you can’t sell it to anyone in Texas right now. So they can either abandon the well and lose money or they can invest in bitcoin mining,” Barbour said.  But more often, “oil companies are a bit shy of buying bitcoin mining facilities,” he added. However, associated gas is a liability for them, so helping them get rid of it by mining is actually a service, for which oil companies might let miners on their territory for free, he said.  None of this is to say protecting the environment is bitcoin miners' top motivation. “They probably don’t care at all,” Bendiksen said. However, mining bitcoin on fossil fuels is just too expensive, he added, concluding:  “Mining is a relentless driver to lowest global energy prices.”  Image of the Fidelity Mining Summit courtesy of Fidelity",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | COMMODITY | MINING | RESEARCH,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/07/bitcoin-miners-send-message-at-fidelity-we-run-on-clean-energy-not-dirty-coal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b7c56d1bb811b203393bc981a3ecb96e750959c-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
