42398107,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSlB,1420753813,Unexpected Home Search Prompts Purse.io Customer Protection Guarantee,"Peer-to-peer bitcoin shopping service Purse.io is now offering a $10,000 customer protection guarantee to cover users against any costs related to purchasing items through its website.      Notably, the scheme, which was launched on 7th January, will also be available retrospectively to users who report incidents on any past transactions.      Andrew Lee, CEO of the startup said:      ""Our payment flow relies on two irreversible transactions: bitcoin transfer through escrow and delivery of a physical good. This is one of the reasons why we are able to deliver drastically lower fraud rates than PayPal, Visa, or any other traditional payments system.""              ""The $10,000 guarantee is broad in scope to cover any unexpected costs that may arise from using our services,"" he added.      The decision to roll-out the protection plan was taken after a user's home was searched as a result of a purchase he made using the marketplace six months ago.      Purse.io apologised following an internal investigation, confirming they were ""truly apologetic"" and ""offered to compensate lawyer fees and any other expenses related to the incident"".      Lee said:      ""When Chesky and company were building Airbnb they did not expect meth heads to destroy a host's home. But when it happened, they dealt with it professionally and restored user confidence. At Purse we are driving mainstream adoption, and we need to meet the standards set by Airbnb, Uber and the like. We hope other companies including Coinbase and Circle follow our lead.""            Increased security    Despite boasting a relatively impressive safety record, claiming over 10,000 completed transactions and only four reported incidents in the last year, Purse.io will implement additional measures to protect its users further.      The company says that, following a doubling of the customer support team in December, numbers will again double in March.      A 'gamification engine' that puts spending limits on new and unverified buyers has also been introduced in an attempt to minimise fraud. Users can improve their limits by completing successful transactions and via social and phone verification.      Additionally, Purse.io has incorporated an algorithm that detects suspicious buyer behaviour by requiring verification before a purchase is made.      ""As our services scale, we fully expect other edge cases that we can't imagine today. Our job is to quickly learn from them and take measures to prevent, detect and react,"" Lee said.    How it works  Purse.io, which connects users worldwide through a decentralized commerce system, markets its service at people who would like to purchase items on Amazon using bitcoin, which currently is not accepted by the online retailer.  By matching these two markets, Purse.io is able to offer bitcoin purchases on Amazon, powered by a kind of bitcoin exchange that uses a buyer discount to incentivise digital currency owners to sell their bitcoin.    The process is similar to other peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Brawker, a site that offers discount shopping at all legitimate retailers. Purse.io acts as an intermediary by facilitating a user platform, bitcoin wallet and escrow for completing transactions.      Buyers who want to use bitcoin to purchase discounted Amazon items are required to deposit them in their Purse.io accounts. They are then asked to import their Amazon 'wish list' using a 'share' URL and indicate the level of discount desired. Once this is done, the listing is posted on the Purse.io marketplace.      The person willing to buy bitcoin for a similar amount will accept the transaction and purchase the items on the wish list using a credit card so they can be shipped to the Amazon buyer.      Once the items have been received, the Amazon buyer is expected to notify Purse.io so the bitcoins can be released from escrow and passed on to the bitcoin buyer.      In a previous interview with CoinDesk, Ken Liu, second founder of the company said: ""It's kind of like an exchange, but with an Amazon layer.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/08/unexpected-home-search-prompts-purseio-customer-protection-guarantee,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98be8fe2ca3b4131ffb6077971477b5ef081658f-666x444.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398106,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSkC,1420741833,"Butterfly Labs Resumes Shipping, Sets Timetable for Refunds","Butterfly Labs has resumed shipping its Monarch hardware and issuing bitcoin refunds to select customers.  The embattled bitcoin mining company issued a statement earlier this week via its website and redesigned the platform to offer services to customers whose orders have not been fulfilled.  The update follows Butterfly Labs' recent legal win against the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on 15th December when a US District Court rejected a request by the FTC for an injunction, asset freeze and appointment of a receiver.  Following the ruling, BFL was free to resume business. However, the FTC is still suing the company as part of an ongoing case, and a number of customers have taken separate legal action against the company in a bid to recover damages for shipment delays.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Butterfly Labs vice president Jeff Ownby explained his company's view on the developing situation:  ""On 23rd December, the Court handed control of the company and assets back to Butterfly Labs. Monarch shipments resumed on 29th December. Bank and bitcoin accounts were returned to us on December 30th. Payment of refunds in bitcoin resumed on December 31 and activations of cloud mining service also started on this day.""  Although Butterfuly Labs was allowed to resume limited operations in October while it was managed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company’s options remained limited until late December.  Customer impact  On its website, Butterfly Labs states that its operations are still ""severely limited"", and that it needs to assess all aspects of its business and determine the damage caused by the temporary shutdown last year.  Customers who ordered Monarch miners could see their shipments fulfilled with added discounts, or can submit a request for a refund. Refunds can be requested on the customer dashboard, via the Refund Request page.  ""Had the company not been shut down, the order queue probably would have been fulfilled by early November 2014,"" Ownby asserted.  Refund pricing information can be found on the updated website.  Refunds resume  Butterfly Labs said refund and rebate payments will be processed in the order received, including those which were on hold during the FTC action.  Ownby also dismissed rumours that the FTC forced the company to start refunding customers, telling CoinDesk:  ""Contrary to reports in some publications that we're only now paying refunds due to the FTC, we were paying refunds well before the shutdown. In fact, the shutdown stopped all refunds. Now that we're back in control, refunds have resumed.""  The company clarified its timetable for fiat and bitcoin refunds, as well, in formal announcements.  “We will resume paying refunds and rebates as soon as we’re operationally ready,"" the company said. ""We anticipate being able to start paying refunds in bitcoin in January. Because the cost of the temporary receivership and our legal defense against the FTC have consumed a substantial portion of our cash reserves, we anticipate being able to resume cash refund and rebate payments in late January or February.”  Butterfly Labs also said it is handling all return merchandise authorization (RMA) requests and getting in touch with customers that submitted requests and did not hear back from the company, advising customers to check their dashboards and spam folders for messages.

42398116,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSSu2,1420735297,CFTC Commissioner: Market Manipulation Could Shape Bitcoin's Future,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was one of the more vocal US government entities on the subject of bitcoin in 2014, holding a hearing to discuss its role in options and futures, claiming regulatory oversight over the derivatives market and speculating on how it might intervene in the digital currency ecosystem.  Perhaps most notably, however, CFTC Commissioner Mark Wetjen penned an opinion piece heralding the technology’s potential to transform the industries his agency oversees.  But while the CFTC and Wetjen in particular have been open with their views on bitcoin, the organisation as a whole has been less clear on how it will proceed with providing more clarity to bitcoin businesses going forward.  Outstanding questions include how bitcoin fits under existing definitions of commodities, what would inspire the agency to investigate potential market manipulation and how it views activities in the global bitcoin derivatives market.  During a new interview with CoinDesk, Wetjen opened up about these issues and more, although he suggested that the agency itself currently has no way forward on any of these concerns. Rather, it is the bitcoin industry that will decide when and how further action will occur.  Wetjen said:  “It depends on whether there is anything bitcoin-related for the CFTC to consider. At the moment, there's nothing before the CFTC itself to decide upon.”  He suggested that the CFTC would consider platforms and contracts that incorporate bitcoin to examine how they fall under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), but noted that the agency can only react to proposals it has received. To date, the CFTC has approved only one bitcoin derivative, that issued by New Jersey-based swap execution facility TeraExchange.  The interview, however, follows a year when bitcoin derivatives and other forms of advanced financial trading were more widely embraced by the industry globally as a way to hedge against volatility, thereby helping to stabilize the price of bitcoin.  Wetjen is one of four CFTC commissioners appointed directly by the US president and Senate, and accountable to organisation chairman Timothy Massad.  ‘No choice’ but to examine bitcoin  While Wetjen admitted he has been personally excited to learn more about the technology underlying bitcoin, he said the agency itself had “no choice” but to focus on the subject last year.  He explained that, when faced with TeraExchange’s filing for its now-approved derivatives contract, the organisation had to respond appropriately.  “In that respect, the issue was forced upon us in some ways,” he said.  However, Wetjen said that the 9th October hearing that addressed bitcoin was more of a passion project given his fascination with digital currency.  “I had an interest in this emerging technology and I believed it was important to have a public discussion about the technology and how it might impact our work at the Commission. As a vehicle for that discussion, I used an advisory committee that I sponsor,” he explained.  In this instance, the hearing also turned out to interest others. More than 5,000 people logged on to view the webcast, a figure that was said to be the largest the organisation has had for any of its meetings.  The role of market manipulation  Of note, is that, while the CFTC has stated that bitcoin is a commodity, the agency has yet to define precisely what type of commodity it is.  As noted by New York Law School professor Houman Shadab, author of one of the more comprehensive papers addressing bitcoin and the derivatives market, the CEA classifies commodities into three categories: agricultural commodities, such as soybean and wheat; excluded commodities, such as prices and price indices; and exempt commodities, a catch-all term that includes precious metals.  Wetjen indicated that while bitcoin has attributes of both excluded and exempt commodities, the CFTC has not yet had the opportunity to provide a definitive answer.  Still, he outlined how he thinks such a decision could come to pass, stating:  “I believe what might precipitate more serious consideration of the issue is if someone from the market were attempting to manipulate the bitcoin cash market to benefit a position that they have in a bitcoin-derivative position. CFTC staff would be responsible for investigating and determining whether that activity constitutes a violation of the CEA.”  “At that point, staff would begin a more analytical approach to determine where bitcoin fits into our statute’s commodity definition,” he explained.  Bitcoin under the CEA  Barring such an instigating event, Wetjen emphasized how bitcoin is currently captured under the CEA due to the broad nature of the document. In particular, he noted a passage he believes best provides evidence that bitcoin falls under its mandate.  ""One of those component parts provides that a commodity includes any ‘rights or interests in which a contract for future delivery is or will be dealt in,’ and it's that part of the definition that I think best captures something like bitcoin,"" he said.  Still, he stressed the limited the nature that such an interpretation affects the CFTC, stressing that the CEA grants the commission the authority only to regulate contracts for sale of a commodity at a future date that are then traded on regulated exchanges.  The CFTC, he said, does not have extensive oversight over bitcoin exchanges that do not offer derivatives contracts.  “Where market participants are simply buying and selling bitcoin on an exchange, we wouldn't have oversight responsibilities for those exchanges,” he added.  Here again, the subject of market manipulation, and how it could inspire the CFTC to further examine bitcoin, was reiterated. Wetjen, for example, said that the CFTC does have anti-manipulation and fraud authority in the cash markets.  ""In an instance where there are manipulative or fraudulent activities in the cash market, that is the type of case where the definition of a commodity comes into play and we can use that authority to prosecute bad behavior in the cash market,"" Wetjen clarified.  No intention to 'skew market'  Wetjen also speculated on the role the CFTC could play in helping to shape an industry that is still in its early stages.  For example, he suggested that he doesn’t believe that regulation will encourage already-regulated companies, such as TeraExchange, to move quickly in the market, thereby potentially threatening any startups.  “I don't really look at it that way. If someone wants to hedge their bitcoin exposure, and if they're US persons, then they need to do that on a regulated, licensed exchange, such as a swaps execution facility, designated contract market or a foreign board of trade,” he said, adding:  ”We're not trying to skew the market. We're trying to make sure that our statutory mandate is being met and that the public is being protected accordingly.”  However, he issued a somewhat stern warning to US bitcoin merchants that may already be using derivatives platforms that aren't yet registered with the CFTC.  ""If they are a US person, trading a derivative contract and the derivative contract is listed by a company that is not licensed by the CFTC, then they should be concerned. Depending on the facts, there could be a violation of our rules,"" he said.  Further action 'far off'  Generally positive about the ecosystem as a whole, Wetjen speculated that his agency won’t likely be bringing any added attention to digital currencies anytime soon.  When asked how it would move forward on the subject in 2015, Wetjen reiterated that this is dependant on the bitcoin market itself.  ""Looking out over the first quarter of next year, I, for one, don't see compelling reasons to host another meeting, but things could change,"" he said.  For now, this means the CFTC may be simply interested observer of the bitcoin market even as larger questions linger, a role that Wetjen suggested perhaps best defines himself at the moment.  Wetjen concluded:  “There are plenty of other use cases for the underlying technology beyond or apart from the need for hedging against changes in the value of bitcoin. The other potential uses of the bitcoin technology are as interesting to me as the role we have as an agency.”  Mark Wetjen image via the CFTC; US capitol via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/08/cftc-commissioner-market-manipulation-could-shape-bitcoins-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cac645d09a0e8ca1eb0211fe53efd7381e8a9ee2-1263x531.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426241,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGM7h,1420720387,Apple Approves iOS Game That Tips Players in Bitcoin,"Apple has approved a retro-styled iOS game that tips players in real bitcoin, recently releasing it onto the iTunes store.  The game, SaruTobi, lets users swing a monkey from a vine, building up momentum before releasing him to collect power-ups and bitcoin tokens as he frolics though the air.  Speaking to CoinDesk, developer Christian Moss said:  ""SaruTobi is literally Japanese for 'Monkey Fly', and this is pretty much the premise of the game. The user ... flings him across an 8-bit jungle collecting floating bitcoin along the way.""  Introduction to bitcoin  Moss says he was in the process of adding typical Super Mario-style coins into the game when it occurred to him to use bitcoin instead. “I thought it would be a nice way to introduce bitcoin to people who are not familiar with it yet,” he said.  The iOS game has three main aims – attaining the greatest distance, collecting bitcoin tokens to be spent on in-app items, and collecting the letters 'SARUTOBI' to unlock a bitcoin 'boost' to spend on in-game items.  Moss said: “The bitcoin tips come from the game’s shared bitcoin wallet, called a ‘pot’, revenue generated by the game (from in-app purchases and ads) is converted into bitcoin and added to the pot.”  After the user has played the game for a certain amount of time, the game will reward the user by sending them a bitcoin tip.  Players can view how much bitcoin is currently in the pot and also donate to keep it topped up. The more bitcoin there is, the more players will be tipped.  International appeal  The main focus of the game is not to receive bitcoin tips, instead Moss considers them a way of rewarding players for using the game.  Bitcoin is also perfect for international use, he said, calling it a “people’s currency”. He pointed out that a player in Africa should feel just as at home with the digital currency as a player in America or the UK.  Like other bitcoin games, such as Coinding, SaruTobi uses micro-transactions to send small amounts of bitcoin. However, where most games generally want the user to spend bitcoin, SaruTobi rewards them with it.  Moss said:  “I have come across a few concept games that use bitcoin micro-transactions, however nothing on the iOS app store … I believe having a popular iOS app that incorporates bitcoin can go along way to helping it become mainstream.”  Additionally, Moss indicated that he is currently working on a new bitcoin mining game. ""it’s still in the early stages of development,"" he said, ""but the player will be able to dig, similar to Minecraft, and collect real bitcoin.”  SaruTobi is now available on the iTunes store for free download.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Milena Ciric,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/08/apple-approves-ios-game-that-tips-players-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d1de66eab1de568bf6b9cdfd05dcf298cba7b15-1456x610.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426232,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGLph,1420715512,Academic Research on Bitcoin Tripled in 2014,"Academia is increasingly focusing on bitcoin, and hundreds of papers on the subject have now been published, according to research by author and alternative finance commentator Brett Scott.  Notably, more than three times as many papers were published in 2014 as in the previous year.  Scott pieced together a database of published research on the digital currency by combing through 16 online repositories, including Google Scholar and academic publishers' websites.  In addition to peer-reviewed research, he included self-published and independent work, theses and ""quasi-academic"" pieces, among which he counts his own work.  He said he was motivated by personal curiosity to start compiling the database, and also because he was seeking quality research to read himself.  ""I wanted a list of deeper, more robust, research pieces that go beyond the standard ideologically-driven pieces about how wonderful or terrible bitcoin is,"" he said.  Scott embarked on manually gathering the material for his database over Christmas, thinking it would be wrapped up quickly. In the end, the project consumed more than six days of his time, although it also seems to have found an interested audience.  According to Scott, the database has already been viewed more than 8,000 times six days after it was published on 30th December. The project is funded by donations (he has received about £100 so far) and he encourages users of the database to tip him in bitcoin.  Quality of work varies  The self-titled 'alternative finance explorer' is the author of The Heretic's Guide to Global Finance, a book about the financial system and how ordinary people can use it for ""guerrilla finance"" and ""activist entrepreneurialism"".  He gave the quality of research on bitcoin that he found a relatively good grade overall (B+), but with the addition of some important qualifiers.  ""Quality to some extent is in the eye of the beholder, but I'll be honest – there is a fair amount of crap research out there,"" he wrote in a blog post introducing his database.  Scott himself has a fair amount of academic experience. He is a lecturer at the Camberwell College of Arts and carried out research at Cambridge University under the noted economist Ha-Joon Chang. In between, he has been a derivatives broker and a fellow of the Finance Innovation Lab, an incubator, in London.  Crunching the numbers  An analysis of Scott's database shows a rapidly rising quantity of research centred on bitcoin, revealing an academia that is increasingly grappling with the subject.  The amount of published work grows from one in 2008 – Satoshi's seminal white paper – to none the following year, and then one paper in 2010. It increases eight-fold the following year before tripling in 2012. The next year again sees a three-fold increase, to 61 papers, before an explosion of 205 papers hits the reading public in 2014.  Scott predicts that this year will see even more research on the cryptocurrency. He also notes that the peer-review process for the most prestigious journals can take years, so a lag in in published work is to be expected.  ""There will be a big flood of research ... good research takes a while to do, especially in the social sciences,"" he wrote.  Social sciences 'underrepresented'  Perhaps unsurprisingly the bulk of research is technical, delving into cryptography, computer science and systems design, Scott finds.  There is a also a large amount of work on the regulatory and legal questions surrounding bitcoin. The economics of the digital currency are another area of academic fascination, with an Austrian flavour to the work.  Crunching the numbers of Scott's database shows that, apart from independently published efforts, the two sources with the most bitcoin research are the papers collected from last year's Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference and the Business Information Systems Workshops that also took place last year. The Journal of Peer Production is the third most popular host for bitcoin work.  The open-access platform arXiv, operated by the Cornell University Library, is the most popular place for independent researchers to publish their work, with 35 pieces accounted for in Scott's database.  The social sciences are underrepresented, Scott says. He calls for deeper ethnographic and geographic analysis of bitcoin, as well as critical engagement with the implications of a decentralised, algorithm-driven system.  ""This research remains hugely underrepresented, which is ironic, because it's by far the most important area of research,"" he writes.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/08/academic-research-on-bitcoin-tripled-in-2014,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53f75cb28c24c438d4b4354934dcf7909411bc42-1000x804.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The email, signed by a representative of the CoinTerra support staff, claims that the firm is no longer capable of making payouts to customers.  The message reads:  ""The company has defaulted on its secured notes. The note holders have senior, secured and, we believe, perfected liens on all of CoinTerra's assets, including servers. We have proposed a plan to the note holders. However, at this point we do not know how they are going to react to our proposal. The note holders are evaluating their options. Until this is resolved, CoinTerra will be unable to make further payments.""  CoinDesk contacted several members of CoinTerra’s staff, including treasurer Pradeep Kumar Cheruvathoor and PR representative Daniel Larsson, but no official confirmation on either the default or the payout stoppages has been received.  What we know  Email headers from two of the messages purportedly from CoinTerra are consistent and both show that they were sent from CoinTerra’s support account at ZenDesk.  Notably, CoinTerra’s website is operational despite the reported service disruption. While cloud mining products are currently listed as ""out of stock"", CoinDesk was able to move a hardware purchase to checkout.  CoinTerra has experienced service problems in the past, including performance issues and security incidents, and has faced scrutiny from both customers and third-party organizations like the US Better Business Bureau. The company has also faced legal hurdles, including a class-action lawsuit earlier this year.  What we don’t know  The email shared by both Reddit users and community members is currently unconfirmed by CoinTerra.  The reported payout stoppages are said to have begun in the last weeks of December, though the exact nature of the interruption is not known at this time. One Redditor claimed to have received a payout on 19th December, while a CoinDesk reader reported that he hasn't been issued payment since the 20th.  The email text states that CoinTerra has defaulted on its “secured notes”, a form of debt. The note-holders, according to the email, have a claim on the firm’s assets because of the default, including its miners and server space.  The email further claims that until a decision has been reached among those who own the company’s debt, no payouts will be processed, adding:  “What this means is that we cannot issue any payments to customers at this time. Rest assured we will let you know if this situation changes or if there are any relevant new developments but, for now, we have no further information.”  More information on the company can be found here.
