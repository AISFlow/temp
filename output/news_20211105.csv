However, not everyone agrees that the altcoin is fairly priced. Analysts at JPMorgan fall into this category. Although the altcoin has made great strides in utility recently, the analysts do not believe that the coin is fairly valued. They believed that the fair price of the digital asset is in fact much lower than its current value. Ethereum has been one of the most successful digital assets in the market. This has been due to the growth of use cases such as decentralized finance and NFTs. Ethereum remains the default blockchain for investors to access these services and this has made its native token, ETH, rally over the months.

The FBI said it has seen an increase in scammers directing victims to use physical crypto ATMs and QR codes to complete payment transactions.  Scammers will request payment from the victim and then direct the victim to withdraw money from the victim’s financial accounts, such as investment or retirement accounts.  The FBI warns they will also provide a QR code associated with the scammer’s cryptocurrency wallet for the victim to use during the transaction.  The scammer will then direct the victim to a physical cryptocurrency ATM to insert their money, purchase cryptocurrency and use the provided QR code to auto-populate the recipient address. Often the scammer is in constant online communication with the victim and provides step-by-step instructions until the payment is completed, said the FBI.  “It is important to remain vigilant and not make payments to someone you have only spoken to online, even if you believe you have a relationship with the individual,” advised the FBI.

42396572,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4Rgn,1636145263,"In Craig Wright Trial, Plaintiffs Lay Out Pattern of Fraud, Deceit and Hubris","MIAMI — Attorneys for Ira Kleiman and W&K Info Defense Research began to paint an unflattering portrait of Craig Wright, his business practices and interpersonal dealings in a Miami court on Tuesday and Wednesday.  These two days of testimony formed part of the plaintiffs’ suit against Wright, revolving around his business dealings with the Kleiman’s late brother, David Kleiman. The crypto community has been watching this case closely because much of the financials at the heart of the case revolve around bitcoin wallets that have been linked to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.  Read more: Kleiman v. Wright: Bitcoin’s Trial of the Century Kicks Off in Miami  Tuesday’s witnesses included former Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, who testified that Wright – the Australian computer scientist best known for his much-debated claim to be Nakamoto – “bamboozled” him.  In a prerecorded video deposition shown in court Tuesday, Andresen testified that he began to doubt Wright’s claim after Wright notoriously failed to deliver cryptographic proof that he had access to Satoshi’s private keys.  “I’m starting to doubt myself, and imagining the clever ways you could have tricked me,” Andresen wrote to Wright on May 3, 2016, in an email presented in court.  “The gobbledygook proof he published was certainly a deception, if not an outright lie,” Andresen told attorneys for Kleiman. “He bamboozled me, there.”  Andresen’s testimony was just a taste of what was to come on days two and three of the Kleiman vs. Wright trial, which is being closely watched because of Wright’s history of claiming to be the inventor of Bitcoin but failing to conclusively prove it.  If the plaintiffs win, Wright could be ordered to give them a portion of intellectual property rights and a share of up to 1.1 million bitcoins, worth $68 billion, that the plaintiffs claim Wright controls. Many in the crypto community, however, have called into question the existence of those coins and, if they do exist, whether Wright in fact controls them – and even if he does, whether the court will be able to force him to abide by the jury’s decision.  ‘I never got a cent’  Jamie Wilson, director of the Australian cybersecurity company Cryptoloc, testified via pre-taped video deposition about his former business relationship with Wright.  Wilson told the plaintiffs’ attorneys that he met Wright in 2012 after learning about bitcoin in 2011, and accepted a director role in several of Wright’s companies, including Hotwire and Coin Exchange.  On Oct. 23, 2013, Wilson sent Wright an email resigning from his positions at four of Wright’s companies.  “I wasn’t feeling comfortable,” Wilson told the attorneys when they asked him his reason for resigning. “I didn’t like the way he went about business, his ethics and morals, the way he treated people.”  Wilson said he became suspicious of Wright when he noticed “a lot of bitcoin” and money that originated in the United States on company balance sheets. Concerned that the money was the result of a U.S. government contract he was unaware of, Wilson said, he took his concerns to Wright, who told him the money was from unspecified research and development activities.  When Wilson dug deeper into company records, he told attorneys, he found that the money originated at W&K – the entity plaintiffs say represented a business agreement between Dave Kleiman and Wright to mine bitcoin and develop intellectual property relating to blockchain technology.  Wilson said his suspicion was increased by Wright’s change in behavior and lifestyle after Dave Kleinman’s death in April 2013. Before Kleinman died, Wilson described Wright as driving “a very cheap car,” living in rental properties and wearing hoodies.  After Dave Kleinman’s death, Wilson described Wright’s newfound interest in “watches, flashy suits ... a massive change in lifestyle.”  “His arrogance, believing he had to change himself, it just caused a lot of problems,” Wilson testified.  Wilson also said Wright never paid him – or any other employees at Hotwire – during the time period of Wilson’s employment.  “I did not receive one cent,” Wilson said. He added that he was never reimbursed for travel expenses or the down payment on a rental property for an office, and that Wright’s other employees were forced to borrow money from friends and family to stay afloat.  Wilson testified that he wasn’t expecting to receive a salary, however, and found out about his supposed $150,000 per year salary only when the Australian Tax Office (ATO) informed him he needed to pay taxes on it, because Wright had reported the payment.  “I never got a cent, anyway,” Wilson reiterated.  Ira Kleiman takes the stand  David Kleiman’s brother Ira, the personal representative of the Kleiman estate and plaintiff in this case, took the stand on Wednesday.  Ira Kleiman told the jury that he first met Wright in February 2014, about a year after his brother’s death, when Dave Kleiman’s friend Patrick Paige forwarded Ira an email from Wright (dated Feb. 12, 2014) discussing their alleged partnership to mine bitcoin.  A day after receiving Paige’s email, Ira reached out to Wright asking for more information about his brother’s purported involvement in the creation of bitcoin:  “Can I ask you if Dave played a part in writing the original PDF under the Asian alias?” Ira Kleiman wrote to Wright, in an apparent reference to Nakamoto’s seminal bitcoin white paper. “I have no interest in public attention from it. I just think that it would be cool if David played a part in creating something so incredible.”  The court then heard about two months of communication between Ira Kleiman and Wright, where the two discussed the role Wright claimed he and Dave played in the bitcoin’s creation.  “I had math skills and some coding that frankly was crud (better than some, but really),” Wright told Ira Kleiman in an email dated March 7, 2014. “Dave could edit his way through hell and back. I am not a team player. I am a terrible boss and a slave driver, but with Dave I was far more ... Satoshi was a team.”  Growing mistrust  But in April 2014, the relationship between Ira Kleinman and Wright appears to have begun to sour.  Ira Kleiman showed the jury an email he received on April 15, 2014, from Andrew Miller, an employee of the Australian Tax Office, about Dave Kleiman’s estate.  Ira Kleinman told the jury that, through Miller’s email, he learned for the first time that Wright had sued W&K in an Australian court and that Wright told Australian authorities he had paid Dave Kleinman’s estate 40 million Australian dollars to “fund the projects” of W&K.  In the email, Miller asked Ira Kleiman a series of questions about W&K, including whether he was aware that Wright had taken legal action against the company in Australia, or that Dave Kleinman’s estate had purportedly received a bond worth 40 million Australian dollars from Wright to fund W&K’s projects.  Miller’s email also said there was a settlement agreement for the transfer of property from W&K to an entity owned by Wright, and that a then-21-year-old Vietnamese woman named Uyen Nguyen had been appointed director of W&K. Miller asked Kleiman if he had instructed Nguyen to accept the settlement agreement.  Kleiman told the jury that, at the time of Miller’s email, he was not aware of W&K and had never met or heard of Nguyen. He also said that the estate had received no money from Wright or any related entities.  On April 23, 2014, Kleiman reached out to Wright by email for answers. ”I feel like there are discrepancies in the contracts between you and W&K, such as Dave’s signature, his resignation, transfer of all accountable value, Uyen’s role of director, BAA projects, etc...I do believe we need to remedy the lopsided contractual exchange,” Kleiman wrote.  “From these documents, it appears clear to see a systematic transfer of assets out of W&K back to you. Up until April 15, I was a complete believer in what you were telling me,” Kleiman wrote in another email to Wright. “But you never mentioned any of the actions you were taking against W&K prior to contacting us.”  Attorneys for the plaintiffs showed the jury a contract allegedly signed by Dave Kleiman on April 2, 2013 – 24 days before his death – that gave Wright control of W&K’s assets.  The signature shown to the jury – crisp and slanted – differed vastly from prior signatures of Dave Kleiman’s, such as the one shown from his will, where he signed with a large, looping “D” followed by a scribble.  “That’s not my brother’s signature,” Ira Kleiman told the jury, referring to the signature on the contract.  Later that month, on April 29, 2014, Miller wrote another email to Kleiman, asking him to confirm the veracity of a contract from March 2014 filed with the ATO by Wright.  “It suggests that you acquired $10,500,000 worth of shares in an Australian company ‘Coin Exch’ Pty Ltd. Were you aware of this, and if so, in what form did you pay this share of capital?”  Kleiman told the jury he never bought shares of Coin Exchange.  Former nChain lawyer speaks  Jimmy Nguyen, a former attorney for nChain, the London-based company where Wright is chief scientist, also gave testimony about the nature of Wright’s involvement at nChain and his claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nguyen testified that Wright told him that he and Dave Kleiman both posted from Satoshi’s accounts.  He also testified that, in 2014, Wright claimed he had “more money than Rwanda.”  Wright is set to take the stand on Thursday.

The price is also little changed over the week, while altcoins and gaming tokens have seen significant gains.  Solana’s SOL token has rallied 21% this week, breaking through its all-time high on Thursday. Ether (ETH) also climbed to a record, hitting $4,628 on Nov. 3. It is up 2.4% on the week.  “Alternative coins to ETH are still in favor,” said Daniel Kukan, a trader at Crypto Finance AG.  The bitcoin dominance chart, which shows the extent of the cryptocurrency’s dominance over the rest of the market, is signaling a bias toward altcoin exposure, according to Matthew Dibb, COO of Stack Funds.  “This trend will likely persist for the short term,” he said.  The chart shows bitcoin dominance declining as altcoins take a larger share.  “We have seen consistent bids for Layer 1 tokens throughout any market weakness,” said Dibb.  Avalanche’s AVAX token touched an all-time high $80.29 on Friday and is up 20% on the week. Polkadot’s DOT has also made significant gains this week and is up 20%.  Coins related to virtual worlds, or so-called metaverses, were also in the spotlight after Facebook said it will change its name to Meta and enter the arena.  “The recent rebranding from Facebook to Meta is making the crypto market reassess the future value of these metaverse competitors, which until last week, many of them were fairly undervalued” said Juan Pellicer, a research analyst at IntoTheBlock.  MANA, the currency of Decentraland, a virtual world on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to monetize content and applications, is up 88% on the week. SAND, the token of The Sandbox, also a virtual world where players can build, own and monetize their gaming experiences using non-fungible tokens, has gained 132%.  Play-to-earn tokens have also experienced an uptick. Axie Infinity’s AXS token is up 5% on the week. Enjin coin (ENJ), the token of Enjin, a gaming community platform and virtual goods marketplace with a market cap of $2.6 billion, is up 28%.

42410946,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtjYz,1636145052,US Stablecoin Report Gets Mixed Reviews From Crypto Industry,"To hear them tell it, stablecoin issuers’ prayers have been answered.  Two of the top 10 stablecoin issuers hailed this week’s report from the President’s Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets, which recommended stricter oversight of this mushrooming part of the cryptocurrency market, as a welcome step toward regulatory clarity.  “We are fully supportive of the call for Congress to act and establish federal banking supervision for stablecoin issuance,” said Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and chairman of Circle, which manages USD coin (USDC), the second-largest such token.  “This is huge progress in the acceptance of stablecoins and provides a path for their adoption,” Allaire said in an emailed statement. Tether, the stablecoin market leader, gave a similarly upbeat statement. While less effusive, Paxos, the No. 7 issuer, and Gemini, the company behind the 16th-largest stablecoin, were diplomatic in their comments.  By sharp contrast, lobbyists for the cryptocurrency industry were critical of the 22-page report’s prescriptions. Both Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce argued that the recommended regulatory oversight could stifle innovation and unfairly single out stablecoins among payment systems like PayPal that work in similar ways.  The discrepancy between the practitioners’ praise and the advocates’ attacks highlights the delicate spot the community finds itself in, given its precarious regulatory status, and mixed public perception of crypto.  “The crypto industry is trying to walk a fine line between benefiting from the legitimacy provided by government oversight while trying to stay clear of extensive and intrusive regulation that deters innovation,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist and author of “The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution is Transforming Currencies and Finance.”  Long overdue?  As the global stablecoin market – currently worth some $134 billion – continues to grow, regulators all over the world are getting nervous. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies tethered 1:1 to the value of other assets like the U.S. dollar, and issuers maintain the fixed value of these currencies by backing them with reserves that match the value of the coins in circulation. This year, Tether, issuer of USDT, revealed that about 50% of its reserves were made up of unspecified commercial paper.  Last month, Circle disclosed it was under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC). Tether may also be under the SEC’s microscope. Meanwhile, Europe is gearing up to approve a 168-page framework to regulate crypto, which proposes additional standards for major stablecoin issuers in particular.  The report compiled by the President’s Working Group, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is the first step towards establishing federal-level regulatory oversight of the stablecoin sector in the U.S.  The regulators behind the report called on Congress to bring stablecoins under federal supervision. The report indicated that should lawmakers fail to do so, the regulators themselves may step in through the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which could designate stablecoin activities “systemically important” and thus subject to tighter supervision.  Although the report said that the rapid growth of the stablecoin market increases the urgency of establishing oversight, Stanford economist and professor Darrell Duffie said he doesn’t feel things are being rushed.  “If anything, we were already past the due date for regulatory action,” he said.  “It is desirable, though, for market participants to get a clearer sense of the rules,” Duffie said.  Issuers’ reactions  In public, the big players in stablecoins appeared to agree, or at least to not protest.  “The ecosystem has been waiting for clarity about stablecoin regulation for a long time. … This will be a pivotal moment in fintech history,” a spokesperson for Tether said.  Tether, which is incorporated in Hong Kong and registered in the British Virgin Islands, says it stopped serving U.S. customers in 2018. For it to resume doing business in the U.S. would require big changes under the report’s proposed regime.  “Tether is not an insured depository institution. So it would have to apply for a charter and be reviewed in that sense,” said Timothy Massad, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in an interview on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program Thursday.  When asked whether Tether, which settled two separate investigations by federal and state U.S. agencies this year over its reserves, is ready to become a federally regulated bank, the spokesperson referred CoinDesk to the previous statement.  A spokesperson for Paxos said the company looks forward to “engaging further with all policymakers regarding the future of stablecoins.”  It took Paxos, issuer of stablecoin USDP, three years to be approved for a trust charter in the state of New York.  Gemini, the issuer of GUSD, said it appreciated the opportunity to share its input with the President’s Working Group.  “We look forward to continued dialogue,” a Gemini spokesperson said in an email.  The Diem Association, the consortium set up by Facebook to build stablecoin hopeful diem, formerly known as libra, did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  Fighting words  Following the release of the report on Monday, Perianne Boring, the founder of the blockchain advocacy group Chamber of Digital Commerce, tweeted that, if multiple agencies step in to regulate stablecoins, things could get messy.  “The report suggests that multiple federal agencies have jurisdiction over #stablecoins, without defining the parameters of this jurisdiction or indicating which agency has superior expertise in the function being regulated,” Boring tweeted.  Boring also tweeted that the recommendation in the report to consider designating activities of stablecoin payments systems “as, or as likely to become” systemically important would open the door to regulators applying this authority to other payment systems that are already used by “tens of millions of consumers every day.”  While the Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) already has the authority to designate financial activities as systemically important, it has never before exercised this authority successfully, Boring later told CoinDesk, so this would be a first.  “It would create a slippery slope – credit card networks and other companies could be next,” Boring tweeted on Monday.  The FSOC’s track record includes previously voting to designate, and then rescinding, three companies whose “material financial distress – or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of its activities” – could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. One such company was MetLife Inc. but the insurance giant filed suit against the regulators in 2015, challenging the designation. In 2018, both the FSOC and MetLife filed a joint motion to dismiss the case and the U.S. Treasury Department recommended the FSOC refrain from targeting individual companies and focus on broader risks.  Imposing these regulations on all stablecoin payments systems, regardless of size, would be regulatory overreach that would hinder innovation with stablecoins and other payments systems that may be designated, Boring said in an email to CoinDesk.  Jerry Brito, executive director of crypto think tank Coin Center, tweeted that the way the report lays out the nature of stablecoins and the risks they pose is similar to how one would describe PayPal or other payment apps.  “I don’t see how they distinguish it, yet there’s no legislation recommended for payments apps,” Brito said in the tweet.  Boring also pointed out that the report overlooks the regulatory efforts of individual U.S. states.  “The current regulatory framework for payments systems – including stablecoin payment systems – primarily takes place at the state level through money transmission laws and trust licenses,” Boring said. By ignoring these efforts, the report disregards the majority of regulation that currently applies to crypto.  “It’s essential to analyze a current regulatory frameworks’ strengths and weaknesses, and to learn from that experience, before imposing a new framework,” Boring said.  Some states are innovating through new laws designed specifically for digital assets, Boring continued, citing New York’s BitLicense and Wyoming’s special purpose depository institution charter.  “We believe that regulators should allow the ‘laboratories of democracy’ – the states – to continue to innovate in this space, rather than imposing one size fits all federal mandates,” Boring said in an email.  DeFi implications  According to Duffie, the treatment of stablecoin issuers as banks may come as a blow to proponents of decentralized finance (DeFi).  “The PWG Report proposes legislation that would require stablecoins to be issued only by banks, under prudential standards and supervision. That’s a significant step that will help with financial stability but surely generate lots of disappointment among some DeFi enthusiasts,” said Duffie.  Jacob Franek, partner at the DeFi Alliance, said he doesn’t believe DeFi enthusiasts will be disappointed by the general concept of regulating stablecoin issuers.  “The devil, however, is in the details,” Franek said.  A delegate for DeFi platform MakerDAO, who goes by the pseudonym PaperImperium, said that the report only applies to fiat-redeemable stablecoins, referring to footnote 5 of the document which states:  “Stablecoins that are purportedly convertible for an underlying fiat currency are distinct from a smaller subset of stablecoin arrangements that use other means to attempt to stabilize the price of the instrument (sometimes referred to as “synthetic” or “algorithmic” stablecoins) or are convertible for other assets. Because of their more widespread adoption, this discussion focuses on stablecoins that are convertible for fiat currency.”  The stablecoin DAI, generated by Maker, is convertible for other assets like bitcoin or ethereum and not fiat currency, and therefore does not fit the report’s parameters, PaperImperium said.  “So it was a big win for DeFi,” he said.  Former CFTC official Massad said on CoinDesk TV that one of the standout contributions of the report is a call for DeFi regulations because it’s an area that hadn’t been wholly addressed by regulators and lacks transparency.  “It’s not exactly clear what kind of regulation they’re envisioning. So, you know, that is something that will have to be developed,” Massad said.  Meanwhile, PaperImperium argued the report was instead a blow to more centralized stablecoin issuers like Circle and particularly Diem.  “The report read to me like a huge shot at Facebook, to be quite honest,” he said, referring to the social media giant’s early involvement in diem, which he said inspired the proposed crypto asset guidelines in Europe.  What’s next?  According to Prasad, regulators are in for a hard time. Regulatory requirements and associated compliance costs often tend to favor larger, established players and put potential new entrants at a disadvantage, he explained.  “Hence, even open-minded regulators face a difficult balance in mitigating financial risks while leaving room for innovation and ensuring a level playing field between incumbent firms and new ones,” Prasad said.  As an immediate next step, regulators should take a step back and assess the current state and federal regulatory framework that applies to stablecoins, according to Boring, starting with assessing how states are looking to regulate the space.  “The report acknowledges that stablecoins currently operate at a small scale so there is time to get the regulatory solution right,” said Boring.  Duffie added that the president’s working group has clearly passed the baton to Congress.  “Let’s see what happens there,” said Duffie.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/05/us-stablecoin-report-gets-mixed-reviews-from-crypto-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c70b1869c98f49fd3b6cc8d2e8bfc9de242bd9a8-1440x1329.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42396589,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4RxW,1636145025,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Could Break Out and Rise With Altcoins Next Week,"Bitcoin’s trading volume continued to decline over the past week as alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as ether rose to new price highs. BTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, sank about 2% over the past week, compared to a 1.5% rise in ETH and a 17% rise in Solana’s SOL token.  “Active speculators in the cryptocurrency market are jumping from one coin to another, trying to ride the small waves,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “This is a positive-sum game if the tide is turning; that is, if the overall capitalization of the crypto market is rising,” Kuptsikevich wrote.  Some analysts expect bitcoin to eventually catch up to the rise in altcoins next week, which could push BTC’s price past $64,000 resistance.  “Historically, there has been a slightly delayed positive correlation with traditional markets and the crypto market, helping to build the case for a bullish November for digital assets,” Will Morris, a trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): 60,956.33, -0.30%  Ether (ETH): 4,484.81, -0.01%  S&P 500: 4,697.53, +0.37%  Gold: 1,817.17, +1.44%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.45%  Traders will also be monitoring Coinbase’s (NASDAQ: COIN) third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 9. The crypto exchange delivered a negative earnings surprise in the second quarter because of declining trading volume. The cryptocurrency exchange’s shares are up about 40% over the past month compared to a 10% rise in bitcoin and a 25% rise in ether over the same period.  Bitcoin correlation with stocks rise  Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 continued to rise over the past month, suggesting investors’ appetite for risk remains strong. On the other hand, demand for Treasury bonds, once deemed to be safe investments, has declined given market expectations of rising inflation and slowing economic growth.  The chart below also shows the declining correlation between bitcoin and long-term Treasury bonds. A similar dynamic occurred in 2019 when the crypto bear market stabilized and monetary policy became more accommodating, which benefitted assets such as equities and cryptocurrencies (deemed to be risky).  For now, it appears that investors are positioning away from long-duration assets, which are more sensitive to rising interest rates as a result of tighter monetary policy. In this scenario, correlations involving bitcoin, equities and long-term bonds could rise as investors reduce their exposure to risk.  Further, during crisis episodes, such as the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 can rise significantly.  Positive funding rates  Bitcoin’s average funding rate, or the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures market, remained slightly positive over the past week, which reflects bullish sentiment among traders.  “The persistent positive funding rates suggest that demand for long exposure remains high in the market, but the relatively low long liquidation volumes in the market suggest that traders are less reckless with leverage now than during the spring rally,” Arcane Research wrote in a report earlier this week.  Still, Arcane warned that there is risk of high volatility if crypto markets turn lower.  Altcoin roundup  Bitcoin cash briefly spikes on fraudulent press release: Bitcoin cash (BCH) rose a sharp 4.6% to $630.70 in under 15 minutes on Friday after a fraudulent press release went public, CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley reported. The release stated that U.S. supermarket giant Kroger would start accepting the cryptocurrency as a form of payment during the year-end holiday season this year. However, the news – which was issued on PR Newswire and appeared on Kroger’s website – was quickly taken down after a spokesperson confirmed that it was fake news. The BCH price declined again and stood at $601.74 at press time.  Argo blockchain shares fall after workers share non-public information: Shares of London-based crypto miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) fell as much as 5% on Friday after the company said in a filing that some employees had inadvertently disclosed potentially material, non-public information in a conversation, CoinDesk’s Aoyon Ashraf reported. The discussion contained information about the potential increase in the company’s hashrate, or computing power, and the expected cost to build its planned facility in Texas, according to the filing. Argo listed its American depositary shares on Nasdaq in September; they are up roughly 3% since the listing.  FTX, Lightspeed, Solana Ventures to invest $100 million in Web 3 gaming: FTX, Lightspeed and Solana Ventures are investing $100 million in Web 3 gaming development, CoinDesk’s Eli Tan reported.

42421695,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9W1,1636140204,Craig Wright’s Latest Funhouse-Mirror Legal Adventure,"Today is the fifth day of the civil trial between Craig Wright, chief scientist of crypto research firm nChain, and the estate of Dave Kleiman, Wright’s collaborator and business partner in the early days of Bitcoin. For newcomers to crypto, the name Craig Wright might not mean much, and fair enough: He is a largely discredited figure at the very margins of the industry, most likely these days to surface as an object of bemusement.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The current trial is a perfect encapsulation of the string of flubbed claims and public misbehavior that have made Wright an outcast. The Kleiman estate alleges that, in order to gain control of Kleiman’s share of their collaborative work, “Craig forged a series of contracts that purported to transfer Dave’s assets to Craig and/or companies controlled by him. Craig backdated these contracts and forged Dave’s signature on them.” According to the suit, Wright “claimed Dave signed all these property rights away in exchange for non-controlling share of a non-operational Australian company … The company went bankrupt after Craig apparently misled the Australian Tax Office (‘ATO’).”  The assets Wright allegedly nabbed include both a variety of intellectual property and a stash of bitcoin now worth close to $65 billion. Since 2016, Wright has used that bitcoin trove as support for his audacious claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.  But in 2018, blockchain analyst Kim Nilsson at WizSec looked at the addresses Wright had publicly claimed and concluded that they aren’t actually his. Instead, Nilsson described Wright as “some guy browsing a ‘blockchain rich list,’ picking out a couple of addresses at random and saying ‘I own those’ for whatever reasons, while offering no evidence except for some clumsy document backdating.” Some may remember Wright’s efforts to prove control of the accounts during the pretrial phase of the Kleiman suit, revolving around a mysterious bonded courier.  So Dave Kleiman’s estate is suing Craig Wright for money that Wright claimed to control as part of his assertion that he is Satoshi. The Kleiman suit largely treats those claims as valid, for the very good reason that it gives the estate standing to claim a large share of Wright’s claimed billions in bitcoin. But the upshot, for skeptics of Wright, is truly bizarre – a fierce, years-long court battle over money that Wright allegedly stole but may not actually have.  The tactics Wright allegedly used against Kleiman, particularly missing or mismatched signatures and seemingly backdated documents, have also undermined Wright’s prior evidence that he is Satoshi. Most importantly, Wright has, to date, not shown that he controls the cryptographic PGP key that validated Nakamoto’s communications prior to April 26, 2011, when Nakamoto sent his final known public messages. Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, whose reputation was itself badly damaged after briefly supporting Wright’s claim to be Satoshi, told the court this week that he now thinks Wright’s evidence for the claim was “certainly a deception, if not an outright lie.”  This, then, is a lawsuit claiming that Wright defrauded Kleiman out of a legacy that Wright has himself claimed through allegedly fraudulent means. The whole thing has the bizarre air of a snake eating its own tail, except neither the snake nor the tail actually exists.  In the context of the suit, the Kleiman estate has nothing to lose by parroting Wright’s claims to be a bitcoin mega-billionaire: If the estate wins, Wright will have to pay out billions of dollars, whether he actually has all that bitcoin or not. A victory in the Kleiman suit wouldn’t in itself prove Wright’s claim to be Satoshi. But, strangely enough, losing would provide Wright another opportunity to show the world the truth: It seems likely that Wright would have to sell some of what his defense team is calling “Satoshi’s coins” to pay the claim.  The show continues on Monday with what is likely to be one for the books: The notoriously aggressive and flinty Wright is expected to take the stand himself.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,David Z.

42421701,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9bB,1636139724,NFTs Take Over NYC,"It’s hard to find words to describe the crypto phenomenon that New York is witnessing right now.  This week’s NFT.NYC conference, which was first held in February 2019 as a quirky curiosity before an audience of a few hundred early enthusiasts, was spread across six venues, with three days of programming covering 600 speakers. Some 5,500 tickets were sold – with space limitations leaving 3,000 more on the waitlist – to attendees who traded 700,000 speaker and sponsor swag NFTs.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  There were 15 different NFT-themed billboards in Times Square. There were parties, dinners, EDM raves and digital art galleries around town, many of which boasted NFT-promoting film and music stars. And there were countless newly created projects promoting everything from royalty solutions for musicians to whisky-backed NFTs. It was a carnival of innovation, a sprawling celebration of possibility.  But what is it all pointing to?  The most striking aspect of all this is how rapidly this industry has sprung up, seemingly out of nowhere, spawning new business models and inventions built on top of those new ideas. That’s what makes the evolution of this space so difficult to predict.  Yet, with that caveat in mind, I do think it’s worth reflecting on a few takeaways from the event, to try to make some sense of it all:  The power of evangelism  On our “Money Reimagined” podcast this week, Sam Ewen, head of CoinDesk Studios, used that religious term to describe how NFT enthusiasts share introductions, ideas, concepts and NFTs themselves, all of which are helping to grow the space at a rapid clip. It’s not purely altruistic because there are real tangible network effects that come from wider adoption, which boosts the value of the assets in question. But there’s also little doubt that the NFT community is truly passionate about this industry and that passion is a driver of its growth.  Ethereum is king  But for how much longer? There are various blockchains now servicing the NFT industry, but the undisputed king is still Ethereum. It’s little coincidence that ETH jumped to new record highs this week amid the hubbub around NFT.NYC. But the question is whether this leadership will be sustained. Gas fees – the costs of transacting – are often prohibitively high on Ethereum, because of network congestion. Newcomers in the space who landed here via the conference would have been shocked to discover that the fees often exceed the value of the NFT being traded. Newer blockchains such as Flow, Avalanche and Solana are now competing to offer lower-priced transfers and attracting more NFT action. Notably, the tokens of the latter two also soared this week.  When interoperability?  It’s all very well for business to migrate from Ethereum to Solana, but the risk is that in doing so we just build isolated silos that do not allow people to move their assets around. To make matters worse, even within blockchains access to the art attached to NFTs is often contingent on terms set by the marketplaces or platforms built on top of them. So people end up being forced to stay within those environments. The worry is that this technology, supposedly a pathway to the Web 3 future, is just leading to a new version of the old, Web 2 walled garden platforms.  The dominant marketplace, OpenSea, for example, is very well funded by venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, which have historically made their money investing in companies that follow Web 2 centralizing strategies. What’s needed are both protocols and standards that allow for interoperable asset transfers. The first is coming by way of protocols such as Polkadot, but there also needs to be a will to build in this way and to give up on monopoly interests. Hopefully, the evangelistic spirit and the desire to maximize network effects will drive people in that direction.  The metaverse? A metaverse?  Everyone in NFT land is talking about the metaverse, a term first coined by author Neal Stephenson, to describe the concept of a new digital existence. NFTs are seen as a kind of “property right” building block for that idea. Now Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of the newly renamed Meta (aka Facebook), claims to be building it. But it seems antithetical to the concept that this digital place would be controlled by proprietary interests. Maybe Facebook is building a version of the metaverse, but not the metaverse. Related to the prior point, we need an open metaverse. It’s nice to see Cyprus’ University of Nicosia, which was a trailblazer in providing blockchain courses, now leading the way on this topic with its Open Metaverse Initiative.  The power of celebrity  No matter how open these platforms are, we’re still going to face the reality that the real centralizing of power in the art and entertainment industry lies in the power of celebrity. That was brought home with the mania stirred up by big names turning up at NFT.NYC: Quentin Tarantino, with his “Pulp Fiction” NFT drop, a sold-out performance by Kaskade, and a Bored Ape Yacht Club-sponsored event featuring The Strokes, Lil Baby, Beck, Chris Rock, Aziz Ansari and Questlove.  In sum, while this conference showcased the frenetic innovation that makes NFTs a promise for a new, more decentralized digital economy, we will continue to confront some of the Old World human challenges within competing interests as the technology develops.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

So Do the Exploits,"The phrase “Code is Law” is often tossed around in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, posing that DeFi is able to self-regulate because code is intended to be used exactly how it was written. As CoinDesk reporter Andrew Thurman said, “Where one man might see an exploit, another may just see ‘crypto trading’.”  Under this self-regulation, the hacker of Indexed Finance is willing to argue in court that his or her permissible exploit of the DeFi protocol should be considered a fair game arbitrage trade. As the industry grows in size, the exploits grow more serious, with Cream depositors losing $130 million last week. Shortly after, it was announced that Aave had a similar vulnerability and tens of billions of dollars in deposits were at risk.  You’re reading an excerpt from Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Triple digit yield and price appreciation have been enough to bring $256 billion in total value locked (TVL) into DeFi and there are no signs of slowing down. Could the current growth rate be sustainable with inherent risk stemming from exploits and counterparty concentration becoming more obvious?  DeFi developers will undoubtedly learn from their mistakes and the industry will naturally become safer over time. However, the Aave vulnerability showed investors that no protocol is 100% safe.

Shares subsequently recovered some and were down about 1% as of the time of publishing.  “During the meeting, these representatives intended to review and explain previously published or publicly available information regarding Argo, but inadvertently disclosed certain information that could be viewed as material non-public information under U.S. securities laws or inside information under U.K. securities laws,” the company said in the filing with the London Stock Exchange.  Argo’s employees held a conversation with a person named Anthony Coyle that Coyle subsequently published on Twitter, the filing said. The discussion contained non-public information, including the potential increase in the company’s hashrate and the expected cost to build its planned facility in Texas, according to the filing.  Argo didn’t disclose which employees held the conversation, nor which Anthony Coyle published them on Twitter. CoinDesk couldn’t immediately identify the referenced tweets.  According to the filing, Coyle wrote in his tweet that the miner increased its hashrate by 25% by using immersion cooling, while Argo now says it doesn’t have sufficient data to make those claims. However, the technology is expected to make the mining machines more efficient and extend the lives of the older computers, the company said.  Moreover, the unnamed Argo employees also said that the total cost to build its 800 megawatt mining facility in Texas could be $1.5 billion to $2 billion. The miner said the range was based on several assumptions that could change, potentially causing the cost range to “differ materially” from what its employees shared.  Argo listed its American depositary shares on Nasdaq in September, and its stock is up roughly 3% since then, while the price of bitcoin has climbed about 37% over the same time period. Recently, the miner reported its third quarter earnings, where it achieved record revenue and EBITDA, while mining 597 bitcoin during the quarter.

The ECB is examining whether to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for retail payments, Panetta said in a speech at the Elcano Royal Institute, Madrid.  If payment trends in the European Union (EU) continue, cash could quickly lose its central role and become a redundant way of settling bills.  “Just as the postage stamp lost much of its usefulness with the arrival of the internet and email, so, too, could cash lose relevance in an economy that is becoming increasingly digital,” Panetta said.  The ECB, which had been discussing a CBDC since the start of the year, said in July it was moving to a more investigative phase that will last 24 months. A decision on whether to issue one would be made at a later stage, and that it was not envisaged to replace cash, Panetta said at the time.  Having a digital euro would allow people to continue using central bank money as a means of exchange in the digital era. The CBDC would have to be designed in a way that is attractive enough to become a widely used payment mechanism.  It should not, however, be viewed as a competitor to private payment services, he said. The digital euro should expand payment solutions without crowding out private payment services.

Powered by blockchain and smart contract technologies, this new breed of online betting platforms vastly improves the quality of services provided to users. Although the online betting industry continues to expand 9% annually, if we take blockchain out of the equation, not much is being done in terms of innovation. Also, users don&apos;t place much trust in online betting platforms, and with good reasons. There are countless stories of users receiving big prizes only to get their accounts frozen or be unable to withdraw the funds. Blockchain can help solve this issue and bring increased trust and transparency to online betting. Let&apos;s see how exactly. Advantages of decentralized betting One of the earliest innovations in blockchain betting was the creation of the provably fair games. Probably fair is a method through which users can verify the random number generator, the algorithm responsible for creating the randomness of every bet. This algorithm is hidden in traditional online betting platforms, and users have no way to verify that the house is being fair. Later on, with the advent of Ethereum and smart contracts, further transparency was added. Any bet made is now written into a smart contract, making it so all transactions can be seen and verified on the blockchain.

Amjad Qaqish, a former criminal investigation special agent at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), was named Binance’s director of global suspicious activity reporting Friday.  During his 30 years with the tax authority, Qaqish worked on cases relating to fraud, tax evasion, money laundering and terrorism financing, including those involving crypto.  His role will involve monitoring suspicious activity to prevent “bad actors misusing the cryptocurrency markets,” Binance said.  The hire is the latest of a series of appointments as the largest crypto exchange tightens up on regulatory compliance while tackling fraud and other criminal activity.

Korean Regulator Says NFTs Are Not Virtual Assets: Report,"South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) reaffirmed its view that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) generally do not fall under the definition of virtual assets and will not be regulated as such, according to a report from the Korea Herald.  “According to the basic position expressed by the International Anti-Money Laundering Organization (FATF), NFTs are not regulated,” the report said citing an unnamed Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) official.  The FIU is the FSC’s anti-money laundering division and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an international governmental body that drafts finance regulation, including on crypto.  However, the official left the door open to NFT regulation in some cases, as outlined in the FATF’s definition.  According to FATF’s latest guidance, NFTs are not virtual assets and don’t fall under its regulatory framework for crypto as long as they are used as “collectibles rather than as payment or investment.” Countries should consider whether NFTs are covered by FATF standards on a case-by-case basis, said the task force.  Some NFTs are only digital collectibles in name and marketing, when in reality they are being used for investment or payment, the FATF warned regulators. Other NFTs that are not virtual assets, but are digital representations of assets regulated by the FATF, the task force said.  “In order to be used as a payment method, a very large amount must be issued, but there is virtually no reason to make it an NFT that values scarcity,” the FIU official said.  Despite regulatory ambiguity, the NFT industry has flourished in the intellectual property-rich country, with superstar band’s BTS agency announcing plans to enter the industry yesterday.  S.

During the short bull market that has just ended, native public chain tokens differed from one another in terms of their performance in the secondary market. Even for public chains with moderate performance like BSC, the TVL rebounded after the May 19 crash. However, their token prices have been lower than those of other public chains (e.g. Solana) because the way TVL is calculated does not correctly reflect the actual TVL and capital flows. In fact, non-stablecoins constitute a significant proportion of TVL, and the prices of many non-stable assets are subject to market swings. This has led to a flawed evaluation method of &apos;price analysis based on token prices&apos;, and the right way to calculate the TVL trends should eliminate the impact of token prices movement. In this article, three TVL adjustment methods that exclude the impact of token prices are introduced. Some interesting analysis using the adjusted TVL is also provided. The data used by the research are the daily TVL statistics of the top 10 public chains (as per DeFiLlama&apos;s TVL ranking) from February 3, 2021, to September 25, 2021, and the closing price of the corresponding tokens.

The AFSA confirmed the news to CoinDesk via email later on Thursday.  Retail investors can invest 10% of their annual income or 5% of their total assets, excluding their main residence, up to $100,000 per year as long as they provide evidence of their finances to the regulator, the site reported.  Should investors not provide any evidence of their finances, they can invest up to $1,000 per month, according to Kapital.kz, which said it attained the information from the Astana Financial Services Agency (AFSA) directly.  The limits have been introduced to protect retail investors from crypto-related “high risks” that can include the complete loss of capital, the AFSA told Kapital.kz.  The AFSA has also created a roadmap to develop the crypto market in the country. Under the plan, crypto exchanges will operate as a pilot starting at the end of 2021 and for one year.  The rules set by the AFSA took effect on Oct. 26, the report said.  The agreed rules are harsher than those proposed by the Astana International Finance Center (AIFC) earlier, according to Kapital.kz. An AIFC committee had proposed a monthly limit of $2,000 for retail investors.

The project is a collaboration between the Bank of Thailand, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority (HKMA), the People’s Bank of China and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). It aims to lower costs and improve the speed of international transactions using CBDCs.  According to the announcement, major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Société Générale and China’s six biggest state-owned banks are also involved.  A total of 22 industry participants across jurisdictions will test the 15 use cases during a pilot that will start in 2022, said a brochure posted by Bank of Thailand that also revealed the specific projects.  Goldman Sachs Asia will test tokenized bond issuance and atomic settlement, DBS Bank Hong Kong will trial cross-boundary insurance payments between mainland China and Hong Kong, HSBC will try out “feature-rich” programmable trade finance, and Société Générale subsidiary FORGE will look into issuing digital native corporate bonds.  Already, “testing of sample trade settlement transactions across 11 industries has commenced on the trial platform,” according to a video presentation of the project at the Hong Kong conference.  The project’s steering committee has given priority to trade settlement because of the potential of mCBDC to lower costs and improve speed in the massive industry, according to the presentation. Trade between the four was more than $730 billion in 2019, the presentation noted citing World Bank data.  In September, the participating banks revealed that they had built a phase 2 prototype.  Head of the Hong Kong Centre of the BIS Innovation Hub, Bénédicte Nolens, described the project as a “massive undertaking.” Colin Pou, executive director at the HKMA, explained it is better to build a new system for CBDC settlement rather than try to recalibrate the existing infrastructure.
