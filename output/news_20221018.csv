Lightning as a scaling solution was really coming to maturity.‚Äù  Lechuga was referring to the fact that last month Lighting Labs, the developer of Bitcoin scaling layer Lightning Network, launched a test version of Taro, new software that allows Bitcoin developers to issue assets such as stablecoins on the blockchain. Taro is based on Taproot, a Bitcoin upgrade that activated late last year and gave developers an expanded toolbox to build projects.  ‚ÄúWe were starting to see entrepreneurs pouring into Bitcoin from not only other ecosystems but other disciplines ‚Äì people from the energy space, people from the technology space,‚Äù Lechuga continued.  Read more: What Is Bitcoin?  The Ego Death Capital LP opened to investments on Sept. 2 and had raised $11,425,000 toward the $30 million goal from 28 investors as of Sept. 15, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Capital for the fund came from its trio of partners, high net worth individuals, family offices and institutional investors, said Lechuga. Once all of the capital is raised, the fund plans to invest in 12 to 15 companies with an average check size of $1 million to $1.5 million. Half of the fund capital will go toward follow-on investments in the original batch of portfolio companies, according to Lechuga.  Ego Death technically made its first investment two months before the fund started raising capital. The firm invested an unspecified amount in Fedi, a mobile app powered by bitcoin custodian Fedimint that aims to make it easier for people to buy the digital asset.  Lechuga previously worked as a senior research associate at private equity firm Spencer Barnor Capital. Ego Death‚Äôs other partners are serial tech entrepreneur Jeff Booth and Andi Pitt, who spent several years at Goldman Sachs including a stint as vice president of trading. The firm also has a three-person advisory board: Lyn Alden Schwartzer, an investment researcher and board member at Swan Bitcoin; ""The Investor's Podcast"" show host and founder Preston Pysh; and Pablo Vernandez, head of research and development at Swan Bitcoin.  Ego Death Capital gets its distinctive name from a concept in meditation (and psychedelics) circles. ‚ÄúEgo death‚Äù refers to a phase of self-surrender ahead of a transition; in this case, the rise of Bitcoin as an abundant, accessible financial system. Lechuga and Andi Pitt stressed to CoinDesk the importance of bitcoin in emerging markets, particularly those with large unbanked or underbanked populations. Reaching those populations requires a continued buildout of the Bitcoin ecosystem.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very focused on what we‚Äôre calling layer 3 (the application layer) and sort of layer 2.5, the infrastructure,‚Äù said Pitt.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/18/new-bitcoin-focused-vc-firm-ego-death-capital-raising-30m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e0051756d2889e3ca565143e4490bb45b8e646b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was relatively flat, falling 1.64%.  Bitcoin (BTC) aligned with the CMI; its price dropped 1.77%. Trading activity was muted again and overall volume trailed bitcoin‚Äôs 20-day moving average. The decline marked the fifth consecutive day and ninth of the last 10 of lower-than-average volume. The exception occurred on Oct. 13, when trading spiked with the most recent release of the Consumer Price Index.  Ether‚Äôs (ETH) performance trailed the CMI, its price down 2.5%. ETH‚Äôs trading volume was also below average, falling below its 20-day average in eight of the last 10 days. Ether sold off sharply during the 13:00 and 14:00 UTC (9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. ET) hours, as traditional U.S. markets opened. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell below the psychologically important $1,300 mark.  The top altcoin gainers recently were ANKR and XYO Networks‚Äô XYO, which rose 16% and 15%, respectively. The poorest-performing altcoins on the day were JasmyCoin‚Äôs JASMY and Vulcan Forged‚Äôs PYR token.  Macro View  Traditional financial markets rose on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 increasing 1.08%, .78% and 1.05%, respectively.  Breadth metrics, which measures the number of stocks moving higher versus decliners, were positive; 67% of stocks across the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE rose.  Macroeconomic data was scant on Tuesday, though one report showed year-over-year industrial production rose 5.3% in September. The growth in production exceeded estimates for 3.9% growth, and was the largest increase since April.  In commodities, West Texas Intermediate crude and European Brent crude fell 3.7% and 1.5% respectively. Safe haven gold declined 0.47%. Copper futures, often viewed as an indicator of economic health, declined 1.7%. Year to date, copper prices are down approximately 25%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Crypto Volatility Declines While Estimated Leverage Increases  Crypto markets continue to operate in an environment of sideways trading, low volume and decreasing volatility.  An investor who bought bitcoin in mid-June will have seen little if any gain over the past four months.  Since that time BTC reached a short-term high of $24,000 in August, but the price has declined approximately 20% since then.  ETH has also entered a season of trading flat, but investors who added to their ETH on June 18 would be up close to 31%. The lead-up to the Sept. 15 Ethereum Merge upgrade from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake likely explains the additional alpha.  The ETH/BTC ratio rose 61% between June 18 and Sept. 8, illustrating the degree of outperformance. Since that peak, the ETH/BTC ratio has declined by 20%.  BTC‚Äôs Average True Range (ATR), a measure of price movement and a proxy for volatility, has declined 67% over the past four months and 72% year to date. ETH‚Äôs ATR has declined 60% since June 18 and 72% year to date.  For both BTC and ETH, the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool implies that both assets are trading near levels of significant activity. VPVR illustrates trading volume by price level, and identifies prices where high levels of trading activity occur, labeled ‚Äúhigh-volume nodes.‚Äù  With both BTC and ETH trading near areas of significant price agreement, they‚Äôre likely to continue trading flat, absent a catalyst that would shift sentiment.  While prices have been flat, growth in leverage has not, as the futures estimated leverage ratio (ELR) for both has been on the rise.  Over the last month, the ELR for BTC has increased from 0.30 to 0.38, while for ETH, the ELR has risen from 0.21 to 0.24.  Increases in an asset‚Äôs leverage ratio increases the risk of liquidation, should prices go opposite investors anticipated direction.  Insight into sentiment can be gleaned by viewing the options open interest by strike price, which shows increases in options to buy BTC at both the $19,500 and $19,750 strike prices.  Positive BTC funding rates in eight of the last 10 days also imply that sentiment is bullish.  Investors long BTC should be mindful in the coming days because increased leverage combined with bullish bets can lead to forced liquidations, and cascading declines should prices turn negative.

42394178,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvY2kn,1666123574,"Web 3 Isn‚Äôt Dead, Despite What Critics Might Say","‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù is the latest in a line of phrases that media pundits and technology evangelists alike have deemed a Holy Grail of tech development. Promises of ‚Äúa new internet‚Äù and killer applications have resulted in much excitement and enthusiasm.  This, in turn, has set the stage for dramatic disappointment. This year has seen high-profile collapses of tokens, a sharp drop in interest in non-fungible token (NFT) markets, and the hotly contested metaverse territory continuing to figure out what exactly it will offer. On the heels of this turbulence, commentators have been quick to proclaim the early death of Web3. Jack Dorsey even announced ‚ÄúWeb5,‚Äù which he touted as ‚Äúextra decentralized.‚Äù  Jesse Morris is CEO at Energy Web, a nonprofit developing open-source products for energy systems to help accelerate the renewable energy transition.  But it would be a mistake to move on so soon when the solutions represented by Web3 are only getting started.  With the term being used so freely, it‚Äôs worth taking a moment to re-clarify what Web3 really means. While Web2 can be characterized by central platforms controlled by tech giants, Web3 refers to a variety of technologies and services that enable a new means of exchanging data and value between parties with built-in security, privacy, and efficiency. In practice, this means networks of businesses, individuals and devices, each with their own data silos, security and policies, can exchange data in an entirely new way.  See also: Why We Need to Build Web3 Differently | Opinion  At its core, Web3 is about decentralization. The technologies that enable it are primarily related to blockchain and cryptography, but these are the tools rather than the principle itself ‚Äì a world where data from different businesses, individuals and physical devices can be seamlessly shared and verified in a privacy-preserving, low-cost way. It‚Äôs designed for a future that will become increasingly distributed, and for this reason remains foundational to how some sectors will eventually operate.  Rather than the end of the line for Web3, recent negativity can be compared to the first dot-com crash at the beginning of the millennium. It can be thought of as a readjustment in expectations that works to separate the wheat from the chaff. The current skeptical environment should be welcomed by the many developers currently working on applications that unlock actual value.  Web3 applications in real business settings have already shown themselves to be quietly transformational. For large banks, blockchain can make same-day international payments simpler and cheaper by reducing intermediaries in the process, a streamlining that couldn‚Äôt be achieved without a trusted technological infrastructure between parties. The rise of Web3 has also led to innovation in the peer-to-peer financial services space, enabling neobanks to offer services to the traditionally underbanked.  See also: Which Web 3 Protocols Are Most Likely to Succeed? A VC Suggests a Common Thread | Opinion  Supply chains, meanwhile, are increasingly leveraging blockchain and other data-driven technologies to create new levels of trust, transparency and accountability across international value chains. This includes carbon efficiency and carbon accounting approaches that are pivotal to combating climate change.  Further ahead of the curve than any other, and perhaps also where there remains the most work to be done, is the energy sector. Web3 is uniquely well-suited to answer the longstanding need for a decentralized approach to energy markets and the much needed transformation of energy grids.  For the past 100 years, the model for energy markets has been the same. Large, fixed power plants produce energy flows with predictable operating parameters and peak periods. A one-way flow of power from utilities to consumers is met with a one-way flow of money in the opposite direction.  Today, this has been turned on its head. Grid management now requires factoring in distributed renewable energy assets, behind-the-meter generation, consumers who can sell back to the grid and more. The power plant is now owned by you, me and the businesses around us, a distributed but connected system composed of networks of rooftop solar systems, inverters, batteries, EVs and smart appliances, making the generation, storage and demand picture far more complex.  The central issue is that while the hardware environment has changed dramatically, the software that underpins the grid hasn‚Äôt. Web2 technologies have a difficult time enabling devices owned by different people and organizations to communicate and exchange data with one another in order for all these assets to be integrated with the grid.  Web3 technologies, on the other hand, are ideally suited to the challenge. At the Energy Web Foundation, we were able to build a system from the ground up that can put all market participants ‚Äì from the world‚Äôs biggest utilities to individual electric vehicles (EV) ‚Äì into conversation with one another. Rather than keeping the data necessary to run the grid separated into siloes, our operating system allows for a shared digital infrastructure where participants can maintain their own platforms and parameters while sharing data in a trusted way. In Australia, a product based on this operating system has already been deployed in collaboration with the energy market operator. Utilities and aggregators are working together to operate a shared system, which sees the owners of small-scale assets being paid for the services they provide.  This kind of shared success is the measure by which Web3 will succeed or fail. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not worried when I see excitement deflating in the public eye. Once the rubble of hype cycles and overpromises clears away, what will be left is an infrastructure for creating stronger, fairer and more flexible systems ‚Äì which is where the value for everyone really lies.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Morris,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/18/web-3-isnt-dead-despite-what-critics-might-say,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42422178,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0iJlh,1666123511,"Bitcoin Slips as Stocks Rise, Sparking Speculation Over Correlation","Crypto markets were lower in U.S. midday trading, underperforming stocks as the correlation between bitcoin and the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 Index fell to the lowest point since January.  The CoinDesk Market Index fell by 1.6% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was down 1.7%, changing hands in a range between $19,300 and $19,700. Ether (ETH), the second-largest by market capitalization, followed a similar trajectory, down 2% to about $1,300 as of press time.  For most of this year bitcoin has traded in sync with stocks as the Federal Reserve tightened monetary conditions as part of a campaign to bring down soaring inflation ‚Äì putting downward pressure on prices for risky assets including stocks and cryptocurrencies.  Recently, the strong correlation has faded, and digital-asset analysts are wondering whether cryptocurrencies might be decoupling from stocks.  According to IntoTheBlock, a crypto data and analysis firm, the 30-day correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 has fallen to 0.04 ‚Äì basically nothing because a correlation near 0 suggests no price linkage whatsoever.  The S&P 500 rose 1% on Tuesday, buoyed by earnings news, including a better-than-expected profit report from Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street firm‚Äôs shares jumped 3% on the news, according to Reuters.  The recent episodes of price divergence are ‚Äúmaking crypto investors wonder if the nascent asset class has decoupled from top indices,‚Äù said Iakov Levin, founder and CEO of crypto investment platform Midas Investments.  Traders in both crypto and traditional markets remain acutely focused on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate hikes, speculating on how aggressively the U.S. central bankers will keep ratcheting rate higher over the rest of this year.  Last week, a hotter-than-expected inflation report whipsawed bitcoin‚Äôs price along with stocks.  Based on trading in federal funds futures on the CME exchange, there is a 95% chance of a 75 basis point (0.75 percentage point) rate hike at the Federal Reserve‚Äôs next monetary policy meeting in November ‚Äì triple the more typical increment of 25 basis points in prior interest rate cycles.  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, said that the Fed's aggressive interest hikes are now ‚Äúlikely priced in,‚Äù and the prolonged uncertainty over the Russia-Ukraine war ‚Äúseems to be ameliorating.‚Äù  If stocks continue surging, bitcoin might reverse course and trade higher, Midas Investments‚Äôs Levin said.  Even so, he said, ‚ÄúInvestors in both worlds are still very cautious of the market per the headwinds that are still ahead.‚Äù  Further clues as to whether bitcoin is decoupling from stocks might come next week, when a slew of additional companies are scheduled to publish quarterly earnings.  ‚ÄúIt's still too early to call for the end of the highly correlated regime, but investors are likely to get a better feel for this following the Microsoft, Google, Apple and Amazon earnings release next week,‚Äù said Outumuro.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/18/bitcoin-slips-as-stocks-rise-sparking-speculation-over-correlation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5312b4efa3782ebd0469bbdfe2fbeeb8d158a659-1120x580.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In March, CEO Stephen Ehrlich and then-Chief Financial Officer Evan Psaropoulos agreed to allow Voyager to lend Three Arrows nearly $1 billion in crypto with very little financial disclosure from the fund, according to the filings.  When LUNA and its sister token terraUSD began to collapse in May, Voyager sought to determine the impact on Three Arrows and was initially told Three Arrows had only limited exposure to LUNA. Later in June, however, 3AC employee Tim Lo advised Voyager to recall all of its loans to 3AC because he was concerned that 3AC‚Äôs founders weren't responding to requests for information from Lo and other employees.  With hours of that communication, Voyager recalled all its outstanding loans to 3AC, and the hedge fund soon entered into liquidation in the British Virgin Islands.  A special committee comprised of two of Voyager‚Äôs board members found that pursuing negligence claims against Ehrlich and Psaropoulos, who is now Voyager‚Äôs chief commercial officer, would be difficult and expensive and that Voyager would be unlikely to recover much.  Instead, Voyager is suggesting a settlement that would have Ehrlich pay $1.1 million in cash to Voyager, pursue claims under directors and officers insurance policies for as much as $20 million and allow Ehrlich and Psaropoulos to continue in their current roles.  The settlement is subject to approval by the bankruptcy judge in the case.  Toronto-based Voyager filed for bankruptcy in New York in July, in large part because of the losses from its loans to Three Arrows.

Jim Himes (D-Conn.) argued that a stablecoin bill will not pass before Congress&apos; term expires in January, The Block reported Tuesday, citing the Congressman speaking at the Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit hosted by CoinDesk. His remarks come even as a number of lawmakers in recent months have worked to form new regulations to oversee the emerging space. In July, for instance, House policymakers Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) and Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.) reportedly neared a bipartisan deal to impose tougher rules on stablecoins in a bid to stave off financial stability risks. Himes said a stablecoin bill probably won&apos;t pass in early 2023, while noting &apos;four years ago if you said Bitcoin, crypto and DeFi in the halls of Congress, nobody would have known what you were talking about. The progress that has been made in Congress is pretty remarkable,&apos; as quoted by The Block. Stablecoins are designed to be pegged to the value of a more &apos;stable&apos; asset such as fiat currencies. The two biggest ones by market cap are tether (USDT-USD) ($68.45B value) and USD Coin (USDC-USD) ($44.68B value), both of which are tied to the value of the U.S. dollar.

In an interview with Laura Shin on the ""Unchained"" podcast, Kwon explained that he moved to Singapore from South Korea before the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, which saw $60 billion in value evaporate in May.  ""There's no reason why any government official would believe we fled to Singapore,"" Kwon said.  Kwon, who was also behind failed stablecoin project Basis Cash in 2020, also dismissed claims that any of his funds have been frozen.  ""To say that the funds are frozen, I have not used KuCoin or OKX, as far as I can remember. I don't have any funds there. If they froze $67 million I would definitely have noticed,"" he reiterated. KuCoin and OKX are crypto exchanges.  ""There has been allegations that we moved LFG [Luna Foundation Guard] funds into a Gemini custody wallet and that it's sitting there. All we did ‚Äì to confirm a trade with market maker ‚Äì is transfer it to an address on the market maker's instruction,"" he continued.  The collapse of the Terra ecosystem led to widespread financial and emotional damage across the crypto industry, with some investors reportedly losing their life savings. A man in Taiwan reportedly committed suicide after losing $2 million.  ""Yes, I am sorry,"" Kwon responded after being pressed for an apology by Shin. ""It could seem that the way we are responding to allegations and news reports that we are being defensive. That is not the case.  ""Statements about the stability of UST led traders to gain confidence in a system that ultimately failed.

It lets you sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) ‚Äì unique crypto tokens that usually bear a pointer to a piece of digital art or music or an in-game collectible.  The company announced on Aug. 2, 2022, that it is going multichain and will expand its offerings to Ethereum NFTs, but its primary ecosystem and main blockchain is Solana.  On October 14, 2022, Magic Eden made a controversial move to an optional royalty model, saying market conditions forced the move which ‚Äúwas effectively a race to the bottom."" They also announced they were waiving their 2% platform fee and devoting funds to developing royalty enforcement tools.  How to use Magic Eden  To use Magic Eden, you‚Äôll need a Solana-compatible wallet (such as Trust Wallet or Exodus Wallet) filled with some SOL ‚Äì enough to pay for your NFT, plus the transaction fee on the Solana blockchain. Hit ‚Äúconnect wallet‚Äù on the top right of the site ‚Äì no need to create an account ‚Äì then click on a collection and bid on a project. It‚Äôs really an interface for Solana NFTs, so any Solana NFT project is hosted on the platform.  The largest NFT collection by trading volume and floor price, as of this writing, is Okay Bears, a profile-picture collection of bears. Like market leader OpenSea, Magic Eden lets you sort through collections by attributes ‚Äì in this case, the hats, fur and eyewear of the bears. In the world of NFTs, rarer attributes, or at least those with community cachet, often sell for more SOL than those with more common attributes.  Magic Eden also offers an iOS app. The app, however, only supports browsing ‚Äì you‚Äôll have to head to the site on a web browser and connect your web3 wallet to trade NFTs.  There are plans for the marketplace to add support for ETH, the native coin of Ethereum, the blockchain that supports most NFT trading activity. Magic Eden‚Äôs first ETH-supported collection will be Ezu, an NFT project that can be minted in either ETH or SOL.  Magic Eden also sells Magic Tickets, which provide access to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). In practice, that‚Äôs a Discord chat that lets users vote on how the marketplace operates.  The marketplace has a launchpad ‚Äì a part of the site that lets projects mint NFTs on Magic Eden. The benefit for projects is that they are featured on Magic Eden‚Äôs site ‚Äì kind of like an artist selling off works at a major auction house, like Christie‚Äôs. Magic Eden claims that just 3% of projects that apply to the launchpad make it through the application process.  The marketplace also has a white-label marketplace used by, for instance, Raydium, a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on Solana.  Magic Eden History and notable news  Four friends founded the marketplace in September 2021: Chief Technology Officer and former Uber Eats developer Sidney Zhang; CEO and former FTX employee Jack Lu; Chief Operating Officer and former Coinbase product manager Zhuoxun Yin; and chief engineer and former Facebook developer Zhuojie Zhou.  In July 2022, Magic Eden raised $130 million in a Series B funding round led by Electric Capital and Greylock, with backing from Paradigm and Sequoia Capital. The funding round, which followed a $27 Series A in March, brought the marketplace to a $1.6 billion valuation.  In August 2022, a major wallet on Solana called Phantom wallet was compromised. It blamed Slope, another wallet provider that was also compromised, draining close to $6M dollars in funds from almost 8,000 wallets, according to data from Elliptic. Magic Eden itself remained unaffected.  Magic Eden vs. OpenSea  On Solana, Magic Eden's trading volume trounces OpenSea, the market leader for NFT trading that added support for Solana in April 2022. Magic Eden captures 97% to 99% of the daily volume for Solana NFTs, according to a dashboard on Dune Analytics from SeaLaunch that derives trading data from the two platforms‚Äô trading fees.  Still, OpenSea remains the larger platform in terms of daily sales across all blockchains. While Magic Eden averages around 55,000 SOL a day, or $2.1 million as of this writing, OpenSea records trades about $15 million in Ethereum every 24 hours.  Network dominance marks the major difference between the two marketplaces. Solana is a rival to Ethereum, so Magic Eden and OpenSea maintain their dominance on very different playing fields. Solana‚Äôs main difference, as of August 2022, is that it‚Äôs faster and cheaper to use than Ethereum.  The network‚Äôs token, SOL, was a favorite of venture capitalists and major players, including FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and the bankrupt (but once popular) crypto VC fund, Three Arrows Capital. When the crypto market crashed in 2022, SOL cratered from $258 in November 2021 to lows of $26 in mid-June.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-magic-eden-how-to-get-started-on-the-nft-marketplace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/001b34057bd33735d9dd61841f4ec0455a26a45b-838x629.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The funding will help build out the products, add new artificial intelligence and machine learning methods, and expand the team.  Alongside the funding, Web3 Builders announced TrustCheck, a free scam prevention tool for those transacting with cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and non-fungible tokens. The Chrome browser extension instantly analyzes the risk of a given crypto transaction by running checks against the company‚Äôs machine-learning engine.  TrustCheck uses data from over a dozen sources that cover tens of thousands of reported and validated scams, and hundreds of millions of addresses.  ‚ÄúWhen we think about the next billion users adopting crypto, you have to take these really powerful concepts, and these powerful engines under the hood, and create really simple and easy to understand user experiences,‚Äù Web3 Builders CEO Ricky Pellegrini told CoinDesk in an interview.  TrustCheck checks for scams programmatically, such as searching for wallet drainer template code, and with a team of humans to take a multi-layered approach. From a product demonstration provided to CoinDesk, the TrustCheck user interface should feel familiar to anyone who has used a Web2 antivirus product. If a user tries to buy an NFT from a trusted site, TrustCheck shows the checks the site passed and explains what the transaction will do. Visiting a known scam site will throw up an immediate warning page. Proceeding past the page will lead to another warning when the site attempts a fraudulent transaction to steal wallet contents.  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs become clear is that a lot of the time, the way most people are getting scammed is a direct message on Twitter or Discord that takes them to a phishing site that leads them to a wallet drainer,‚Äù explained Pellegrini.

The capital will go toward hiring more employees, expanding its network and increasing its community, Shetty told CoinDesk in an interview.  Other investors in the round included Big Brain Holdings, DFG, Ghaf Capital Partners and Foresight Ventures, among others.  Shardeum is an Ethereum virtual machine-based sharded blockchain, meaning anything that works on Ethereum can work on Shardeum.  Sharding generally refers to splitting a blockchain‚Äôs infrastructure into smaller pieces to improve scalability, a noted problem with the Ethereum blockchain, and to speed up transaction times and lower fees. Shardeum can scale infinitely, expanding transactions per second as demand increases, Shetty said.  Read more: What Is Sharding?  ‚ÄúShardeum acts a lot like your traditional websites, where if you get a lot of traffic, you just add a server so it expands,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe same concept works on Shardeum, where every time there‚Äôs a lot of traffic, you need more transactions. You just add more nodes and the transaction capacity increases.‚Äù  Shardeum isn‚Äôt the first sharded blockchain. Near is another notable example. Shetty says Shardeum stands apart by expanding transactions per second every time a node joins a network rather than having to add a shard for each increase. Shardeum also offers ""atomic composability,"" meaning that smart contracts can communicate between shards.  End users are often required to take on the complexity of a sharded blockchain by choosing which shard to use, whereas users can interact with Shardeum in the same way they do with a traditional blockchain like Ethereum.  In the next couple of weeks, Shardeum plans to introduce an ""autoscale"" feature that will allow the transactions per second to automatically contract when traffic goes down. The blockchain‚Äôs test network will launch by the end of the year with the mainnet following in the second quarter of 2023.  Over the next year, Shardeum will host hackathons in India and the U.S. and provide an incentive platform for developers who want to help build and grow the blockchain‚Äôs ecosystem.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at India as one of the major markets for us.

In January 2021, the FCA became the supervisory body for anti-money laundering compliance for crypto firms in the country.  ""While we do not regulate or supervise the cryptocurrency business, these firms are required to be registered with the FCA and they are required to comply with the money laundering regulations,"" Steward said during a speech in March 2021.  At that time, the FCA had already set up the list for ""unregistered"" crypto companies to help investors recognize firms authorized by the FCA to operate in the country. In September, the FCA made headlines when it added billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried-owned crypto exchange FTX to its list of unauthorized firms.  The FCA has previously come under fire from the crypto industry for delays in processing applications for registration, while the regulator has blamed the delays on the ""quality of the information provided"" by the crypto firms looking for approval.

42422186,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0iK5h,1666090952,Growing Popularity of Cash-Margined Bitcoin Futures Suggests Crypto 'Liquidation Cascades' Might Become Rare,"The bitcoin (BTC) derivatives market has undergone a significant structural change in the past 18 months, making the asset class less vulnerable to volatility-inducing liquidation cascades.  The cash-margined contracts, which require traders to deposit the U.S. dollar or dollar-linked assets like stablecoins as collateral to take leveraged bets, now account for a record 65% of the total open positions (or open interest) in the BTC futures market, according to data tracked by analytics firm Glassnode.  That's significantly higher than the 30% seen in April 2021 when the crypto-margined contracts dominated the futures market activity. The crypto-margined contracts, also known as inverse contracts, require traders to deposit a cryptocurrency as collateral. According to Glassnode, the growing popularity of cash-margined contracts represents an improvement in the health of the derivative collateral structure.  ""This acts to reduce the probability of an amplified liquidation cascade while also demonstrating the growing market demand for stablecoin collateral,"" Glassnode's analyst James Check said in a weekly note sent to subscribers.  Liquidation refers to the forced closure of all or portion of a bullish/bearish (long/short) futures position when the trader cannot fulfill the margin or collateral requirements for a leveraged position.  A liquidation cascade happens when an event leads to sudden bullish or bearish price action, triggering mass forced closures of long/short positions, which, in turn, exacerbate price turbulence, leading to further liquidations. In other words, a small move becomes larger as exchanges liquidate positions with margin shortfall, causing a feedback loop.  Large liquidation cascades were quite common before mid-2021 when crypto-margined were more popular than cash-margined ones.  These contracts are quoted in U.S. dollars (USD), but margined and settled in cryptocurrencies. It's the case of collateral being as volatile as the position, exposing the trader to liquidations. For instance, assume an entity takes a long position in a BTC/USD inverse contract, representing 1 BTC, collateralized and settled in BTC and quoted at $10,000 at press time.  If the price rises by 10% to $11,000, the profit of $1,000 will be paid in BTC valued at the current market price ($11,000). In other words, the trader will earn a profit of 0.09 BTC or 9% on one BTC. On the contrary, if the market drops by 10% to $9,000, the trader will lose $1,000, amounting to a loss of 0.11 BTC or 11% on one BTC.  Essentially, the long position bleeds faster as bitcoin becomes cheaper relative to USD. Further, the collateral, BTC, also loses value, compounding losses. As such, the margin required to keep the position increases sharply. If the entity fails to provide the same, the position is liquidated.  ""Your margin requirements increase in a nonlinear way, which is why bulls burst their positions quickly when the market falls,"" Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto spot and derivatives exchange BitMEX, said in an explainer.  The blue line, representing the percentage profit and loss from a long position in a crypto-margined contract, shows a non-linear payoff. In this case, the trading entity loses more when the market drops and earns less when the market rallies. The latter happens because, after the market rally, BTC itself becomes costlier relative to USD.  ""Coin-margined contracts are convex when it is calculated by USD, which brings relatively higher liquidation risk and potential user losses (under the USD standard),"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk.  Cash-margin contracts flipped crypto-margined ones in terms of market domination a year ago. ""The proportion decline of coin-margined futures has already begun in 2021. The reason is that the inflow of a large number of US dollars not only inflates the market value of the entire crypto market, but also amplifies the original convexity of coin-margined futures,"" Ardern noted.  Cash- or stablecoin-margined contracts have a linear payoff, with profit and loss measured and paid in dollars. That makes them somewhat less vulnerable to liquidations.  ""Cash-margined contracts are relatively concise and not mathematically convex, making them easier for retail investors to understand and easier for exchanges to liquidate.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/18/growing-popularity-of-cash-margined-bitcoin-futures-suggests-that-crypto-liquidation-cascades-might-become-rare,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a490caa06dbaaf843fc7fde8a544c872165a1dce-7456x4294.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434994,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGndjt,1666086401,DappRadar Says Decentraland has 650 Daily Active Users,"Decentraland has been upgraded from a hamlet to a village, according to revised numbers from the data platform DappRadar.  DappRadar says there are now 650 daily Unique Active Wallets (UAW) on Decentraland, or users interacting with the dapp, defined as a decentralized application that runs on a blockchain without a central administrator.     ‚ÄúThe DappRadar tooltip describes the UAW or user data as the ‚Äònumber of unique wallet addresses interacting with a dApp‚Äôs smart contracts.‚Äô So, to be counted by DappRadar, a user needs to make a blockchain transaction,‚Äù the data company explained.  Over the course of the last 30 days, there were a total of 7,490 unique users on the platform with a total of $110,390 in volume. In total, on-chain data shows that there‚Äôs a balance of $28.8 million in assets with the dapp‚Äôs smart contracts.  DappRadar‚Äôs data shows that the largest number of active users came in late September, when the platform saw just over 1,300 online at once.  When CoinDesk reported that were 38 users across Decentraland‚Äôs $1.1 billion platform, citing DappRadar‚Äôs numbers, there was a considerable amount of pushback from Decentraland, which claimed that there were over 55,000 thousand monthly active users on its platform.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to note that data on the blockchain is unchangeable, and therefore it doesn‚Äôt lie,‚Äù DappRadar said in a blog post. ‚ÄúHowever, this data doesn‚Äôt always mean the same for each dapp. Furthermore, blockchain data doesn‚Äôt always paint the entire picture.‚Äù  But doing a census of the metaverse is difficult, and Decentraland‚Äôs official numbers just don‚Äôt add up to other publicly available data, especially as they don‚Äôt account for bots or idle users.  Decentraland‚Äôs numbers from Catalyst Monitor, a tool for tracking the load on each of its servers which it calls catalysts, show there are 509 active users as of Tuesday afternoon Asia time. Nansen‚Äôs Entity Billboard tool, which tracks 72 of Decentraland‚Äôs smart contracts, shows there are less than 400 users.  Both of these align with DappRadar‚Äôs revised numbers.  To put things into context, the top PC games on the gaming platform Steam have active player counts in the mid-hundreds of thousands during the North American evening, according to tracking tool SteamCharts. Dota 2 would have just north of 600,000 during this window, while PUBG: Battlegrounds has almost 400,000.  When compared with a PC game, Decentraland‚Äôs numbers would put it in line with the current active monthly players on the fighting game Tekken 7, which launched in 2015, or the critically panned Battlefield 2042, considered to be a disaster by executives.  At the same time, Meta‚Äôs Horizon Worlds metaverse is also falling short, as the Wall Street Journal reported. Internal company documents, according to the Journal, put its monthly active users at less than 200,000 which is far below its initial goal of 500,000.  The Journal reported that only 9% of worlds built by creators are ever visited by at least 50 people, and most are never visited at all.  Research by CoinDesk suggests that the number could be even lower, perhaps in the tens of thousands. Decentraland‚Äôs MANA token is down 1% on the day, and is currently trading at 64 cents. The token is down 80% year to date.  Exchange data aggregated by Kaiko shows that the trading volume of metaverse tokens is at an all-time low, from a peak in late 2021.  At the time token trading was evenly distributed between the Sandbox and Decentraland tokens, but now what's left of the trading volume is effectively just SAND, with AXS, MANA, and ENJ being virtually eliminated.

According to tracking from Coingecko, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,332.18, going up by 2.1% over the last 24 hours and tallying an increase of 3.2% over the past week. But the digital asset is still performing badly considering it is nowhere near its all-time high of $4,878 attained on November 10, 2021. By this date last year, the altcoin opened its day with a trading price of $3,848, which is almost thrice as much as its current value. Moreover, Ethereum is coming off a major price dump, losing 26% of its $1,773 price on September 10. While the crypto, along with its fellow digital currencies are no stranger to price drops caused by the unpredictable volatility of their market, experts think big investors of Ethereum are somehow responsible for its recent slump.

On-chain data from Aptos‚Äô block explorer shows the protocol is currently processing four transactions per second. During the development process the Aptos team said that its parallel execution engine was capable of processing 160,000 transactions per second (far above speed demon Solana‚Äôs advertised 65,000 per second).  Also, the vast majority of these, as Crypto Twitter personality Paradigm Engineer #420 pointed out, are not actual transactions from users but rather maintenance messages from validators writing metadata to the blockchain.  ‚ÄúIt's hard to see how users can even use Aptos right now, I personally cannot find any rpcs nor connect with any validators to send transactions,‚Äù they wrote.  The engineer also pointed out that nearly 80% of the tokens on Aptos are staked, which they said will result in them being dumped on retail users.  In a post on the Aptos Discord, the team said the TPS shown was a ""function of network activity"" and having announced the activation of the mainnet only a few hours ago there are no user transactions yet. Those are expected to start tomorrow.  The race for a faster blockchain  As institutional interest in digital assets increases, there‚Äôs a hunt for infrastructure that can keep up to the demands of real-world finance applications. Right now, Ethereum in its current form can do a maximum of 15 transactions per second, and has done an average of 13 TPS during the past month. Ethereum 2.0, when complete, will have a theoretical ceiling of 100,000 TPS.  Venture capital firms have been enthusiastically looking for this nirvana, and hundreds of millions of dollars have been deployed to build out faster blockchains.  Jump Capital, as an example, has doubled down on its commitment to Solana, investing in fixing the back-end infrastructure of the once-hot protocol, which has suffered from a number of high-profile breakdowns during the last year.  Jump has also invested in Aptos, alongside FTX and a16z in Aptos‚Äô $150 million series A round.  Trust from investors  But Ethereum, despite its sluggishness, still has the trust of investors with 58% of the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) on that protocol, according to aggregator DefiLlama.  After Tron and Binance‚Äôs BNB Smart Chain, which have 10.2% and 9.9%, respectively, the rest of the total value locked (TVL) is split among protocols that have 1%-2% at most, like Solana, which has 1.72%.  Part of this long-tail distribution likely comes from the skepticism about the integrity of platforms.  As CoinDesk reported earlier, Solana has struggled with developers faking the size of the ecosystem and high-profile exploits including the hack of Mango Markets that preyed upon the immaturity of the codebase.  This won‚Äôt bode well for Aptos as Ian and Dylan Macalinao, who operated under 11 different pseudonyms while building for Solana, say they are moving on to Aptos next.  And Avraham Eisenberg, part of a group that drained $114 million from Solana-based DeFi platform Mango Markets last week before returning $67 million, recently tweeted, ominously: ‚ÄúSo guys are there lending protocols on Aptos?‚Äù  UPDATE (Oct. 18, 2022 07:12 UTC): Adds details on amplification regarding transactions per second.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | APT | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/18/ftx-a16z-backed-aptos-blockchain-off-to-a-rocky-start,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15adead72c5233209ef8551caa99402729631c19-3536x2652.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

LeXpunK Army, a group that received permission to file an amicus ‚Äì or friend of the court ‚Äì brief in the ongoing Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) lawsuit against Ooki DAO, argued that the federal regulatory agency should be required to identify and directly serve any people it believes has violated federal law rather than the DAO as an entity.  The CFTC alleged that Ooki DAO was an unincorporated association last month, suing it while simultaneously settling charges against bZeroX, the DAO's predecessor centralized company and founders Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner. Last week, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam described Ooki DAO's behavior ‚Äì that is, offering the same illicit products bZeroX previously offered without registering or operating a know-your-customer program ‚Äì as so ""egregious"" that the agency had no choice but to bring charges.  Still, it's how the CFTC has brought these charges that has attorneys in the crypto industry sounding alarm bells. The agency sought court permission to serve the entire DAO at once by posting the lawsuit on a public forum and through a help bot. Judge William Orrick, of the Northern District of California, briefly approved this move, before responding to two motions for leave to file amicus briefs brought by LeXpunK and the DeFi Education Fund (meaning they asked for permission to join the case). DEF filed its amicus brief alongside its motion to join, which the judge accepted after the fact. LeXpunK had until the end of Monday to file its own amicus brief. Another party, crypto venture fund Paradigm, asked the court to file its own amicus brief earlier on Monday.  In it, the group argues that whether a DAO is an unincorporated association should be interpreted under the Commodity Exchange Act's federal statutes, rather than under any state concerns.  ""While the CEA includes an 'association' within in the definition of 'person', ... nothing in the statutory text suggests that a DAO is an association,"" wrote Brown Rudnick attorneys Stephen Palley and Samuel Moniz, and attorney Alex Golubitsky in the brief.  The filing also expresses concern that serving a DAO, which the brief argues should be seen as software, means it may be impossible for anyone to challenge the precedent.  ""No person will be able to challenge whether the CFTC‚Äôs actions in expanding the definition of 'person' comport with the requirements of the APA [Administrative Procedures Act] if a default judgment is entered in this matter on the CFTC‚Äôs behalf,"" the filing said.  Allowing the default action would allow the CFTC to ""effectively"" create a rule bypassing the APA, the attorneys argue.  ""In short, there is no independent statutory basis to support the CFTC‚Äôs assertion that Ooki DAO is a person or an association. Without this authority, service on Ooki DAO cannot be approved by this Court, whether under FCRP 4 or otherwise,"" the attorneys wrote.  The CFTC does have existing precedent it can point to in bringing a lawsuit against individuals it believes violated the law, the filing said.  ""But if the CFTC alleges that individuals it cannot identify are responsible for CEA violations, the solution is to name them as fictitious defendants until such persons can be identified, served with this lawsuit in a manner consistent with FRCP 4, and given an appropriate opportunity to defend themselves. This is the correct method of filing and serving a complaint against unknown individuals,"" the attorneys said.  The CFTC now has until Nov. 7 to respond to the DEF and LeXpunK briefs. The amici parties will then have another week to respond to any issues raised by the CFTC before all parties meet in court on Nov. 30 to hash the questions out.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/18/daos-arent-people-crypto-lawyers-tell-court-in-cftcs-ooki-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d198f65de356d9c7fb791f05a4f4f2a127207ba9-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Buyers are still less in number as compared to sellers, which is a sign of bearishness. If the Ethereum price continues to maintain its upward movement, an influx of buying strength can be witnessed on the 24 hour chart. Over the last week, the Ethereum price has barely made any progress as it was laterally trading. With Bitcoin price appreciating in the last 24 hours, altcoins made slow recoveries on their charts. The $1,270 zone continues to remain a critical support zone for the coin. A fall from the present level will drag ETH to the aforementioned support level. The bulls could be expected to make a comeback if Ethereum touches the $1,400 price mark. Without constant buying support, the same remains unlikely. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ETH was trading at $1,316 at the time of writing. The coin has moved up and away from its critical support line of $1,270. The immediate resistance for the Ethereum price was at $1,360. A push above that will help ETH to reclaim $1,400. Another important resistance point was at $1,460. The bulls could then help the altcoin rally on its chart. If ETH loses footing now, the local support line is at $1,260, and falling through that will p...",NEUTRAL,ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-price-tries-to-move-upwards-as-it-tries-to-break-consolidation-whats-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Is the most controversial person in the world a bitcoiner now? Over the last few weeks, the fashion mogul/ rapper has dominated news cycle after news cycle. And it now seems like bitcoin has entered his orbit. Or Kanye West entered bitcoin&apos;s orbit. The always-calculated rapper/ performer was photographed wearing a &apos;Satoshi Nakamoto&apos; cap, which sent the Internet into a frenzy. The whole situation makes sense and the timing works. JPMorgan and West&apos;s Yeezy brand recently ended their business relationship, which lead to the billionaire receiving a slew of bitcoin enthusiast&apos;s messages on Twitter. It also left many to wonder exactly why did the relationship end? Was it just because of West&apos;s controversial opinions and wild antics? Or was this a genuine parting of ways? The real question, though, is this: does JPMorgan have the ability to turn off their banking service on an individual just because they don&apos;t like his or her political views? The Kanye West/ JP Morgan Incident On October 12th, Republican author Candace Owens published a letter from JPMorgan to the Yeezy high command. &apos;Earlier today I learned that Kanye West was officially kicked out of JP Morgan Chase bank.
