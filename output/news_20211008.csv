42376015,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDm8h,1633729161,Mt. Gox Voting Deadline for Creditors Ends,"The voting period for Mt. Gox creditors regarding the proposed the civil rehabilitation plan has now ended.  The groundbreaking cryptocurrency exchange, based in Tokyo, shut down in 2014 after thousands of bitcoins were stolen by unknown hackers. The process of making the exchange’s victims whole has been a lengthy, drawn-out process, characterized by delays and legal disputes. Today marks the end of yet one more milestone in the process: It is the deadline for creditors to approve or reject a civil rehabilitation proposal for compensation.  The voting process started on May 31, so creditors had over four months to cast their votes either by mail or electronically. At least 50% of the creditors’ voting shares will need to have voted “yes” for the plan to pass; the votes of those who did not respond at all will automatically be considered a “no.”  According to the plan, should it be accepted, creditors would be at least partially compensated for their lost funds in Japanese yen, bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  A coordinator of the creditors’ group MtGoxLegal (who asked not to be named) said the creditors have been asking the Tokyo District court representative and the Trustee to give some indication as to whether the 50% threshold had been crossed, but to no avail.  “If we had been able to get an update, say, after half of the voting period had passed, and that update indicated that the participation rate in the vote was worryingly low, then we could have tried to fundraise and allocate those funds to bring more attention to the issue,” he told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  He added that he hoped the voting still goes through and the rehabilitation plan gets approved because, otherwise, some creditors fear that instead of civil rehabilitation, the process would revert to the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, which its CEO, Mark Karpeles, filed for soon after the exchange became insolvent.  “It’s such a huge difference between what creditors receive under the civil rehabilitation plan and what creditors would receive if we reverted to bankruptcy, so it’s difficult to see anyone voting against,” the creditor said.  A long, frustrating process  A third creditor, “Nicholas,” who talked to CoinDesk, said he was pessimistic about the whole idea of getting compensated, but conceded there is no way left for creditors other than to approve the plan and move forward.  “The lawyers are drawing out the process and milking fees. Many of us don’t even think this process will play out after years of disappointment from Mt. Gox to any favorable conclusion. If this doesn’t pass we are in for more drama and hell,” Nicholas said.  Read more: Voting on a Proposal to Reimburse Mt. Gox Victims Begins Today  Another creditor, going by the name of “Max,” said he appreciated the Trustee approaching the process with all due diligence and allowing both online and offline voting. However, the transparency and timing could have been better, he said.  “There’s no reason to vote for such a long time and tally all votes at the end of deadline,” Max said. “There are some large creditors, Josh Jones, Fortress, etc. and they could easily cast 50% of the votes, as voting power is based on the claim size.”  He added that it would have been helpful if the voting progress had been shared with creditors in a form of an online ticker, but “understandably, the Trustee is old-school and might not be well versed with tech.”  Kim Nilsson, the Mt. Gox creditor who also investigated the theft of coins back in the day, told CoinDesk he didn’t see any point in being angry at how the process was handled.  ”Sure, everyone can imagine how all this could have been done far more easily if you just make up new rules as you go along, but that’s not how anything works, and to cynically attack people who have been bending over backwards to try to secure a much, much better outcome for creditors is just dumb,” Nilsson said.

42376025,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDmK1,1633726242,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Ends Week Notching 14% Gain,"Bitcoin ended the week performing strong, gaining nearly 14% as regulatory fears faded and sentiment turned bullish in anticipation of a bitcoin futures-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. by the end of the year.  Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin stayed roughly flat, hovering above $54,000 as of Friday afternoon. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization also surpassed $1 trillion again this week.  “We have broken the key point of breakdown level from May, which was around $50K,” wrote Blockware Intelligence in a research report. “In the short term, we are seeing some resistance from this last $56K-$58K area, which is not unexpected as there is a fair amount of overhead supply there from earlier this year.”  Bitcoin briefly broke above $56,000 early Friday, notching its highest level since May, before declining to around $54,000. Some analysts attributed the overall surge to Chinese buyers returning after the market settled after the initial news of China’s crypto ban.  “It appears as if the return of Chinese participants provided some fuel to the recent BTC fire, pushing prices temporarily above $56K overnight,” Armando Aguilar, FundStrat Global Advisors vice president of Digital Asset Strategy, told CoinDesk. “There was a similar risk-on sentiment in Chinese equity markets, with the Shanghai Composite closing up 0.67% in its first day back trading post-holiday.”  CME open interest also neared a record high on Friday, continuing its upward creep since the start of the week.  “We’re seeing a pickup in spot trading volume, but most activity is in the futures market to build exposure without putting up 100% of capital,” Finxflo’s head of Institutional Sales, Jeff Reed, told CoinDesk.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $54,494, +0.9%  Ether (ETH): $3,617, +0.4%  S&P 500: -0.2%  Gold: $1,758, +0.0%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.605%  Optimism over a futures-backed bitcoin ETF  Investors are growing antsy for a futures-backed bitcoin ETF to be approved in the U.S. An ETF would provide an easily accessible way for more retail and institutional investors to get involved in cryptocurrency. Some analysts point to the growing difference between BTC futures and spot prices as evidence of this optimism.  “The basis for CME futures has increased both on an absolute level and on a relative comparison with futures that trade on offshore derivative venues,” NYDIG’s global head of research, Greg Cipolaro, wrote in a research note. “Today the basis premium for futures traded on OKEx versus CME has flipped to a discount as CME futures are now trading at a basis premium for the first time.”  In August, a speech by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler hinted his agency would support a futures-based ETF based on his reading of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (commonly referred to as the ‘40 Act).  Gensler said that “when combined with the other federal securities laws, the ‘40 Act provides significant investor protections. Given these important protections, I look forward to the staff’s review of such filings, particularly if those are limited to these CME-traded bitcoin futures.”  Previously, applications for bitcoin ETFs holding bitcoin sought to register under the Securities Act of 1933 (’33 Act) because bitcoin is not considered a security by the SEC.  However, registration under the ‘40 Act is more appropriate for a fund engaged in a bitcoin futures strategy, as such funds will “generally hold fixed-income securities as a margin for the futures,” according to a report from NYDIG.  Bitcoin, Ethereum usage picks up  Price rallies for both bitcoin and ether may be driven by increased usage of their respective networks.  Ether was trading at over $3,600 on Friday afternoon, a 10% weekly gain.  For Ethereum, network usage has led to deflationary pressures as the ether used to pay transaction fees are being taken out of circulation, or “burned.” This has historically led to higher prices.  “Ethereum has been net deflationary over the past two days where the total supply of ether has decreased,” Fundstrat’s Will McEvoy told CoinDesk. “We attribute much of this to an increase in NFT sales, which have doubled since early September and generally require higher transaction fees to complete.”  Bitcoin network usage has similarly picked up over the past several months. Both layer 1 and layer 2 usage has been increasing since July 1, according to Coin Metrics analyst Nate Maddrey.  “Monthly unique active BTC addresses have rebounded back to about 17M after a drop-off following the May crypto crash,” Maddrey said.  The number of new BTC addresses has also been trending upwards since Q2. There were nearly 480,000 new bitcoin addresses created on Oct. 5, the highest number since May 13, according to Coin Metrics.  Altcoin roundup  Alchemix to expand collateral types, strategies for its “self-repaying” loans: Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Alchemix revealed plans for the second version (v2) of its platform on Friday, reported CoinDesk’s Andrew Thurman. The protocol is conceptually similar to MakerDAO, which takes token collateral and issues a heavily over-collateralized stablecoin loan in return. Alchemix, however, takes yield-bearing collateral and uses the yield to pay down the user’s collateral balance: a self-repaying loan. Alchemix is currently the 37th-ranked DeFi protocol with $1.06 billion in total value locked (TVL).  Tether has loaned $1 billion to Celsius Network: Tether, the issuer of stablecoin $USDT, has loaned $1 billion to Celsius Network, a crypto lender that is under investigation by several U.S. state financial regulators, reported CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley. Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky said the company pays an interest rate of 5%-6% to Tether, Bloomberg reported Thursday as part of an investigation into the stablecoin provider’s reserves. The investigation found that Tether had loaned billions of dollars to crypto companies, using bitcoin as collateral.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), SEC and CFTC have issued guidance letters, informal statements and public rulemaking efforts to direct how different aspects of the crypto industry should comply with federal law.  The OCC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Federal Reserve – three federal bank regulators – formed a “sprint team” to coordinate their work around crypto earlier this year.  According to Bloomberg’s report, one of the executive order’s provisions would coordinate this effort.  The Biden administration has ramped up the U.S. government’s work around crypto in recent months. In September, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned a crypto exchange in a first as part of its response to a spate of ransomware attacks.  The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets is also set to consider a report that would recommend Congress enact legislation to create a special purpose charter for stablecoin issuers, treating these entities akin to banks.  The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, is also set to issue reports on stablecoins – digital asset tokens whose values are pegged to another asset, such as U.S. dollars – and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/08/white-house-considering-executive-order-on-crypto-oversight-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29d4665591e9e6815603b2e62d30ea6c8b477dbd-4972x3315.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376010,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDm2P,1633724399,Airdrop Ethics: VC Firm Draws Ire Following $2.5M Ribbon Finance Exploit,"On Friday afternoon, decentralized finance (DeFi) users discovered a researcher for Divergence Ventures, a crypto venture firm, was receiving hundreds of ETH from wallets selling recently airdropped RBN tokens – a sign of an airdrop exploit to which Divergence later admitted.  The episode presents the largely unregulated, permissionless DeFi community with yet another chance to debate the nature of fair play in an increasingly powerful, $200 billion ecosystem where the only governance is on-chain rules and some modicum of common sense.  “Airdrops” are a token distribution method that allows users to claim tokens if they’ve completed certain actions or fulfill other parameters, such as having deposited into a vault or participated in a project’s governance.  In Friday’s exploit, the Divergence researcher allegedly used dozens of wallets to fulfill bare-minimum parameters to claim $2.5 million in RBN tokens – an exploit that some have labeled a sybil attack on the distribution.  The crypto community responded with ire, noting that Divergence is an investor in Ribbon and speculating that the researcher may have successfully gamed the distribution using insider information. A Ribbon community manager denied these allegations.  Divergence has since published a tweet thread acknowledging the sybil attack in which it said it “crossed a line” and said it would be “better contributors to the community going forward.”  Divergence also sent the ETH back to the project’s treasury, and the Ribbon community is now debating what to do with the funds.  A Ribbon Finance representative declined to comment. Divergence Ventures did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  The airdrop exploit was first flagged by pseudonymous self-described “ex-academic” Gabagool.eth. In an interview with CoinDesk, he said the episode is a prime example of a nascent ecosystem still trying to determine the rules of the jungle.  “There are rules we enforce socially, and this is an important example of that playing out,” Gabagool said. “Divergence responded in a few hours and returned 705 ETH because an anon with a ‘Sopranos’ joke as a name tweeted an analysis? That is the opposite of ‘code is law.’ That’s community law, and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. We’re making up the rules as we go along.”  Due diligence  Gabagool told CoinDesk that he spotted the exploit as a result of his day-to-day research. He’d bought Ribbon tokens pre-launch from a friend and was doing due diligence after adding to his position on Friday.  “Today I bought Ribbon in size, so I was looking at the Uniswap v3 pool, checking out some of the wallets buying and selling Ribbon,” he told CoinDesk. “I was curious, primarily to find out what people were doing with their airdrops.”  He said that he noticed a 17 ETH sale by “happenstance,” a sale whose proceeds were subsequently sent to another wallet. The new wallet, he noted, was funded with ETH that “all came from wallets that had received a Ribbon airdrop and sold a Ribbon airdrop.”  The parent wallet also linked to a wallet containing bridget.eth – an Ethereum name service domain that identified the owner as a Divergence Ventures researcher.  “Crypto people are very good at [operations security], but ENS is a weak point,” he cautioned.  Initially Gabagool reached out to Divergence Ventures’ Calvin Liu to compliment his firm on the windfall, but another friend tipped him off that Divergence was actually an investor in Ribbon – a sign that it may have been acting on insider information.  “That’s when I sent my tweet, because I said, ‘That’s interesting, a fund that’s invested in this protocol has a rogue analyst or is doing something people won’t like,’ based off what I know about crypto.’”  Worse than it looks  Gabagool told CoinDesk that, despite appearances, he leans towards believing there was no insider information at play.  “I tend to land on the side of trusting [Ribbon Finance founder] Julian Koh, but that’s purely my gut. The way Julian responded to this seems pretty above the board,” he said.  Gabagool also noted the farming was part of a broader strategy executed by the analyst’s wallets, indicating that this is a tactic that was tried in the past with other drops and not the product of insider knowledge.  “I mean, clearly just from this one analyst’s wallet – and this is just one linked to many other wallets – they’re airdrop-farming. They’re doing this on a pretty mass scale,” he said.  In an apology tweet today, Divergence seemed to confirm that the Sybil exploit (of using multiple identities) was part of a purposeful strategy it deploys with other projects as well:  Gabagool said that the episode is a “bad look” for Divergence, and will likely contribute to the community’s mistrust of VC firms.  “My experience in DeFi and crypto generally is that whatever you think is happening behind the scenes, it’s probably worse in fact – there’s more of it happening, or it’s happening at a larger scale. These people have privileged information, and they use it.”  Only wrong if you get caught  The discovery of the Sybil attack and the subsequent donation has prompted significant social media debate concerning the ethics of gaming distribution events.  Airdrops can be tremendously lucrative. Tracking down potential upcoming targets is a popular pastime, and likewise savvy DeFi users spend ample energy trying to predict the manner in which the drop will be conducted in order to maximize gains.  “In my original tweet, I said, ‘Copytrade this wallet.’ Everyone in DeFi is looking to do what this person did, and they’d be lying if they said otherwise,” said Gabagool.  Read more: Users Celebrate Massive DYDX Token Airdrop as Transfer Restrictions Lift  Last December, one trader narrowly missed out on $1.8 million from the 1INCH airdrop using a similar Sybil attack – in that instance users commiserated that he was foiled in his efforts, and largely refrained from chastising him for trying.  Much of the consternation for Divergence seems to focus on the fact that many observers initially believed the firm to have executed the Sybil attack with insider information and/or that it was sloppy with operational security – not that the firm executed it in the first place.  “I do think they f**ked up, if not just because they got caught,” said Gabagool.  To this end, he cautioned against users attacking the researcher simply for “being good at DeFi.”  “At no point was I intended to draw personal attacks towards this researcher,” he told CoinDesk. “The ethical fault here comes from Divergence.”  He noted that the Sybil strategy prevented other users from entering vaults and subsequently claiming tokens of their own – ultimately denying a broader swath of the community a share of the airdrop.  Dilemmas abound  This incident is not the only example of moral debates and questions of intentionality clashing with on-chain rules and logic in recent weeks. Last week, a bug in decentralized money market Compound’s code led to the erroneous distribution of nearly $150 million in tokens intended as community liquidity mining rewards.  Compound founder Robert Leshner called the unintended distribution a “moral dilemma” and called on users to return the funds. So far, users have returned over 163,000 COMP tokens worth $53 million.  Likewise, last month the developers for an exploited non-fungible token (NFT) project, Jay Pegs Auto Mart, expressed disappointment the attacker didn’t manage to get away with what it admitted was a “pretty smart” attack vector.  The team discovered the exploiter’s identity and successfully pressured that person into sending the funds back.  Read more: $3M Was Stolen, but the Real Steal Is These Kia Sedonas, Say Anonymous Developers  “He’s a dweeby NARC who failed to execute,” the developers told CoinDesk at the time.  Winners and losers  Gabagool speculated that such attacks are inevitable, given the current state of DeFi and the incentives that push it forward.  “It’s interesting because you have a system that people are actively trying to build gamification into, and the problem with gamification is that there are winners and losers,” he said.  Still, to whatever extent there are ethics in DeFi, they were violated here: Gabagool noted that the fund also has a sizable liquidity pool position in the project, usually a display of confidence or a longer-term investment.  “They clearly were signaling one thing in their public wallets, and doing another thing in private wallets,” he said.  Ultimately, however, episodes like today excite rather than depress him.  “To me, the power of decentralization is that thing are messy, things are in flux – and there’s kind of a creative potential in that,” Gabagool said. “The weakness is that there’s plenty of gaps to be exploited. And that’s what obviously fascinates me – those kind of in-between moments where people expose faults in popularly accepted logic.”",NEGATIVE,ETH | ENS,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | ENS | AIRDROP,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/08/airdrop-ethics-vc-firm-draws-ire-following-25m-ribbon-finance-exploit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b942265467114cd1cade852a64f94311ce694ae-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376003,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDlw7,1633723369,VC Fund NFX Launches Crypto Gaming Seed Fund,"Venture capital firm NFX has launched a crypto gaming initiative to get pre-seed and seed funds into the hands of founders within nine days.  NFX earlier this week announced it had lined up $450 million to invest in seed-stage companies. General Partner (GP) Morgan Beller teased that the fund would be doing “something cool in gaming.”  NFX put the money into action on Thursday with the launch of six FAST (Founder-friendly, Application-driven, Software-enabled and Transparent) initiatives, which span a number of industries. The group is looking for founders who are “bringing gaming and web3/crypto/NFTs together in new ways,” according to the website.  NFX has made $20 million available for this batch of FASTs, and funds are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.  Why should founders consider applying for FAST funding instead of pursuing a more traditional round of fundraising? FAST offers “speed and simplicity and the chance to get NFX on your team,” James Currier, NFX co-founder and GP, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Gaming background  The new FAST initiative ties together the gaming backgrounds of two NFX founders, Currier’s early embrace of the crypto industry and the addition of a new GP with deep crypto ties.  Currier previously co-founded and headed social gaming company WonderHill, which merged with Kabam in 2010. NFX co-founder and GP Gigi Levy-Weiss formerly served as the chief executive at online gambling company 888 Holdings and invested in mobile game company Playtika.  Beller, co-creator of Facebook’s Libra (now Diem), joined NFX as a GP in September 2020 and has become increasingly interested in the crypto gaming space.  She tweeted yesterday that gaming will likely be the “gateway drug” that brings the next billion people into the decentralized web.  Asked about the most exciting opportunities in crypto gaming, Beller told CoinDesk that “gaming people are finally coming into web3, so just the quality of games that you’re seeing is going to be higher.”  NFX’s shortlist of future FAST sectors includes decentralized finance (DeFi), and Beller says that might not be the end. “Stay tuned for more crypto and web3 FASTs,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,OTHER,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/08/vc-fund-nfx-launches-crypto-gaming-seed-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77be0b8f6b21fea5492655cfa482f8ab5a717b4d-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At press time, Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge retail interest in trending topics, is returning a relatively low value of 10 for the search term “how to buy shiba inu” over the past 12 months.  While general interest has picked up slightly with SHIB’s 230% weekly gain, it is nowhere close to the peak of 100 reached on Google Trends in the second week of May. A score of 100 represents peak popularity among the general population – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time frame. It indicates that more and more people are scanning the web for information on the trending topic.  Web data shows SHIB’s latest move higher has yet to catch the attention of retail investors, and further gains may be in the offing.  Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of search requests made to Google and scales these searches on a range of 0 to 100, according to the company. The search value represents the search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the selected region and time.  Retail investors have a reputation of being the last entrants in the bull run. As such, a Google search value of 100 or peak retail interest often coincides with bull market exhaustion. SHIB’s year-to-date high of 0.0000388 coincided with search value for “how to buy Shiba Inu” reaching 100 in the second week of May.

Writing in a forum entitled “Unpopular opinion: El Salvador President Mr Nayab Bukele should not be praised by Crypto community,” Buterin, under his Reddit user name of vbuterin, said that “there is nothing unpopular about this opinion,” noting that “making it mandatory for businesses to accept a specific cryptocurrency is contrary to the ideals of freedom that are supposed to be so important to the crypto space.”  Buterin’s remarks appear to refer to Article 7 of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law passed in June, which stipulated that bitcoin must be accepted as a form of payment by “every economic agent.”  However, in July, amid pushback against the mandatory use of bitcoin, Bukele wrote in a Twitter thread that the use of bitcoin as legal tender was going to be “totally optional” and the government would not force any of the nation’s residents to receive bitcoin as a form of payment.  Read more: Why El Salvador Is Botching Its Bitcoin Experiment  “If someone wants to continue to carry cash, not receive a sign-on bonus, not win over customers who have bitcoin, not grow their business and pay commission on remittances, they can continue to do so,” Bukele wrote at the time.  Despite Bukele’s words about bitcoin not being mandatory, locals remain confused about the details of the new law. “One thing is what the president says, and another is what the law establishes,” a Salvadoran merchant told CoinDesk recently.  According to a survey by the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (Fusades) published this week, more than 93% of Salvadoran companies did not report having any bitcoin transactions in the last week of September.  In his Reddit comments, Buterin added that the “tactic of pushing BTC to millions of people in El Salvador at the same time with almost no attempt at prior education is reckless, and risks a large number of innocent people getting hacked or scammed. Shame on everyone (ok, fine, I’ll call out the main people responsible: shame on Bitcoin maximalists) who are uncritically praising him.”  In response to a comment theorizing that Bukele may be supporting the use of bitcoin in El Salvador because he had bought the cryptocurrency at a cheap price and wanted it to go up, Buterin proposed what he called a “simpler and dumber hypothesis.”  “Both for political reasons and because he’s a human being like the rest of us, he just loves being praised by people he considers powerful (i.e., Americans),” Buterin wrote.

Blockchain pioneers view it as a way of passing the torch to the next generation of innovators.  Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), for example, boasts partnerships with more than 30 of the world’s leading universities, while the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) now works directly with academic programs around the world.  This post is part of CoinDesk’s universities package.  “We started looking at academic institutions seriously about a year or so ago,” said Justin Rice, the vice president of ecosystem development for SDF.  Rice said SDF now has enough staff to run such a program, which it sees as aligned with the open-source platform’s founding mission to increase equitable access to the world’s financial infrastructure.  It’s “not only in putting the end products, the digital assets, into the hands of end users, but it’s also about empowering the people who create those products,” he said. “In many ways that’s the most important layer of the whole cake that we can and should be focusing on – the builders, the creators, the innovators – because they will take these underlying networks that represent value digitally and turn them into something meaningful.”  Read more: Do You Need to Go to College to Get a Job in Crypto? | David Z. Morris  The mandate of increasing equitable access extends to the development of the technology itself. To that end, SDF has partnered with academic programs around the world, including Blockchain at Berkeley, the University College London’s Centre for Blockchain Technologies, The National University of Singapore’s Fintech Lab and the University of Nicosia in Cyprus. The first three place within the top seven places of CoinDesk’s new ranking of top universities for blockchain, which covers 230 schools worldwide.  The Stellar Development Foundation also provides a range of resources to students outside of those institutional partnerships, including grants and guest lectures, as well as hackathon events developed in partnerships with blockchain clubs on campus.  “We also assist in adding blockchain – and sometimes Stellar-specific – content to various curriculums,” says Rice. “A lot of it is creation of resources, some of it is providing technical assistance or providing mentorship with people in our organization, and some of it is actually creating hackathons that have rewards for successful projects.”  Such partnerships are becoming increasingly popular now as a generation of blockchain pioneers feel increasingly certain about the technology’s longevity.  “The people who are working on blockchain today are the first generation,” he says. “There’s been enough advancement, adoption, and mainstream understanding of blockchain where it feels like it’s here to stay, so let’s start thinking about the next generation.”  These partnerships help academic institutions stay up to date with leading-edge technologies.  “Having students who are trained in blockchain technology is going to inevitably lead to more tech jobs in Wyoming for our graduates,” says Dr. James Caldwell, the co-director of the University of Wyoming’s Advanced Blockchain Laboratory (WABL).  The Top Universities for Blockchain by CoinDesk 2021  The Lab launched in early 2020 following a $500,000 endowment from IOHK, the entity behind Cardano and the ada cryptocurrency. It was also matched by state funding. The Blockchain Lab currently supports six graduate students and a similar number of undergraduate researchers. WABL has minted 205 blocks as part of the Cardano Stake Pool.  “We have students who are doing research on the cutting edge of blockchain technology, working on projects at IOHK,” said Caldwell. “Through the center’s efforts we just got 13 mining machines, and we’re starting a mining club, and we’re hoping to be able to get the students involved in keeping those machines running properly.”  Caldwell, who has been teaching at the University of Wyoming for 23 years, says the state has long struggled to secure local tech jobs for its graduates, as most employers favor neighboring Colorado when setting up offices in the region. A slew of blockchain-friendly legislative changes, coupled with WABL’s efforts, however, are helping to establish the state as the “Crypto Capital of America.”  “It provides a point of technical expertise in blockchain – and more specifically in the Cardano blockchain – in Wyoming,” he says. “Wyoming is kind of a hard sell, but now with this legislation we’ve had more technology companies interested in moving to the state than we ever have.”  Caldwell adds that those recent successes are a direct result of both the legislative changes and partnership with the IOHK, and he believes it won’t be long before other states and institutions look to establish similar partnerships. “Oh gosh, I’m sure of it,” he says.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jared Lindzon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/08/stellar-and-cardano-show-the-power-of-college-partnerships,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b9b7ce3162f793af897e89dc8fca6171e21ff1c-2688x2005.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The assessment cites a new report from the Bank for International Settlements that could serve as a roadmap for regulating fiat-pegged crypto assets.  “While these requirements would likely increase the regulatory and administrative burden on stablecoin issuers, they should ultimately lead to a more robust framework for faster and more widespread adoption of stablecoins as a form of payment,” Zerbe wrote.  Stabelcoin regulation has been a hot topic in the U.S. recently.  This week the Biden administration floated a proposal that would subject stablecoin issuers to bank-like regulations.  Meanwhile, Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent the company an investigative subpoena in July.  Morgan Stanley’s Zerbe also saw Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s statement that the Fed has “no intention to ban” stablecoins as well as a CoinDesk report on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) as “incrementally” positive news for the potential widespread adoption of the stablecoin market.  Morgan Stanley initiated Silvergate last month with an “overweight” rating and $158 price target. The stock is trading at $163 as of press time.  While Silvergate currently gets an “immaterial” amount of earnings related to its relationship with the four U.S. stablecoin issuers, “the adoption of stablecoins for day-to-day commerce is perhaps the single biggest driver supporting the bull case for owning Silvergate,” according to Zerbe.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Josh Fineman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/08/morgan-stanley-silvergate-report-sends-crypto-friendly-bank-up-7,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c83b306ed4dda688d08db972bd44ecca88e9741-1500x844.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The fund, “BlockFi Bitcoin Strategy ETF,” would only invest in futures contracts traded on the CME, according to regulatory filings. It would be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (commonly referred to as the‘40 Act). Those attributes are in line with a hypothetical bitcoin ETF that SEC chair Gary Gensler has hinted may finally receive the long-sought approval.  BlockFi has a slim chance of crossing the finish line first, however. A bevy of similar offerings filed months earlier are set for final verdict later this month. ETF experts believe one of these is likely to be approved, particularly after Gensler’s comments in recent weeks.  Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said he predicts one or more applications will receive an approval this month.  A BlockFi spokesperson confirmed the filing in a statement to CoinDesk.  “If approved, the actively managed fund would invest primarily in Bitcoin futures contracts registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and would not have direct exposure to Bitcoin. We look forward to sharing more details with the market when appropriate,” the statement added.  At least one major contender has begun preparing for Gensler’s go-ahead. Earlier this week, ETF firm VanEck secured an insurance policy for its yet-to-launch bitcoin futures ETF. The policy comes online on Oct. 26, one day after the SEC’s decision deadline.

42376019,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDmDj,1633713540,NFT Rentals: Why VCs Are Backing a Puzzling New Project,"Some non-fungible tokens (NFTs) come with exclusive perks. A project helping holders monetize those benefits – all while maintaining long-term ownership – has raised $1.5 million in a seed round led by Animoca Brands.  ReNFT announced the funding round on Friday. In addition to Animoca, the year-old decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind the rentable NFT platform is now backed by Lattice Capital, Play Ventures, MetaCartel Ventures, Scalar Capital, LongHash Ventures, SkyVision Capital, Fedora Capital and Maeve Ventures.  The Ethereum-based project recently facilitated the lending of Stoner Cats, an NFT collection whose holders have access to a library of video shorts, and Animetas, whose holders rented their tokens to give temporary access to a private Discord event.  A rising trend in the NFT sector is for projects to include community benefits that go along with the ownership of their tokens. ReNFT is giving owners a way to monetize these benefits without selling the underlying asset.  How it works  Lenders can send the NFTs they want to rent out to a smart contract after determining the daily rental price and maximum rental period. Borrowers then input how long they want to “own” the NFT, paying for the rental cost plus a collateral amount equivalent to the price of the NFT, which they get back once the NFT is returned.  With the NFT sector still in bloom, reNFT sees the future of its lending protocol extending into the metaverse, where users could rent out their play-to-earn items, intellectual property and even digital real estate.  It’s not entirely unheard of in cryptoland: Yield Guild Games also operates a rental program for in-game assets that yield financial returns, whether it be revenue-driving GameFi characters or plots of virtual land.  While reNFT currently works with the peer-to-peer renting of ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens on the Ethereum mainnet, it’s working on expanding compatibility to Solana and Polygon, co-founder Nick Vale told CoinDesk in an interview.  “ReNFT provides an alternative to speculative NFT trading by allowing owners of valuable digital assets to generate income over time,” Regan Bozman, partner of Lattice Capital, said in a statement. “This is a valuable new primitive in web3 and in particular within the fast-growing gamefi space.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SOL | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/08/nft-rentals-why-vcs-are-backing-a-puzzling-new-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e90260db19e952cca7dd56484690105baa86792a-1600x1071.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto created it with a view to upend traditional financial institutions and remove the middleman from the majority of transactions.

As crypto has gotten increasingly popular, it has also become very centralized with a few big players taking up most of the liquidity and market share. DeFi is the revolt against that.

In fairness, I knew a little bit about disruptive technologies but dove into the rabbit hole, reading white papers, listening to podcasts, practicing questions like, “What’s your transactions per second?” and using expressions like, “We can build a dapp for that.” Frankly, I learned that business development people, marketing gurus and alignment specialists who did not have engineering backgrounds knew about as much as I did.  It was classic “learning by doing,” a methodology I had pioneered for two decades building trial advocacy and other skills training programs for the legal reform movement that had swept Latin America as it returned to democratic governance. Leapfrog technologies like case management software, ballistics and DNA testing were revolutionary as that continent transitioned from the Inquisitorial model to the adversarial model in criminal procedure. But nothing prepared me for the baptism by fire that I encountered in the blockchain sector.  Having trained as a lawyer was of great assistance, particularly because so many blockchain enthusiasts and entrepreneurs may have been simultaneously breaking securities law, immigration law, corporate law, tax law and labor law. It was like one big issue-spotting examination. But the technical issues were far beyond my comfort zone. For that I relied on my new mentor, my boss from China who was literally half my age. Working with him was part Master’s degree in disruptive industries, part cultural competencies crash course, and part internship in Chinese regulation. He taught me about POW, POS, PBFT and a host of other acronyms that transcended continents, economic models and generation gaps. I taught him how to tie a Windsor knot for his formal look, something we needed to do even if we were in this sector. The bankers, lawyers, accountants and foundation presidents we met still liked formality.  Read more: Do You Need to Go to College to Get a Job in Crypto? | David Z. Morris  For years, the dynamics behind the supply chain involving China could have meant that some child laborer was involved in the manufacturing process. This story is the opposite. Up until two weeks ago when China finally banned all things crypto – although the truth is that the authorities there had long banned the industry - the kids from China have not just been making our consumer goods, but creating the foundations for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. And they were readying their generation to lead it.  The work hours were almost the same as the Shenzhen sweatshops of old – grueling days, but Eric, then 27 years old, did not toil away for a few dollars a day; as the company’s CTO, he was leading software developing with teams around the globe. Suddenly, he was thrust into the role of CEO and our timetables got even shorter. We would pitch our team as networking from Beijing, Boston and Bangalore although the Indian team was really working out of Jaipur. Alliteration sells.  We scoured the globe for engineering teams in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Vietnam, to no avail. Technology was fast eclipsing finance, giving an advantage of technology-centric leadership rather than the money folks calling the shots. At the Cardinal Pitch Club at Stanford University’s Faculty Club in March 2018, everyone confirmed that funding was not an issue confronting emerging technology startups – getting the right technologists was. It was no surprise then that signing bonuses were de rigueur and competition among projects intense. So was burnout.  These new kids on the blockchain were the rock stars of their generation. They were in their late 20s and early 30s, smart, beautiful and rich – well, much of it in crypto. They did not think twice about going to an airport and getting on a plane to Shanghai, Singapore, New York or Davos without advanced airline reservations. They had not yet arrived at the stage of throwing TV sets out of hotel windows, but I did encourage it a few times. Even electrical engineers need to let loose every now and then. These kids did not have a tattoo among them. There was no time for such needless diversions. They had some coding to do.  Read More: The Top Universities for Blockchain by CoinDesk 2021  For the rest of us, it was about helping organize and regularize their affairs – protecting the company’s intellectual property (even if much of it was open source), building culturally sensitive marketing plans that span the hemispheres and growing investor relations teams. The promise of going to the mainnet (an independent blockchain running its own network with its own technology and protocol), getting listed on an exchange or two and finding test cases to tout were sometimes not enough. In 2018, with every fraudster and their mother attempting an initial coin offering, many Silicon Valley law firms would not return calls from crypto startups, all of which were seen a potential problematic clients, even if they paid retainers on time. As the designated adult on the team (principally signaled by being a graying white guy with a salt and pepper beard), I could get us meetings, particularly because some of my former students were now partners at reputable law firms and others principals at venture capital firms and accelerator funds.  None of the folks with whom I worked are at the company now. There has been turbulent turnover, but the lessons learned have stuck: work hard, innovate and find a real problem that needs solving. None of that involved going to university or graduate school (except for the engineers). For those who do go, they are delaying the inevitable – doing it on the fly, hopefully with some ethics and professionalism. It is rarely like the simulations or case studies in the textbooks we use in class.  When folks ask me how to learn about the space and get one’s chops, I always tell them to find a mentor, especially one who is younger and from a land far, far away. I learned about hybrid consensus protocols and in exchange these kids learned how to fill out expense reports, engage with legacy technology leaders, encourage regulatory clarity and earn airline reward miles. What I came to understand about these young Chinese technology entrepreneurs is that they are huge fans of U.S. popular culture.

42394403,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvczVF,1633712077,‘Only the Little People Pay Taxes.’ The Pandora Papers and the Case for Crypto,"First, there was a series of disclosures about monetary policymakers’ stock trading activity, a controversy that contributed to the resignation of the presidents of the Federal Reserve banks of Boston and Dallas and has put Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s renomination in jeopardy.  Then, last weekend, the International Consortium of Independent Journalists dropped the Pandora Papers. That trove of 11.9 million confidential documents revealed how “35 current and former world leaders, more than 330 politicians and public officials in 91 countries and territories, and a global lineup of fugitives, con artists and murderers” have shifted assets into offshore havens, shell companies and trusts to hide their business dealings and evade trillions in taxes.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  You might be tempted to dismiss these revelations as nothing new, as mere confirmation of what you’ve already known. Others might be inclined to take the – in my opinion, naive – view that “well, all these actions aren’t technically illegal, so what’s the problem?”  But it’s important to take stock of these new developments. They force us to confront the harsh reality that there are two sets of rules for society: one for a narrow group of people with access to the levers of power, the other for the rest of us. Given the challenging economic and social backdrop of 2021, the reminder of this unfair dichotomy can do nothing but hurt public confidence in the centralized institutions that control our economy.  It also raises questions about what this kind of institutional confidence blow means for crypto and for the prospects of an alternative, decentralized financial system that its proponents are seeking to build. We’ll address that lower down.  Trust under threat  These revelations come amid a global health and economic crisis in which the poor have suffered enormously while the wealthy, at least in financial terms, are markedly better off. They sit alongside the image of politicians too gripped by partisan divisions to enact regulations that enable productive innovation and sustainable growth. And they put more than a decade of central banks’ “quantitative easing” measures into a more cynical context, implying that a monetary policy of questionable efficacy is being administered in the narrow interests of those institutions’ officials rather than those of the wider economy.  What matters here is the core question of trust.  Money, as we’ve discussed in past Money Reimagined newsletters and podcasts, is a collectively imagined concept. A currency only works if there’s shared belief among its users that the system it’s built upon is serving the common interest. It requires faith in the rules, protocols and institutions that run that system.  We’ve seen what happens when the bedrock of trust breaks down: the hyperinflation of Weimar Germany, of Zimbabwe and of many Latin American countries; the ingrained, self-reinforcing disdain for government that makes it impossible for failed monetary systems like Argentina’s to break a cycle of repeated crises.  Until now, we have seen no such breakdown in the dollar-centric global financial system. Despite domestic and geopolitical challenges to U.S. leadership, most of us still trust that system sufficiently to not abandon it.  But that trust is not infinite. At some point, if people see enough evidence that the system is working against them, that faith will evaporate. If an appealing, alternative model starts to arise, people may gravitate toward it.  That, of course, leads us to the aspirations of the crypto community, which wants a system that employs a decentralized protocol to set rules and execute transactions rather than relying on a corruptible centralized intermediary such as a bank or a government. Given that it’s impossible to create an infallible human institution, the idea is to defer our trust to infallible math.  Crypto’s promises and challenges  I say “aspirations” because there aren’t many concrete signs that the wider general public – as angry as people might be – is willing to make the leap to bitcoin, to stablecoins or to some other token as their primary mechanism for sending and saving money. Some of that is about misperception and education. But it’s also because the crypto industry writ large continues to integrate many of the centralized vulnerabilities that confront the legacy financial system.  Crypto advocates are right to complain that the mainstream press overly focuses on hacks, losses and failures without sufficiently covering the industry’s incredible innovation and progress over the past decade. But the reality is those problems occur because of a similar structure to that which enabled the Fed stock trading controversy and the Pandora Papers transactions. Crypto is full of centralized entities entrusted with people’s funds, each posing a prospect for abuse or failure. Think QuadrigaX or Mt. Gox.  Those centralized entities have been somewhat unavoidable because this industry’s evolving technology is not sufficiently developed and because the network of users is insufficiently large or robust to allow for true decentralized governance. It’s also because developers have tried to build applications that interface with the traditional financial system, which leaves them subject to traditional regulatory demands that imply centralized custody and user data collection.  Blockchain developers have made tremendous progress building cryptographic solutions to these problems and in incentivizing rapid adoption so services can be provided in a decentralized manner. The growth of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) within decentralized finance (DeFi) reflects that effort. But it’s far from a finished process.  Read More: The Pandora Papers Show Why People Love Crypto: You Can’t Trust the Powerful  Meanwhile, the regulatory framework, at least in the U.S., is currently not conducive to this decentralization push, especially the hardline position of Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler who is arguing that most tokens are securities and is suspicious of industry claims that decentralized finance (DeFi) is sufficiently decentralized to avoid that treatment.  Finally, the quality of public discourse around cryptocurrencies remains poor. Instead of focusing on how removing trusted intermediaries could address corruption, the discussion is framed by the rules of the old, centralized paradigm, where intermediating institutions such as banks are expected to identify and catch bad guys. I fully expect many people to use the Pandora Papers as an argument against crypto and wrongly conclude that it makes it easier for crooks to launder money.  The reality is that blockchain analytics, combined with privacy-protecting tools such as zero-knowledge proofs can provide valuable tools for law enforcement while preserving privacy and decentralization. It’s just that people aren’t talking about them in the mainstream, which means they aren’t on regulators’ radars.  The upshot: We still have a ways to go before there’s a viable decentralized solution to the failures of the centralized financial system.

42411901,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgwTI,1633710783,Ethereum Nodes and Clients: A Complete Guide,"In the computing world, a “client” refers to any type of software that is downloaded onto your computer and helps you interact with another type of software or service provided by a server. For example, Gmail is a software client that connects to an email server and allows users to send and receive emails.  An Ethereum client is the software needed to allow Ethereum nodes to read blocks on the Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum-based smart contracts. A “node” is the running piece of the client software. In order to run a node, you have to first download an Ethereum client application.  What are Ethereum nodes?  A “node” is a computer that performs a certain function on the Ethereum network and runs client software in order to do so. Depending on what your specific needs are, whether it be a decentralized application (dapp) or a wallet, there are three different types of nodes that can be run by any client: full nodes, light nodes and archive nodes. Each node will interpret data differently and offer different methods for synchronization – this refers to how quickly your node is able to retrieve updated information for your client to interpret.  Full nodes are full of data; they store and can distribute all of the blockchain data from the Ethereum network. A full node will additionally participate in block validation (i.e. verify all blocks and states on the network).  An advantage of implementing a full node is that it can directly interact with any smart contract on the public blockchain. Full nodes can also directly deploy smart contracts into the public blockchain.  However, the full use and storage of data, as well as direct smart contract functionality, comes at a cost. Full nodes can be taxing on your computer’s hardware and bandwidth resources. Retrieving full data can also be very time consuming, sometimes taking multiple days to sync your data when the node is first deployed. Then, the node must be maintained, upgraded and kept online in order to not have to repeat the full synchronization process.  Light nodes are similar to the full node but handle less information. The light node stores header chain information (basic information stored in a block such as a timestamp and the hash of the previous block,) but will only receive additional information upon request. They are able to verify the validity of data but do not fully participate in block validation. Light nodes are almost always implemented within remote clients. Because these nodes do not take on more intensive data storage and writing processes, they have proven to be useful for low-capacity devices like smartphones.  Archive nodes are nodes that store all of the information that a full node does and builds an archive of historical blockchain states. Archive nodes will retain historical data even after a client has finished synchronization. Full and light nodes, on the other hand, will “prune” the historical blockchain data, meaning they can rebuild, but do not retain this information.  While archive nodes may not be useful for the average user, they have proven effective in the application of block explorers, wallet vendors and chain analytics.  What is an Ethereum client?  Clients can be useful for developers because they let them interact with the network and other network nodes using various programming languages. The Ethereum Foundation maintains several different clients for different programming languages, including Go, Rust, Java and C#. Various third-party developers have also created Ethereum clients for further language support.  The most common uses for Ethereum clients include transaction and mining interfaces, but its use cases can go far beyond basic blockchain interactions.  The Ethereum Foundation maintains the following clients:  Geth (Go)  OpenEthereum (Rust)  Nethermind (C#, .NET)https://nethermind.io/client  Besu (Java)  Erigon (Go/Multi)  These give developers options in implementing their Ethereum-based projects. If your preferred language isn’t officially supported by the Ethereum Foundation, numerous third-party Ethereum clients exist to provide additional language support.  The reason all of these different clients are possible is because Ethereum is defined by a formal specification (i.e. the “Yellow Paper”). The formal specifications that make up Ethereum sets the blockchain apart from Bitcoin. Where Ethereum defines standard behaviors for all Ethereum clients to follow, Bitcoin Core has no such definitions. By providing consistent documentation and clear language, Ethereum’s specifications enabled the blockchain to allow for independent, but interoperable, software implementations of an Ethereum client.  Types of Ethereum client  Full client  Full clients store the entire Ethereum blockchain; a process that can take several days to synchronize and requires a huge amount of disk space – over 1 Terabyte to be exact, according to the latest figures. Full clients allow connected nodes to perform all tasks on the network, including mining, transaction and block-header validation and running smart contracts.  Light client  Ethereum clients may be implemented in full or in part. The above overview gives an explanation of how a “full” client works, however it is important to know that you don’t always need to run a full client. Typically when data storage and speed are at issue, developers will elect to use what are called “light clients.”  Light clients offer a subset of the functionality of a full client. Light clients can provide faster speeds and free up data storage availability because, unlike the full clients, they do not store the full Ethereum blockchain.  The scope of a light client’s functionality is tailored toward the goals of the Ethereum client. For example, light clients are frequently used for private keys and Ethereum address management within a wallet. Additionally, they tend to handle smart contract interactions and transaction broadcasts. Other uses for remote clients include web3 instances within JavaScript objects, dapp browsers and retrieving exchange rate data.  Remote client  There is a third type of client called a remote client which is similar to a light client. The main difference being, a remote client does not store its own copy of the blockchain, nor does it validate transactions or block headers. Instead, remote clients fully rely on a full or light client to provide them with access to the Ethereum blockchain network. These types of clients are predominantly used as a wallet for sending and receiving transactions.  The difference between nodes and clients  Nodes and clients work alongside one another and both terms are often used interchangeably. However, they both operate separately in order to access the Ethereum network.  Think of nodes and clients operating like a computer accessing the internet: the node is an operating system, like Windows or iOS, and the client is the computer itself. The client computer gives a user the ability to access the node operating system, which in turn, gives you the ability to access the internet. Different computers will be able to give you access to the same operating system and the different operating systems will give you access to the same internet.  MetaMask  To see how Ethereum clients work in the real world, we can look at MetaMask as an example. MetaMask is a browser-based wallet, Remote Procedure Call (RPC) client and basic contract explorer. Any computer with Chrome, Firefox, Opera or Brave Browser is able to run MetaMask.  MetaMask is an implementation of a remote client that interacts with the blockchain through a light client. In order to avoid any security issues, MetaMask operates its own light client to communicate with the remote client in order to ensure effective security and certainty of transactions.  MetaMask is unique from other browser-based wallets because it applies a web3 instance into a browser’s JavaScript reader, providing access to the Ethereum mainnet and other testnets as well, including Ropsten testnet, Kovan testnet and the local instance of an RPC node. Even with its unique functionality, MetaMask still runs a remote client just as most other browser wallets do. The remote client allows wallet storage functionality, transaction broadcasting and web3 JavaScript injections.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Griffin Mcshane,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-nodes-and-clients-a-complete-guide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c27457d63920e8d686c2a43a11cd97dc5f7a7f5-1885x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394411,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvd0FP,1633707856,Sign-In With Ethereum Is Coming,"Over the past few weeks, Facebook has been raked over the coals in the press and U.S. Congress for practices that are hard to regard as anything short of evil. In essence, the company allegedly knew for years that its algorithms were pointing users to content that was harmful in a variety of ways, but did nothing, because change would mean losing money.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  If you’ve ever used your Facebook account to log into another service online, you’ve been helping the social network make your online experience more toxic, even if you’re not a user of Facebook.com itself. Or maybe you do much the same using Google or Apple identity services. All involve major trade-offs – like possibly having your data shared with U.S. intelligence.  It’s one of the core quandaries of today’s internet. While the ‘net’s inherent anonymity is definitely a good thing, it leaves users of ID-reliant tools in thrall to major centralized identity providers and their seemingly inevitable abuses. Blockchain developers have long talked about developing “decentralized” identity standards to save us from the dangers of Big Login, and at least one significant step towards that future appears imminent: Sign-in With Ethereum is coming.  It’s just what it sounds like: a standard way to use an Ethereum wallet that you own as an identifier across multiple services. If your first thought is, “my name isn’t even attached to my ETH wallet,” that’s exactly the point: Using a cryptographic marker as an identity means the user, not the identity provider, has total control over what information is associated with it. Eventually, you’ll be able to decide, for instance, whether a particular service needs your name, proof of your age, or a glimpse of your ETH balance. You won’t have to send all that information to every service you use.  The standard is being developed by Spruce Systems, cofounded by former ConsenSys staffers, which won a recent development RFP from the Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum Name Service. The initial goals are modest (always a good sign, in my book).  “We’re starting with not as serious, not as strong identity,” says Spruce co-founder and CEO Wayne Chang. “Because we want to be battle tested. In the short to medium term it’s more like social media credentials that tie their Twitter handles to a blockchain … We don’t want to provide [know your customer] credentials for buying millions of dollars of financial securities right yet,” though that’s a possibility down the road.  Applications for this initial iteration, according to Spruce, are more likely to include lower-security uses like gating content for non-fungible token (NFT) holders. But, eventually, by integrating secure off-chain storage, Sign-in With Ethereum (let’s just call it SIWE) could also offer “strong” options such as government ID. Users will be able to control access to that data on a case-by-case basis and remove or disassociate it at will.  One significant hurdle for SIWE is the inherent risk of reusing any identifier, particularly an address that can likely be pretty easily linked to wallets used for financial activity. While the idea of using multiple or disposable wallets as a security measure is familiar to crypto users, it’s probably a bridge too far for normies, at least for now – one more reason SIWE is starting with baby steps.  Spruce regards its work as a community project, and it is holding weekly community calls as it develops the SIWE standard.

Bitcoin prices have surged above $50,000 recently, climbing 85% this year. The price of ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, has rose 393% year to date.  Meanwhile, gold prices are hovering below $1,800 per ounce, falling 6.5% in 2021.  Panigirtzoglou pointed to “the failure of gold to respond in recent weeks to heightened concerns over inflation” as a possible driver of the return to bitcoin.

Bitcoin and other virtual currency mining were included in an April 2019 draft list of industries to be phased out but they weren’t present in the final version published the following November.

Given the massive footprint of Big Tech firms, the assets backing such stablecoins would increase to the point that traditional banks’ funding becomes more scarce and therefore more expensive, Panetta said in a speech Friday.  Banks may therefore resort to more expensive short-term sources of funding, while the increase of deposit holdings under the control of Big Tech would make banks’ deposit base more concentrated.  “Without proper regulation, these developments could amplify international shocks and undermine financial resilience globally,” Panetta said. “We could see risk-biased technological change, whereby the digitalization of finance favors business models that are riskier for the global economy.”  Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could thus represent “an anchor of stability” for digital finance, he added, highlighting the work being carried about by central banks into CBDCs that could be used by consumers and companies alongside cash.

42396775,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5HGN,1633701691,"‘Self-Repaying Loan’ Platform Alchemix to Expand Collateral Types, Strategies","Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Alchemix revealed plans for the second version (v2) of its platform on Friday.  The forthcoming v2 represents a significant protocol upgrade that will make a vertical that already appears far-fetched to traditional finance wonks – “self-repaying” loans – even more exotic.  In a blog post, the Alchemix team detailed an overhaul that will vastly expand accepted collateral types, yield-bearing strategies and collateral utility for users.  Alchemix, the 37th-ranked DeFi protocol with $1.06 billion in total value locked (TVL), is notable for being a project with few, if any real-world corollaries – and one that often strikes outsiders as unsustainable.  The protocol is conceptually similar to MakerDAO, which takes token collateral and issues a heavily over-collateralized stablecoin loan in return. Alchemix however takes yield-bearing collateral – such as yDAI (DAI deposited into Yearn.Finance’s yield vaults) – and uses the yield to pay down the user’s collateral balance: a self-repaying loan.  A key roadmap target is to expand the possible uses of collateral from simply paying down the principal, including “credit delegation” services via StreamPay.  “So for the credit delegation, imagine you have $100k principal deposited in Alchemix, making 10% annually,” wrote pseudonymous Alchemix core contributor Scoopy Trooples in an interview with CoinDesk. “That would be $10k in income, or ~$850 a month. That $850 could be delegated to paying for subscription services, payments to others in the space, payments to other dapps.”  Additionally, the protocol is planning to vastly expand the number of available collateral types. Currently, Alchemix only issues stablecoins against yETH and yDAI collateral; v2 will include yWBTC, and will feature an architecture that enables easily adding new collateral types and yield-bearing strategies for that collateral.

42411894,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgw9S,1633700283,What Is the Bitcoin Block Size Debate and Why Does It Matter?,"The question of how to scale, or expand upon, Bitcoin is not a new one. But as transaction volumes are expected to increase in the years ahead, questions about the underlying cryptocurrency’s future composition must, in the eyes of those who favor change, be answered sooner rather than later: Who does it serve? How should it look? What makes it unique?  What are blocks?  Blocks are batches of transactions that are confirmed and subsequently recorded on a public ledger, in this case the Bitcoin blockchain.  During digital currency’s early days, these blocks could carry up to 36 megabytes of transaction data apiece. However, in 2010, Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, decided to reduce them to 1MB to reduce the threat of spam and potential denial-of-service attacks on the network.  This limit remains in place today. But as transactions increase, Bitcoin’s blocks are filling up fast – edging further towards this 1MB limit. Miners have a financial incentive to fill blocks regardless of how many transactions occur. With more network users come more transactions, introducing more pressure to increase the block size. So far, there is no indication the developers will increase the block size directly, though.  Data released by YCharts confirms the average block size is now 0.7928MB. That may seem high, yet it is a 39.71% decrease compared to a year ago.  The implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) – an upgrade that removes signature data from the main block and stores it off-chain – brought about two major changes on the Bitcoin network:  Signature data, which normally accounts for 65% of the data stored in a block, is removed from the main “base” block and stored in a separate block. This allows for more transactions to fit in each base block.  SegWit also introduced “block weight,” which technically increases Bitcoin blocks from 1 MB to 4 MB, consisting of 3 MB of signature data and 1 MB of transaction data.  What was particularly clever about the new block weight was because the base block still only stored 1 MB of transactions, it meant SegWit was compatible without all bitcoin users needing to upgrade to support it.  Average Bitcoin block size in the past year - Source: Ycharts  Today, there are several Bitcoin blocks that are 1MB in size or even bigger. That can be attributed to Segregated Witness, which allows for a theoretical block size of up to 4MB. Over 77% of network blocks make use of SegWit already.  Bitcoin miners aren’t obliged to fill blocks all the way up. They are able to “tailor” mined blocks anywhere from 0 to 1MB, while the standard Bitcoin client has a default setting of around 732KB.  Pros and cons for increasing the block size  The debate as to whether Bitcoin needs bigger blocks has raged on for years. Several arguments can be made as to why developers should or shouldn’t explore this option.  Potential benefits include:  Lower transaction fees  More transaction capacity to rival other payment systems  A boost for using bitcoin for micropayments  However, the counterarguments should not be overlooked either:  Becoming a full node becomes more expensive due to larger blocks  More centralization concerns if the outline above comes true  Security issues due to grouped full nodes, which create single points of failure.  As no one is officially “in charge” of Bitcoin, achieving consensus on this topic has proven incredibly challenging. There will always be winners, losers and those who do not care.  Different proposals to change the block size  Increasing the limit on the size of blocks is one option. That’s the thinking behind Gavin Andresen’s BIP 101 “bigger blocks” proposal, first pitched in May 2015 and eventually tested live as the Bitcoin XT client. BIP 101 was eventually removed from Bitcoin XT and replaced with a one-time block size increase to 2MB. However, the Bitcoin XT client is no longer in use in any significant manner.  The former lead developer and current chief scientist for the Bitcoin Foundation proposed raising the limit to 8MB, which would increase an additional 40% every two years until 2036https://github.com/gavinandresen/bips/blob/blocksize/bip-0101.mediawiki to accommodate future growth in CPU power, storage and bandwidth.  Originally, Andresen had sought a 20MB hard limit but many Chinese miners, who account for more than 50% of the network’s hashing power, expressed concerns over such a drastic change due to the country’s limited bandwidth.  Other proposals for the Bitcoin Core team include Pieter Wuille’s annual 17.7% block size increase and Jeff Garzik’s 2MB “emergency” proposal. However, these and other ideas have not achieved broad support among Bitcoin Core developers, and the debate seems to have calmed down since Segregated Witness has become the default transaction type on the network. As of August 2021, more than 77% of all bitcoin transactions use SegWit.  Problem solved, right?  As developer Peter Todd points out, blockchains – owing to their design – do not scale. Even Andresen, the mastermind behind the “bigger blocks” proposal as well as a driving force behind Bitcoin XT, concedes that raising the block size limit is akin to “kick[ing] the can down the road.”  Others have expressed concern that raising the block size limit will mean fewer full nodes – nodes that store the entire blockchain on a hard drive rather than a slimmed-down version – due to the increased data storage costs involved. This could dissuade users to operate full nodes and centralize the system around entities capable of handing bigger blocks. This, some opponents of bigger blocks say, would go against Bitcoin’s distributed, censorship-resistant nature.  Richard Gendal Brown, formerly with IBM UK and now with R3, has attributed this way of thinking, in part, to the security engineering mindset – “how can I break this?” – a fear of technical failure that would put this decision off. On the flip side, those who see the larger problem as a more immediate danger are driven by a fear of practical failure that will drive away users.  As Bitcoin blocks can now – theoretically – be up to 4MB in size, there is no immediate reason to increase the size further. That topic may be revisited in the future, depending on how widespread Bitcoin is used as a payments network.  So, what other future options are there?  Other solutions include various mechanisms that push the many tiny transactions on the Bitcoin network – such as those from gambling sites – “off-chain.” One, known as the Lightning Network, is a kind of “hub and spoke” system that lets two parties transact in private, then puts their data back on the blockchain at an agreed-upo time. The Lightning Network is available on the Bitcoin blockchain today, though adoption is still in its early stages.  Sidechains, spearheaded by $299 million-backed company Blockstream, has been mentioned in the context of the expansion discussion. However, some of the team behind the concept, which allows developers to experiment on separate chains pegged to the Bitcoin blockchain, say their focus isn’t scalability.  Luke-Jr, one of several Core developers involved with Blockstream, commented on Reddit:  “Sidechains aren’t about scaling, they’re about improving bitcoin’s functionality. Some of those features may be useful to improve scaling, but sidechains themselves don’t do it.”  As it has unfolded, the block size debate has touched on many pain points for the bitcoin currency as it seeks to grow. Bitcoin is many things to many types of people – anarchists, speculators, entrepreneurs – which, until now, hasn’t been much of a problem.  Despite Segregated Witness offering a temporary solution to the block size debate, the question of the currency’s future remains. Will it compete with the likes of Visa as a cheap, fast payment channel? Or should it remain an ultra-secure, premium – and scarce – store of value to which other services can be pegged?",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING | WALLET,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-debate-and-why-does-it-matter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3551dba7450b1bc354ba40d21c16c820a7d852df-1500x1059.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396789,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5HOF,1633697222,"US September Jobs Report Misses, Amid Fed Tapering Speculation","U.S. jobs rose by 194,000 in September, well below economists’ average estimate for a gain of 500,000 jobs, the Labor Department reported Friday.  But the data was mixed, with August’s jobs number revised upward by 131,000.  The combination may give the U.S. Federal Reserve more flexibility after Chair Jerome Powell signaled recently that the central bank looked to be on track to start tapering its $120 billion-a-month in bond purchases – a form of monetary stimulus – later this year.  “Overall, this looks like a ‘decent’ enough labor report to allow the Fed to proceed with the taper in November, as flagged at the last FOMC meeting,” Fitch Rating’s Chief Economist Brian Coulton said in an emailed statement, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee.  The concern among bitcoiners is that they would no longer be able to count on the Fed bringing more liquidity to the markets through quantitative easing (the policy of buying longer-term securities from the open market), which in the past has given investors the green light to keep putting money into riskier assets. The bitcoin price was holding steady after the report around $55,000.  “Powell made it clear we’re right on the edge,” said former Federal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm. A jobs gain of “200,000 or more will push [the Fed] to ‘further substantial progress,’” a phrase that Powell has used to describe the precondition for tapering.

The cryptocurrency was trading near $55,500, representing a 3% gain on the day, having printed a five-month high above $56,000 during European trading hours.  The higher lows and highs pattern seen in the featured chart above suggests that the path of least resistance is to the higher side. Upward momentum looks strong with the daily chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram charting higher bars above the zero line.  However, another failure to hold $56,000 would validate the overbought reading on the four-hour chart relative strength index (RSI), opening doors for a pullback. A price under $53,000 at 0:00 UTC – the de facto daily cutoff point for most chart readers – would weaken the immediate bullish case.

42396785,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5HMH,1633687857,"Bitcoin Peeps Above $56K, May Ignore US Jobs Report","Bitcoin rallied to a five-month high Friday ahead of a monthly U.S. jobs report that could cement expectations the Federal Reserve (Fed) will start unwinding crisis-era stimulus starting in November.  The top cryptocurrency by market value rose to $56,100, hitting its highest level since May 12 and taking the month-to-date gain to 27%. It was recently trading about $55,270.  The U.S. non-farm payrolls (NFP) report scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC on Friday is expected to show the world’s largest economy added 500,000 jobs in September, more than double August’s 235,000 additions. The jobless rate is expected to have dropped to 5.1% from 5.2%, according to FXStreet.  Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020, bitcoin has become sensitive to critical macro data releases, such as the NFP report, influencing the Fed’s monetary policy. This time, however, the cryptocurrency could ignore the data, even if it beats estimates and cements the case for a Fed taper. A weak report would, in any case, be positive for asset prices in general.  The indifference is because the bitcoin market is currently focused on speculation that U.S. regulators will soon approve a futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), opening doors for more mainstream money. The cryptocurrency appears to be on a solid footing, having decoupled from stocks and bounced hard from $40,000 despite adverse macro developments on institutional participation, as hinted by the surging premium in futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  “Bitcoin is looking too strong here,” said Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange. “The cryptocurrency has digested all the negative news that has come out of China in the past few weeks, which is a very positive sign.”  “There has been fresh spot buying activity in BTC, and looking at the price action, we expect to see a fresh ATH in the coming weeks,” he said, referring to an all-time high. The current record is $64,801, reached in April.  According to Singapore-based QCP Capital, there has been an overwhelming amount of outright buying in CME-based futures. “There are many reasons to be bullish; the stabilization of the Evergrande situation, possible upcoming approvals for BTC ETFs in the U.S., more traditional finance stalwarts like Soros Fund Management turning crypto-positive,” QCP Capital said.  Analysts told CoinDesk last month that bitcoin would remain resilient to any Fed taper. Being at the far end of the risk curve, bitcoin likely priced in an early end of stimulus during the May slide from $58,000 to $30,000. That was when the taper concerns first surfaced.  “The crypto [world] isn’t paying too much attention to quantitative easing [stimulus], and there is certainly a lot of money floating around the system, though, looking to invest in crypto projects at the moment,” Anthony Vince, global head of trading at GSR, told CoinDesk last month.  QCP Capital is cautiously bullish and foresees pullback if leverage, as measured by futures open interest (OI), continues to rise. “BTC OI is reaching levels [seen in chart below] that tend to precede market sell-offs. We will start to be cautious of potential downside risk if OI levels continue spiking,” QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel.  Open interest in futures contracts has more than tripled in one year, making the market more vulnerable to leverage washouts than a year ago.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/08/bitcoin-peeps-above-56k-may-ignore-us-jobs-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eabaff61a43cfa71d688401e6d971ee37d5764a4-1500x901.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The London-based company describes itself as a “digital-asset financial services platform.” It plans to appeal to fintech firms, corporate service providers, wealth managers and private banks that want to offer digital asset services to their clients, particularly those who fall between retail and multimillion-dollar institutional markets.  “BVNK aims to plug that gap in the mid-market and become the “go to” choice among fast-growth international businesses and partners for digital-asset financial services,” co-founder and CEO Jesse Hemson-Struthers said.  “There is clear appetite among mid-market enterprises for financial services rooted in the world of cryptocurrencies. It will take time, however, before mainstream banks incorporate digital assets.”  There’s a clue in the name: BVNK, with a “V” substituting for an upside-down “A.”  The platform will provide a business account for settlement, exchange and payment of crypto, access to markets for large-volume trades and a yield service where funds are deployed to brokers to earn interest.  BVNK’s immediate aim on launch is to build its product features and acquire the operating licenses from regulatory bodies across Europe.  Hemson-Struthers, who lists himself as an entrepreneur and investor on his LinkedIn page, was the founder of Balfour Group, an investment vehicle for startup technology businesses, and CoinDirect, a payment-services provider and over-the-counter trading service, where he also served as CEO.

42396774,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5HEP,1633675722,2020′s Bull Redux? CME Improves Its Ranking in Biggest Bitcoin Futures Exchanges List,"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has jumped to the No. 2 position on the list of the world’s biggest bitcoin futures exchanges by open interest.  This is notable because the exchange is seen as a proxy for institutional demand. Further, its latest jump from last month’s fourth spot is reminiscent of the exchange’s rise to the top seen during bitcoin’s fourfold, institutional-driven rally to nearly $40,000 in the final three months of 2020.  The CME now accounts for nearly 17%, or $3 billion, of the global futures open interest of $17.9 billion, according to data provided by the derivatives research firm Skew.  The CME is climbing ranks amid bitcoin’s price rally, as was the case a year ago. The cryptocurrency has rallied more than 30% to $54,000 since Sept. 29, decoupling from the weakness in stock markets. The derivatives giant rose to the second place in May, however, largely due to leverage washout or crash in open interest on other exchanges.  The annualized premium or basis on CME’s front-month futures has climbed to a six-month high of 15% – also a sign of increased institutional participation.  While CME has replaced FTX as the second-biggest exchange, Binance, which has come under the regulatory hammer in the past few months, retains the top spot, with an open interest of $4.1 billion. The CME dethroned Binance in late December 2020, but the latter quickly regained the top spot in the first quarter of this year.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/08/2020s-bull-redux-cme-improves-its-ranking-in-biggest-bitcoin-futures-exchanges-list,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9051c0fa61596d00acd76cdeee2ca1f155bb43b6-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) disclosed she bought bitcoin worth $50,001-$100,000, according to a Periodic Transaction Report filed Thursday.  Lummis, who has been buying bitcoin since 2013, executed her latest purchase on Aug. 16 via the brokerage platform River Financial. CNBC first reported the news.  Under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 (STOCK Act) senators and senior staff with earnings above $119,554 are required to disclose certain financial transactions. Part of the requirements means they must report any purchase, sale, or exchange of any stock, bond, commodities future and other securities on transactions above $1,000.  The senator previously served eight years as Wyoming’s state treasurer and told CoinDesk last year that during her time as treasurer she had always been looking for “something that was a good store of value.” Her son-in-law and his friends helped educate the senator about bitcoin’s potential as a store of value, she said, prompting her to jump on the bandwagon when the crypto was trading for around $320.  While a bitcoin advocate, Lummis slammed stablecoins during a speech on the Senate floor last week, saying they “must be 100% backed by cash ... and this should be audited regularly” expressing her concerns that cryptos pegged 1:1 to other sovereign fiat currencies lacked transparency.
