CoinDesk’s Christine Kim spoke to colleagues Michael J. Casey and Aaron Stanley about the most compelling and under-discussed topics about Ethereum 2.0 headlining next week’s conference.

This episode is sponsored by Crypto.com, Nexo.io and Elliptic.      From the dynamics of staking to the architecture of sharding, there haven’t been many topics Ethereum 2.0 core developers have shied away from discussing over the past five weeks on “Developer Perspectives: Ethereum 2.0.”      See also: 3 Things You Should Know Before Staking on Ethereum 2.0      Each discussion, however, has sparked new questions about the ramifications of Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake on the crypto markets and the broader blockchain industry.      “There’s a lot of unanswered questions about how the markets are going to behave,” said Casey, CoinDesk’s chief content officer. “Do we end up with a split, [with] two versions of ethereum or at least two tokens that trade differently in the marketplace?”      Casey added that financial engineers in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space will likely seek to unlock the liquidity of staked ETH on Ethereum 2.0 before token transfers are officially enabled on the network. What new DeFi products are created, their attributes and, most important, their impact on the value of ETH remain to be determined.      Along with lingering questions over how the markets will react to the launch of Ethereum 2.0, there’s also uncertainty over how the launch will affect the competitive landscape for dapp users and dapp developers in the crypto industry.      “What does the multi-chain future look like?” asked Stanley, CoinDesk’s managing director of events content. “If Eth 2.0 succeeds, … what does that mean for all these other [smart contract] chains out there? Are they going to go away or just cease to exist? I don’t think that’s the case.”      With the recent popularity around yield farming and liquidity mining on Ethereum, Stanley also questioned what the real incentives are for users holding large amounts of ETH, upwards of $11,000 worth, to stake on Ethereum 2.0 when they could earn “100x returns farming ‘hotdog coin’ or whatever the meme coin of the day is.”      See also: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto’s ‘Weird DeFi’ Moment      These questions are pertinent to the discussions happening next Wednesday at invest: ethereum economy.

42384884,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlpYl,1602356356,"SEC Will Be Forced to Give Crypto Guidance Despite Bureaucracy, Risk Avoidance: Peirce","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce, well known for her pro-cryptocurrencies views, said increased interest in the space will necessarily force the regulatory body to shift toward a more accommodating stance, but it won't be easy, according to a recent interview with Cointelegraph.    ""While we've been very slow in giving guidance, there is more and more interest from a wide spectrum of people, both inside the crypto space as well as inside the traditional financial institutions who are asking us for guidance,"" Peirce said. ""The landscape is changing so quickly.""  ""So I think we're going to be forced to confront that more and more in the coming years.""  Peirce blamed bureaucracy for the SEC's slowness to react to financial innovation, saying it acts as an impediment to change and discourages risk-taking.  ""It's really difficult,"" the commissioner said. ""There's so many different layers of bureaucracy things need to get through and people tend to be very hesitant to make decisions because when they do the ramifications come back on them if something goes wrong so it's easier to kick the can down the road.""  On the positive side, Peirce said that pro-crypto moves in the U.S. by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as well as actions by regulators in other countries are slowly prodding the SEC into action.  She also said there are a growing number of people at the SEC, many who are interested in crypto, who want the body to become more innovation-friendly. That, combined with the growing interest in financial innovation, will eventually cause the regulatory agency to shift, she said.  On another issue, the commissioner said Congress needs to be thinking about smart contracts and decentralized finance so it can give the SEC directives on how it wants the regulator to handle them.  Peirce said that while she hopes the SEC will revisit its decisions to reject BTC Exchange-Traded Funds, she declined to predict whether the regulator will ever approve them, saying the SEC seems to have made up its own standards just for BTC.  Though the commissioner called the prospect of a digital dollar ""likely,"" that's not where she says the real action is.

42384891,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlpip,1602329529,"Bitcoin Nears $11.5K on US Stimulus Prospects, Seems to Confirm Bullish Trend","Bitcoin's (BTC) uptrend gathered pace on Saturday with prices nearly testing $11,500 for the first time in over a month.    The biggest cryptocurrency by market value rose to $11,484 at 03:10 UTC – the highest level since Sept. 2, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Likely driving the move was optimism for the prospects for a U.S. stimulus package after the White House boosted its offer to Democrats on a pandemic relief package to the north of $1.8 trillion Friday.    A new round of stimulus would likely benefit BTC in at least three ways:    Government and central bank spending around the world in response to the coronavirus-induced slowdown, in the eyes of many, will inevitably result in inflation, and therefore be positive for the cryptocurrency.  Given the current correlation between equities and BTC, and that some investors treat BTC like it's a tech stock, anything that boosts equities invariably boosts BTC.  Stimulus paychecks would give individual investors money to invest, and some of those investments would likely be BTC.    Buyers stepped in around $10,500 earlier this week after payments company Square announced it had put some 1% of its assets into bitcoin.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $11,320, representing a 2% gain on the day.
