42404106,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMss,1583360113,"Russian Oligarch, Ex-Cabinet Minister Invested in Telegram's ICO, Court Filing Says","A Russian oligarch, a former cabinet minister and the COO of German fintech company Wirecard invested in Telegram’s $1.7 billion initial coin offering (ICO), according to a previously unreported court document.      Tycoon Roman Abramovich and former Minister of Open Government Affairs Mikhail Abyzov bought tokens, known as grams, via offshore funds, the document says.      These big names' involvement is the latest twist in the case brought against Telegram by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which claims the messaging app provider violated securities laws by failing to register its 2018 token sale.      The names, along with the amounts each of them invested, were listed in an attachment to an expert report by Stephen McKeon, a University of Oregon professor who was hired by Telegram to write an analysis of the Telegram Open Network (TON) blockchain project.      The report was filed by the SEC with the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York in January but received little notice. It contains a number of exhibits, including the “List of Potential Validators at Launch (Purchasers in Round 2).”      The second round, known as Stage A, was completed in March 2018 and raised Telegram another $850 million on top of the same amount raised in the first round, or pre-sale. The purchasers’ names have been largely kept secret, and the investors were prohibited from talking publicly about their participation.      Asked by CoinDesk about the source of the list attached to his report, McKeon declined to respond.    Soccer tycoon    The list includes a British Virgin Islands-based fund called Norma Investments Limited, controlled by Abramovich, an industrial tycoon and the owner of the Chelsea soccer club. According to the document, Norma invested $10 million in TON during the second round.      Rumors of Abramovich’s participation in TON have been circulating since the end of the first round. However, the billionaire himself never confirmed his involvement. John Mann, the spokesperson for Abramovich’s investment firm Millhouse, declined to comment.      Abramovich mostly makes headlines for his soccer ties, but he also was famously sued by his former partner, now deceased Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who claimed Abramovich “intimidated” him into selling his shares in the Russian oil company Sibneft by leveraging his relationship with the Russian authorities. Abramovich denied the allegations. Berezovsky lost the case.      Another fund, Russia-based Larnabel Ventures, invested $15 million in TON during the second round, the document says. The fund belongs to the Gutseriyev family. The head of the family, Mikhail Gutseriyev, made his wealth in the oil industry and founded the oil corporation Safmar.       His son Said Gutseriev, also a billionaire, who manages Larnabel Ventures, followed his father’s lead in the oil industry but also dipped his toe in a more modern business: In 2019, he invested in Currency.com, the first legal crypto exchange in Belarus founded after the country adopted crypto regulations in late 2018.       Later last year, a Russian media outlet reported that the Gutseriyev family business was under investigation for alleged oil smuggling.       Safmar’s press office did not answer CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.      Another notable name on the list is Batios Holdings Limited, a BVI-registered fund where former government minister Abyzov is a director, according to the SEC database. His relation to Batios became public after Russian law enforcement brought an embezzlement case against Abyzov in 2018.       Abyzov, who used to be responsible for the digitization of the government services, has been in jail since March 2019. He ended his government career in May 2018, after the Telegram ICO took place. Abyzov’s legal representative didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.    Fintech exec    Another notable investor listed in the document is Jan Marsalek, chief operating officer at German payment service Wirecard. According to the document, he invested $7 million in the second round of the TON token sale.      Last year, Wirecard partnered with TON Labs, the tech startup affiliated with TON investors, which helped Telegram work on the test version of its blockchain since March 2019. Wirecard and TON Labs agreed “to develop a joint digital financial services, payments and banking platform,” Wirecard announced last April.      The company did not answer CoinDesk’s questions about this partnership or Marsalek’s investment by press time. Wirecard's accounting practices came under scrutiny in a Financial Times investigation last year; the company has sued the newspaper.      Previously, two Russian millionaires publicly announced they invested in TON: the founder of the e-payment company Qiwi, Sergey Solonin, and David Yakobashvili, a co-founder of soft drink company Wimm-Bill-Dann, acquired by PepsiCo in 2010.      Solonin said he put $17 million in TON and Yakobashvili said he invested $10 million. However, according to an exhibit in McKeon's report, Yakobashvili’s total investment might be five times larger – $50 million, which would make him one of the largest single holders of TON’s yet-to-be-issued tokens.      As previously reported, Telegram’s oversubscribed token sale attracted prominent U.S. venture funds Kleiner Perkins, Benchmark, Sequoia, Lightspeed, Redpoint, Draper Dragon and Fortress.      The live version of the network was scheduled to launch in October 2019, but the SEC sued Telegram several weeks before the deadline. After the months of exchanging legal papers, the sides met in court on Feb. 19.    The judge promised to rule on the case before April 30 – the new deadline for the TON mainnet launch agreed upon by investors in October. In the meantime, Telegram kept working on TON all through the court battle: in November, it released a test crypto wallet, in February, a technical paper on the TON consensus protocol was published. Telegram also published the tech documentation for TON DNShttps://ton.org/DNS-HOWTO.txt, a service for running websites in the TON ecosystem.

42404100,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMmy,1583353785,India's Supreme Court Ruling Is a Win for the Whole Blockchain Industry,"Ajit Tripathi, a CoinDesk columnist, is an entrepreneur and crypto co-host at the Breaking Banks Europe Podcast. Previously, he served as a Fintech Partner at ConsenSys and a co-founder of PwC’s UK Blockchain Practice.      On Wednesday, the Supreme Court of India overturned the Central Bank’s ban on trading in virtual currencies. This order is clearly a major victory not only for the digital asset industry but also for India’s fast-growing fintech and technology industries. This progressive decision paves the way for measured and progressive regulation that will allow India, a leading software exporter and market for fintech, to benefit from rapid innovation in blockchain technology and digital assets.      I have spoken to colleagues at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and in the finance ministry about why India chose a blunt instrument such as a ban rather than a more measured approach to regulating digital assets. They said the RBI considers cryptocurrency a significant risk to India’s payments system.      Informally, these colleagues accepted that while India’s experience with cryptocurrencies has been just as uneven as that of China or the U.S., the real challenge for India has been law enforcement. Unlike China, India is an argumentative democracy, which means India can’t shoot scammers in the back of the head in rice paddies if necessary. Unlike the U.S., India has a very large population as well as arcane, out-of-date colonial-era laws and an underfunded judiciary, which means lawsuits drag in courts for years with no verdict or settlement.      Indeed, rule of law is a significant challenge in India, entirely unrelated to cryptocurrencies. When justice is likely to be delayed and therefore denied by default, it’s understandable for regulators to seek to eliminate rather than manage risk to consumers. That’s essentially why the central bank chose to ban rather than regulate first.    Village scams and the road ahead    We have all heard of the infamous Crypto Queen, Dr. Ruja Ignatova. On April 23, 2017, police arrested 18 people in Navi Mumbai for organizing a OneCoin recruitment event. In May, that led to the recovery of $4 million in nine bank accounts whereas $11 million was transferred before the authorities were able to seize it. It’s sufficient to say that the police’s concerns about the legendary scam have been proven prophetic and avoided an utter disaster like Uganda, where poor and middle-class victims lost several hundred million dollars in aggregate.      In 2017 and 2018, India’s challenge was not so much prominent initial coin offerings (ICO) sold on YouTube or Facebook but nonexistent, no-name coins sold by unscrupulous fraudsters in small towns and villages all around the country. The rampant ICO boom and nonexistent coins forced the RBI to restrict banks and financial institutions from providing any services to individuals or businesses dealing in virtual currency.    When justice is likely to be delayed and therefore denied by default, it’s understandable for regulators to seek to eliminate rather than manage risk to consumers.    This decision by the Supreme Court doesn’t address the law enforcement issue but it paves the way for creating rules that are nuanced and well designed. The decision will likely place the responsibility for regulating digital commodities like bitcoin in the hands of the commodities and securities markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).      This is good news for three reasons. First, the SEBI is India’s equivalent of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission combined, which means the Industry has fewer regulatory fiefdoms to engage and fewer issues and topics will fall through the cracks. Secondly, the crypto industry does not have to worry about a patchwork of state-by-state laws as we have to in the U.S. Third, the SEBI has prior experience in addressing market failure. In 2015, SEBI assimilated the former commodities regulator, the Futures Markets Commission after a multi-billion dollar scam undermined public trust in India’s commodities markets.      That has two major implications. First, SEBI is more likely to take a nuanced approach to treating mainstream, decentralized digital assets like bitcoin and ethereum differently from fly-by-night coins. Second, having a single market regulator for both equity-like tokens (many ICOs) and commodity-like tokens (e.g. bitcoin and ethereum) means fewer opportunities for regulatory confusion or regulatory arbitrage. All of this in turn means that, when India finally lays out a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, it will be one that is far clearer, efficient and transparent than the rampant confusion we have to deal with in the United States or Europe. Getting to that point will take sustained effort, but the prize is more than worth it.      While the RBI may not be able to restrict crypto to crypto transactions going forward, the central bank is still the prudential regulator of India’s banking and payments system. This means the RBI still has the power to restrict banks from offering fiat services to crypto businesses and might still choose to do so. This ring-fencing of the fiat system from crypto related risks is not unique to India and is essentially a BCBS (Basel Committee Recommendation to Prudential Regulators). European countries and the U.K. have only recently started unlocking these fiat bridges to crypto exchanges on a case-to-case basis and India may take some time to follow the learning curve. This requires ongoing constructive engagement with the central bank.      In my opinion, the primary social function of cryptocurrency is to finance the development of Web3, often also called the decentralized internet-of-value. We are so early in the development of this new architecture that most legacy enterprises or even mainstream VCs are often not the ideal source of funding for digital asset startups. So far, in the absence of crypto financing, there has been little incentive for India’s developers to prioritize blockchain technology ahead of opportunities in traditional software development.      At DevCon5 in Osaka, my former boss and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin called for the ethereum community to enlist one million developers to build Web3. It’s not difficult to argue that this mission can not be achieved without the participation of India’s thriving technology ecosystem. I hope that the overturning of RBI’s crypto ban will finally unlock this all important source of financing for India’s blockchain technology startups and bring one million developers from India alone to blockchain and crypto platforms.    Too early to celebrate    Two years ago, at a Bloomberg conference in London, I called upon the crypto community to take a grown-up approach to engaging with the legal system and the regulators. That’s exactly what India’s crypto community has done and this mature and thoughtful approach has clearly set a precedent and thus delivered sustainable results.      But it’s too early to celebrate. As I highlighted in this article, the industry has just won the first battle, not the war. We still need to engage with the RBI, the SEBI and the central government to create a favorable and sustainable environment for crypto that accelerates innovation while also protecting consumers. In spite of the IMAI’s terrific win, India still lacks well-funded industry level forums to constructively engage with policymakers.      In the last three years, several major crypto companies have withdrawn entirely from India – a significant lost opportunity for the nation. Now would be the perfect time for these companies to re-engage and put India right back in their plans for investment, hiring, technology partnerships and ecosystem development – a process which I personally intend to contribute to in the coming months.      The future is bright for crypto and it looks brighter because India is a bigger part of the picture.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Ajit Tripathi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/04/indias-supreme-court-ruling-is-a-win-for-the-whole-blockchain-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0874943ac2865702f1fb2b3f365d8c551ee64b0d-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over the past 24 hours, the price rose a mere 0.07 percent.       The surprise U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut Tuesday corresponded with a spike in positive cryptocurrency trading, with a jump of 1,699 trades in one hour on Coinbase. However, bitcoin’s 10-day moving average crossed below the 50-day average at around 12:00 a.m. UTC, falling even though Tuesday’s trading action pushed prices back up into the $8,800 range.      The subsequent holding pattern for bitcoin prices can be attributed to jittery trading sentiment related to coronavirus fears, according to Alex Mashinsky, chief executive of cryptocurrency lender Celsius.      ""Recent volatility in crypto markets has been driven by speculators responding to the virus, liquidating and withdrawing their cash or going long on margin. This group is a small part of the crypto community, but they continue to wield an outsized effect on prices,” said Mashinsky.      The U.S. central bank rate cut, an emergency measure taken because of concerns about the coronavirus possibly slowing the economy, did not initially help the S&P 500 Index. It was down 2.81 percent at Tuesday’s close. It rebounded toward the middle of trading on Wednesday.      Bitcoin has stayed below the $9,000 level since it dropped 7 percent on Feb. 26.

42404094,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMf6,1583345185,"After Court Victory, Indian Exchanges Gear Up for Crypto Trading Surge","The decision by India's Supreme Court to lift the central bank’s ban on cryptocurrency trading could soon translate into notable growth in trading volumes, according to cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.      India’s Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) order dated April 6, 2018, which prohibited banks from providing services to entities dealing with cryptocurrencies.      The top court called RBI’s ban unconstitutional, bringing cheer to the crypto market community.      Put simply, Indian traders will now be able to directly deposit Indian rupee (INR) from bank accounts to crypto exchanges. As a result, it will be more convenient for users to cash in and cash out of their holdings.      “This is the first step towards embracing cryptocurrency in India, which has the potential of becoming one of the largest crypto markets.” Ashish Singhal, chief executive of the cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.co, told CoinDesk.      India was doing very well in terms of trading volumes, contributing about $50 million to $60 million per day before the RBI ban, according to Singhal.      “In India, a huge damage was done due to the lack of awareness and RBI’s decision,” said Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO at online crypto banking platform Cashaa.      Volumes subsequently dipped after the central bank issued banking restrictions and commercial banks responded by advising account holders not to engage in cryptocurrency transactions.      For instance, Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of the largest lenders in India, has diligently sent multiple notification emails to account holders in the last two years warning against the use of credit cards for cryptocurrency exchanges.      “In line with the instructions issued by RBI, we also wish to advise you that, if transactions relating to any kind of virtual currencies are witnessed on your Kotak Credit Card, the Bank shall be constrained to block your Credit Card without any further intimation,” the email reads.      As a result, Indians crypto traders were forced to use peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms, which allow direct transfer of cryptocurrencies into the individual accounts without the intervention of any financial institution or government authority. However, liquidating cryptocurrency holdings is quite difficult when dealing with P2P platforms.      Also, RBI’s decision was widely misinterpreted as legal ruling deeming cryptocurrency trading as an unlawful activity.      With the Supreme Court’s latest ruling, the situation is widely expected to change for the good.      “Crypto exchanges including WazirX will now be able to enable banking channels for fiat deposit and withdrawals,” said Nischal Shetty, founder & CEO of Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, which was recently acquired by Binance, the world's largest exchange by trading volume.      Shetty expects volumes on Indian cryptocurrency exchanges to grow by 10 times in the near future.      CoinSwitch’s Ashish Singhal anticipates average daily volume rising as high as $50 million to $60 million – the level seen before the RBI ban – and may surpass that level.      A sharp rise in volumes cannot be ruled out in India, a country with a population of over 1 billion. The Supreme Court judgment could help erase the misconception that cryptocurrencies are illegal and may draw more investors to the market.      “The clarity that the judgment has brought, will help crypto adoption as a whole and which in tune will see a spike in volume,” said CoinDCX Chief Executive Sumit Gupta. CoinDCX has actively voiced its thoughts on behalf of India’s crypto community on the RBI ban over the last two years and was quick to allow bank transfers following the ruling.    Focus on compliance    “The Supreme Court decision to lift the bank is a forthcoming step and cryptocurrency exchanges should now start focusing on deploying stronger know-your-client (KYC), user data privacy, and AML policies,” according to Arpit Ratan, co-founder of RegTech startup Signzy.      Indeed, that would help build trust and reduce risks of cryptocurrency transactions being exploited for illegal activities, such as crimes, money laundering and tax evasions.      Moreover, Indian lenders serving cryptocurrency entities will now face similar which banks in other, developed countries such as Japan, Europe, and the U.S. are facing.      “Cashaa, with its huge crypto-focused customer base, can provide a powerful system that will be very helpful for RBI to understand the [anti-money laundering] issues coming due to onboarding crypto companies is needed,” said Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO of Cashaa.    Premature optimism?    The general consensus is the Supreme Court’s ruling would open a path to favorable regulations towards protecting all stakeholders, including companies, customers and users.      However, despite the top court’s decision, the government could still ban cryptocurrencies.      “There’s still a bill that the Parliament has to discuss. It has changed shapes and forms but hopefully this will be the framework for how cryptocurrency is traded in the country,"" said Prashant Swaminathan, founder and CEO of Tandem, a peer-to-peer bitcoin (BTC) trading platform told Mint, an Indian financial daily newspaper.      The Indian government had submitted a draft crypto bill named entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currencies” to the Supreme Court in August 2019, seeking to ban the use of cryptocurrency as legal tender or currency and prohibit mining, buying, holding, selling, dealing in, issuance, disposal or use of cryptocurrency.      However, the government did not introduce the draft bill in the winter session of the parliament held between Nov. 18 and Dec. 13.      So the regulations and legalities of operating cryptocurrency businesses in India remain unclear. As a result, volume growth may still not be as strong as some expect.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/04/after-court-victory-indian-exchanges-gear-up-for-crypto-trading-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/948d1122415dcd1b64b56a0f3e448bd614be449b-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404096,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMi3,1583344227,Indian Crypto Exchange Adds Bank Transfers Hours After RBI Ban Lifted,"An Indian cryptocurrency exchange has added support for bank account transfers, hours after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was forced to lift its cryptocurrency ban.      Mumbai-based CoinDCX announced Wednesday that users can now purchase cryptocurrencies with the Indian rupee, as the exchange became the first platform in India to fully integrate bank account transfers.      The integration came less than six hours after the Supreme Court of India ruled against a 2018 ban imposed by the RBI, which banned domestic financial institutions from providing banking services to cryptocurrency companies.      Anirudh Rastogi, the founder and managing partner of Ikigai Law, the law firm that filed the original petition on behalf of CoinDCX and other exchanges, commented that the judges' decision was made on the grounds there was little evidence to suggest cryptocurrencies posed a threat to the banking system.      The RBI ban was deemednot to be ""proportionate to the risk sought to be addressed by such ban,"" Rastogi said.      In a statement, CoinDCX co-founder and Chief Executive Sumit Gupta said the court verdict would likely be the catalyst for a ""transformation"" in the Indian cryptocurrency industry.      A banking integration was the exchange's ""first priority"" now that Indian citizens could once again invest in digital assets, Gupta said.      ""With renewed accessibility and convenience in purchasing cryptocurrencies, we believe that this change will have a dramatic effect in accelerating crypto adoption in India,"" Gupta said.      It's unclear whether the banking integration means CoinDCX has struck up a partnership with an Indian financial institution.

42404102,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMnx,1583343605,Coronavirus Rate Cuts: Australia's Central Bank Did It First,"Hours before the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) also cut interest rates in hopes of curbing market reaction to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.      In a meeting held on March 3, the RBA announced it would be cutting the cash rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 0.50 percent, its lowest on record, according to recent figures.      Several hours later, the U.S. Federal Reserve also took action to cut interest rates by half a percentage point, between 1 and 1.25 percent, in its first emergency measure since the 2008 global financial crisis.      The cuts in Australia and the U.S. are designed to boost demand to assist in easing pressure for local businesses and homeowners. It marks the first cut for Aussies this year and is further evidence that central bankers are becoming weary of the continuing threat the coronavirus poses on global growth.      ""The coronavirus has clouded the near-term outlook for the global economy and means that global growth in the first half of 2020 will be lower than earlier expected,"" the RBA board said in a recent media release.      Solutions, like that of America's quantitative easing (QE) programs, have not been ruled out by the RBA, with preparations being made for additional rate cuts to ease monetary conditions even further.      In a recent tweet commenting on the RBA's decision, U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. fell behind ""others"" when it came to lowering interest rates, which were currently applying pressure to U.S. exporters.      Still, in the face of a looming recession, cryptocurrencies have failed to attract new capital to the fore as investors look to cash as the safest investment vehicle.      The global slowdown in growth for stocks and bonds have so far failed to translate into higher prices for digital assets, which have intermittently held the status as a risk-off asset, forcing investors to play a much more dangerous game.      ""When things go from bad to very very bad like they did last week, investors take leverage down as fast as they can. They book profits to make up for other losses. Ouch,"" Galaxy Digital Chief Executive Michael Novogratz said in a recent tweet.    Flight to safety    Bitcoin's (BTC) role as a safe-haven asset continues to be questioned after it dropped 2 percent on Monday amid the backdrop of the U.S. Fed's decision to cut rates. Prices have since then rebounded by about 2.5 percent but have failed to attract further investment on the day.      It comes at a time when the world's second-largest economy, China, also a large participant of crypto mining, is deeply caught up in one of the worst contagions in recent memory.      Conventional crypto wisdom holds that loose monetary and fiscal policies would be a net positive for the crypto markets, with capital flowing from stocks to digital assets. However, it would appear that traditional investors have been playing it safe, sticking to well-worn strategies by remaining liquid with cash reserves and avoiding what some would perceive as risky investment decisions.      ""Unlike traditional safe havens such as gold or the [U.S. dollar], the BTC market is a speculative one with high volatility, which might explain why they are failing to act as a safe haven asset,"" said Nemo Qin, markets analyst at eToro.      ""While gold has been rallying since Sunday evening, crypto assets including BTC continue to face heavy sell-offs amid the growing global epidemic, challenging bitcoin’s safe-haven status,"" Qin added.

For early access before our regular noon Eastern time releases, subscribe with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica or RSS.      Yesterday, CoinDesk launched its Post-Trust Election series, looking at how politics and the U.S. presidential campaigns are grappling with issues of cryptocurrency, data security, privacy, disinformation, online voting and other areas. We spoke with Ben about why we're launching this series and what it means. Benjamin was on the ground in South Carolina in the days leading up to that primary, heard all the major candidates speak and spoke with voters, so we wanted to see whether cryptocurrencies and blockchain were factoring into people's thought process around the primaries and election.      The candidates have been largely silent on the issue of cryptocurrencies, outside of the Andrew Yang campaign before it folded. But with trust in traditional institutions waning, the rise of a digital national currency in China, and whispers of the same in the U.S., the world of cryptocurrency is seemingly on a collision course with politics. In the same way things like election interference, disinformation, and the impact of tech platforms rose to national prominence in the years following 2016, we think stablecoins, decentralization and privacy will have a similar impact on the national discourse leading up to, and in the wake of, 2020.

Singapore-based Matrixport, founded by Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu last February, is looking to raise $40 million in a new raise, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.      Should the round be successful, Matrixport's post-money valuation would hit $300 million, nearly triple the $114 million the young company reached with its previous funding. Matrixport claims to have made revenue between $7 million and $8 million since beginning operations last July, according to a pitch deck seen by Bloomberg.      The company started actively pitching investors a few weeks ago.      Matrixport provides regulatory compliant crypto-related financial services to professional traders, including OTC trading and lending services, as well as a custody solution. Most recently in February, the company launched a product helping traders successfully identify and take advantage of market dips.      CoinDesk previously reported that many Matrixport staff came from Bitmain's blockchain-development department, a division directly under Wu's control.

42404095,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMg5,1583334004,"Microsoft, EY and ConsenSys Tout New Way for Big Biz to Use Public Ethereum","It’s time for big business to embrace the public chain – as a coordination tool, rather than as a place to carry out large-scale financial transactions.      That’s the view of a trio of heavy hitters in the enterprise blockchain space: EY, ConsenSys and Microsoft. The group has come up with a new way of using the public ethereum mainnet to connect firms’ internal systems for resource planning.      They are calling it the Baseline Protocol.      Using Ethereum as a kind of message-orientated middleware, rather than a source-of-truth data repository, is a novel approach. Some people might even think it boring, said John Wolpert, head of Web3Studio at ConsenSys.      “It’s about changing the mental model from system of record to middleware,” Wolpert said. “That’s a pretty boring way to use the blockchain. I think we could use a little boring.”      A useful analogy, says Wolpert, is thinking of Ethereum like an old-school message bus, a type of messaging infrastructure connecting distributed systems and interfaces. Ethereum offers a highly expressive version of this, which Wolpert likes to call the “Magic Bus.”      This concept ought to be attractive to the chief security officers of large enterprises since their critical data all remains within their firewalls, he added. Then there’s the hundreds of millions of dollars spent integrating large scale enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) systems.      Rather than build a general set of tools, team Baseline has chosen to pick off one specific use case in the area of procurement: comparing and verifying purchase orders and the like. These records, and some of the business logic attached to them, are then tokenized.      The Baseline Protocol code will be released later this month and a technical steering committee is also being formed. The committee will include the likes of EY, Microsoft, ConsenSys, Splunk, MakerDAO, Duke University, ChainLink, Unibright, Envision Blockchain, Neocova, Core Convergence, Provide and W3BCloud.      “We can use the mainnet as a common frame of reference,” said Wolpert. “I can say my purchase order is the same as the record you have of that same purchase order. The business rules that we employ to transform that record or use it to make new records is going to be executed by both of us in the same way.”      But all this talk of tokens and public blockchains tends to make the enterprise world nervous. Creating shared immutable systems of record and eliminating costly reconciliation has typically been the hunting ground of private blockchain projects.      Paul Brody, head of blockchain at EY, believes the private DLT model is fundamentally flawed.      “We have long believed that private blockchains don't scale very well because it's hard for companies to want to join somebody else's private network. Indeed there’s a lot of evidence to suggest that's the biggest problem,” said Brody.    Zero-knowledge proofs make it possible    Surely the biggest elephant in the room here is privacy: Blockchains reveal data. But as Wolpert points out, this problem is common to both public and private chains. “Blockchains are the digital nudist colonies of IT, and a private blockchain is just a nudist colony on a private beach,” he said.      The tokenizing part of the Baseline system is done using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a way of mathematically proving you are privy to a secret without having to share any its attributes.      Brody explained a good deal of progress has been made with ZKPs, referencing EY’s Nightfall project and work done within ConsenSys by Aztec, a London-based startup focused on the technology.      Baseline will manage tokens under zero-knowledge using shield contracts with the key metadata related to the tokens stored off-chain.      But blockchains and zero-knowledge proofs don’s scale well. ZKPs require a lot of computation and when they run on public ethereum there is the cost of gas to consider, the price levied on ethereum transactions.      EY has been exploring ways of batching ZKPs together to make them scale better and to reduce the cost of running them on blockchains like ethereum.      “There’s a lot of FUD deployed around blockchain scalability. The truth is if I have to wait four minutes for my transactions to clear most enterprises won’t even notice,” Brody said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MKR | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/04/microsoft-ey-and-consensys-tout-new-way-for-big-biz-to-use-public-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f0fe93efb22f833d6aa32b5382cebc4d37e732b8-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404105,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMpv,1583330425,Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global Warming,"This year’s Hyperledger Global Forum, the annual gathering for big companies seeking the benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT), opened in Phoenix, Ariz., with a film of a woman walking through a bamboo forest gathering up crimson thread.      The metaphor of traceability was hammered home in the Accenture flick, asserting that blockchain empowers people to buy from companies that share their values, giving consumers the info needed ""to contribute to an inclusive green economy.""      ESG (the new shorthand for environmentally minded corporate do-gooding) and how it overlaps with digital identity appeared to take center stage at this year's event, with perhaps less of an emphasis on banking consortia and trade finance blockchains.      Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf said the ideal scenario is combining positive social impact with positive financial implications for the different participants, or a double bottom-line approach.      He gave the example of diamond-tracking blockchain Everledger, where there are real commercial reasons to want to verify a diamond didn’t come out of a factory, but also it didn't come via slave labor.      “A blockchain purely for social impact might be challenging to get enough critical mass,” said Behlendorf.      Important new projects, including blockchain-enabled climate accounting to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, are figuring out the right framework and incentives.      “This will depend upon a regulatory environment and a trustworthy set of auditors, but also commercial motivation for companies to reduce their emissions – using the blockchain as a way to keep track of who is emitting what and getting credit for cutting your emissions,” said Behlendorf.    The Tesla example    Social-impact tracking platform Circulor, built in conjunction with Oracle using Hyperledger Fabric, began its life tracking cobalt from mines in the Congo. The startup is now attributing carbon footprints to the dynamic flow of materials (natural rubber and leather as well as electric car battery components) across the supply chains of Daimler and Volvo.      “The reason this is important is that electric cars are worse for the planet than normal cars,” said Circulor CEO Doug Johnson-Poensgen. “Why? Because the carbon footprint in the supply chain is bloody enormous.”      In other words, a Tesla Model 3 and a BMW 7 Series would both have to drive about 50,000 miles before their total carbon footprint was exactly the same. In the case of the gas-powered 7 Series, this is based on tailpipe emissions; but for the all-electric Model 3, it’s about the supply chain that built it – and half of that is the battery.      Politicians such as U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson who enthusiastically tout an all-electric-car future either choose to ignore this fact or simply don’t understand it, said Johnson-Poensgen.      “Building that battery involves the carbon footprint of large-scale mining, multiple stages of chemical refining and it’s all geographically dispersed – mined in Africa, refined in China, turned into cathode in South Korea and then back to China to be turned into a battery,” he said. “And of course, China uses a lot of coal-fired electricity and are therefore a significant carbon consumer.”      Blockchain is an essential first step in accounting for this complexity.      Car manufacturers are interested because they all have carbon neutrality targets. Buying a slightly more expensive electric battery component from a manufacturer that uses hydropower could potentially knock five years off their carbon neutrality footprint.      “You can’t reduce something you can’t measure,” said Johnson-Poensgen. “So if this is the flow of my material and I understand the carbon footprint of each segment of transport or manufacture along that way, I can engage my tier-one suppliers, my battery manufacturer, for example, in a conversation about balancing sustainability with price. At the moment it’s all about price.”    Accountability    The carbon accounting problem was framed at a dizzying scale by Hyperledger’s Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group.      The goal of the project, which also grew out of work done at Yale Open Innovation Lab, is to create a global climate accounting mechanism that can be compatible with the Paris Agreement.      There are certain climate accounting efforts that happened at the United Nations level that are essentially accountability of countries and their pledges, but big companies are also making these pledges.      That’s why an enterprise blockchain conference is a good place to build collaborations, said Martin Wainstein, the founder of the Yale Open Innovation Lab who co-chairs Hyperledger’s climate action group.      “We know the biggest climate actors today are the companies. But their type of pledges have very little accountability,” said Wainstein. “When big companies make these pledges it’s also because they know the next generation is angry, and those are their customers of the future.”      Exploring the role of digital transformation for a trusted climate accounting system has involved looking at blockchain and IoT and also things like the blockchain-based Spatial Web initiative, said Wainstein.      “You have to think about a climate internet or a planetary internet that can talk about jurisdiction, spatial contracts, volumetrics and clear expression levels. Hyperledger has become a very interesting center of gravity around this.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/04/hyperledger-conference-shows-where-blockchain-can-fight-global-warming,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1b1226ab7b8d515fa5e1b81fecc5d612ab7d535-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The so-called ""fraud factory,"" working from two floors of plush offices in Kyiv, was exposed after an investigation by Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter (DN) published Monday.      Called Milton Group, the firm was revealed to have employed ranks of telemarketers cold-calling potential investors, often older people, and offering inviting returns on money put into stocks and cryptocurrencies.      However, DN writes in the report: ""Their real operation is committing fraud on an industrial level – and their victims are from all around the world.""      Responding to the claims on Tuesday, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said, ""It is really upsetting to see how they bluff Swedish retirees who have to leave their homes and live on a minimum subsistence level. And then they sit there, laughing.""      As quoted by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Linde added that it's ""important"" that authorities in Ukraine are informed about Milton Group's alleged activities and that the claims are looked into.      DN alleges a number of individuals have lost their life savings through the scheme. In all, it says that the firm has left possibly 1,000 people from over 50 countries with losses. It's not clear how much money may have been taken by the scheme, but a team member is caught on video boating of persuading one individual to hand over $150,000.      After persuading a victim to part with an initial investment of around $100, DN said, the salesperson then attempts to persuade the victim to install a program said to assist with financial advice. In fact, it provides Milton's staff with full control of the host computer. The claims include that ""big"" loans were taken out in victims' names without their permission using banking data stolen via the app and ID information that victims were asked to provide.      After initial investments, victims are shown figures suggesting high returns. Yet when they tried to withdraw the funds, the money disappeared, the investigation found. Some have also been left with sizable loans they hadn't agreed to.      The investigation was carried out with the help of a whistle-blower within Milton Group who provided materials from the firm's own database, as well as video recordings of the team's activities.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/04/sweden-calls-for-action-over-ukraine-crypto-fraud-factory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a081ad8579784ee6daf93377b988f143bf8c3a68-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The product, which hasn't yet been named publicly, will work on Samsung SDS' Nexledger Universal platform, the proprietary blockchain first unveiled in 2017. Work processes will be automated using AI technology from Brity Works, another Samsung SDS company.      Hong Won-pyo, Samsung SDS president and chief executive, said to local media the agreement with Credorax, which has already provided solutions to companies across the European Union and broader economic area, will enable the Korean tech company to gain a foothold in the region's payments sector.      ""Together with Credorax, which specializes in payments solutions, Samsung SDS will try to expand its business in the European sectors that seek digital transformation,"" he said.      Credorax did not immediately respond to requests for comment.      Samsung SDS changed its articles of association in February to include e-finance as one of its main business areas. SDS' value grew by $3.7 billion in 2019, an above-average growth rate for the broader tech sector. Speaking to the Korea Herald, Chief Strategy Officer Im Soo-hyun attributed the company's good fortunes to successful inroads into AI and blockchain technology.

42404112,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMwo,1583321150,Bitcoin Keeps Recovery Hopes Alive With Defense of Major Average Support,"View  A corrective bounce above $9,000 is suggested by a bullish daily chart candlestick pattern. However, that may remain elusive if buyers fail to defend the 200-day average at $8,720.  A daily chart trend indicator is reporting a weakening of bear momentum. BTC, therefore, is likely to hold the average support.  The bullish reversal candlestick pattern would be invalidated only if prices find acceptance under Sunday's low of $8,410.    Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the hunt for a notable recovery with prices holding above widely tracked average support.      The top cryptocurrency is currently trading above $8,760, having defended the 200-day moving average (MA) support at $8,720 early on Wednesday.      The support level is widely considered a barometer of long-term market trends and tends to attract buying or selling pressure, depending on the direction in which it is breached.      Therefore, a corrective bounce to levels above $9,000 put forward by a bullish reversal candlestick pattern confirmed Monday may remain elusive if prices find acceptance under the long-term average.      The key support has held ground so far today, keeping hopes for a recovery rally alive. The average support withstood selling pressure on Tuesday.      Bitcoin ran into offers during Tuesday’s U.S. trading hours as the stock markets dropped with the Federal Reserve's announcement of a 50 basis point rate cut. Prices briefly fell below the 200-day average but the bears failed to secure a daily close under the support level.    Daily chart    Bitcoin jumped 4.5 percent on Monday, confirming a bullish reversal doji candle and opening the doors for a notable corrective rally. That pattern will remain valid as long as prices are holding above $8,410 (Sunday’s low).      That said, the prospects of a quick move to resistance at $9,075 (Feb. 4 low) would weaken if the 200-day average support at $8,720 gives in. That could yield a re-test of $8,410.      However, a sustained drop below the 200-day MA looks unlikely, as the MACD histogram is registering a higher low below zero for the fourth consecutive day – a sign of weakening bearish momentum.      So bitcoin appears more likely to bounce from the 200-day MA toward resistance at $9,075 (Feb. 4 low). A violation there would expose the next resistance lined up at $9,312 (Feb. 19 low).    Hourly chart    Bitcoin is trapped in a broadening descending channel on the hourly chart. A break above the top end of the channel, currently at $8,820, would confirm a breakout and imply an end of the pullback from Monday’s high of $8,980 and a resumption of the rally from Sunday’s low of $8,410.      That would strengthen the case for a bounce to levels above $9,000.

42404110,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMvp,1583316000,"The Markets Were Already Vulnerable, Then Came Coronavirus","Kevin Kelly, a CoinDesk columnist, is a co-founder and chief market strategist for Delphi Digital, a research and consulting boutique dedicated to the digital asset market.      The “Everything Rally” that has characterized financial markets for much of the last year was flipped on its head this past week as the markets scrambled to make sense of the growing uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus outbreak. The extent of last week’s price falls took many by surprise, but underneath the surface the risk of a major correction had been building for weeks as bond and equity markets began pricing in faltering outlooks for the global economy. On Feb. 19, the day the U.S. equity market peaked, I noted a handful of key indicators that highlighted this polarity, and it appears the “inflection point” for markets has finally arrived.      Up until last week, markets were sending opposing messages as to how the future was likely to unfold. On one hand, stocks appeared entirely unfazed by the latest COVID-19 developments; so much so that on Feb. 19, the S&P 500 notched its 25th all-time closing high in the last 60 trading days. Meanwhile, the “safest” corners of the bond market (i.e. U.S. Treasurys) were trading like the worst was yet to come as yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell to within 20 basis points of their all-time low. Fast forward and we’ve finally seen risk assets cave to the bond market’s view coming off the S&P 500’s worst weekly decline since the 2008 financial crisis.      It’s still too early to tell whether the coronavirus will be the proverbial straw to break the back of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, but the outbreak certainly threatens to destabilize an already vulnerable global economy, the implications of which will be felt across every asset class, including those in the digital asset space.      Let me preface this by saying I’m no epidemiologist (nor do I play one on TV) and there are still a great deal of unknowns surrounding COVID-19. Even the reported case totals (which breached 90,000 over the weekend) are to be taken with a grain of salt given inconsistent testing and politically motivated repression. It’s difficult to forecast the economic fallout because a global pandemic hits aggregate supply and demand simultaneously. Attempting to forecast the impact of coronavirus on global GDP at this juncture is like trying to hit a moving target while strapped inside NASA’s MAT simulator. Nevertheless, I believe there are two scenarios that present the most likely path forward.      The optimistic scenario and the pessimistic one    Behind door number one is the optimistic scenario: The repercussions of the coronavirus outbreak are relatively short-lived, the demand curve shifts out a few quarters, and an antiviral vaccine is tested and approved to help contain its contagion. Such circumstances would all but guarantee a serious correction in bonds, notably U.S. Treasurys, which are pricing in aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the coming weeks. The assumption global interest rates can only go lower has become ingrained in market consensus, increasing the downside asymmetric risk to the safety trade that’s pushed long-dated Treasury yields to their lowest level on record. Conversely, risk assets, such as stocks, would also rebound, likely breaking back to all-time highs. While many people find this scenario highly unlikely, it’s important to note how strong market consensus is for a far more dire outcome. Let’s hope for everyone’s sake the market is wrong.      Creeping behind door number two is the doomsday scenario: Coronavirus contagion fails to be contained, major metropolitan areas come under quarantine, fear and panic spreads like wildfire, and the global economy comes to a grinding halt. This would undoubtedly prompt central banks to cut rates aggressively (as the Federal Reserve has already proven) and restart their infamous asset purchase programs (if they haven’t already). This may provide temporary relief to markets, but it’s less likely to stave off a powerful deflationary threat to global demand, unless these cuts keep credit conditions relatively loose.      Policymakers would also ramp up fiscal stimulus measures in an attempt to support their central bank counterparts, specifically targeting small and medium-size businesses facing temporary cash flow disruptions. Rampant Treasury issuance would likely be soaked up by the Fed, pushing its balance sheet, national debt and the risk of dollar debasement to new heights.      At the same time, public fear over COVID-19 coupled with the growing number of mandated quarantines, travel restrictions and company shutdowns pose a considerable threat to global consumption, notably the U.S. consumer. American consumption is not only the backbone of the U.S. economy, it serves as a major support for global economic activity, too. This is where the situation can get dicey quickly.      Historically low rates encouraged an explosion of non-financial corporate debt issuance over the last decade, which recently surpassed $10 trillion in the U.S. alone (and that’s not even counting a swath of small and medium-size private businesses). Not all debt is inherently evil. When the economy is expanding, companies can take on leverage to grow their operations and increase market share. In theory, these companies become more profitable and thus are more capable of servicing their debts. But the world is far from ideal, and debt loads have continued to grow even as the outlook for corporate profitability weakens, not to mention Wall Street’s obsession with share buyback plans. On top of that, ""BBB""-rated bonds (one rating above speculative-grade) now make up over 50 percent of investment-grade debt in the U.S., according to S&P Global.    Attempting to forecast the impact of coronavirus on global GDP at this juncture is like trying to hit a moving target while strapped inside NASA’s MAT simulator.    If the fallout from coronavirus weakens consumer spending and aggregate demand takes a hit, companies big and small will see a slowdown (or contraction) in sales. Falling revenue would pressure margins and corporate profits, which could lead to an increase in downgrades by major rating agencies, higher borrowing costs and, in an extreme scenario, a credit market freeze. In isolation, this growing debt burden isn’t paramount as long as credit conditions remain favorable.      But the crux of debt-based economies lies in the ability for individuals, local businesses and multinationals to readily gain access to credit and short-term funding.If credit conditions tighten considerably, it will accelerate the timeline and risk of recession, and at that point the catalyst won’t be nearly as important as the aftermath.      If panic over the coronavirus outbreak spreads, we can expect to see more supply chain disruptions, quarantines, mandated company shutdowns and, as a result, more uncertainty and unrest. The longer the hysteria lasts, the higher the risk companies will fall behind on servicing sizable debt loads, which could unleash a far greater fear to asset prices than fear itself. Any material threat to the economy will provoke more extreme responses from monetary and fiscal policymakers, driving demand for hard, scarce assets.

According to the new document, first reported by Russian-language crypto news outlet Forklog, taxpayers should report digital assets as intangible property, similar to intellectual property or licenses for natural resources extraction.      The guidance indicates cryptocurrencies, according to the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) definition, are a digital unit of value, which can be traded electronically and transferred, and used as a means of payment or investment.      To report cryptocurrency holdings, taxpayers should name the assets they hold (such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, etc.) as well as the date of acquisition, the amount owned on the last day of the tax period, and the value of the holdings in Ukraine’s national currency (the hryvnia) according to the exchange rate on the last day of the tax period.      Ukraine has recently made a series of moves aimed at clarifying the rules around cryptocurrency. In February, the country’s Ministry of Digital Transformation made the surprisingly tech-savvy announcement that it was not planning to regulate cryptocurrency mining since it’s already governed by the rules of the blockchain protocol.      Ukraine's financial watchdog earlier indicated [crypto service providers would be obliged to monitor all crypto transactions above $1,200 and report suspicious activities to the authorities. And a bill yet to be passed by Ukraine’s parliament proposes crypto-related earnings be taxed at a 5 percent rate for the first five years after passage.      Yet, the country has still to come up with a comprehensive set of regulations for the crypto industry, and the new income reporting rules might be the first action with a real impact on Ukrainian taxpayers.      Even though declaring crypto holdings hasn’t been obligatory until now, some Ukrainian politicians have already disclosed some impressive numbers from their crypto wallets.      In 2016, member of parliament Dmitri Golubov reported holding 4,376 BTC and Odessa city council member Anatoly Urbansky declared 256 BTC.

42404109,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhMrt,1583304998,India’s Supreme Court Lifts Banking Ban on Crypto Exchanges,"The Supreme Court of India has ruled against a decision imposed by the country's central bank nearly two years ago that stifled crypto trading in Asia's third-largest economy.      According to a report from Bloomberg, a three-judge bench of the court ruled on Wednesday in favor of petitions by crypto exchanges and startups that opposed the decision made by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in April 2018 banning domestic financial institutions from providing banking services to crypto exchanges.      The central bank's decision at the time forced crypto exchanges in the country to either close, relocate to other jurisdictions or shift their business model to crypto-to-crypto and over-the-counter trading.      While crypto exchanges immediately filed petitions to the Supreme Court after the central bank's decision in 2018, a clear decision had not been reached until Wednesday after several rounds of hearings. Some exchanges had been forced to close as trade plunged while the case was ongoing.      ""The uplifting of the ban by Supreme Court is going to open new opportunities for India in terms of investments, economy and a market as a whole,"" said Sumit Gupta, founder and chief executive of exchange aggregator CoinDCX. ""As few of the surviving petitioners of the case, we are thankful to the Supreme Court for hearing our side of the story. We have always seen crypto as a potential to unlock India's dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy.""      Tanvi Ratna, chief executive and founder of Policy 4.0, which works on crypto policymaking in India, wrote in a pre-verdict analysis on Tuesday the win would mean for ""a resurgence of liquidity and resumption of activity with exchanges and other startups"" for the ecosystem.      ""Now that this circular has been struck down as unconstitutional, banking access, the biggest hurdle so far, should pick up again. This will provide sufficient liquidity and access to market for many exchanges to come in,"" she said in an email.      But she also cautioned the verdict could still be a ""short-term respite"" since the verdict against the RBI ""does not directly impact actions on the policy level.""      In fact, while overturning the RBI order, the Supreme Court didn't go as far as saying the central bank had acted unconstitutionally. Instead, it said the order was set aside because it failed the test of proportionality – that is, it had not been balanced in how it treated crypto firms.      ""What is logical to conclude is that if the verdict goes against the actions of the central bank, there might be re-thinking on the issue within our financial policymakers. There is no guarantee this will happen, though, especially if the verdict only address the question of regulatory overreach of the RBI, and leaves sufficient leeway for policymakers to decide upon the treatment of cryptocurrencies,"" Ratna wrote in the analysis.

42431568,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN3x5h,1583290800,Bitcoin's Computing Power Is Growing Again After Coronavirus-Related Disruption,"The computer processing power of the bitcoin network is growing again – albeit slowly – as major Chinese miner manufacturers gradually resume business after the coronavirus outbreak delayed shipments.      The average hashing power on bitcoin (BTC) over the past seven days has reached a new high of around 117.5 exahashes per second (EH/s), up 5.4 percent from where it stagnated for a month beginning Jan. 28, according to data from PoolIn, which, along side with F2pool, are currently the two largest bitcoin mining pools.      Data from BTC.com further estimates bitcoin's mining difficulty, a measure of competitiveness in the field, will increase by 2.15 percent when it adjusts itself in about five days thanks to the increased hashing power in the current period.      The growth comes as major Chinese miner manufacturers have gradually resumed shipments over the past one to two weeks. The coronavirus outbreak had forced many businesses across the country to extend the Chinese New York holiday since the end of January.      Shenzhen-based MicroBT, maker of the WhatsMiner, said it has gradually resumed business and shipments since mid-February, and noted that more mining farm locations are accessible than a month ago.      Similarly, Beijing-based Bitmain has also restarted domestic and overseas shipments since late February. The firm's domestic repairing service has returned to work since Feb. 20.      MicroBT and Bitmain are now locked in a neck-and-neck race to roll out top-of-the-line equipment ahead of bitcoin's halving in May. The third halving in the cryptocurrency's 11-year history will reduce the amount of new bitcoin added to the network with each block (every 10 minutes or so) from 12.5 to 6.25.      Adding to the competition, Hangzhou-based Canaan Creative also announced the launch of its latest Avalon 1066 Pro model on Feb. 28, boasting a computing power of 50 terahashes per second (TH/s). The firm has also gradually resumed businesses since mid-February.    Slow recovery    However, to be sure, this does not mean these mining equipment manufacturers have fully resumed to the same production and delivery capacity as it was prior to the virus outbreak.      Charles Chao Yu, chief operating officer of F2pool, said manufacturers' production and logistic capacity have not yet fully recovered. ""There are still many farm locations that won't allow in maintenance teams,"" he said.      And as major manufacturers have already launched more powerful new equipment like Bitmain's AntMiner S19 and MicroBT's WhatsMiner M30, ""they won't place a lot of new chip orders for older models,"" Yu said. ""As such, there won't be too many additional AntMiner S17 or WhatsMiner M20 series hitting the market.""      Yu expects bitcoin's hash rate may go up to at most 130 EH/s in the next two months before bitcoin's halving, which would be another roughly 10 percent jump from now.      F2pool's global business director Thomas Heller shares the same expectation that bitcoin's hash rate will likely remain around 120 - 130 EH/s before May.      ""It's unlikely to see large scale deployment of M30S and S19 machines before June/July,"" Heller said. ""It's also yet to be seen how the impact of COVID-19 in South Korea will impact the supply chain of WhatsMiner's new machines, as they get the chips from Samsung, whereas Bitmain gets chips from TSMC in Taiwan.""      He said the coronavirus outbreak has already disrupted many large farms' plan to scale up facilities before the Chinese New Year. As such, they are now taking a more cautious approach leading to May.      ""Many large Chinese miners in January were of the viewpoint that they would want to get their machines running before the Chinese New Year."" Heller said, ""And if they couldn't get the machines running by then, they would wait to see how the halving plays out.""    $100M in equipment    While the growth rate of hashing power may appear anemic, it nonetheless implies that about 5 EH/s in computing power has plugged into the bitcoin network over the past week.      BTC.com's data shows bitcoin's 14-day average hash rate reached 110 EH/s for the first time on Jan. 28 but generally stayed at that level for the next four weeks even though bitcoin's price enjoyed a short-term jump during that period.      Based on quotes for various mining equipment posted by several distributors on WeChat seen by CoinDesk, most of the latest and more powerful machines made by Chinese manufacturers are priced between $20 to $30 per terahash.      That could mean additional computing power worth $100 million has come online in the past week, even using the lower end of that range. (one exahash = one million terahashes)      The mining activity growth also comes as the coronavirus situation in China has improved compared to late January, although overall economic activity has not yet fully returned to its level prior to the outbreak.      According to a report from news outlet Caixin, as of Monday, 19 Chinese provinces, including Zhejiang and Guangdong, where Canaan and MicroBT, respectively, are based, have lowered the emergency response level from Level One (very significant) to Level Two (significant).      Meanwhile, big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai are maintaining the response level at ""very significant"" but more companies have gradually returned to business in the last two weeks.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/04/bitcoins-computing-power-is-growing-again-after-coronavirus-related-disruption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f8f0af7ccc034c06cbbfaf318c734fc0eb012fe-1069x719.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
