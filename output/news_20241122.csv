If the Senate confirms him, the next person whose signature adorns U.S. paper currency will be a fan of the digital currency ecosystem set up to replace the conventional financial system.  Bessent runs Key Square Group, a macro investing firm. He worked for prominent investor George Soros three decades ago and was, according to The Wall Street Journal, ""one of the driving forces"" behind Soros Fund Management's famous bet — that netted a more than $1 billion profit — that the British pound would collapse.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and crypto as a whole are now in his sights.  ""I have been excited about [Trump's] embrace of crypto and I think it fits very well with the Republican Party, the ethos of it. Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay,"" he said in an interview with Fox Business in July. ""Crypto is bringing in young people, people who have not participated in markets.""  Polymarket traders had bet that he was a frontrunner. At one point, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick was viewed as one, too, but he was ultimately picked as Commerce Secretary.

Recent trends suggest growing interest in the popular meme coin, but conflicting indicators leave the market’s next move uncertain. From search trends to mining milestones, Dogecoin has plenty going on, keeping its community engaged. Related Reading: Upbit Listing Sends BONK Skyrocketing 67% For A Fresh ATH In Memecoin Mania Search interest in Dogecoin peaked today, November 22, coinciding with a price increase, data from Google Trends shows. However, as public curiosity declined, so did the price, demonstrating a significant link between attention and performance. While some see this as an indication of Dogecoin’s unexpected character, others believe that it demonstrates how community-driven it is. Mining Activity Reaches New Peak Dogecoin is on a tear and its network enjoying solid numbers. Proof of this is its soaring hashrate, which touched an all-time high. This strengthens the security and stability of the blockchain as well as being more appealing to miners and investors.

A stable mining environment assures security and serves as a basis for the growth of the ecosystem. Traders Are Becoming More Optimistic Seasoned cryptocurrency expert expert Tardigrade sparked enthusiasm in the Dogecoin community by highlighting a major technical trend on its charts. The expert identified a “Hidden Bullish Divergence,” a structure that frequently indicates a reversal or slowing in bearish momentum. His analysis has sparked rumors that Dogecoin might be getting ready for its next innovation. Positive mood seems to be mostly prevalent when taken with the existing “Extreme Greed” value of 94 on the Fear & Greed Index. But the notable volatility (42.27%) over the past month calls for prudence on behalf of investors. Related Reading: XRP Gains Momentum: Whale Activity Points To $15 Breakthrough A Mixed Price Forecast Though there is growing hope, Dogecoin projections remain dubious. Analysts project a -6.83% decline with a December 22, 2024 price of $0.369286. Although the Fear & Greed Index is rather positive, history shows that such times usually precede temporary corrections. For investors, the combination of enthusiasm and prudence creates a perilous atmosphere. On the one hand, increased hashrate and technical indications appear good. However, because of Dogecoin’s unexpected nature, risks are always present. Dogecoin’s market remains volatile, fueled by its community, mining stats, and social emotion. Whether it’s a good moment to purchase or sell is determined by the community’s risk tolerance. One thing is certain: Dogecoin never fails to keep the cryptocurrency community guessing.

36719113,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654405,1732311036,"Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2017 Pattern, Is The Top Only 2 Weeks Away After Hitting $100,000?","The Bitcoin price is well on its way to reaching the $100,000 price mark, with multiple projections saying it could do so by this weekend. Notably, the Bitcoin price reached an intraday high of $99,486 in the past 24 hours, putting it by about only 0.5% from reaching $100,000. As the entire industry continues to await the Bitcoin price break above $100,000, crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino has highlighted an interesting outlook for what to expect from here. Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2017 Pattern Crypto analyst Tony Severino drew parallels of Bitcoin’s recent price movements to its 2017 surge. The Bitcoin price first broke before the round figure mark of $10,000 in the last week of November 2017. Now seven years later, it is exhibiting similar price movements as it looks to break above the next round figure mark of $100,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 37% Upshoot For Dogecoin Price, Points Out Support Levels Bitcoin’s break above the $10,000 level was a pivotal moment in its price history, as it marked a break above a key psychological threshold. Severino pointed out that after reaching this psychological milestone, the Bitcoin price nearly doubled in value within two weeks. Severino used the outcome of this move to draw parallels with the current performance of the Bitcoin price. This time, however, the stakes are higher, with Bitcoin now about to break above the $100,000 mark. Particularly, this is a figure that carries even greater psychological significance in the outlook of the Bitcoin price than the $10,000 mark. Could Breaching $100,000 Cause Another Excitement? Severino’s analysis centers around the idea that breaking $100,000 could cause another sharp Bitcoin price increase, much like what happened after it crossed $10,000 in 2017. He noted that the Bitcoin price could see gains of up to 100% from its current price, but the pace of the rally may happen extremely fast. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals When The Ethereum Price Will Reach A New ATH, It’s Closer Than You Think This rapid ascent could mark the final leg of this bull run that will create a peak followed by a significant correction, much like how the 2017 bull cycle played out. “The top is near,” Severino cautioned. However, he doesn’t believe Bitcoin’s peak is just two weeks away; he suggested it could be as close to around two months. It is important to note that the Bitcoin ecosystem has changed massively since it first broke above $10,000 in 2017. At that time, the rally was driven largely by retail investors and Bitcoin whales who got in relatively early. The current landscape includes a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, especially through Spot Bitcoin ETFs. This institutional interest has been key to the steady growth of the Bitcoin price throughout this year, and current market dynamics point to such continued growth. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $99,032, up by 2% in the past 24 hours.

36719492,https://blockworks.co/news/tracking-solana-all-time-highs,1732311000,Solana’s all-time high by the numbers,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . SOL touched $260 for the first time ever last night, setting off a round of quasi-religious celebration and dunks on Solana bears. We have covered the narrative side of Solana’s turnaround from a massive post-FTX sell-off previously, but today we’re bringing you some interesting data to recap Solana’s landmark day. 1,111 That’s the number of days between Solana’s first and second all-time highs. As long as the wait may have felt for SOL holders, that’s actually less time than it took bitcoin to set its second price record: The orange coin took some 1,200 days to top its 2013 high. $294.42 That would be Solana’s previous all-time high adjusted for inflation, according to the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So $263 is pretty good, but those SOL tokens don’t go quite as far as they used to. 7.72% That’s the percentage of one ether token that one solana token represents, and this SOLETH ratio also set an all-time high yesterday. When solana last hit an all-time high, the coin was only worth 5.7% of one ether. $2.4 billion That’s how much the SOL tokens Galaxy Trading purchased from the FTX estate are worth at today’s prices, according to details reported by Bloomberg. The subsidiary of Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital purchased $620 million in SOL at $64 per token in April. SOL was trading at around $172 at the time. Not a bad deal. 80% That’s roughly the percentage of Solana decentralized exchange activity that involved memecoins yesterday. Speculative meme tokens have largely been the story of Solana’s massive run-up in volume and blockspace demand. Solana founders and investors will often portray memecoins as a “stress test” for the network — presumably as it readies itself to onboard more meaningful financial activity. 1,150% That’s roughly the price appreciation between when Robinhood delisted SOL in June 2023 and when it added the token back to the platform last week. The popular retail trading app stopped offering SOL and repaid users at June 2023 market prices after the SEC declared in lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance that the asset is an unregistered security. Following Donald Trump’s electoral victory and the prospect of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Robinhood brought SOL back. Robinhood users missed out on some pretty big gains in between those dates. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

36718632,https://blockworks.co/news/sec-departures-regulation-changes,1732309200,Changes at the SEC start well ahead of Inauguration Day,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . This has been a busy week at the SEC. The headline news from the commission, if you will, was Chair Gary Gensler’s departure announcement . He said yesterday he would be resigning, effective 12 pm ET on Jan. 20, 2025 — the exact time President-elect Donald Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated. We’re not surprised, but we got a chuckle out of him unprecedentedly naming the exact time he would leave the post. And then today, fellow Democrat Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga announced he would also depart early on Inauguration Day, saying he wants to spend more time with his family as his wife battles breast cancer. We wish her and the Lizárraga family all the best. On the legal front, one federal judge this week came to the same decision in two separate cases. Judge Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas found the SEC had overstepped its authority and must vacate the Dealer Rule, adopted in February by a 3-2 commissioner vote. Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda dissented against the Dealer Rule. The rulings were seen as a win for both the hedge fund and crypto industries, protecting companies and managers in both groups from what has been described as “severe and adverse” changes in policy. Under the rule, certain hedge funds and crypto traders and validators would have been considered “dealers,” a classification both groups found prohibitively strict . It looks like changes at the agency are coming even before Trump moves back to Washington. We wrote earlier in the week about how there was a chance the commissioner voting breakdown would remain the same even after Trump takes office. With two spots now up for grabs, we know this won’t be the case. No more than three commissioners can be from the same party, and with Gensler out we can all but guarantee a Republican will be in as the next chair. That means Lizárraga’s vacant spot will go to a Democrat or Independent. Typically in this case, the Democrats would submit names for Trump to consider. But we know the Trump Administration often veers from the conventional. I’m still skeptical, though, that we will see any pending litigation dismissed. Even if the SEC now swings Republican (and potentially more pro-crypto), its staff would have to ask the commissioners to dismiss a lawsuit. These are staffers that have worked on these cases, in many instances, from the beginning. As we enter this new era of the SEC, it’s important to remember that Gensler’s predecessor — Chair Jay Clayton, a Trump nominee — was the one who brought the Ripple case over XRP’s security status in 2020. He also brought an additional 79 crypto-related enforcement actions during his tenure, plus a separate action against Trump ally Elon Musk. Clayton is now headed to lead prosecution at the Southern District of New York, if Trump has his way. Despite Clayton’s track record, he’s largely praised by the industry as being pro-crypto . We know Trump wasn’t always a fan of the industry, so maybe he’s not the only one who can have a change of heart. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

36717770,https://blockworks.co/news/btc-price-predictions-thanksgiving,1732307400,"As BTC nears $100K, keep an eye on Thanksgiving","This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Bitcoin hit about $99,500 overnight before dipping below $97,300 a few hours later. The asset’s price was right around $99,350 at 2 pm ET. On the cusp of $100,000, what will happen after BTC hits that level? Or if it doesn’t break through that in the short term? As you know by now, nobody knows for sure. But I caught up (again) with Federico Brokate, head of 21Shares’ US business. He also helped BlackRock launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) in January while he led iShares’ business strategy in the Americas. The main takeaways? Well for one, the six-figure mark represents “a psychological barrier for markets” and a price target investors have been eyeing since the last crypto bull run, Brokate explained. He noted, too, that BTC’s price last week quickly rose another 3-5% after hitting the $90,000 mark with enough volume — a scenario that could happen again at $100,000 . “If the barrier isn’t decisively broken by Thanksgiving, we could expect to see prices come down 15-20% — a correction that would test the $80,000 support level and wash out leveraged and low-conviction players,” Brokate told me. Reaching the six-figure level would mean “greater short-term volatility as orders are filled, options liquidate and liquidity providers fulfill ETF block order requests,” he said, adding: “It wouldn’t be surprising to see some drawdown in the coming months.” Outside of BTC, Brokate noted that altcoin markets often surge after bitcoin establishes a price plateau. This comes as investors tend to rotate to what are viewed as “higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities.” Perhaps that happens in late Q1, or Q2, the 21Shares executive posed. While solana (SOL) just reached a new price peak at roughly $263, ether (ETH) remains about 32% off its November 2021 high. XRP was up about 65% from a week ago, as of 2 pm ET Friday. Finally, Thanksgiving might mean more than turkey and football this year. After all, Brokate reminded, holiday gatherings are often a time investors discuss their investment journeys and gains, sparking curiosity. Brokate recalled that in 2017, BTC hovered in the $6,000-to-$9,000 range before surging to about $16,000 after Thanksgiving.

The world's oldest cryptocurrency has risen ~41% since the U.S. Election Day. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is becoming one of the most prominent ""Trump trades"" in the aftermath of the 2024 election, and has been hovering around the $100K mark since Thursday. Back on the campaign trail, now President-elect Donald Trump jumped on the crypto bandwagon, with promises to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, fight CBDCs, and defend the right to self-custody. ""Crypto has by far been the hottest asset class following Trump's election, with BTC rocketing to record highs above $90k and outpacing even its levered Nasdaq brethren. Gains have been led primarily in the U.S. hours as mainstream participation has been increasing from the U.S., with spot ETF seeing dramatic inflows with BTC gaining +1.7B, and ETH adding +500M on a weekly basis,"" said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights, SOFA. We feel that the 'easy' part of the rally has been done and the next stage will be much trickier with more price choppiness and potential for drawdowns, Fan added. The cryptocurrency has traded nearly above the $90K mark in the week. ""Bitcoin’s price surge is fueled by institutional demand, growing mainstream acceptance, and a derivatives market boom,"" Seeking Alpha analyst Dean Popplewell . ETF inflows have approached $2 billion in three days, further boosting Bitcoin’s rally, Popplewell added. Past bull runs suggest buying the breakout is more favorable than waiting for a significant pullback, as the current price offers the next best profit-risk profile, said Seeking Alpha analyst Made Easy - Finance . BTC touched its fourth consecutive record high at $99.4K on Friday. Notable News MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) slumped 16.2% to $397.28/share on Thursday, reversing earlier gains that saw shares rise nearly 15%, after activist short seller Andrew Left's Citron Research bet against the ""overheated"" stock.

36716587,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654380,1732305659,Bitcoin LTHs Start Taking Profits – Metrics Reveal Whales Are Actively Spending,"Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs for four consecutive days, hitting $99,500 just hours ago. The relentless surge has fueled extreme bullish sentiment in the market, with investors eagerly anticipating Bitcoin’s historic breakthrough of the $100,000 mark. However, on-chain data suggests that the rally may face challenges as signs of profit-taking emerge. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Charts Signal Potential Breakout Key insights from CryptoQuant reveal that Long-Term Holders (LTHs) are actively spending their Bitcoin, capitalizing on profits exceeding 350%. This behavior indicates that some seasoned investors are beginning to lock in gains after the aggressive uptrend. Whale activity and profit-taking by LTHs could temporarily slow the rally, potentially triggering a consolidation phase before the next leg up. While Bitcoin remains shy of the six-figure milestone, the market closely examines whether it can sustain its momentum or if a pullback is imminent. Consolidation at these levels could provide the foundation for BTC to reclaim its bullish trend and break through the psychological $100,000 barrier. Bitcoin Rally Seems Unstoppable Bitcoin has surged an impressive 45% since November 5, displaying relentless upward momentum that appears unstoppable. Despite increasing selling activity, demand continues to support the price, driving Bitcoin to new highs and maintaining its bullish trajectory. Market participants are now closely watching for potential signals of a slowdown or correction as BTC pushes deeper into uncharted territory. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler recently shared X data highlighting a significant trend among Long-Term Holders (LTHs). According to Adler, LTHs are actively spending their Bitcoin, capitalizing on profits exceeding 350%. This marks a critical juncture, as these holders are often regarded as market stabilizers, and their selling activity could indicate potential shifts in sentiment. Adler further notes that if Bitcoin’s price surpasses $119,000, LTH profits would soar to over 500%. Such extraordinary profit levels could trigger a wave of selling pressure, potentially leading to the first major correction after this unprecedented rally. However, he emphasizes that predicting an exact price point for a correction remains speculative, as no definitive threshold exists to determine when LTHs might overwhelmingly exit their positions. Related Reading: Polkadot Holds Key Demand Level – DOT Could Hit $11 In Coming Weeks While the rally shows no signs of slowing down, this dynamic between demand and LTH profit-taking underscores the importance of monitoring market behavior. Traders should remain cautious as Bitcoin’s rapid ascent unfolds. BTC About To Reach $100K Bitcoin trades at $98,600, less than 2% from the highly anticipated $100,000 mark. This psychological level is expected to be a significant supply zone, with many investors closely watching price movements around this milestone. Recent “only up” price action has left little room for traders to buy at lower levels, frustrating those who hoped to accumulate during dips. If Bitcoin holds above the crucial $93,500 support level in the coming days, market sentiment suggests a powerful surge above $100,000 could follow. Breaking this barrier would likely usher in further bullish momentum, pushing Bitcoin into uncharted territory and fueling optimism for additional gains. However, failure to maintain support at $93,500 could trigger selling pressure, leading to a price pullback. In such a scenario, Bitcoin might test lower demand zones, with $85,000 and $80,000 identified as key levels to watch. These zones could provide new accumulation opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on price corrections.

36714164,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654357,1732300245,"Dogecoin Price Set To Skyrocket By Saturday, Warns Crypto Analyst","Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) has identified a bullish pennant formation in the 4-hour Dogecoin / USD price chart, indicating that a significant price movement could occur by this coming Saturday. In a post on X, Kevin remarks: “Dogecoin is now forming a more defined potential bullish pennant that has multiple touch points on each side with plenty of consolidation time. Something to keep an eye on folks.” Dogecoin Price Breakout By Saturday? The chart shared by Kevin illustrates a bull pennant pattern. A bull pennant typically signifies a pause in a prevailing uptrend, followed by a potential continuation of that trend. This pattern is characterized by converging trend lines that encapsulate a period of price consolidation after a strong upward movement. In Dogecoin’s case, the pennant is delineated by converging yellow trend lines, indicating decreasing volatility and a consolidation phase. The memecoin is trading around $0.38 within this pennant structure. Kevin’s analysis suggests that this critical breakout could happen “by Saturday at the latest.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Forms A ‘Nasty Triple Top’: Analyst Reveals What’s Next In technical analysis terms, a breakout occurs when the price moves beyond the defined trend lines of a formation, signaling a potential continuation or reversal of the trend. Given the bullish momentum preceding the pennant formation, an upward breakout is often anticipated. However, Kevin maintains a cautious stance by acknowledging market unpredictability: “Up or down,” he notes. The chart also highlights several horizontal lines representing key support and resistance levels. The upper resistance is identified around $0.54, which could be tested if an upward breakout occurs. Conversely, immediate support levels are situated around $0.33 and $0.2950, which would be critical if the price breaks downward. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Test Of 0.786 Fibonacci Level, What Happens Next? Kevin also emphasizes the role of the stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the daily chart. He states: “The stochastic RSI is a phenomenal momentum indicator in strong trends in either direction. The daily RSI is almost reset for Dogecoin and probably needs another week give or take a few days to fully reset. Once it does, I expect the next leg to begin.” The stochastic RSI is a technical momentum indicator that compares the level of the RSI to its high-low range over a set period, providing insights into potential overbought or oversold conditions. A reset in the daily RSI suggests that previous overbought conditions have eased, potentially paving the way for the next significant price movement. Further emphasizing the potential impact of the current consolidation phase, Kevin adds: “The longer Dogecoin consolidates, the bigger the next leg will be. In my opinion, the next leg will be the biggest leg of the DOGE bull run and will give us a good idea where it’s going to top out at for the cycle.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.39.

42435267,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kop06,1732298955,"Another SEC Democrat to Drop Out, Leaving Republicans Running Agency by February","The sudden resignation announcement of a second Democrat from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Jaime Lizárraga, could give Republicans a boost as they start work changing the agency's policy direction.  Lizárraga's announcement comes a day after Chair Gary Gensler said he'd be leaving the moment President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath on January 20.  Another Democratic commissioner on the Securities and Exchange Commission is following Chair Gary Gensler out the door in January, leaving the agency with a Republican majority as it weighs a likely course shift under the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump.  Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga is leaving January 17, he said in a Friday statement, which could give Republicans a head start on what could otherwise have been months of delay in redirecting the regulator's policies — including on cryptocurrency. At this point, Caroline Crenshaw will be the sole Democrat on the five-member commission going into 2025, and her term has already expired, putting her into an extension that can last as long as about 18 months.  Lizárraga said he's leaving because his wife has been suffering with a serious illness.  ""In reflecting on the challenges that lie ahead, we have decided that it is in the best interests of our family to close this chapter in my 34-year public service journey,"" he said in the statement.  The commission has been led in recent years by Gensler, who announced this week that he'd be resigning when Trump is sworn in on January 20. Under Gensler's leadership, the commission had maintained an aggressive campaign of enforcement against crypto companies, arguing that digital assets platforms such as Coinbase Inc. (COIN) and Binance are operating as unregistered securities exchanges and that many of the tokens transacted on their platforms are securities.  A wide array of enforcement actions have been based on that stance, and they've developed into federal court cases in which the industry has countered the agency's arguments on tokens as securities. That's the situation that will be inherited by the new commission.  If Trump appoints one of the sitting Republican commissioners as an acting chair — widely expected to be Mark Uyeda — that new commission chief can begin shifting policy priorities and the agency's legal stance on crypto. With a two-member majority alongside Commissioner Hester Peirce, the two Republicans will be running the agency's agenda while the rest of the commission is filled out by Trump's nominations.  Gensler said on Friday that Lizárraga ""has been steadfastly focused on elevating the interest of everyday Americans.""  ""At the SEC, he has been an excellent partner in our work to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and ensure markets work for investors and issuers alike,"" Gensler said in a statement.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/22/another-sec-democrat-to-drop-out-leaving-republicans-running-agency-by-february,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e502953bd9e3aace8a6bc2902ae727193bf7af14-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

To read full editions, subscribe . As SOL reached new all-time highs yesterday, Crypto Twitter’s search for the “next Solana” is on. There is no shortage of mega fast alt-L1s to pick from, but in the spotlight are two contenders: MoveVM-based chains Sui and Aptos. Both chains were born in the previous crypto cycle, and built by teams with backgrounds in Facebook, which developed the Move programming language as part of its Libra (later renamed Diem) project. In terms of price action, SUI has outperformed APT by a large margin on a YTD basis after overtaking Aptos in market cap in mid-September. Source: CoinMarketCap Despite suffering a brief two-hour outage yesterday, SUI’s price has bounced back above its pre-outage price levels, ironically reinforcing the mimetic perception of Sui as the next Solana due to the latter’s history of outages . In terms of TVL, Sui and Aptos are running fairly neck to neck (see below chart), no doubt thanks to ongoing liquidity incentive campaigns. As far as active dapps on the L1s, both are also fairly even — Sui has 44, Aptos has 49 — based on DefiLlama ’s numbers. Source: Artemis Zooming into onchain activity, Sui’s DEX trading volumes saw a 3x jump since September, overtaking Aptos by a long shot in the last month. Source: Artemis In terms of fees, Sui is also far outpacing Aptos, with $1.1 million generated in October alone, vs. $196k for Aptos. Source: Artemis In the TradFi arena, both chains are pursuing real-world assets. Ondo has deployed its USDY tokenized Treausurys product on both chains, with about $8.3 million on Sui and $15.7 million on Aptos. Aptos also announced last week BlackRock’s deployment of its tokenized RWA BUIDL fund, while Sui announced today a partnership with the digital assets arm of Franklin Templeton to support ecosystem growth. Finally, both Sui and Aptos are attempting their own hardware plays. Sui is leaning hard into the gaming sector with its handheld console SuiPlay0x1 , and earlier this month struck up a partnership with the global esports team Team Liquid , while Aptos has taken the route of a budget-priced JamboPhone smartphone .

Apparently triggering the move was Musk posting a screenshot of podcaster Joe Rogan's X profile. The post included a dollar icon that's different from the app's tipping service, one user noted in an X post, speculating that it might be for sending money as part of X Payments.  Musk replied ""true"" to the post.  Dogecoin's price has a history of moving on payments-related news — no matter how fanciful — at any Elon Musk-owned companies including X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk long floated his plans to turn the social media site into an ""everything-app,"" encompassing payments between users. X Payments LLC obtained money transmitting licenses in most U.S. states, excluding New York.  Some crypto enthusiasts speculate that the service, once live, might include transactions with some digital assets such as DOGE, given Musk's long-standing affection for the token. Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, already accepts DOGE payments for some merchandise purchases in its online store.

42435262,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4koova,1732297853,Bitcoin Going to $140K Says Trio of AIs Managing $30M Investment Fund,"Intelligent Alpha builds portfolios by relying on AI investment picks.  The firm relies on a trio of AIs — ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini — and implements their decisions, even if they sound counter-intuitive.  The models have a great track record so far.  There’s a $30 million fund that, for all intents and purposes, leaves all investment decisions to be made by artificial intelligence (AI).  The firm’s name: Intelligent Alpha. Its staff includes founder and CEO Doug Clinton, a few programmers and contractors, and a trio of AIs — OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude.  The AI triumvirate makes up the firm’s investment committee and so far, it’s doing a stellar job.  “Some of the AI’s best calls have been shorts,” Clinton told CoinDesk in an interview. “It was short on Boeing earlier this year, before that door blew off the 737 MAX [in January]. And AI was actually short on the stock for that reason — because it thought there would be quality issues with the plane.”  While the firm has focused on traditional finance so far and mostly kept away from crypto, Clinton said he started experimenting with bitcoin {{BTC}} specifically in the last five months. The objective: for AI to set useful targets to trade the world’s top cryptocurrency.  “In the bull case — which was a Trump win and a more favorable regulatory environment — AI saw that bitcoin could maybe go to $140,000,” Clinton said. “Maybe that's the scenario we're working toward right now.”  How it works  A lot of firms now use AI to enhance human processes, to help analysts process data and think in different ways. But Clinton’s method is to give responsibility to the AI trio, and stay out of its way as much as possible when it comes to investment decisions.  The process is relatively simple. If, for example, Intelligent Alpha is looking to build a large cap U.S. equity portfolio, the fund will curate a bunch of data about U.S. companies with large market capitalizations, like historical revenue and earning projections, and feed it to the AIs.  The next step is to give a philosophical framework for the AIs to use. Clinton asks the AIs to step into the shoes of some of the most famous investors in the world — Warren Buffett, Stanley Druckenmiller, Cathie Wood — and apply their way of thinking to the portfolio at hand.  The triumvirate then produces a portfolio, which a human must double-check to make sure there aren’t any “hallucinations,” in Clinton’s words. For example, the AI may accidentally include a stock that was recently acquired, or the stock of a company with a small market cap.  “Other than that, we try not to really mess with the portfolios,” Clinton told CoinDesk. “As a human, I’ll sometimes look at the portfolios and think ‘Oh, this pick seems like a terrible idea.’ Other times I’ll see something really interesting and try to understand the logic. It’s kind of fun.”  The process involves the three AIs explaining their reasoning to Clinton. Not only does it help him ascertain that the investments are aligned with the portfolio’s goals, but he says that models provide better portfolios when they’re forced to explain why they like specific stocks.  It often happens for the AIs to disagree. And their way of thinking changes as updates get rolled out. “It used to be the case that Claude was the most contrarian model in terms of the outputs, when we first started testing,” Clinton said. “Now I would say it’s ChatGPT.” And while Clinton has tested other AIs such as Grok or Lama AI, keeping the investment committee down to three AIs has proved to be the most efficient set-up.  Predicting the future  Investors can gain exposure to Intelligent Alpha’s strategy through an exchange-traded fund, the Intelligent Livermore ETF, which launched in September and uses AI to build a global equity portfolio. More such funds are on the way, Clinton said.  For the Livermore ETF, every financial quarter the models review world events and try to make predictions for the next three to six months. Five or six areas of opportunities are then identified (following the investment philosophies of the greats like Druckenmiller) and the portfolio gets built around these sectors.  Having competing philosophies means the portfolio usually ends up being quite balanced. “In many cases they're looking at idiosyncratic opportunities,” Clinton said. “We haven't seen big issues where [the investment philosophies] are at odds, but even then, it would be like hedging.” The AIs themselves make the decisions on how to weigh the various philosophies found in the portfolio, depending on the areas they’re the most confident in.  “AI has been, at least so far, really good at seeing forward,” Clinton said. “Right before we launched, it made a big bet on Asian stocks, specifically Chinese stocks, and that was right before [billionaire hedge fund manager] David Tepper went on CNBC in September and said that China was his biggest bet, that they were bringing out the bazooka for stimulus. And you know, Chinese stocks went crazy.”  Another memorable trade: chipmaker giant Nvidia has been AI’s top pick since the experiment began in summer of 2023. “Back then, I was like, ‘Oh, my God.’ Nvidia had run so much at that point,” Clinton said. “But it's up now like 400% from the moment the AI picked it.” The lesson in there, he says, is humans will react to charts emotionally, whereas AI “just doesn't care. It says ‘No, this is going to go higher.’”  Not that every bet has been a slam dunk, but so far, the mistakes have been on the margin, according to Clinton. The AI is building a good track record on macro events especially, he said. For one thing, it predicted that former President Donald Trump would be re-elected.  And crypto?  One of the reasons Intelligent Alpha doesn’t focus too much on crypto is simply lack of data. Their trades may have happened on-chain, but there’s no easy way to go back and find the kind of trading setups and investment philosophies used by famous crypto investors like Cobie or GCR. Most of the time, all you can do is go off of their posts on X — and it’s hard to know whether the posts reflect reality.  That being said, the crypto community’s reliance on X means that Grok could end up playing a role in Intelligent Alpha’s triumvirate someday for crypto purposes, Clinton mused, since that model is trained and fine-tuned with data from the social media platform.  “The question that we're exploring here is, what can we do with AI that would maybe be unique and different and stand out a little bit,” Clinton said. “To find a unique way to use AI to identify breakout crypto projects, that would be a really cool way to use the tech.”",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/22/bitcoin-going-to-140k-say-trio-of-ais-managing-30m-investment-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c13fbefb3e7b68764aacb77191160f86baf41e93-4961x2791.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

TikTok videos are teaching people how to navigate wallets that are harder to use than centralized exchanges like Coinbase.  ""Traditional centralized exchanges can't keep up with all of the new on-chain paradigms fast enough,"" Phantom CEO Brandon Millman said.  It's long been a cryptocurrency maxim that Coinbase's (COIN) ranking in app store downloads signals how much retail traders are participating in a bull market. Well, the bull run's here, and Coinbase isn't climbing charts like it used to.  Instead, Phantom, a harder-to-use crypto wallet, has leapfrogged the better-known centralized exchange. At press time, Phantom was in seventh place among free applications — between Temu and Google — on Apple's U.S. App Store, well ahead of Coinbase at 27th.  The flip is challenging expectations of what mainstream traders can tolerate during their first days in crypto. While the bitcoin community in particular has always emphasized ""being your own bank,"" other parts of the cryptoverse, like Coinbase, have bet on a more accessible experience.  Memecoin mania is blowing that up. Coinbase and other established exchanges don't list the bottom-of-the-barrel, hours-old, exceptionally risky yet sometimes tremendously lucrative (if you don't lose your shirt, as most do) joke tokens that new traders want to bet on. To get those, they gotta go on-chain with something like Phantom.  ""Traditional centralized exchanges can't keep up with all of the new on-chain paradigms fast enough,"" said Phantom CEO Brandon Millman in an email.  Chill Guy, TikTok  In the past week, one memecoin in particular, Chill Guy, caught plenty of attention on TikTok and even more bids on-chain. Bolstered by a coordinated social media marketing campaign, CHILLGUY — whose mascot is, well, a chill-looking dog — soared in days from a market cap of basically nothing to as high as $500 million.  Buying CHILLGUY and other fresh memecoins requires a bit more effort than, say, buying bitcoin {{BTC}} on Coinbase. Traders must navigate decentralized exchanges and learn to futz with finicky order settings just to get the prices they want. It's a clunky setup with a high learning curve compared to the exchanges.  Whether TikTok is primarily responsible for driving newcomers on-chain is an open question. The video app's exceptionally niche crypto scene doesn't have any truly standout videos racking up millions of views, as those de rigueur dance routines often do. More common are the oodles of low-viewership crypto bros crowing about their gazillionaire designs. A handful also teach their followers how to download Phantom.  Coinbase is onboarding memecoins, to be sure. In the past week, it greenlit FLOKI and PEPE, as well as WIF for German traders. Those tokens have been around a relatively long time and accrued market caps in the billions of dollars, making them more stable (relatively speaking) than, say, DIDDYOIL, a memecoin only accessible to traders who operate on-chain.  ""Our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world, and we know we can't do it alone,"" a spokesperson for Coinbase said. ""We believe a rising tide raises all boats, and we are thrilled to see more people engaging on-chain and with crypto over the last few weeks.""  While the Coinbase exchange itself is only tiptoeing into the memecoin space, the company at large is attempting to foster — and capture — such activity with its layer-2 network, Base. Base's memecoin scene isn't at the level of Solana {{SOL}}, but it still sees millions of dollars worth of volume each day.  ""We're focused on making on-chain faster (transactions anywhere across the globe in seconds), cheaper (with typical Base fees of less than 1 cent) and easier to use, so on-chain technology is accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world,"" the spokesperson said.

Recommend direct Bitcoin purchases or ETFs like IBIT for better tax efficiency and 1:1 Bitcoin exposure, avoiding MSTR's speculative premium. The recent election victory of Donald Trump has catalyzed a remarkable surge in cryptocurrency related assets, with MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) shares rallying more than 46% in just two weeks. This political development has fueled optimism about a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. But I am taking a contrarian stance and initiating coverage with a Sell rating on MSTR. Because of its severe overvaluation and unfavorable corporate structure. As per MicroStrategy's latest disclosures, the company holds 331,200 bitcoins, which represents their primary asset. With bitcoin trading at approximately $98,000, this puts the total value of their bitcoin holdings at approximately $32.4 billion. But MicroStrategy's current market cap stands at $80 billion. Even after accounting for their software business which I conservatively value at about $1.3 billion based on a 3x multiple of declining revenues ($460 million TTM), and adjusting for their debt burden of $4.27 billion, we're looking at an extraordinary premium of 150% over the underlying bitcoin value. This means investors buying MSTR shares are effectively paying $245,000 per bitcoin, a 150% premium over bitcoin's current market price of $98,000. To put this in perspective, for every dollar invested in MSTR, only about $0.40 is backed by actual bitcoin holdings. The remaining $0.60 represents what I view as a speculative premium that cannot be justified by fundamentals. Political optimism doesn't change the fundamental equation. Investors seeking bitcoin exposure now have far more efficient alternatives, particularly through ETFs like ( IBIT ). These vehicles offer direct 1:1 bitcoin exposure without the substantial premium and, crucially, without the tax disadvantages inherent in MicroStrategy's C-corporation structure. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has fundamentally changed the landscape for bitcoin investment, making MSTR's premium even harder to justify. MicroStrategy is now the largest corporate holder of bitcoin worldwide. While this transformation of the company has captured significant market attention and contributed to the stock's remarkable rally, there are two fundamental problems with this strategy. Based on current bitcoin prices, MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $32.4 billion. However, the company's market capitalization has soared to $80 billion, creating a 150% premium over the underlying bitcoin value. This means that for every dollar invested in MSTR stock, investors are only getting 40 cents of actual bitcoin exposure. The second major problem, which I believe the market is significantly underappreciating, is MicroStrategy's corporate structure as a C Corporation. Unlike bitcoin ETFs or direct bitcoin holdings, any gains realized by MicroStrategy on its bitcoin holdings will be subject to corporate-level taxation. When the company sells bitcoin it will pay capital gains tax at the corporate level. Subsequently, when these gains are reflected in the stock price and shareholders sell their shares they will pay additional capital gains tax on their stock appreciation. This tax inefficiency becomes particularly problematic in scenarios where bitcoin appreciates significantly. For example, if bitcoin reaches $1 million per coin, as some bulls project, MicroStrategy would face substantial corporate tax liabilities upon any sale of its holdings. This contrasts sharply with newer bitcoin ETF products like IBIT, which has a more tax efficient structure for investors seeking bitcoin exposure. The 21/21 Plan MicroStrategy's recently announced ""21/21 Plan"", the management aims to raise $42 billion over the next three years, evenly split between $21 billion in equity offerings and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. The scale of this capital raising effort raises several red flags in my analysis. Let's talk about the equity portion of the plan. MicroStrategy has already demonstrated its willingness to dilute shareholders through aggressive equity issuance. In Q3 2024 alone, the company issued and sold 8,048,449 shares of class A common stock, raising approximately $1.1 billion. The proposed $21 billion in additional equity raises would likely result in even more dilution. Based on current market prices, this could potentially double the outstanding share count, severely impacting existing shareholders' ownership percentage. Moreover, the company pays a 2% fee for its ATM equity issuance program, which is a significant ongoing cost that directly impacts shareholders. On the debt side, the plan to raise $21 billion in fixed-income securities is equally concerning. The company's latest financials reveal interest expenses of $18.13 million in Q3 alone. Adding $21 billion in new debt would dramatically increase this interest burden, potentially creating significant financial strain if bitcoin prices don't perform as expected. A Lesson From February 2021 I've analyzed a remarkably similar situation from February 2021 that serves as a crucial warning for today's investors. On February 9th, 2021, MSTR closed at $127 per share with a NAV of $40 per share. Over the following two months, bitcoin's price rose impressively from $47,336 to $63,410, marking a 34% gain. But During this same period, MSTR's share price collapsed from $127 to $74, a 42% decline. This resulted in a 76% underperformance compared to bitcoin over just two months. The market's reassessment of MSTR's premium to NAV created significant shareholder losses even as the underlying asset appreciated substantially. Today, with MSTR trading at a 2.5x premium to NAV, I see alarming parallels to that period. Management's aggressive capital raising plans, the historical precedent of premium compression and mounting operational losses, paint a picture of a company whose ""intelligent leverage"" strategy may be anything but intelligent for shareholders. The risk of another dramatic premium compression, similar to the 2021 episode, looms large over current valuations. Software Business Deterioration The company's Q3 2024 financial results reveal that the software business is in serious decline, with total revenues falling 10.3% YoY to $116.1 million. This deterioration becomes even more alarming when examining the composition of these revenues and the magnitude of the company's losses. The most troubling aspect of MicroStrategy's software business performance is the collapse in product license revenue, which plummeted by 53.9% compared to the previous year. This precipitous decline in high margin license sales causes the company's profitability, contributing to an operating loss of $432.6 million in Q3 2024. While management highlights the growth in subscription services revenue, which increased by 32.5% YoY to $27.8 million, but this is nowhere near sufficient to offset the broader decline in the company's traditional revenue streams. The severity of the situation is further highlighted by the company's operating expenses, which increased by an astounding 301.6% YoY. This includes significant digital asset impairment losses of $412.1 million, but even excluding these losses, the core business is struggling to maintain profitability. The company's gross profit margin has declined from 79.4% in Q3 2023 to 70.4% in Q3 2024, indicating deteriorating pricing power and increasing cost pressures. The deterioration in MicroStrategy's software business is particularly concerning given the company's transformation into what it calls a ""Bitcoin Treasury Company."" While the bitcoin holdings have captured market attention, the declining software business is a significant drain on resources and raises questions about the company's ability to generate organic cash flow to support its bitcoin acquisition strategy. The software segment's operating loss of $18.46 million in Q3 2024 (before corporate expenses and bitcoin related costs) suggests that the business transformation has come at the expense of operational focus and execution in its traditional market. What Could Go Wrong The risk profile for MSTR is asymmetric, with both significant upside and downside potential. On the upside, bitcoin's potential march toward $100,000 could drive further share price appreciation even from these elevated levels. The cryptocurrency market's current momentum, particularly following Trump's election victory, could sustain or even expand the current NAV premium. The downside risks are equally concerning. The most immediate threat comes from potential premium collapse similar to what we witnessed in early 2021. With MSTR trading at a 150% premium to its bitcoin holdings, any reversion toward NAV could trigger substantial losses even if bitcoin prices remain stable or rise modestly. The company's core software business represents another significant risk factor. Q3 2024 results showed accelerating revenue declines across most segments, with product license revenue plummeting 53.9% YoY. This deterioration in the traditional business removes a potential cushion against bitcoin price volatility. Bottom Line I assign sell rating on MSTR at current levels. While the cryptocurrency market's momentum is powerful, particularly in the wake of Trump's victory, the fundamental disconnect between price and value has become too extreme to ignore. The current market price of $400 implies investors are paying $245,000 per bitcoin through a tax-inefficient corporate structure when they could purchase actual bitcoin for $98,000 or gain exposure through more efficient ETF vehicles like IBIT. Given these alternatives, I expect the current premium to gradually erode, potentially creating significant losses for shareholders who remain invested at these levels. The stock's more than 46% surge in just two weeks represents a remarkable return. For those choosing to maintain positions, I strongly recommend having a tight stop-loss. For investors seeking bitcoin exposure, I recommend either direct bitcoin purchases or ETF alternatives like IBIT.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739669-microstrategy-paying-245000-per-bitcoin-makes-no-sense-mstr-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36711860.jpeg

Bull arguments for MicroStrategy include its value through trading, benefits to traders, and outperforming Bitcoin, but these advantages are diminishing. The company's strategy of issuing securities to buy Bitcoin isn't necessarily accretive to investors buying today. Seasonality data suggests December is weak for MicroStrategy, reinforcing the preference for direct Bitcoin investments over MicroStrategy shares. MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) options are the 3rd most traded in the world right now. It is all Fintwit seems to talk about. Not to mention it has announced an astounding $42 billion plan to raise capital . I see a lot of back-and-forths on whether MicroStrategy is worth $102 billion (current market cap) or whether it is not. MicroStrategy's strategy and popularity are very bullish for Bitcoin, but I ultimately prefer to get exposure outside of it. Of the many bull arguments put forward, I group them roughly into three categories: MicroStrategy is worth a multiple of net asset value because it adds value through trading. MicroStrategy is worth a multiple of net asset value because it adds value to traders. MicroStrategy is worth a premium to net asset value because it goes up more than Bitcoin. The bear argument is essentially simple: MicroStrategy's value should be based on Bitcoin. MicroStrategy's market price vastly exceeds the value of its Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy also owns a software operating company, but it is not very significant when compared to its current market cap. The current share price is $397 per share. The cash flow from operations hasn't really exceeded $1 by much since 2000. If anything it is declining. This simplifies things a bit because we can essentially disregard it at this market cap. Data by YCharts MicroStrategy is worth a multiple of net asset value because it adds value to traders. Now, let's look at the idea that MicroStrategy adds value to traders. This is true. There are advantages for traders when dealing with MicroStrategy compared to trading some other Bitcoin-related securities. MicroStrategy is classified as a corporation and there are traders whose mandates do not allow them to invest in funds holding Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is a company, and options are available in the Tradfi systems. MicroStrategy also has a history of tapping leverage to invest in Bitcoin. This provides non-recourse leverage to traders. For a long time, MicroStrategy could also be bought on margin much more efficiently than the only available U.S. fund (at the time) which was the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ETF ( GBTC ). Increasingly, these advantages are disappearing. The latest advantage that MicroStrategy lost is available options through the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) ETF. The way I look at it, this increased the demand for MicroStrategy shares. For many market participants, it was rational enough to own MicroStrategy at a bit of a premium to the actual net asset value of its holdings. MicroStrategy is worth a multiple of net asset value because it adds value through trading I often see a version of the argument that MicroStrategy is adding value through trading Bitcoin. It doesn't trade Bitcoin in the short term. It actually clearly communicates to the market it buys Bitcoin and holds it for the long term and issues securities to finance and refinance these acquisitions/holdings. This idea is often described as MicroStrategy being a bank, investment bank or that it creates value through tapping financial markets. There's some evidence to point to. MicroStrategy has outperformed Bitcoin over the past 5 years: Data by YCharts Earlier this year and throughout most of the previous five years that wasn't the case, though. A lot of it is related to MicroStrategy suddenly getting assigned a much higher multiple: Data by YCharts Book value doesn't accurately reflect Bitcoin's value, but the company likely holds something around 340k Bitcoin. With Bitcoin at around $100k that translates into $34 billion worth of Bitcoin. Against that, the company has around $7 billion worth of debt which puts an approximate net asset value at something like $27 billion. We have a bit of a hindsight problem when looking at whether MicroStrategy trades crypto well. At this point, Bitcoin has been a tremendous financial success story. If you look at your buying history of something that's been very successful it likely looks pretty good. From MicroStrategy's own most recent earning call: As of September 30, 2024, the market value of our Bitcoin holdings was $16 billion at an aggregate cost of $9.9 billion, and an average purchase price of $39,000. MicroStrategy started buying on 8/11/2020 or very close to 4 years ago. On average, it made ~2.5x on the investments (if I exclude the Bitcoin that was likely purchased post-quarter end). Over the same period, Bitcoin is up 504% and MicroStrategy 1970%. Data by YCharts Strangely the company has a slide in its earnings presentation deck where it prides itself on the performance of the MSTR convertible bonds. They also draw attention to it on the call: MSTR convertible bond returns ( MicroStrategy earnings presentation) I guess this is to entice convertible bond buyers. But this ""winning"" comes out of the pocket of equity holders. You're paying a lot of money for leverage if your convertible bonds are performing well. I don't think it is a great track record of tapping the capital markets. At the same time, it would have been hard to predict MicroStrategy's outperformance of Bitcoin. The company has developed trading goals for itself. It uses a convoluted metric it calls BTC yield. Basically, it wants to increase the ratio of its Bitcoin holdings to shares outstanding by 6-10% per year. That essentially means the company would increase by 6-10% in value per year if the net-asset-value metric remained the same and the Bitcoin price didn't move. It is a metric that attempts to isolate the value created by navigating capital markets well. BTC yield ( MicroStrategy ) This target is very easy to hit if you can issue stock at 3x net asset value. It makes me very hesitant to buy MicroStrategy at multiples of net asset value. If you buy at 1x net asset value this strategy aligns you well with management but if you buy above, it is a license to dilute you into oblivion. I don't think these are good comps, but for the sake of argument JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) is generally considered a very successful bank, and it trades at 2.13x book value. The sector median is 2.13x. A trader like Virtu Financial, Inc. ( VIRT ) trades at ~2.4x book value and Flow Traders ( FLTLF ) trades at 1.48x book value. These are high-frequency traders though that eke out consistent profits. They achieve returns on assets well above 6-10% with little market risk. MicroStrategy is worth a premium to net asset value because it goes up more than Bitcoin. One particular interesting but ultimately wrong way to justify a MicroStrategy investment is by bringing up the reflexivity theory by Soros. He explained this idea in the ""Alchemy of Finance"" and later in the FT as follows: I can state the core idea in two relatively simple propositions. One is that in situations that have thinking participants, the participants’ view of the world is always partial and distorted. That is the principle of fallibility. The other is that these distorted views can influence the situation to which they relate because false views lead to inappropriate actions. That is the principle of reflexivity. For instance, treating drug addicts as criminals creates criminal behavior. It misconstrues the problem and interferes with the proper treatment of addicts. As another example, declaring that the government is bad tends to make for a bad government. A practical example, that translates quite well to this MicroStrategy situation is that of REITs. Soros put the example of real estate investment trusts or REITs in the 70s forward to illustrate his theory in practice. REITs are asset-based companies. Over the long term, their value is closely related to the value of the value of the net assets owned by the REIT. Some factors influence whether a REIT should trade at a discount or premium but there is a strong relationship. In the 70s, REITs got all the rage, and they generally went up. This led to increased attention and capital inflows. With REIT valuations getting pushed up managements started to issue equity at market prices. They then turned around and acquired more properties. Running a bigger company is cool and it justifies higher pay. It also makes a lot of sense to issue shares at 1.2x net asset value and use the proceeds to buy property at 1x. As long as your share price holds up this creates value out of thin air. If the multiples you get awarded continue to go up, you're creating more and more ""value"". This started to drive property prices and when sentiment ultimately turned, the real estate market collapsed. In these situations, it is actually super interesting to get into the ""REIT"" or MicroStrategy equivalent early on. This is especially the case if you are restricted in your trading. If selling MicroStrategy isn't an option for you anyway, it makes sense to issue shares at any premium to net asset value above your cost base. It is always value accretive. It doesn't necessarily work out very well if you buy later (at that higher multiple of net asset value). You have to believe MicroStrategy will succeed in issuing significant amounts of additional securities at even higher multiples than what you're paying. Because of the principle of fallibility, the fact that this trade doesn't make much sense enables it. Discovering that it doesn't make sense isn't really a great thesis to take the opposite side. There is one reason why I don't think the reflexivity theory explains the outperformance of MicroStrategy very well or should be used as a justification to go long MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy 's underlying value is ultimately tied to Bitcoin. If it is successful, and it continues to be able to issue securities, buy Bitcoin, and so on, then Bitcoin is going to rise. You can now easily buy Bitcoin at 1x net asset value through a number of ETFs or futures or even get leverage through option markets. You can have others ""fund"" the MicroStrategy loop but not run the risk of the premium evaporating. Of course, you miss the potential upside of the premium increases, but because that's based on extended fallibility, I don't mind. Seasonality I also took a quick look at the seasonality data for MicroStrategy. Generally, October and November are very strong months. December tends to be really weak. There isn't that much value in this data because MicroStrategy changed a lot as a company. The sample size of monthly data points is too small to be reliable. But I've seen many very popular stocks that seem a bit weak in December (see this NVIDIA write-up ). So, I'm inclined to believe the next month is perhaps not the best time for MicroStrategy. MSTR seasonality (seekingalpha.com) To wrap things up, I think it is best to get Bitcoin exposure outside of MicroStrategy. The market cap value far exceeds the value of its net asset value. It is possible this multiple continues to expand. As long as this continues to be the case, it is likely a positive tailwind for Bitcoin. However, MicroStrategy has laid out how it will continue to issue securities to buy Bitcoin even if only marginally accretive. At the current Bitcoin per share ratios, it is highly accretive, and I'd expect aggressive fundraising. Although December isn't bad for Bitcoin (see What To Buy On A Trump Win ) it doesn't look great for MicroStrategy. Although I'm quite bullish on Bitcoin (see Why It Is A Good Time To Go Long Bitcoin ) I'd avoid MicroStrategy. The potential reflexive upside will also show up in a straight Bitcoin investment. It leaves you less exposed if the net asset value multiple decreases.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739664-why-i-favor-bitcoin-over-microstrategy-mstr-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36711318.jpeg

Citron Research's short position was enough to send the stock much lower, highlighting how sensitive it is to sentiment shifts at the moment. MicroStrategy's ability to raise funds at favorable terms boosts its book value per share and Bitcoin holdings per share, but it remains highly sensitive to Bitcoin's performance. Despite long-term potential for Bitcoin as governments adopt it, BTC's chart looks overextended at the moment, which can severely hurt MicroStrategy if it falls. The technical chart for MSTR doesn't look great, as it is acting in a similar way to SMCI stock before it started tumbling. The fact that MSTR stock was down while BTC was up, is another red flag. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has established itself as a one-of-a-kind company, using its corporate structure and strong investor sentiment to turn into a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) investment bank, as a recent Seeking Alpha article called it. MicroStrategy now has 331,200 Bitcoins , turning its stock into a leveraged bet on the cryptocurrency, funding its purchases via a combination of free cash flow, debt issuance, and ATM equity offerings. This has attracted attention because it gives investors the ability to have amplified exposure to BTC without needing to use leverage. Meanwhile, this works for the company because it's able to raise debt at 0% or near 0% and issue shares at a high valuation to buy BTC. Its proprietary Bitcoin Yield metric also highlights the company's focus on increasing its Bitcoin holdings per share to create value. However, the stock fell by over 16% yesterday, November 21, while Bitcoin was actually up about 4-5%. This created a large bearish engulfing candle, similar to the one seen from Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) shortly before it imploded. The main reason for the drop was the news that Citron Research, a well-known short-seller, has shorted MSTR. While many people would call this a ""nothing burger"" because not everyone cares about what Citron Research does, it's telling that the stock still fell by that much on news that has nothing to do with the fundamentals. It goes to show how sensitive investor sentiment can be once it gets stretched so high. Adding to the complexity, Semler Scientific ( SMLR ), a company that has a somewhat similar strategy to MSTR, gained 12.1% yesterday while all of this happened, showing that this is specifically a MSTR stock problem. Additionally, Bitcoin's rally is starting to get overextended in the short term, which can hurt MSTR's valuation. While MicroStrategy remains an intriguing play for the long term (if you're bullish on Bitcoin), it may be prudent to exercise caution in the short term. The stock trades at a speculative premium, is reliant on favorable market conditions, and is highly sensitive to sentiment shifts. Therefore, I rate the stock as a Hold. The Advantage MicroStrategy Has And How It Can Increase Its BVPS And Bitcoin Per Share One of MicroStrategy's most unique advantages is its ability to raise money through both equity and debt offerings at insanely great terms, which can allow the company to quickly increase its book value per share [BVPS] and Bitcoin holdings per share, as long as BTC doesn't tumble, of course. For example, the company recently raised $3 billion worth of convertible bonds with a 0% coupon and a conversion premium of 55%. Bondholders will be able to convert the bonds at a strike price of $672.40. This means that if they're converted into shares, MSTR won't have to pay the $3 billion in cash. This can increase its book value per share, but it depends on whether the conversion price is higher than the company's book value per share at the time of conversion (quite likely). If the conversion price of $672 is higher than the BVPS, the company will see a boost in BVPS because it will be issuing shares at a premium to its intrinsic value, increasing the company’s book value on a per-share basis. If the conversion price is below BVPS, the increase in shares outstanding has the opposite effect. But if MSTR's BVPS was over $672 at that point, then you'd probably be up significantly on the stock and wouldn't care about the dilution. In the meantime, MSTR has debt that it doesn't even have to pay interest on, which is obviously a great deal. The company's has an advantage in equity offerings as well. MicroStrategy has been able to issue shares at prices far above its book value per share in the past, which immediately increases BVPS because it adds more value to the balance sheet than the dilution caused. Just recently, it raised $2.03 billion by issuing shares. In addition to potential BVPS growth, MicroStrategy closely monitors its Bitcoin yield, a proprietary key performance indicator that reflects its ability to grow its Bitcoin holdings on a per-share basis. Per MSTR , Bitcoin Yield measures the ""percentage change period-to-period of the ratio between the Company’s bitcoin holdings and its Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding."" This metric helps the company and investors see whether Bitcoin purchases are accretive to shareholders. For example, when MicroStrategy raises money to buy Bitcoin, the company increases its total Bitcoin holdings. If its BTC holdings growth exceeds the growth in Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding, then the Bitcoin Yield is positive, giving investors more BTC per share. Risks: MSTR Is Rising On Perception And Potential Rather Than Current BTC Holdings While MicroStrategy’s strategy has captivated investors with its ability to raise cheap capital, it seems to me that the stock's valuation is very dependent on perception and future potential rather than its current Bitcoin holdings. This creates some risks. Let's outline them. 1. Overvaluation Relative to Bitcoin Holdings First, we have the age-old argument, but it's a valid one. MicroStrategy's market cap was $89.259 billion as of the most recent closing price, far exceeding the value of its Bitcoin holdings, currently worth ~$32.788 billion if you use a BTC price of $99K. This means there's a speculative premium because the market believes the company can continue raising funds and accumulating Bitcoin. However, is this premium sustainable? Maybe not, especially if there's a Bitcoin bear market or if investor sentiment shifts. All it takes is a pullback in Bitcoin prices or a reassessment of the speculative premium, which could cause the stock to fall quickly, regardless of the company's ability to hold or acquire more Bitcoin. 2. Dependence on Favorable Market Conditions MicroStrategy's ability to issue funds cheaply is key to its strategy. These favorable terms are probably only possible in strong bull markets, where investors are thinking about how to make more money rather than thinking about how to control risk. If BTC's momentum stalls or turns negative, the company may no longer be able to raise money at such favorable terms as investors reconsider the risk at hand. This would limit MSTR's ability to continue growing its Bitcoin holdings quickly. 3. The Double-Edged Sword of Leverage Perception While MicroStrategy is often viewed as a leveraged play on Bitcoin, it doesn't carry traditional leverage, as its market cap far exceeds its Bitcoin holdings. SC Capital Group on Seeking Alpha talked about this in one of his recent articles . Traditional leverage, at least in my view, would mean a market cap of, say, $100 billion and Bitcoin holdings worth $200 billion. Instead, MSTR's leverage comes from its ability to amplify BTC exposure through capital raises. This perception of leverage helps it during bull markets, as investors expect it to take advantage of rising BTC prices. At the same time, however, it also amplifies the downside risk during BTC bear markets, as the speculative premium it carries can collapse if sentiment falls, which would expose the disconnect between the market cap and the value of its BTC holdings. 4. Sentiment Is Important Sentiment is key. The 16% drop on November 21, despite a 4-5% rise in Bitcoin, shows just how much sentiment can quickly change. The sell-off was triggered by Citron Research posting on X that he went short, saying the following: How did this one age? Nearly 4 years ago to the date, Citron was the first to tell readers that MicroStrategy was the ultimate way to invest in Bitcoin, setting a $700 target. Fast forward to today: $MSTR has skyrocketed to over $5,000 (adjusted). Kudos to Michael Saylor for his visionary Bitcoin strategy... Now, with Bitcoin investing easier than ever (ETFs, $COIN , $HOOD ), $MSTR’s volume has completely detached from BTC fundamentals. While Citron remains bullish on Bitcoin, we've hedged with a short $MSTR position. Much respect to @saylor , but even he must know $MSTR is overheated"" That's all it took for MSTR to give up many of its gains. Now, imagine if BTC pulled back. MSTR's premium valuation seems fragile. 5. Debt Maturity Risk and Liquidity Concerns The recent debt issuance may be ""free,"" with a 0% interest rate, but it still needs to be paid back, along with the rest of the debt it has raised in the past. If we're in a BTC bear market by the time it has to pay back this debt, it may have to sell shares (likely at an unfavorable price) to pay it off, which would dilute shareholders meaningfully. The rebuttal to this is that BTC prices should be higher in a few years. Fine. That's very possible, but just know the risk you're taking there. 6. Bitcoin's Rally May Be Getting Overheated When would you rather invest in Bitcoin? When it's consolidating for many months and investor sentiment is not super hot (as things were just a couple of months ago), or after a large breakout that has been continuing for weeks? Sure, the rally can keep going, but if you're a long-term investor, you know you'd rather get in when the sentiment is not as hot. In addition, the $100K level is a magnet, pulling investors in because they want to see that $100K level hit. BTC is approaching the magnet, but if it can notably pass that level in the short term remains a key question. A dip can come at any time, and MSTR stock will get hurt big. BTCUSD Chart (TradingView) The Chart Reminds Me Of SMCI Stock When It Started To Top MSTR's stock chart also raises red flags. There's a bearish engulfing candle on its daily chart -- a candlestick pattern where a large red candle fully engulfs the previous green candle. This often signals a potential momentum reversal. Engulfing candles happen often and can provide false signals, but context is important. What makes this one notable is a few things. First, look at the size of that red candle. That does look healthy to me. Second, the candle comes after a large melt-up in price. That's key because it shows that this melt-up has fully melted, indicating a large shift in sentiment. Third, look at the high volume on the bottom of the chart. High volume often confirms that this is not just a fake-out move. MSTR Stock Chart (TradingView) Importantly, a similar pattern was observed earlier this year with SMCI stock, which was riding the AI wave. I remember seeing the pattern play out and thinking, this is the end of the melt-up. You can see the candle and volume (the black arrows I drew). Although SMCI stock bounced in the short term after that -- just enough to trap the bulls -- it eventually faced a decline as sentiment faded. SMCI Stock Chart (TradingView) What also gives me pause is the fact that SMLR stock rose 12.1% yesterday. Semler Scientific, while not the exact same as MSTR (and much smaller) is employing a similar BTC strategy, buying Bitcoin and reporting a BTC yield to shareholders. As a result, its stock has been rising recently because of BTC's rally. BTC was up yesterday, and so was SMLR, but MSTR was put off by a post on X. Maybe new investors aren't willing to pay such premium valuations for MSTR. Maybe everyone who already wanted in on MSTR has already gotten in. It seems like a problem specific to MSTR. The Long-Term Case for Bitcoin Despite the risks tied to MicroStrategy's BTC strategy, BTC itself has solid upside potential for the long term. As most people know, it has a fixed supply, is seeing growing adoption by institutions, and is often used as a hedge against inflation. However, something that can give it solid long-term upside is the growing interest from governments and policymakers, so that's what I'll be discussing below. Government Interest Is Growing Recent political developments suggest that governments are increasingly becoming interested in Bitcoin. People are speculating that there will soon be policies creating Strategic Bitcoin Reserves at both the state and federal levels. This would add plenty of legitimacy and demand to the market. For instance, the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act proposes allocating up to 10% of certain state-managed funds into BTC. Collectively, these funds have $51 billion in assets under management, meaning that a 10% allocation could translate to $5.1 billion worth of Bitcoin purchases, per Forbes . Also, Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act earlier this year, which is pushing for the creation of a national Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The reserve would be built by purchasing Bitcoin and by keeping the 69,370 BTC that has already been confiscated by U.S. authorities, instead of selling it. The BITCOIN Act even proposes annual purchases of up to 200,000 BTC over five years, totaling 1,000,000 BTC, which will create large amounts of demand for the cryptocurrency. The Bottom Line On MSTR Stock MSTR stock offers a unique way to gain Bitcoin exposure. By issuing equity at high valuations and raising debt at 0% interest, the company has positioned itself as a ""Bitcoin investment bank."" However, MSTR's valuation is very reliant on perception, favorable market conditions, and future potential, as it trades at a large premium compared to its current Bitcoin holdings and isn't actually leveraged in a traditional sense. Its valuation premium can fade if sentiment were to fall, and a Bitcoin bear market would likely hurt its ability to raise cheap funds, hurting the fundamentals. The sharp 16% decline after Citron Research's post on X demonstrates how vulnerable the stock is to sentiment shifts. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's long-term upside potential remains strong, driven by growing institutional adoption and emerging government interest, so there is potential there. Nonetheless, Bitcoin's chart looks overextended, which is not a time when I'd want to have BTC exposure, personally.

The U.S. government benefits from Bitcoin's rise, as Tether's increased Treasury purchases could help alleviate the nation's budget deficit. Tether's stability and role as a safe haven during Bitcoin volatility mitigate risks, even if Bitcoin's value drops. The relationship between Bitcoin, Tether, and U.S. debt presents a compelling case for Bitcoin to surge in the months ahead. Preamble Six months ago, had I seen the headline above, I would have guffawed to the point of apoplexy. However, in the words of our modern-day sage, Mr. Bob Dylan; The times they are a changin’. Rather than keep readers hostage, let me outline my thesis and then support my hypothesis in detail within the body of the article. Tether (USDT-USD) plays a considerable role in the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ecosystem, despite not being Bitcoin-based itself, by being a bridge between fiat and crypto. Investors in Bitcoin often trade via this stablecoin, so, as the price of Bitcoin rises, so does the market cap of Tether. As followers of Bitcoin are aware, Tether claims that each token is backed by reserves, and a significant portion of these reserves are held in short-term US Treasury bills. So, given that the current market cap of Tether is around $130 billion, we may conclude that the stablecoin is backed by the equivalent sum of T Bills together with other tradeable assets. My thesis is that the US government would not oppose Bitcoin rising ever higher as this would lead to a further rise in Tether, and consequently, it would establish itself as a more than significant buyer of T Bills. Indeed, given recent poor demand in bond auctions, it has, in fact, become desirable that Bitcoin rise to heady levels. Tether For those unfamiliar with Tether, it is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is designed to remain stable at $1 per USDT. This stability makes it easier for people to move money between traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, and Bitcoin. Investors can buy Tether with USD and then use that Tether to buy Bitcoin, avoiding the volatility of directly exchanging USD for BTC. Many exchanges use Tether trading pairs (BTC/USDT for example) as their primary trading pairs, even more so than USD pairs, thus improving liquidity. This high liquidity makes it easier for traders to buy and sell Bitcoin quickly and efficiently, facilitating smoother market operations. There any numerous other advantages that have led to the market cap of Tether soaring over recent years. A mere five years ago Tether’s market cap was a paltry $4.5 billion, and now it has increased around 2,767% to reach $129 billion. This enormous percentage rise dwarfs even the market cap of Bitcoin. Over the same period, the market cap of Bitcoin has increased by circa 1,526% from $115 billion to the current market cap of about $1.87 trillion. Tether Treasury Bill Holdings Tether recently announced a massive $5.2 billion profit for the first half of 2024. This success is largely due to their huge investment in U.S. Treasury bonds, which has reached a record-breaking $97.6 billion. To put this into perspective; “This achievement brings Tether’s exposure to Treasuries above Germany.” The company reportedly issued over $8.3 billion worth of their stablecoin in the second quarter alone. Because USDT is pegged to the U.S. dollar, Tether needs to back it with reserves such as Treasury Holdings or equivalents. According to the company’s attestation; “Tether also ranks 3rd in purchases of 3-month U.S. Treasuries, after the United Kingdom and the Cayman Islands. Given the trajectory of USDT adoption, it sees the potential of becoming 1st in the next year.” What this means is that it is in the US government’s interest if Bitcoin heads higher, particularly given the high deficit spending. In addition to their Treasury holdings, they also have significant assets in Bitcoin, amounting to $4.7 billion, and hold an extra $5.3 billion in reserve. Treasury Issuance The U.S. is increasingly relying on short-term borrowing to cover its growing budget deficit, which is a trend driven by a complex series of factors. To begin with, short-term debt generally carries lower interest rates than long-term debt. Thus, the government can minimize its interest costs by issuing more short-term debt and refinancing it frequently at lower rates. In recent years, there has been a consistently strong demand for short-term US Treasury securities. These securities are considered very safe and liquid, making them attractive to a wide range of investors, including financial institutions, foreign governments, and individual investors. Perhaps most importantly, there has been a lackluster demand for long-dated paper. According to Barron’s ; “The Treasury’s auction of 30-year bonds on Thursday went about as badly as it could, indicating investors are reluctant to own long-dated government securities. At the auction of government debt that matures in 30 years, investors were awarded 4.769% in yield, 0.051 percentage point higher than the yield in pre-auction trading. The difference between the two yields—called a tail—indicated a weak auction where the U.S. government had to entice investors with a premium over the market to buy their debt. Primary dealers, who buy up supply not taken by investors, had to accept 24.7% of the debt on offer, more than double the 12% average for the past year.” This is a topic I have previously covered in my article on gold . In the piece, I highlight data from the Congressional Research Service , which highlights the dwindling demand for treasuries from foreign buyers. Given the above, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to conclude that Tether may well continue to be an important buyer of US bonds and that the US government is unlikely to stand in the way of the continued rise of Bitcoin. US Marketable Securities Are there any readers that would disagree that the demand for more money by the US government is probably going to rise in the near term, certainly not the government. According to The Treasury ; “During the January – March 2024 quarter, Treasury borrowed $748 billion in privately held net marketable debt.” For the same quarter in 2025, the estimate by The Treasury is to borrow $823 billion , or $75 billion more, which equates to approximately $25 billion a month extra. So, a back of the envelope calculation gives us $150 billion over the next six months. The Path To Further Rises In Bitcoin Counter intuitively, we have seen is that the market cap of Tether is rising faster than that of the market cap of Bitcoin. So, if Bitcoin hits, say, $200K a coin, well then, we may surmise that the market cap of Tether will more or less double, as a result of inflows, to reach circa $260 billion. And if the company follows through with their promise to purchase Bills, almost the full amount of the excess debt of $150 billion can be purchased, which would be a massive relief for the US government. What Happens To Tether If Bitcoin Falls Perhaps there are some who may suggest that the market cap of Tether could fall, which would lead to a sell-off of their holdings of Bills. It seems to me that even if Bitcoin were to slump in value, Tether would be only modestly affected. Tether is designed to maintain a stable value pegged to the US dollar. There are a few reasons why a Bitcoin nose dive is unlikely to significantly impact Tether's market cap To begin with, whilst we may agree that Bitcoin is Tether is used for stability and as a safe haven during Bitcoin volatility. When Bitcoin falls, investors often move funds Tether, increasing demand and potentially its market cap. Tether, as I have mentioned, is backed by reserves such as Treasuries or equivalents, which should insulate Tether from Bitcoin's price fluctuations. If Bitcoin falls, it doesn't directly affect Tether's reserves. Risks To Thesis In this world, no investment comes with a guarantee to go up forever. It is possible that there will be a total loss of confidence in cryptocurrencies at some point in the future. This would, I suspect, impact even Tether, which could then precipitate a wholesale sell-off of the assets. Summary There is a fascinating relationship between Bitcoin, Tether, and the U.S. government's debt. It appears that the U.S. government might actually be rooting for Bitcoin to skyrocket to $200,000. Why? Because it could lead to Tether coming to the rescue of the US by purchasing the government’s debt. As Bitcoin rises, so does Tether's market cap, and a significant portion of Tether’s inflows are held in US bonds. Tether's demand for Treasury bills could be a lifeline for the government. A loss of confidence in Bitcoin could impact even Tether, potentially leading to a sell-off of their assets. However, Tether's stability and role as a safe haven during Bitcoin volatility could mitigate this risk. Overall, the dynamics between Bitcoin, Tether, and the U.S. Treasury market present a compelling case for Bitcoin to head much higher within the next six months.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739653-bitcoin-appreciation-will-benefit-the-us-government?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36710634.jpeg

As of Friday, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hovers around $98.3K, briefly surging to a peak of $99.5K, marking its highest recorded value. With investors keenly monitoring the token’s movements, let’s explore the insights of some Seeking Alpha analysts on the current price action of bitcoin below: SA Analyst Dean Popplewell stated: “Bitcoin’s price surge is fueled by institutional demand, growing mainstream acceptance, and a derivatives market boom… Looking at a move to the upside and the 100000 mark could lead to some wild price swings I will be keeping an eye on the round numbers/psychological numbers around 105000 and 110000,” in Bitcoin's Rocket Ride To Near $100,000, More To Come? SA Analyst Made Easy – Finance indicated: “Bitcoin has broken through the historic $90,000 resistance as we expected, entering uncharted territory with the potential to reach up to $200,000 in the ongoing bull market,” in Bitcoin: Buy The Breakout . SA Analyst Logan Kane said: “Bitcoin's price surge is driven by reduced supply, increased demand, plus potential government adoption, giving it continued long-term upside,” in With Bitcoin Topping $90,000, Beware Of Crypto Copycats Like Dogecoin And MicroStrategy . SA Analyst Nicholas Kitonyi spotlighted: “If Trump delivers his promises, Bitcoin could further stretch gains to $100,000 or even $110,000, making it a multi-trillion dollar asset,” in Trump's Pre-Election Crypto Promises Could Spur Bitcoin To A Multi-Trillion Asset . Additionally, for investors looking to further track the price of bitcoin, they can look towards some of Wall Street’s bitcoin backed exchange-traded funds as an option: ( IBIT ), ( ARKB ), ( GBTC ), ( BRRR ), ( BTCO ), ( HODL ), ( BTCW ), ( FBTC ), ( BITB ), and ( EZBC ).

36709257,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654341,1732289451,XRP Price Outlook Brightens: Expert Predicts $2 Target Post-Gensler Era,"On Thursday, the XRP price soared to $1.41, marking its highest trading value in over three years. This surge coincides with a shifting regulatory landscape in the United States, spurred by the anticipated administration of President-elect Donald Trump. During his campaign, Trump pledged to position America as the “crypto capital of the world,” a promise that is beginning to resonate with market participants even before his inauguration on January 20, 2025. Gensler Sets Last Day At SEC For January 20 In recent weeks, the cryptocurrency market has seen a notable uptrend, with Bitcoin leading the charge and achieving consecutive all-time highs. This momentum is in part a response to the positive sentiment surrounding Trump’s pro-crypto promises, which is expected to facilitate a more favorable environment for digital assets. Related Reading: FTX Provides Details On $16 Billion Distribution Timeline For Customers And Creditors Central to this optimism is the expected departure of Gary Gensler, the current chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gensler has been criticized for fostering an unclear regulatory environment that many argue has stifled the growth of cryptocurrencies in the US. For XRP and Ripple Labs, this scrutiny has been particularly pronounced over the past four years under the Biden administration. Trump previously vowed to remove Gensler from his position, a move that many in the crypto community view as a necessary step toward clearer regulations. Yet, on the same day as Trump’s anticipated inauguration, Gensler confirmed that January 20, 2025, will be his last day at the SEC. His resignation preempts what many experts speculated could be a contentious conflict if he remained in office while Trump sought to replace him. XRP Price Surges Nearly 30% In 24 Hours This shift in the regulatory landscape in the US has contributed to a clearer outlook for digital assets, as reflected in XRP price movements. In the past 24 hours alone, XRP recorded gains of nearly 30%, and over the past week, it has increased more than 70%. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared his views on X (formerly Twitter), stating that Gensler’s exit could be highly beneficial for both Ripple Labs and the XRP price, which he believes is now targeting $2. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Neutral Netflow On Binance: What Does This Signal? Another analyst, CrediBull, echoed this sentiment, noting that XRP’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching overbought territory for the first time in three years. The analyst emphasized that a higher RSI typically indicates stronger momentum and bullish prospects for the asset, absent any bearish divergences. CrediBull suggested that the next significant target for XRP is $2, with aspirations for new all-time highs thereafter. Currently, the token’s all-time high stands at $3,040, which was reached nearly seven years ago in January 2018. This means that the XRP price could be in for a massive 150% uptrend in the coming months.

42435260,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kooug,1732289423,How to Talk About Crypto With Your Family This Thanksgiving,"With bitcoin eyeing $100,000 and ""Peanut the Squirrel"" grabbing headlines with 3,000% gains, crypto is firmly back on the menu this holiday season. Family debates about bitcoin, memecoins and ""the dog thing Elon tweets about"" will no doubt liven up the dinner table and you, as the designated ""crypto expert,"" will need some talking points to win over the normies.  Crypto is libertarian lunacy  Trump's candidacy and victory sparked the latest crypto bull run and many now associate it with the worst excesses of MAGA and Elon's D.O.G.E trolling. For your left-leaning relatives, seeing crypto championed so hard by the new Republican administration will do little to help your case. If your true-blue cousin won't buy bitcoin because of its red-and-orange connections, switch to the facts instead.  Point out that bitcoin is a currency that can be used by people of all creeds, making it inherently non-political and a movement that can unite us all. Reference Jason Maier's book, ""A Progressive's Case for Bitcoin,"" which unpacks many misconceptions about bitcoin and underscores its origins as a protest against too-big-to-fail banks, its ability to help poor and marginalized communities, and its potential to create a sustainable environment. While policies may drive price action, crypto itself should never be a partisan issue.  Crypto is a memecoin casino  Somewhere between the deviled eggs and the turkey, the next battle you'll face will be meme coins. With top-performing coins like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB, and newcomers like PNUT delivering explosive returns, Aunty Cynthia's heard about the meme coin craze and she's got some opinions to share.  While POPCAT, BONK and MOODENG capture culture and community in ways that make insiders smile, the flip side is making our industry look a little delulu. When trying to get pension funds and family offices to allocate to crypto, it's hard to argue the virtues of Fartcoin, no matter how many brussel sprouts you've eaten. The memecoin craze is fun but shouldn't overshadow the real power of crypto to bring better, more efficient, more effective financial services to the world. It's simple — for the 1.4 billion people shut out of the traditional financial system, crypto is a better way to store value, access lending and build wealth, empowering them to take control of their financial futures. Also, when it comes down to it, memecoins are an incredibly innovative new form of expression and financial participation that can provide a sense of community and belonging missing from much of the polarizing social discourse on centralized platforms.  Cryptos are no different from stocks  The launch of bitcoin and ether ETFs this year has some saying that crypto is just another payday for Wall Street suits. While folks like BlackRock's Larry Fink may help onboard more Boomers to crypto, they're missing the point. Cryptocurrencies are the antithesis of stocks and other TradFi assets administered and held by centralized custodians. Digital assets are yours to own. They are decentralized, unseizable, peer-to-peer, require no centralized authority, and often have additional utility beyond a means of exchange and store of value.  The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has opened up myriad opportunities and leveled the playing field for everyday individuals to access sophisticated financial instruments, secure a decent APY, or take out a permissionless loan. No one can take your crypto from you if it's stored correctly under your control, or halt trading to prevent you from claiming your funds. It's entirely different from traditional finance.  Crypto is a risky investment  Many people who got curious about crypto during the last bull cycle immediately crashed into one of the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history. And those who got tired of waiting for prices to rise sold their assets at a less-than-ideal time. Everyone knows someone's cousin, niece, or nephew who ""lost everything in crypto,"" especially NFTs. But for those who bought and held bitcoin at least, their patience was duly rewarded. Since 2013, BTC has seen annualized returns of 125% [coinmarketcap.com], making it one of the best-performing assets of our time.  Just look at El Salvador's success. President Nayib Bukele's bet on bitcoin in 2021 drew its fair share of criticism but the small Central American country's bitcoin holdings have now soared to over $500 million, yielding more than 100% ROI. Not only that but his approval ratings are hovering around 90% and the homicide rate is now lower than in the U.S. Another small country to make it big on bitcoin is the Kingdom of Bhutan, whose bitcoin holdings now equate to over $1 billion. Does that seem risky to you?  Crypto isn't real  Of course, no Thanksgiving dinner would be complete without the old adage that crypto isn't real. Some folks just can't get around not being able to put bitcoin in their pocket, arguing that it isn't backed by anything, unlike the dollar which comes with the ""full faith and credit"" of the U.S. government. Cold hard facts are your friend for this one. Point to the powerful network of miners behind bitcoin, the $3 trillion crypto market cap, the ETF providers, the institutions, politicians and nation-states.  Talk about bitcoin's capped supply of 21 million and reinforce that — unlike the dollar which has lost 92% of its purchasing power since 1933 — no more will ever be mined and can never dilute the value of your holdings. Bitcoin's limited supply makes it much more akin to gold as a scarce asset and optimal store of value, compared to the out-of-control money printing machine behind the greenback diluting the value of your savings.  Wonder why the cost of everything from ham and eggs to house prices and the turkey on the table have gone up? Inflation is an ongoing tax on the people and bitcoin provides a compelling solution. Or, to put it in words that Uncle Dave would agree with, bitcoin offers a hedge against many of the risks inherent to the traditional fiat financial system.  If, after all that, your family remains an immovable object, take heart. It's better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all. And Grandma asking about crypto again is the clearest top signal you can get.

MSTR stock's valuation is irrational, with its market cap decoupled from reality, driven by high Bitcoin prices and speculative trading. MicroStrategy stock is highly volatile, with significant risks due to its heavy reliance on Bitcoin and continuous share dilution to purchase more BTC. A fair valuation for MSTR could be around $175-225, reflecting a 25-50% premium to its Bitcoin holdings, suggesting a potential 50% drop from current levels. MicroStrategy Overview Things were much different when I wrote about MicroStrategy Incorporated ""MSTR"" ( MSTR ) early this year. MicroStrategy's stock was coming off a significant correction, trading below $50 (adjusted for the recent spit), below a $10 billion valuation, and below the fair value of its massive Bitcoin stockpile. With Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) highly likely to move above $50K and higher, buying MicroStrategy stock was a no-brainer, and the stock did extraordinarily well. In fact, MicroStrategy recently surged to over $500, appreciating by over 10x since I published my bullish article on the company. MSTR Stock 1-Year Chart MSTR (StockCharts.com) MicroStrategy had a significant blow-off top, fluctuating between $375 and $550 in a single trading session. This is about a $35 billion move market cap-wise, which is more valuable than all the Bitcoins the company owns here. Also, with over 100 million shares changing hands in one day, it equates to about $50 billion, which is enormous. All the technical indicators are highly stretched, essentially screaming sell here. Today's MicroStrategy stock is much different than what I wrote about at the beginning of this year. I recently sold my position in two tranches, and I've been highlighting MSTR as a ""take profit"" candidate in my Investment Group as the share price skyrocketed into the $450-550 range. For reference, MicroStrategy is a company that saw the value in Bitcoin early and began investing in Bitcoin instead of holding devaluating cash on its books. This revolutionary strategy enabled MicroStrategy to become one of the most significant holders of Bitcoin over the years, simultaneously transforming MSTR into the most exciting Bitcoin proxy play. MicroStrategy - Better Than Bitcoin ETFs MicroStrategy is better than a Bitcoin ETF because it's not an ETF, and many people trade MSTR instead of dealing with ETFs and crypto exchanges. Many more people have access to MSTR than Bitcoin ETFs or actual Bitcoin. There are also insane options action in MSTR shares, making it almost an ideal trading vehicle for Bitcoin-related exposure. While certain aspects of this stock are excellent, there are considerable issues. For instance, MicroStrategy can become enormously overbought and outrageously overvalued, posing a significant risk to investors and anyone not familiar with the dynamics of this company. When The Top Is In I recently read a fascinating article discussing how MicroStrategy could become a multi-trillion dollar company and how it's Bitcoin's ""only"" investment bank. The article discusses and attempts to explain the massive divergence between its market cap and the value of its Bitcoins. My issue with this perspective is that you can't explain away MSTR's irrational price action. There is no fundamental reason MSTR should be near the $400-500 level. MSTR is this high primarily because of the incredibly high investor sentiment regarding Bitcoin and MicroStrategy's future strategy of purchasing more Bitcoins. Devoid of any connection to reality, MSTR has essentially become a ""meme stock."" Bitcoin Doesn't Only Go Up The problem with this dynamic is that Bitcoin doesn't go up perpetually. Bitcoin is in a bull market now, but someday, it will end, and we will likely see a substantial bear market again. Significant pullbacks are also common, and Bitcoin could have a 20-30% correction at any time, which would be considered a relatively normal pullback process, especially after the extraordinary gains. While Bitcoin could pull back by 20-30% on ""any given Sunday,"" MicroStrategy could drop by much more. Given all the optimism surrounding MSTR, this may not be a popular valuation process. However, I still believe we should value this company ""traditionally"" and not according to eccentric estimations that may come true in the distant future. MicroStrategy's ""Fair Value"" MicroStrategy was originally a niche software company with a relatively steady business but, unfortunately, little or no growth. MSTR should have about $500M in sales next year and in 2026. If we're generous, we can give its software business a 6x sales valuation. Thus, MSTR's software operations may be worth about $3 billion. However, this valuation is minuscule relative to MSTR's burgeoning market cap, and most of the company's value comes from its Bitcoin Holdings. MicroStrategy now holds 331,200 Bitcoins . At its current market value of approximately $98,300, MSTR's Bitcoin treasure chest is worth roughly $32.56 billion. Once we add the $3B estimate for its software segment valuation, MSTR's valuation is about $35.56B. However, there are two ways MSTR gets more Bitcoins on its books , either by taking out debt or by issuing more shares. MSTR has about $4.2B of long-term debt, which it used to purchase Bitcoins on its balance sheet. Considering this debt load, MSTR's value may be around $31.36B. MSTR's Bitcoin Stash True Worth $31.36B may be MSTR's fair value here. However, Bitcoin could continue rising, and MSTR is a company. Perhaps it should trade at a premium to its BTC. However, what is the correct or acceptable premium? BTC could be worth $125-150K in about a year. This dynamic implies that MSTR may trade around a 25-50% premium to its Bitcoin holdings. This dynamic suggests that MSTR's market cap could be about $40-50 billion, with BTC around $100K, and still considered sane. However, at $400, MSTR's market cap is around $90 billion. When the stock hit a nose-bleeding level of around $550, its market cap was approximately $125 billion, which is insane, valuing each of the company's Bitcoins at roughly $374,000. MSTR's Valuation has Decoupled from Reality Bitcoin may not reach this lofty level for several years, potentially taking five years or longer. Some risks could cause BTC to drop drastically, and there is no guarantee that BTC will continue to increase perpetually. It's irrational for MSTR to be at such frothy levels, and what will happen to MSTR if Bitcoin shrinks in value, even if it is just another transitory decline? At $550, each of MSTR's BTCs is valued at around $374,000. At $400, each BTC is valued at around $272,000. This is where we are now, and it's still a very lofty valuation. There isn't a reason (in my view) why MSTR's Bitcoins should be valued at a 178% premium. Given the dynamic, a ""fair valuation"" with about a 25-50% premium may be around $175-225 for MSTR's stock price. This dynamic implies that MSTR could decline by about 50% from its current price of about $400 to reflect its valuation more accurately. It's Not Always Bullish Also, we're only discussing the Bullish case for Bitcoin. We should all consider the massive rally Bitcoin has had, tripling since about the start of the year. Therefore, we may see a substantial pullback soon. Bitcoin can have violent 20-30% corrections, which is considered normal in the crypto segment. When Bitcoin goes through another grueling pullback of 20-30% or greater, MSTR's stock could decline much more because its BTC premium could revert to the mean, possibly even inverting, as it did when I wrote my bullish article on MSTR early this year. If BTC dropped from roughly $100,000 to about $70,000, MSTR's Bitcoin stash would be worth around $23 billion. MSTR's premium could also revert to the mean as prices drop. If MSTR retains about a 20% premium, its BTC stash could be valued at around $27.6B. This dynamic implies a potential market cap of about $25B once we adjust for the company's software business and debt. This scenario suggests that MSTR's stock may decline to about $111 or roughly 80% from its recent peak if BTC declines by about 30% from the $100K level. MicroStrategy Keeps Selling Shares To Buy Bitcoin MSTR continuously prints more shares to buy more Bitcoins. While this approach makes sense in some instances, it could end badly, and there is perpetual dilution of MSTR's stock. Increasing Stock Dilution Share count increasing (ycharts.com) MSTR's share count increased drastically by about 44% over the last year. While issuing new shares and buying Bitcoins has paid off, it only works well when Bitcoin rises in value. This strategy could appear questionable when BTC corrects or goes through another bear market. In a crypto downturn, the increased debt and sharply higher share count will likely work against the company, potentially leading to significant declines and massive volatility in its share price. The Bottom Line: MSTR is Like A Bitcoin ETF MSTR is an exciting investment, but deep down, it remains a proxy for Bitcoin and is very much like a Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin ETFs do the same thing. They buy Bitcoins, offering investors exposure to the BTC space. There isn't a valid reason why MicroStrategy's Bitcoins should be worth 178% more than Grayscale's or anyone else's. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ETF ( GBTC ) owns 218,408.356 Bitcoins and maintains a tight ratio of about 1-1 premium-wise. While I like MSTR and its forward-looking approach, its stock is massively overbought here, setting an example of frothiness in the general crypto space. While I am not calling for a top in the market or the Bitcoin/crypto rally, MSTR is a wake-up call regarding what happens in a market when things heat up too much and too quickly. MSTR is an increased-risk stock and may continue exhibiting abnormally volatile behavior until the market can reach a more evident consensus regarding its valuation, which should be substantially lower than where it is now ($90 billion).",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739643-microstrategy-stock-potential-50-percent-drop-mstr-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36709144.jpeg

Recent analysis shows that a long-standing holder of Ethereum emerged to dump a large number of ETH tokens after the asset pumped by 10% today.Market watcher Lookonchain drew attention to this development in a recent disclosure , revealing that a whale was engaging in a continuous selling spree of ETH after being inactive for nearly a decade. Today alone, the whale cashed out nearly $4.5 million worth of ETH.Details of the ETH Tokens Under LiquidationNotably, the ETH tokens offloaded by this whale today in the $3,300 per token range were initially acquired at $6 per ETH back in May 2016. According to the report, this investor had committed $2.4 million to acquire 398,889 units of Ethereum at the time. However, eight years later, the value of this holding ballooned to a staggering $1.34 billion.This investor held the ETH across 28 addresses over the last eight years with no activity. He first became active again two weeks ago, on November 7. At that time, Ethereum’s market value was around $2,895. While significantly below its peak valuation, the whale began selling nonetheless, converting the tokens into USDC stablecoin.Today, the whale liquidated 13,623 ETH as the market value of ETH rose to $3,428. After eight rounds of sales over the past two weeks, the seasoned investor has profited over $224 million from Ethereum and still holds $1.1 billion worth of ETH tokens. Ethereum whale acquisition timeline and sales | Lookonchain Ethereum Price ReactsThis whale's selloff spree has contributed to the recent ETH pullback. After briefly reclaiming the $3,400 mark today, Ethereum’s price has already dipped by 5.4% to $3,250 at press time.This bearish reversal further adds to ongoing concerns among market participants about ETH’s performance, particularly as it continues to lag behind Bitcoin.https://twitter.com/3orovik/status/1859856362571956370Meanwhile, Bitcoin is in a price discovery phase in the $98K range, while Ethereum is 32% below its all-time high.

Pseudonymous analyst Petruschki called the attention of the broader crypto community to the development today in a tweet. The post, accompanied by data from Bloomberg Terminal, shows that the insurance giant acquired 149,455 units of MicroStrategy’s $2.6 billion convertible note offerings. https://twitter.com/petruschkii/status/1859881777940283522Allianz Investment Allianz’s acquisition represents 24.75% of the business intelligence firm’s convertible note offerings, due March 2031. Per Petruschki, Allianz allocated its investment across four sub-organizations, with Allianz Global Investors Luxembourg receiving 14.34% and AllianzbGlobal Investors GMBH receiving a smaller portion of 0.04%. The investment shows Allianz’s confidence in MicroStrategy’s operation, which revolves around Bitcoin. Other notable companies that also participated in the fundraiser include Calamos Partners, Context Capital Management, BlackRock, Franklin Resources, and Deutsche Bank. These companies acquired 37,329, 30,500, 5,925, 5,475, and 680 units of MicroStrategy’s 2031 notes, respectively. Hefty Bitcoin Acquisition Looms The $2.6 billion note offering follows MicroStrategy’s announcement of a $3 billion fundraiser following the offering of its 2029 convertible senior notes. MicroStrategy disclosed in a press release that it offered the 2029 notes at a 55% premium with a $672 implied strike price. Like previous convertible note offerings, MicroStrategy also aims to use the proceeds from its 2031 notes offering to purchase Bitcoin. With Bitcoin trading at $97,707, MicroStrategy can acquire 26,610 BTC using the $2.6 billion. The development is part of MicroStrategy’s commitment to increase its Bitcoin holdings through fundraising. As reported earlier, the company disclosed plans to raise $42 billion over the next three years to purchase Bitcoin. Despite being the largest corporate BTC holder, the company has focused on increasing its Bitcoin holdings. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries, MicroStrategy holds a total of 331,200 BTC, valued at $32.36 billion. Meanwhile, the development follows Bitcoin’s remarkable spike to $99,000. The premier crypto asset reached an all-time high of $99,502 earlier today before retracing below $98,000. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $97,707, up 0.67% over the past 24 hours. Despite the massive surge of Bitcoin’s price, MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) plunged by 27.5% yesterday from a high of $536.87 to $389.18.

Stellar has recently managed an impressive price explosion, drawing initiative from a broader market bullish momentum. For context, the high-ranking crypto asset has grown 210% and 105% in the monthly and weekly timeframe, extensively rewarding holders. XLM continued its bullish upsurge today, having grown over 20% in the past 24 hours. The asset’s high spirit has elated its community and drawn the attention of notable market speculators.Among others, analyst Charting Guy has provided an update on XLM’s recent price performance and an outlook of the asset’s ultimate target for the cycle. In a recent analysis, the notable commentator predicted an ambitious four-figure surge for the 18th-ranked cryptocurrency.Analyst Cites Multi-Year Pattern Set to Push Stellar to $3-$5In a Thursday tweet , Charting Guy drew his massive audience to a price structure on the XLM/USD 1M chart. The analyst stated that XLM had formed an Adam and Eve bullish pattern on the frame, set for an audacious upsurge. He noted that the pattern has been forming for seven years, specifically since 2017. Furthermore, the commentary claimed that an imminent breakout from the structure would propel Stellar to $3 to $5.Notably, a surge of that magnitude from XLM’s current price would account for a three to four-figure price uptick. Stellar would have to grow 930% and 1,617% to attain the $3 and $5 targets, respectively.Meanwhile, Charting Guy called for patience, insisting that the Stellar price would extensively reward resilient holders. He noted that the asset would end the cycle surging 50x from its bear market lows.Charting Guy Lauds XRPIn the Thursday commentary, the analyst also asserted that XRP would impress this cycle. While he did not present any price expectation in the analysis, he argued that the $80 million-caped crypto asset would “surprise many” in this bullish cycle.Meanwhile, XRP is among today's top gainers after an explosive push to a new multi-year high of $1.50 early Friday. The bullish uptick followed positive sentiments around the ecosystem after SEC chair Gary Gensler confirmed his resignation.Amidst the uptick, bullish assertions for XRP have emerged, with pro-crypto lawyer John Deaton predicting the coin will hit the psychological $100 billion market cap.

36707669,177976,1732284664,Sui Foundation Enters into Strategic Partnership with Franklin Templeton Digital Assets,"Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, November 22nd, 2024, Chainwire Sui drives blockchain innovation with support from global leader in asset management The Sui Foundation, the independent organization dedicated to the advancement and adoption of Sui , the innovative Layer 1 and smart contract platform, today announced a strategic partnership with Franklin Templeton Digital Assets. Franklin Templeton Digital Assets has been investing in the Sui ecosystem, and believes this strategic partnership will provide further benefit toward that effort by seeking value creation opportunities to allow builders of Sui blockchain-based solutions to deploy novel technologies leveraging the Sui blockchain protocol. “Sui was originally inspired by some of the challenges Franklin Templeton Digital Assets is helping to solve, particularly those that exist within decentralized finance today,” said Jameel Khalfan, Head of Ecosystem Development. “Their interest in Sui’s groundbreaking technology feels not only validating, but as though Sui has come full circle.” Franklin Templeton Digital Assets has been engaged for the past few years in building blockchain-based technology solutions, running node validators, and developing a wide range of investment strategies. The firm’s dedicated digital assets research team leverages fundamental “tokenomic” analysis, insights from an embedded data science team and deep industry connections to help inform product development and investment decisions. “For the past decade, blockchain technology has captured public attention from technologists and economists alike, but often runs up against technical limitations. We are excited for what the Sui team is building,” said Tony Pecore, SVP / Director of Digital Asset Management at Franklin Templeton. Examples of impressive projects being built in the Sui ecosystem include DeepBook on Sui , called DeFi’s answer to a central limit order book , or what exchanges use to facilitate buying and selling between traders by recording bids and offers, as well as Karrier One, the decentralized mobile carrier behind the Karrier One DePin network, and Ika, a parallel MPC network that enables seamless and secure cross-chain interactions. As a secure and scalable platform for building the future of intelligent assets, Sui has already become a premier destination for application builders in gaming, DeFi, memecoins, as well as real-world applications such as 3D printing and tokenized securities. Most recently, native USDC launched on Sui, enabling users to have direct access to one of the most widely used stablecoins globally while removing the added complexities and risks caused by bridged assets.

36707139,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-goes-up-when-cz-tweets-gm-a-theory,1732284440,Bitcoin goes up when CZ tweets ‘gm’: A theory,"Crypto has all sorts of stories we hope are really true. For one, bitcoin’s rising price is dictated by the world recognizing its raw disruptive power. No way that it’s a simple reflection of the global liquidity cycle . Nor does it serve as a basic multiplier on the performance of megacap tech stocks in the Nasdaq 100. Correlation be damned. Coincidence at best. Here’s another: The price of bitcoin goes up when Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao tweets “gm.” It’s something I covered a while back . But that was before Zhao finished up his four-month prison stint in September, which included a stay in a Long Beach halfway house. Zhao has since shared gms on X three times, and each one has preceded bitcoin pumping shortly after. All in all, bitcoin has rallied 82% since Zhao first tweeted following his release two months ago — from about $54,600 to as much as $99,456 this morning. Here’s (almost) every “gm” tweet from CZ mapped to the price of bitcoin Zhao has now tweeted “gm” on 11 different occasions across his full Twitter history, starting in March 2022. On all but two, the price of bitcoin has gone up in a significant way within days, retained that value and then some. That’s an 80% success rate. In fact, anyone who’d bought $1,000 worth of bitcoin alongside Zhao’s gms would’ve accumulated 0.317 BTC for $11,000. They’d now be able to cash out almost $31,480, which is a profit of 186%. Of course, correlation is not causation, and loads of stuff correlates with the price of bitcoin in any case. Here’s a similar, but opposite, story from a few years back: the S&P 500 crashes every time rapper Lil Yachty releases music . Still, for the superstitious, Zhao’s gms can’t hurt. It’s now been two weeks since his last. Sounds overdue. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

36706105,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654291,1732282235,"Bitcoin Officially In Overheated MVRV Zone, Rally End Near?","On-chain data shows Bitcoin has recently surpassed a level of the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio that has historically signaled overheated conditions. Bitcoin Has Surpassed Highest MVRV Deviation Pricing Band In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about how Bitcoin is looking right now from the perspective of a pricing model based on the MVRV Ratio. The MVRV Ratio is a popular BTC indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the market cap of the asset and its realized cap. The latter here is an on-chain capitalization model that, in short, tells us about the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have used to purchase their tokens. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could See A 53% Surge If This Resistance Breaks, Analyst Explains Since the MVRV Ratio compares this initial investment against the value that the investors are currently holding (that is, the market cap), it essentially provides information about the profitability of the addresses on the BTC network. Now, the pricing model that Glassnode has created doesn’t directly make use of the MVRV Ratio itself, but rather some standard deviations (SDs) from its mean. Below is the chart for this model shared by the analytics firm in the report. In this model, pricing levels correspond to BTC prices at which the MVRV Ratio would attain a value equal to a certain SD above or below its mean. At the +0.5 SD level, for instance, the MVRV Ratio is 0.5 SD greater than its mean value. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin price has broken past the highest of the pricing bands part of this model with its latest run. The level in question is the +1.0 SD, equivalent to $90,200 at the moment. Historically, BTC has tended to form tops when its price has exceeded this pricing band. The reason behind this is the fact that at such high levels of the MVRV Ratio, the investors carry a significant amount of profits, so a mass selloff with the motive of profit-taking can become a real possibility. Related Reading: XRP Binance Inflows Spike: What It Means For Price The last time that the cryptocurrency broke past this barrier was in the first quarter of this year. As is visible in the chart, it didn’t take the price long to top out back then. In full-blown bull markets in the past, however, Bitcoin has generally sustained inside this overheated territory for notable periods of time before finding a peak. An example of this trend is also highlighted in the chart; the first half 2021 bull run saw the coin stay in the zone for a few months thanks to high capital inflows. As such, it’s not necessary that BTC would immediately reach a cyclical top now that it has become overheated on this model. BTC Price Bitcoin had risen beyond the $98,000 level earlier in the past day, but it seems the coin has suffered a minor setback as it’s now back at $97,500.

It clinched another record on Thursday at $99,500, dipping below $99,000 heading into the U.S. open. BTC has risen 1% over the past 24 hours, while the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index gained over 7%. Most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) in the CD20 outperformed BTC, an early sign of capital rotation into smaller, riskier tokens as bitcoin's pace stalls. The $100,000 price point poses a significant resistance level, where investors might take profits on their investments. Still, there's a possibility of BTC rallying to $115,000 by Christmas, supported by broadening stablecoin supply, inflows into ETFs and bullish options positioning on BlackRock's spot BTC ETF (IBIT), 10x Research said in a Friday note.  Altcoins are taking their moment to shine as regulatory headwinds look poised to clear. Gary Gensler, the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to leave on Jan. 20, President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration date. Industry participants anticipate that the agency's new leadership will be more open to approving investment products for smaller tokens and allowing staking for ETFs. XRP led the rally, gaining 33% in 24 hours and Cardano's ADA rose over 15%. Solana's native token (SOL) hit an all-time high above $260, the first of the large-cap altcoins to surpass the 2021 market peaks.  Financial service giant Charles Schwab wants to directly offer crypto to users, its incoming CEO said,a sign that U.S. institutions are increasingly emboldened by an expected regulatory sea-change towards digital assets. ""We’ve been waiting on a change in the regulatory environment … and we’re confident that we think that will come in short order,"" Rick Wurster said in an interview. Also, digital asset manager Bitwise officially joined the race to launch a spot-based solana ETF in the U.S.  Chart of the Day  Traders are increasingly flocking to decentralized exchanges in anticipation of friendlier crypto regulatory policy under Donald Trump's presidency.  Volumes on major DEXs surged to a record $72.6 billion last week, with Solana-based Raydium alone accounting for a staggering 44% of the total.

36735109,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102490,1732281201,"Veteran Analyst Predicts Upcoming Cardano Surge, Says $10 Goal Becoming More Realistic","Veteran market analyst and Cardano bull Dan Gambardello provides an optimistic outlook on ADA’s potential price movements. He disclosed this on the back of the recent Cardano upsurge. According to him, the altcoin may be poised for a substantial surge, following a series of rapid gains. Gambardello noted that the $10 price goal is now becoming more realistic.Key Cardano Momentum Indicators Signal GrowthGambardello highlighted Cardano’s recent gains, noting a remarkable 168% increase over just 17 days. This rapid price movement has been supported by breakthroughs in major indicators, including the 20-week and 50-week moving averages. He emphasized that ADA’s current trajectory mirrors its behavior from November 2020. As a result, he suggests a cyclical pattern that could point to further growth.A major observation from Gambardello’s analysis is ADA’s recent monthly candle, which he described as erasing two and a half years of downward price action. With eight days remaining in the month, he stressed the importance of closing above the 50-month moving average, currently around $0.72. He also identified the $0.75-$0.76 range as a major zone on the weekly chart, signaling that the coming days could define ADA’s short-term direction .ADA’s $10 Goal Becoming Increasingly RealisticGambardello drew parallels between ADA’s current price action and its performance in previous market cycles. He noted that while ADA experienced consolidation around this stage in the last cycle, its current movement shows less cooling off. He suggested that a short-term pullback might sync with historical trends, allowing the market to regroup before a larger rally. Despite the possibility of short-term consolidation, Gambardello remains bullish on ADA’s long-term prospects. He projected a potential target of $1.05 in the near term, with a broader goal of $5 to $10 appearing increasingly realistic if the current momentum continues. However, he also cautioned investors to prepare for potential pullbacks, with support levels around $0.60-$0.65.Momentum Oscillators Also BullishThe market analyst then pointed to the stock RSI and MACD as major momentum oscillators that show increasing upward movement, reflecting a bullish market environment. The MACD histogram has moved above zero, and the RSI indicates substantial room for growth, both of which suggest that ADA has not yet reached its peak.Additionally, Gambardello highlighted the importance of market sentiment, noting that Cardano’s rapid movements could surprise many investors. He referenced recent bullish headlines surrounding Cardano, including developments in its ecosystem and broader market conditions, as factors that could accelerate its rise.Short-Term Cardano Targets and Long-Term VisionIn the short term, Gambardello identified $0.86 as a critical resistance level, with the potential for ADA to test the $1 mark in the near future. He noted that even a 16% increase could push ADA to this milestone within hours, given its historical volatility. However, he also warned of the possibility of consolidation, particularly if ADA falls back into the $0.60-$0.70 range.Looking ahead, Gambardello remains optimistic about Cardano’s long-term prospects. He encouraged investors to monitor broader market trends, including the performance of other cryptocurrencies like XRP, which has recently reached new highs.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/22/veteran-analyst-predicts-upcoming-cardano-surge-says-10-goal-becoming-more-realistic/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=veteran-analyst-predicts-upcoming-cardano-surge-says-10-goal-becoming-more-realistic,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36735107,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102476,1732279730,Jito Token Price Targets $5 as Market Cap Nears $500M,"Will the massive bullish engulfing candle prolong the uptrend in the Jito (JTO) token to create a new all-time high? Over the past 24 hours, the JTO token has surged nearly 20%, bringing its market capitalization closer to the $500 million mark. With this momentum, trading volume has soared by over 150%, reaching $293 million.As the Solana -based DeFi token gains traction, market sentiment is growing increasingly bullish. Analysts anticipate a potential price breakout to the $5 mark.Jito Price AnalysisLast night, Jito saw a sharp 23.35% price increase. This creates a massive bullish engulfing candle on the daily chart and crosses above the 50% Fibonacci level at $2.9387 and the 67.80% Fibonacci level at $3.2715. Jito Price Chart The bullish engulfing candle undermines the prevailing consolidation and exceeds the high supply pressure at the 61.80% Fibonacci level. This marks a change of character for the JTO price trend and increases the chances of a bullish trend continuation. However, the intraday candle shows a higher price rejection as it failed to reach the 78.60% Fibonacci level at $3.8113. The bullish failure resulted in a 24-hour high at $3.6815 and is currently trading at $3.4252. This bullish reversal drops the intraday gain to 1.57%. Despite this brief pullback, the broader trend remains bullish. Jito recently broke out of a descending triangle pattern and bounced off the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement. The post-retest rally has seen the 50-day and 200-day EMAs form a bullish gap following a recent golden crossover.In addition, the 100-day and 200-day EMAs are approaching a potential bullish crossover, further supporting the bullish outlook. The MACD has regained positive momentum, with the signal line and histograms confirming the shift from bearish to bullish.Jito Targets $5.92With the underlying dynamics turning bullish, a minor retest of the 61.80% Fibonacci level will likely propel the JTO price.

Institutional interest in Solana continues to grow as 21Shares and VanEck submit applications for Solana-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Cboe BZX Exchange. These filings align with a broader trend of increasing Solana ETF proposals, as Bitwise and Canary Capital have also taken similar steps. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart confirmed the filings in a post, highlighting the potential regulatory milestones ahead.https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1859716635772452876The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now actively engaging with issuers concerning the filed S-1 registration statements, marking progress in the approval process. As Eleanor Terrett reported , the SEC's interactions signal that exchanges may soon submit the required 19b-4 forms, which would initiate a 240-day review period. Approval remains contingent on the regulator's acknowledgment of these filings, but optimism is mounting among market observers.Regulatory Hurdles and Shifting DynamicsRegulatory discussions around Solana ETFs have intensified, with recent developments underscoring the complexity of the approval process. Earlier this year, some Solana ETF-related documents briefly disappeared from the Cboe website, raising concerns about procedural or compliance issues. However, the subsequent restoration of these filings provided reassurance to stakeholders who were monitoring the situation.This renewed focus on Solana ETFs coincides with shifting attitudes at the SEC, attributed to the anticipated pro-crypto stance of the incoming Donald Trump administration. These changes have fostered a more favorable outlook for ETF approvals, though challenges persist. The SEC's decision-making process will hinge on the 19b-4 filings and the subsequent 240-day review timeline.Brazil Sets Precedent for Solana ETFsGlobally, Brazil has emerged as a pioneer in launching Solana ETFs. In August 2024, the country approved two Solana ETFs, with the first, QSOL11, debuting at $10 per share on the B3 stock exchange. The ETF quickly gained traction, amassing over $2.75 million in trading volume on its first day. This success highlights the growing appeal of Solana-focused financial products and their potential to attract investor interest.If approved, these filings could significantly enhance Solana’s standing within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

36704850,https://blockworks.co/news/bitwise-ceo-solana-ncredible-emerging-asset,1732278386,Bitwise CEO: Solana an ‘incredible emerging asset and story’,"The crypto-focused asset manager Bitwise took an initial step toward launching a SOL ETF yesterday when it registered a statutory trust in Delaware. Bitwise becomes the fourth firm to show interest in a spot SOL ETF following earlier filings from VanEck , 21Shares and Canary Capital . I spoke with Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, who cast Solana as one of this crypto market cycle’s breakout successes that he thinks clients will want to access. The firm also recently filed for an XRP ETF . Bitwise’s filing is the latest indication that despite Solana’s lack of a regulated futures market in the US — long thought to be a requirement for spot crypto ETFs — a potentially more crypto-friendly Trump administration could get SOL ETFs across the finish line. The move comes as a FOX Business correspondent reported on social media that the SEC is more actively engaging with spot SOL ETF applicants. This is an about face from August, when The Block reported that the SEC rejected 19b-4 filings from the Cboe exchange, a key component in bringing about an agency decision. The obvious difference between now and then is the regulatory outlook, with SEC chair and crypto industry bogeyman Gary Gensler announcing his resignation from the agency. Horsley said the US presidential election was “absolutely relevant” in Bitwise’s decision to file for a SOL ETF, and now feels like a “constructive time” to engage with regulators after mulling over an application for around a year. Like competitors VanEck and 21Shares, Bitwise currently offers a Solana exchange-traded product in Europe — a product it gained access to by way of acquiring London-based ETC Group in August. The Solana ETP currently has $27 million in assets under management (AUM), which is dwarfed by some competitors — 21Shares’ Solana ETP holds nearly $1.4 billion, for instance. With a potential spot ETF, Bitwise and its competitors will seek to let US investors get exposure to SOL’s price action in a regulated wrapper. SOL has the chance to become the third crypto to get a US-traded ETF. The first, bitcoin, saw impressive inflows after launching while the second, ether, was much less in-demand . I asked Horsley if the uninspiring ether flows spelled trouble for SOL ETFs. He responded that ether ETFs faced an uphill battle since they launched over the summer (when asset managers are likely vacationing in the south of France), ether hasn’t had great price action this market cycle, and two crypto ETFs were a lot for slow-moving capital markets to absorb in a short time. Horsley was effusive in talking about Solana overall, calling SOL “an incredible emerging asset and story.” Later on, the Bitwise boss said many bitcoin ETF buyers may be looking for the “next big thing” in crypto. “For a lot of investors, the answer to that is Solana,” Horsley said.

36703783,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654299,1732276842,Bitcoin Hits S2F Threshold: Should You Hold Tight Or Take Profits?,"Bitcoin has so far continued to level up in terms of price performance, hitting new highs consistently for the past week. As a result of this, investors seem to be curious about whether it’s time to secure profits or stay bullish for the next leg of the cycle. A recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, known as Darkfost, sheds light on this and the current market sentiment, offering insights into potential strategies for navigating the current phase of Bitcoin’s cycle. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Bitcoin’s Hidden Price Zones: Key Levels Investors Need To Watch Time to Secure Profits? Darkfost’s observations center around the S2F reversion metric, a tool used to gauge market conditions and identify strategic moments for buying or selling Bitcoin. According to the analyst, this metric has reached 2.5, a historical indicator that signals the market is “heating up.” While this doesn’t suggest Bitcoin has reached its cycle peak, it indicates that the asset is entering a phase where profit-taking could be a wise strategy. Darkfost wrote: Currently, the S2F reversion has reached the 2.5 level, which historically suggests that starting to take some profits may be prudent. This doesn’t indicate we’ve reached the cycle’s top, but it means that the market is beginning to heat up but stay bull. Notably, the S2F (Stock-to-Flow) reversion metric is derived from Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model, which compares the asset’s existing supply with its annual production rate. This model has historically provided insights into Bitcoin’s valuation and potential price movements. The S2F reversion specifically measures deviations from this model, with higher levels typically indicating overbought conditions in the market. While the S2F metric for Bitcoin has now reached 2.5 level, Darkfost has pointed out when to take profit, noting: The next target for further profit-taking would likely be when the S2F reversion metric reaches the 3.0 level. Bitcoin Market Performance Bitcoin remains in a bullish trend. Earlier today, the asset reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $98,310 bringing its year-to-date price performance to over 160%. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns of Potential Bitcoin Market Shift as Exchange Reserves Decline However, at the time of writing, BTC has faced a little price correction from its peak as it trades for $97,236, down by 1.2% from its ATH but still up by 3.1% in the past day. Analysts say the asset is primed for a further rally to the six-figure price mark. Ali, one of the prominent crypto analysts in the space, for instance has recently highlighted that with Bitcoin breaking out of a bullish flag on the lower time frames, the asset could reach $100,000 as soon as today. #Bitcoin $BTC could reach $100,000 today as it appears to be breaking out of a bull flag on the lower timeframes. pic.twitter.com/UKKcXilHO4 — Ali (@ali_charts) November 21, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-hits-s2f-threshold-should-you-hold-tight-or-take-profits/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/36703783.jpeg

With Trump as the president-elect, regulatory headwinds are turning into tailwinds for the first time. We expect SAB to be repealed within Trump’s first quarter, if not by the SEC, then by Congress, spurring banks to announce crypto custody solutions. Bitcoin surged past all-time highs, buoyed by regulatory tailwinds from Trump's election. With growing interest, indicators suggest a bullish rally could continue. As we anticipated in our September Bitcoin ChainCheck , Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) price has surged upward in a high-volatility, post-election rally. Now in uncharted territory with no technical price resistance, we believe the next phase of the bull market is just beginning. This pattern mirrors what happened four years ago, when Bitcoin’s price doubled between the 2020 election and year-end, followed by an additional ~137% gain in 2021. With a transformative shift in government support for Bitcoin underway, investor interest is rising rapidly; we are receiving inbound calls at an accelerating pace as many investors find themselves under-allocated to the asset class. While we remain vigilant for signs of overheating, we reiterate our cycle price target of $180k / BTC as a number of key indicators we track continue to signal green for this rally. We also hosted an X (formerly Twitter) Spaces conversation with Senator Cynthia Lummis and Michael Saylor, exploring the timing and prospects for a U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and how more corporations are exploring adding Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries. Bitcoin’s Price Action Market sentiment: At $89,444, Bitcoin’s 7-day moving average (7 DMA) is at an all-time high. On election night, Tuesday, Nov 5th, Bitcoin surged ~9% to new all-time highs of ~$75k as Polymarket’s odds indicated Trump was winning the race, effectively front-running traditional news outlets’ election calls. This aligns with our previous observations of Bitcoin’s price surging when Trump’s odds improved on Polymarket, such as after his assassination attempt. Trump made Bitcoin and crypto central to his campaign, promising to end the SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement approach and to “make America the world capital for crypto and Bitcoin.” With Trump as the president-elect, regulatory headwinds are turning into tailwinds for the first time. Trump has already started appointing pro-crypto figures across the executive branch, while the Republican party now holds a unified government, increasing the likelihood of supportive legislation. Such legislation includes proposals like creating a national Bitcoin reserve—the odds of which are trading at 34% on Polymarket as of November 19th—and rewriting crypto market structure and stablecoin draft legislation. Under new leadership, we expect FIT21 will be rewritten in market- and privacy-friendly terms, while new stablecoin drafts will allow state-chartered banks to issue stablecoins without Fed approval. At a time when nations like BRICS are exploring alternatives like Bitcoin to bypass USD sanctions and currency manipulation, stablecoins offer a strategic opportunity to export the U.S. dollar globally. By removing regulatory hurdles and enabling state-chartered banks to issue stablecoins \, the U.S. can defend the dollar’s global influence and capitalize on crypto’s faster adoption in emerging markets, where financial services, hedges against local currency inflation, and DeFi are in high demand. We expect SAB to be repealed within Trump’s first quarter, if not by the SEC, then by Congress, spurring banks to announce crypto custody solutions. If Gary Gensler hasn’t already resigned, we anticipate Trump will follow through on his promise to replace the SEC chairman, favoring more crypto-friendly candidates and ending the agency’s notorious “regulation by enforcement” era. Additionally, we expect that in 2025, U.S. ETH ETFs will be amended to support staking, the SEC will accept the SOL ETF 19b-4, and in-kind creation and redemption will make these ETFs more tax-efficient and liquid. As Trump has previously acknowledged the shared energy-intensive nature of Bitcoin mining and AI, we anticipate energy deregulation—leading to cheaper, more abundant baseload power (e.g., nuclear)—will drive global leadership in energy, AI, and Bitcoin. In our view, this election marks a bullish turning point, reversing years of offshoring jobs and capital caused by previous hawkish leadership. By fostering entrepreneurial dynamism, the U.S. is poised to become a global leader in crypto innovation and employment, transforming crypto into a critical industry for domestic growth and a key export to emerging markets. Bitcoin dominance: The 7-day moving average of Bitcoin dominance, a measure of Bitcoin’s market cap relative to all crypto’s aggregate market cap, rose 2 points to 59% this month, reaching levels not seen since March 2021. While the uptrend from 40% in November 2022 may persist in the near term, we expect it to peak soon. In September, we noted that a Harris victory might favor Bitcoin dominance due to Bitcoin’s clearer regulatory status as a commodity. In contrast, Trump’s pro-crypto stance and growing cabinet will likely spur investment more broadly across the crypto space. With Bitcoin reaching new highs under a pro-innovation regulatory backdrop, wealth effects and regulatory de-risking are poised to attract both crypto-native capital and new institutional investment into DeFi, boosting returns in the long tail of the asset class. Regional trading: At first glance, traders during Asian market hours appeared to significantly increase their Bitcoin holdings this month, defying a years-long trend of being net sellers to European and US traders. However, Bitcoin’s price surge on election night occurred during Asian trading hours, likely driven by an unusually high proportion of US-based investors trading around the election. This exceptional event complicates attributing such price movements solely to regional dynamics. Consistent with historical behavior, traders during US and European hours continued accumulating BTC, sustaining the price performance trends observed in October.

Key Indicators To evaluate this bull market's potential upside and remaining duration, we examined key indicators that assess risk levels and potential peaks. This month, we begin our analysis with perpetual futures, or ""perps,"" where funding rates offer insight into market sentiment and help gauge the likelihood of an overheated market. Bitcoin Prices Appear Overheated When 30 Displaced Moving Average ((DMA)) Perp Funding Rates Exceed 10% for ~1-3 Months.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This month, we start by examining perpetual futures, or 'perps'—futures contracts where traders on the more popular side of the market pay a 'funding rate' to those on the opposite side. As markets skew, funding rates automatically rise to incentivize balance and compensate traders for directional risk. Thus, sustained high funding rates may be used to indicate an overheated market. Starting from April 2020, we analyzed periods when the 30-day moving average perpetual funding rate exceeded 10%. These periods averaged ~66 days with 17% returns from open to close, though individual durations varied significantly. Only one period—the single-day spike on June 18th, 2024—was tactical, reflecting a short-term reaction. All other instances lasted several weeks, highlighting structural bullish sentiment that often drives significant short- to medium-term gains.For example, the high funding rate period starting August 31st, 2021, lasted 23 days, followed by a 28-day cooling-off period before re-igniting for another 51 days on October 19th. Counting this brief gap, the combined duration of elevated funding rates in 2021 totaled 99 days. Similarly, the current high funding rate period, which began on November 12th, 2024, lasted 80 days before a 19-day pause, resuming for another 69 days. Combined, this period spans 168 days, comparable to the 186 days observed from November 11th, 2020, to May 21st, 2021. Notably, Bitcoin purchases made on days when funding rates exceeded 10% yielded higher average returns over 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day time frames compared to purchases on days with lower funding rates. However, the data also highlights a pattern of underperformance on longer time horizons. On average, purchases made on days when funding rates were above 10% began underperforming at the 180-day mark, with this trend becoming even more pronounced over 1-year and 2-year periods. As market cycles typically span about four years, this pattern suggests that sustained high funding rates often correspond with cycle tops and may serve as early indicators of an overheated market vulnerable to longer-term downside.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. As of November 11th, Bitcoin has entered a new phase where funding rates again exceed 10%. This shift points toward stronger short- to medium-term momentum, as historically, elevated funding rates have been linked to higher 30-, 60-, and 90-day returns, reflecting heightened bullish sentiment and demand. However, as funding rates remain elevated, we may move out of the phase where longer-term (1-2 year) returns are as favorable. Given the current pro-Bitcoin regulatory environment, we anticipate another period of high performance, reminiscent of the post-2020 election phase when sustained 10%+ funding rates drove a 260% gain over 186 days. With Bitcoin currently trading near $90k, our $180k price target remains plausible, reflecting a potential cycle return of ~1,000% from the cycle’s trough to peak.

Average BTC Returns Versus 30d Moving Average Relative Unrealized Profits (RUP) (11.13.16 - 11.13.24) RUP ) (11.13.16 - 11.13.24)""> Source: Glassnode as of 11/13/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Next, we look towards Relative Unrealized Profit (RUP), another metric useful for highlighting overheated Bitcoin markets. Relative Unrealized Profit (RUP) measures the proportion of Bitcoin’s market cap represented by unrealized gains—profits that exist on paper but have not yet been realized through selling. This metric rises when Bitcoin’s price exceeds the last acquisition price for most holders, reflecting optimism as a larger proportion of the market moves into profit. Historically, elevated 30-day moving average ((DMA)) RUP levels - especially above 0.60 and 0.70 - signal strong market sentiment and potential overheating. As illustrated by the red bands in the chart, RUP 30 DMAs above 0.70 often align with market tops, as the high proportion of unrealized profits triggers profit-taking. Conversely, RUP levels below 0.60 indicate more favorable conditions for long-term buying, with historical data showing higher 1- and 2-year returns for purchases below this threshold. Our analysis of the past two market cycles suggests that 30 DMA RUP levels between 0.60 and 0.70 tend to deliver the highest short- to medium-term returns (7-day to 180-day). This range ordinarily reflects the middle stages of a bull market, where optimism is rising but not yet excessive. In contrast, RUP >0.70 in aggregate consistently correlates with negative returns across all time frames, reinforcing it as a strong sell signal. As of November 13th, Bitcoin’s 30 DMA RUP is ~0.54, with daily values exceeding 0.60 since November 11th. According to our detailed table, risks progressively increase as RUP approaches 0.70, emphasizing the urgency of acting within the 0.60–0.70 range for short-term trades. However, if RUP’s 30 DMA rises closer to 0.70, it could signal an overheated market, advising caution for long-term positioning. Google Search Term Popularity for Crypto in the U.S. RUP ) (11.13.16 - 11.13.24)""> Source: Google Trends as of 11/18/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The popularity of ""crypto"" as a Google search term serves as a strong gauge of retail investor interest and market momentum. Historically, peaks in search interest have closely aligned with crypto market cap peaks. For example, all-time highs in search interest in May and November 2021 preceded significant market drawdowns: a two-month ~55% correction after the May peak and a ~12-month, ~75% bear market following the November peak. Currently, search term popularity sits at just 34% of its May 2021 peak and slightly below the 37% local peak observed in March 2024, when Bitcoin reached its highest price of this cycle. This relatively low level of search interest suggests that Bitcoin and the broader crypto markets have not yet entered speculative mania, leaving room for further growth before reaching the levels of mainstream attention typically associated with market tops. Coinbase App Store Rankings Source: Homepage | OpenBB as of 11/15/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Like Google ( GOOGL ) searches for “crypto,” Coinbase’s ( COIN ) App Store ranking is a strong indicator of retail interest in the space. After a lengthy bear market, Coinbase re-entered the top 50 apps on March 5th of this year, following a ~34% surge in Bitcoin price over nine days as Bitcoin retested its 2021 all-time high of ~$69k. Despite Bitcoin reaching new highs of ~$74k later that month, retail interest waned as price volatility declined into the summer doldrums and attention shifted to the presidential race. However, Bitcoin’s election-night breakout reignited retail interest, with Coinbase’s App Store rank jumping from #412 to #9 between November 5th and 14th. This surge in engagement helped drive prices higher, alongside record Bitcoin ETF inflows (see Chart of The Month). Bitcoin’s Network Activity, Adoption, and Fees Daily transactions: The 7-day moving average of daily transactions is ~543k, a -15% month-over-month decline. Despite the decline, activity remains strong at the 96th percentile of Bitcoin’s all-time history. Fewer transactions are being offset by larger payloads, as evidenced by rising transfer volumes. Ordinals inscriptions: Daily inscriptions (NFTs and meme coins on the Bitcoin blockchain) transactions increased 404% month-over-month, reflecting revitalized speculative enthusiasm likely stemming from price increases and regulatory tailwinds. Total transfer volume: Bitcoin transfer volume increased 118% month-over-month to a 7-day moving average of ~$85 billion. Average transaction fees: Bitcoin transaction fees fell 5% month-over-month to an average cost of $3.58, representing an average transaction fee of 0.0023% compared to the average transaction payload of ~$157k. Bitcoin Market Health and Profitability Percent of addresses in profit: With Bitcoin price trading at all-time highs, ~99% of all Bitcoin addresses are currently profitable. Net unrealized profit/loss: This ratio increased 21% percent to 0.61 over the past month, indicating a significant increase in the ratio between Relative Unrealized Profit and Relative Unrealized Loss. As an indicator of market sentiment, this ratio sits in the “Belief – Denial” range, corresponding to market cycle phases of accelerated expansion and contraction between cycle peaks and troughs.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Bitcoin Miners & Total Crypto Equities’ Market Cap Mining Difficulty (T): Bitcoin's block difficulty rose from 92 terahashes ((T)) to 102 T, reflecting miners expanding and upgrading their fleets. The Bitcoin network automatically adjusts difficulty every 2,016 blocks (~two weeks) to ensure blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes, increasing or decreasing the computational power needed to solve a block. Rising difficulty signals growing competition among miners and a robust, secure network. Total Daily BTC Miner Revenues: Increased 30% month-over-month, benefiting from Bitcoin’s rally but suffering from a 30% decline in BTC-denominated transaction fees. Transfer Volume from Miners to Exchanges: On Friday, November 18th, miners transferred ~$181 million in BTC to exchanges—50x the preceding 30 days’ average—driving the 7-day moving average up 803% month-over-month. This extreme move reflects the highest level since March, prior to Bitcoin’s latest halving. While persistently high levels of miner transfers to exchanges can signal an overheated market, this spike follows a summer of relatively low miner selling, suggesting profit-taking for operations and growth rather than a market peak. Total Crypto Equities’ Market Cap: The 30-day moving average of the MarketVector Digital Asset Equity Index (MVDAPP) rose 47% month-over-month, outperforming Bitcoin. Leading index components such as MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Bitcoin miners directly benefit from Bitcoin’s price appreciation through their holdings or mining operations. Meanwhile, companies like Coinbase capitalize on broader crypto market gains as rising prices drive expectations of increased trading fees and other revenue streams.

It's an investing moment to appreciate, no matter what side one takes in the crypto debate, and will surely be one of the topics discussed around tables this Thanksgiving. In overnight trading, BTC-USD advanced another 4% to reach a high of $99,512. Crypto catalysts: It's not only Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The crypto market as a whole has grown from about $2.5T to a $3.5T capitalization since Donald Trump's election win on Nov. 5. Trump has committed to fostering a favorable crypto environment and vowed to eliminate ""tough"" laws that stifle the industry, while promising to fight CBDCs and create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. In yet another win for crypto bulls, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler just announced his coming resignation , building on the ouster of Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, who was no friend of the sector as Chair of the Senate Banking Committee. That's not all. Crypto backer and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick has been nominated as Commerce Secretary, while reports suggest that Trump Media ( DJT ) is in talks to buy crypto trading platform Bakkt ( BKKT ). There has also been heavy buying from major Bitcoin holder MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), as well as the debut of options on Bitcoin exchange-traded funds like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( NASDAQ: IBIT ). It has all helped more institutional and retail investors come aboard the crypto ship, pushing up prices via direct buying and a broader range of ETFs. Crypto First: How much does politics play into crypto markets? Whether and how movement is correlated is always open to debate, with many investors (and voters) touting market performance under different administrations. Some may be surprised that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is up a whopping 395% from the time Biden got elected in 2020 until the vote in 2024, which would mean Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) would need to hit $345,000 under Trump (Round 2) to match that record. It may also come as a surprise how much Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) advanced during Trump's first term, when he called it a scam and was far from being a crypto advocate (Bitcoin would need to reach $1,400,000 to match that level).

The rules will apply to stablecoins and staking services and will end months of uncertainty for the industry.  The U.K. plans to draft a regulatory framework for the crypto industry by early next year, starting the process just as the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) laws kick in across the trading bloc.  ""We aim to engage firms on draft legal provisions for the crypto asset regime including stablecoins as early as possible next year,"" Economic Secretary Tulip Siddiq said at City & Financial Global’s Tokenisation Summit on Thursday, according to a copy of her speech obtained by CoinDesk.  The announcement follows months of uncertainty about the government's plans for the industry following its election. The previous Conservative government had put in place measures to treat crypto as a regulated activity in the Financial Services and Markets Act and had said that more rules would be coming for stablecoins and staking providers.  The new Labour government, elected in July, intends to implement its predecessor's crypto proposals on the creation of regulated activities, including operating a crypto trading platform and a market abuse regime, in full, Siddiq said. Under current plans, stablecoins will no longer fall under the U.K.'s payments regime. There will also be a carve out for staking to prevent it being treated like a collective investment scheme.  The European Union, the U.K.'s biggest trading partner, already has its crypto regulation in place. MiCA's rules on stablecoins took effect at the end of June and rest will kick in by the end of the year. Among them, the ability for crypto-asset service providers with a license in one member state being able to operate across the entire 27-nation bloc.

36701385,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654284,1732271401,"Ethereum Attempts Key Breakout: Analysts Set Next Target As ETH Reclaims $3,200","Ethereum (ETH) price is finally moving after a week of sideways movement. In the last hour, the second-largest crypto has seen a 5% surge to retest the key $3,200 level. Some market watchers believe ETH is about to move toward Q1 highs and kickstart the altseason. Related Reading: Crypto Community’s Revenge: Solana Memecoin Rug-Pulled By Gen Z Trader Hits $80 Million Market Cap Ethereum Retests Key Support Level Ethereum has been heavily criticized for its performance against Bitcoin (BTC), with investors worrying that ETH might not run to new highs this cycle. ETH’s price action has moved sideways while the flagship crypto continues its price discovery mode. On Thursday morning, BTC neared the $100,000 mark after hitting its latest all-time high (ATH) above $98,000, while ETH continued hovering in the mid-zone of its $3,000-$3,200 one-week price range. However, Ethereum has seen a remarkable 5% pump to trade above the $3,200 mark for the past hour. The second-largest crypto rose above $3,200 a week ago for the first time in over three months, hitting the $3,400 mark before retracing 5%. Over the past week, ETH attempted to reclaim the $3,200 resistance as support but failed twice to achieve it. Today, the cryptocurrency’s jump has propelled its price past the key resistance toward the mid-range of the $3,300 zone, reigniting a bullish sentiment toward Ethereum. Analyst Crypto Yapper asserted that the $3,200 is “the next big breakout” for Ethereum, as it has been a major rejection point for the last week. The analyst highlighted that after ETH’s consolidation, the next move was a retest of this level, which could see the crypto breakout toward the $3,500 mark if successfully reclaimed. However, failing to turn this resistance into support could likely see ETH’s price lose the $3,000-$3,100 support and move toward the $2,600 level, a major resistance before this month’s breakout, before attempting to reach $3,500. ETH’s Breakout To Kickstart The Altseason Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that ETH is breaking out of a short-term bull flag today. Per the post, the King of altcoins broke out of a three-week bull flag formation after surpassing $3,200. A confirmation of the breakout “would see ETH revisit the $3,700 above,” forecasted the analyst. Similarly, crypto analyst Zayk pointed out that the cryptocurrency displayed a two-week bullish pennant formation in the 4H timeframe. A successful breakout from the bullish pattern above the $3,200 mark could target a 15% rally to $3,700. Related Reading: Aptos Following SUI’s Lead? Analyst Says APT’s ‘Explosive Breakout’ Targets $20 Crypto trader Daan stated that investors should wait to see if Ethereum’s current momentum sustains. However, he considers that the next impulse for ETH/BTC is “likely to have some legs and go for some proper relief.” This run could see the ETH/BTC trading pair move back toward the 0.04 mark, which it traded at two weeks ago. This move would display a 20% surge from the current levels, which “should absolutely send the overall altcoin market and bring BTC Dominance down a decent amount.” As of this writing, the ETH’s price holds above $3,350, trading 2% below last week’s high.

Dubbed the Wisdomtree Physical XRP (XRPW), the product provides investors with secure and physically-backed exposure to the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. The asset management firm launched the product across three European exchanges, including Six Swiss Exchange, Euronext, and Deutsche Börse Xetra. Notably, the XRP ETP is fully backed by the XRPL native token and boasts a management expense ratio of 0.5%. According to an announcement , the XRP tokens backing the ETP are stored using a dual custody model featuring regulated custodians and cold storage. WisdomTree Crypto Offerings The company claimed that XRPW has the most competitive price offering for XRP exposure in Europe. With its launch, XRPW joins a portfolio of nine crypto ETPs WisdomTree offers. Some of the company’s crypto ETPs are tied to assets like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana.WisdomTree’s crypto ETPs are available in multiple European nations, including Poland, Spain, France, Ireland, Belgium, and Denmark. This large-scale availability increases the likelihood of XRPW launching on more European-based exchanges.Growing Institutional Interest in XRPThe recent development highlights the growing institutional interest in investment products tied to XRP. Several asset managers have recently shown interest in XRP.Interestingly, this trend has been observed in the United States, where XRP is embroiled in a lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple. Since last month, at least four asset managers have applied to launch investment products for XRP in the U.S.In particular, Bitwise submitted two applications, seeking to convert its multi-asset crypto fund containing XRP to an ETP and to launch an ETF exclusively linked to XRP.Grayscale made a similar move by applying to convert its XRP-related Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) to an ETF. This application comes after Grayscale re-introduced the XRP Trust, offering accredited investors direct exposure to XRP. Furthermore, Canary Capital and 21Shares submitted separate filings for XRP ETFs.Despite the fact that the Ripple lawsuit has moved to appeal, most fund managers, particularly Bitwise, are convinced the SEC will approve their applications.Also, Gary Gensler’s plans to resign as SEC chairman and the potential appointment of a pro-crypto chairperson further increase the odds for an XRP ETF launch.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/22/new-xrp-etp-goes-live-on-three-european-exchanges/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-xrp-etp-goes-live-on-three-european-exchanges,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Shiba Inu has been unusually calm since its previous rally earlier this month, which saw it surge to $0.00003031. However, the token could not continue its uptrend as it recently plunged below the $0.000025 level. Investors Desire Substantial Rally for SHIB Amid Ongoing Market Uptrend With other crypto assets, particularly Bitcoin, witnessing significant price spikes, several SHIB investors have been urging the team behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem to make efforts that could lead to a substantial rally for the token.These users have communicated their demands differently, with some explicitly asking Kusama to ‘send SHIB to the moon.’ This request signals their desire for a substantial price increase for Shiba Inu.Kusama Responds Interestingly, Kusama has recently responded to this, boasting about Shiba Inu’s success. The Shiba Inu lead emphasized that SHIB is the top ERC-20 token on Ethereum, being the most valuable ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain besides multi-chain stablecoins.https://twitter.com/ShytoshiKusama/status/1859748429821509717 His response aligns with sentiments shared by other team members, including developer Kaal Dhairya. As reported earlier, Dhairya highlighted SHIB as the number one ERC-20 token, excluding USDT and USDC, due to their availability on other blockchains outside Ethereum. Notable, Shiba Inu currently boasts a market cap of $14.67 billion, making it the 12th biggest token in the global crypto ranking and the largest in terms of ERC-20 tokens. Kusama's response indicates that SHIB had already witnessed resounding success despite prospects of more substantial growth.Current Status Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00002489, up 3.2% over the past 24 hours. Shiba Inu has been hovering around the $0.000025 territory over the past few days, with notable crypto expert Ali Martinez identifying a major resistance at this level. According to Martinez, about 40,150 addresses acquired 54.6 trillion SHIB for an average price of $0.000025, posing a major resistance to the token. As Shiba Inu attempts to surpass this level, some of these addresses would likely sell their holdings to secure profit, presenting a roadblock to any rally.However, if SHIB successfully overcomes this resistance, Martinez expects the token to soar to around $0.000039, citing the formation of a bull flag pattern on Shiba Inu’s chart.Investors Remain Bullish Meanwhile, although many investors are eager for this bullish move, it is worth mentioning that Shiba Inu remains one of the most successful cryptocurrencies in the market. Despite trading at an initial price of $0.000000000056 in August 2020, SHIB surged over 150 million percent to an ATH of $0.00008616. At press time, SHIB is down 71.11% from its ATH record set on October 28, 2021.Nonetheless, several community members are confident that Shiba Inu will register a new ATH this cycle, with some experts, like Javon Marks, setting a target of $0.0001553 for the token.",POSITIVE,ETH | SHIB,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/22/shiba-inu-lead-says-send-shib-to-the-moon-declares-were-still-1-eth-token/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-lead-says-send-shib-to-the-moon-declares-were-still-1-eth-token,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Solana’s native token price fell dramatically amid the FTX exchange’s unwinding, briefly trading in the single digits in late 2022. SOL then endured a sluggish 2023, as the SEC made the argument that SOL was a security, creating regulatory fears around the asset. But after a year of explosive growth, a resurgent Solana has climbed all the way back to become one of only a few major cryptoassets to set a price record this market cycle. Two years ago today, SOL was changing hands for a little under $12. The asset has appreciated by more than 2,000% since then. In recent weeks, user demand to include transactions in Solana blocks has skyrocketed amid explosive growth in the memecoin trading sector. Solana memecoins attached to AI agent projects began the uptick, and Donald Trump’s presidential election victory turbocharged it. Moonpay, a popular fiat to crypto on-ramp, said it saw an all-time record for Solana transactions on the platform Tuesday. Solana’s “real economic value” metric — which largely comprises extra money traders will pay to get transactions processed faster — totaled a record of over $100 million-worth last week, as measured by Blockworks Research. Source: Blockworks Research So-called REV can be thought of as a proxy for Solana blockspace demand, and the metric was under $10 million weekly just two months ago. Based on the past few days, Solana’s REV could approach $200 million this week. Further fueling the recent rise was speculation on Thursday that the chances of a SOL ETF being approved by the SEC under a Trump administration are higher than previously thought.

42435264,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kooxO,1732269600,"Binance Boosts Compliance Staff by 34% Year-Over-Year, Citing Industry’s ‘Rapid Maturation’","Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, says it expects to have 645 full-time compliance employees on staff by the end of the year — a 34% increase from last November — as it continues to rapidly build out its compliance department.  Including contractors, the crypto exchange already has over 1,000 employees focused on compliance, according to a Friday press statement from Binance.  Binance’s intense focus on regulatory compliance is relatively new for the crypto exchange, which just one year ago, agreed to pay a massive $4.3 billion fine to various U.S. regulators for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and knowingly allowing users to skirt international sanctions. As part of Binance’s settlement, founder and then-CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao agreed to step down as CEO and was sentenced to four months in prison for violating the BSA.  Richard Teng, a former regulator in Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, took the helm at Binance after Zhao’s departure. He’s since been very vocal about turning the exchange into a model of regulatory compliance — something he sees as necessary to ensure the company is sustainable for the long term.  Though Teng’s short tenure as CEO has certainly accelerated Binance’s compliance efforts, the exchange began making an effort to be more compliant with regulators well before Zhao stepped down in November 2023. Tigran Gambaryan, Binance’s head of financial crime compliance, left the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2021 to join the exchange. Noah Perlman, Binance’s chief compliance officer, started in January 2023. In 2023, Binance increased its compliance spend by 36%.  ""Our industry has entered a paradigm shift and new phase of maturation where regulatory compliance is an essential standard to user experience and protection, business success, and responsible growth,” Perlman said. “Binance has matured alongside regulators and other players throughout the years, and the continued growth of our compliance team and program are a testament to that and this shift in our industry which is set for strong sustainable growth.""  Some of Binance’s recent compliance hires include people with long careers in traditional finance and government.  Todd McElduff, Binance’s new enterprise compliance director, who will spearhead the exchange’s relationships with global law enforcement agencies, previously led the global financial crimes oversight division at PayPal. Before that, he was head of a financial crime division at Morgan Stanley.  Binance has also hired two special investigations specialists, Céline Inial for France and Caner Akyürek for Turkey, who both previously spent nearly 20 years in law enforcement in their respective countries.  “We are actively hiring for top compliance talent to strengthen our already industry-leading compliance program and team to match the demands of our rapidly maturing sector while global crypto adoption also grows rapidly,"" Perlman said. “We are proud of leading the industry’s standards in protecting users and the growth of our compliance team ensures we continue to protect our global user base of over 240 million.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/22/binance-boosts-compliance-staff-by-34-year-over-year-citing-industrys-rapid-maturation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35b9a576a0453d81486fbd8bba0817cbbb2bf5c7-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36700434,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-media-plans-crypto-platform-truthfi,1732269363,Trump Media Plans Crypto Platform TruthFi,"Trump Media & Technology Group is exploring a new crypto payment platform called TruthFi , according to a recent trademark filing. The application, submitted on Monday, outlines plans to offer services such as digital wallets, cryptocurrency payment processing, and digital asset trading. This marks an ambitious step for Trump Media, which initially focused on its social media platform, Truth Social, launched in 2022 after Donald Trump’s ban from major social networks. Expanding into crypto payments suggests the company aims to diversify its business model significantly. Following the announcement, Trump Media’s stock rose about 2%, reflecting growing investor interest. However, details about TruthFi remain limited, with no specific timeline or operational plans revealed. Reports indicate the company may need to acquire additional resources or collaborate with established firms to execute this initiative, given its current small workforce of under 40 employees. To bolster this venture, Trump Media is rumored to be in talks to acquire Bakkt, a business-to-business crypto trading platform. Since the discussions surfaced, Bakkt’s shares have surged by nearly 140%, signaling strong market interest in the potential partnership. The move aligns with President-elect Donald Trump’s broader pro-crypto agenda, which has gained momentum even before his term begins in January. He is also reportedly interviewing candidates for the first-ever crypto advisor role in the White House, signaling a shift in regulatory priorities. This follows the resignation of current SEC Chair Gary Gensler , whose departure is seen as a win for the crypto industry. The crypto market responded positively to these developments, with Bitcoin approaching its highest levels and the overall market cap reaching $3.4 trillion . Trump Media’s foray into the crypto sector, combined with Trump’s broader crypto-friendly policies, indicates a significant shift in the U.S. approach to digital assets. If TruthFi launches successfully, it could position Trump Media as a key player in the growing cryptocurrency landscape.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-media-plans-crypto-platform-truthfi,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36700434.jpeg

Known as “Crypto Dad” for his advocacy of blockchain and the Digital Dollar Project, Giancarlo is a favorite among cryptocurrency supporters. Since Trump’s election victory, Giancarlo has been a key member of the transition team, aligning with the president-elect’s pro-crypto agenda. Trump has promised to create a regulatory council for cryptocurrencies and to bring major changes to how the sector is governed, including replacing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler . Gensler, who faced criticism during his tenure, has already announced his resignation, set for January 2025. Giancarlo’s history as a vocal supporter of digital assets strengthens his candidacy. During his time at the CFTC from 2017 to 2019, he championed the recognition of Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities, not securities. He also played a major role in advocating for Ripple during its legal battles with the SEC. His efforts to promote blockchain innovation earned him widespread respect in the crypto community, with fans embracing his nickname “Crypto Dad.” If appointed, Giancarlo would oversee the first-ever White House advisory role for cryptocurrencies, part of Trump’s broader push to reform the crypto regulatory landscape. Trump’s plans include establishing a dedicated council for cryptocurrencies, which is expected to reshape policies and ease restrictions imposed during the Biden administration. Giancarlo’s candidacy has generated significant online support. His leadership at the Digital Dollar Project and his calls for a balanced regulatory framework position him as an ideal figure to lead the next phase of U.S. crypto policy. However, Trump is also considering other candidates, including David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc., and Brian Morgenstern, Riot Platforms’ public policy head. Both have been instrumental in fundraising efforts for Trump’s campaign. While Giancarlo remains a top contender, Trump’s decision will reflect his broader vision for the crypto industry. Advocates like Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, have emphasized the importance of appointing someone neutral with a deep understanding of crypto’s unique value. The potential appointment of a crypto czar underlines a significant policy shift. With Trump’s pro-crypto stance , this role could mark a turning point for the U.S. crypto industry, signaling a more supportive and innovative environment for digital assets.",POSITIVE,BTC,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | OTHER,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/chris-giancarlo-eyed-as-trump-s-crypto-czar,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36700336.jpeg

This event is expected to bring volatility, with the combined value of these contracts exceeding $3 billion . Bitcoin accounts for the majority, while Ethereum contributes a smaller, yet substantial, portion. Market sentiment shows mixed expectations. Bitcoin’s put-to-call ratio is above 1, signaling a bearish outlook with more traders betting on price drops. In contrast, Ethereum’s ratio is below 1, reflecting optimism and bullish bets. This difference suggests traders anticipate a short-term pullback for BTC but expect ETH to continue its recent upward momentum. Options trading metrics, like the ""maximum pain point,"" indicate where prices might gravitate during expiration. Bitcoin’s key level suggests potential downward pressure, while Ethereum’s indicates a likelihood of further price strength. According to analysts, these levels are crucial as they represent where the largest number of options could expire worthless, minimizing payouts for both buyers and sellers. Volatility is further fueled by rising interest in crypto markets, driven by increased capital inflows into exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) and broader optimism in the market. Analysts also note that Ethereum's implied volatility has spiked due to its recent rally, while Bitcoin's remains stable, reflecting a cautious market sentiment for BTC. While Bitcoin faces potential correction risks, analysts highlight that strong investor interest, particularly in ETFs, and a bullish market environment might help mitigate downward trends. For Ethereum, the rally appears supported by sustained optimism, with traders expecting its growth to continue in the near term. With such a high volume of contracts expiring today, both BTC and ETH are likely to experience fluctuations that could influence their short-term trajectories. Traders should remain cautious and monitor how these expirations impact market trends.

36699726,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654273,1732267842,Bitcoin ATH Drags ETH/BTC To Lowest Point In 3 Years – What’s Next For Ethereum?,"As Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $98,310 today, the ETH/BTC trading pair fell to multi-year lows, raising questions about the relative strength of Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest digital asset. What’s Causing Ethereum’s Underperformance Against Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s new ATH earlier today brings it within $2,000 of the coveted $100,000 mark. However, BTC’s sustained dominance has resulted in the underperformance of altcoins, particularly Ethereum, throughout the year. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Be Set To Explore New Highs As On-Chain Metrics Light Up The weekly chart below reveals that the ETH/BTC trading pair has dropped to a multi-year low of 0.0331 – a level last seen in March 2021. Since December 2021, the pair has failed to form a new higher high, reflecting a decline of over 60%. The pair’s losses have accelerated since July 2024, coinciding with Bitcoin’s price surge, driven by rising optimism over pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump’s prospects in the U.S. presidential election. The success of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also contributed to institutional preference for BTC over other cryptocurrencies. At present, BTC ETFs hold more than $100 billion in total net assets. While Ethereum ETFs have also received regulatory approval, they haven’t matched the success of their Bitcoin counterparts. For instance, US-based spot Ethereum ETFs have accumulated only $8.96 billion in total net assets so far. Additional factors, such as Bitcoin’s halving in April 2024 – reducing miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC—have further reinforced BTC’s supply scarcity narrative. In contrast, Ethereum’s rising issuance rate has led some experts to question its “ultrasound money” status. Additional factors such as Bitcoin halving in April – which slashed miner rewards from 6.250 BTC to 3.125 BTC – further reinforced the digital asset’s supply scarcity narrative. In contrast, Ethereum’s rising issuance rate has led some experts to question its “ultrasound money” status. When Will Ethereum Recover Losses Relative To BTC? With the ETH/BTC trading pair hitting new lows, Ethereum traders are eager to know when ETH might recover its losses. Several analysts have shared their views on X. Related Reading: Last Chance To Buy Ethereum? Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation Crypto analyst @CryptoGemRnld recently identified two strong support zones: a trendline support and a demand box zone. According to the analyst, since 2017, the ETH/BTC pair has historically rebounded from these levels, often leading to altcoin seasons. Similarly, seasoned trader Peter Brandt has suggested that the ETH/BTC ratio may be approaching its bottom. Brandt’s analysis predicts a potential reversal in December, with the trading pair beginning an upward trajectory. Supporting this outlook, recent data indicates that ETH may be undervalued at current prices. The limited inflow of ETH to exchanges, coupled with a lack of significant profit-taking, suggests that ETH bulls are holding out for further gains. Additionally, spot ETH ETFs have been recording significant inflows, attracting over $515 million between November 9 and November 15. At press time, ETH trades at $3,333, up 7.4% in the past 24 hours.

The company aims to finalize agreements with fund distributors by December and begin payouts early next year, marking a significant step in resolving the fallout from its collapse. John J. Ray III, CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX, said the company is ""working full steam ahead"" to return funds to customers as soon as possible. While the plan offers some hope for creditors , it has sparked frustration, as they are expected to recover only 10-25% of their losses . Despite these challenges, FTX is continuing efforts to recover more assets and maximize payouts. The reorganization plan comes amid ongoing legal battles involving FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, who is appealing his criminal conviction. His former co-founder, Gary Wang, avoided jail time after testifying extensively against him. Prosecutors are determined to finalize a conviction for Bankman-Fried, who remains a central figure in one of the most significant crypto scandals in history. Although regulatory scrutiny on crypto is expected to ease under a Trump administration, Bankman-Fried remains an exception due to the high-profile nature of his case. FTX has been active in its recovery efforts, settling lawsuits and filing new ones to reclaim lost funds. It recently resolved a dispute with ByBit to cut expenses and is exploring additional ways to recover assets. Meanwhile, the exchange’s FTT token has seen a surge in value, potentially boosting liquidity for reimbursements. Discontent among creditors remains high, as many feel the expected recoveries fall far short of their losses. However, FTX’s management insists it is doing everything possible to deliver maximum returns. The process of asset recovery and distribution continues to be a top priority for the company. With the reorganization plan moving forward, FTX is set to redirect proceeds to its former users and creditors, aiming to close one of the most controversial chapters in crypto history. The January 2025 timeline signals progress, but many challenges remain as the company works to rebuild trust and resolve disputes.",NEUTRAL,FTT,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | FTT,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ftx-to-begin-creditor-payouts-by-2025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png

36699307,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-plans-bitcoin-reserve-pro-crypto-council,1732266797,"Trump Plans Bitcoin Reserve, Pro-Crypto Council","President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to establish a “Crypto Advisory Council” is making waves in the financial world. According to a recent report from Reuters, this council will oversee crypto policy, collaborate with Congress on legislation, and work towards creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , an idea Trump championed during his campaign. The council would mark a significant step forward for the crypto sector, which has grown rapidly since Bitcoin's launch in 2008. Unlike traditional presidential advisory councils, this crypto-specific group could function under the White House’s National Economic Council or operate independently. Industry leaders like Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken, Circle, Paradigm, and Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, a16z, are reportedly vying for a seat on the council. Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, stressed the importance of forming this council quickly, saying it could be implemented immediately. The idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has already gained momentum at the state level. In Pennsylvania, Representative Mike Cabell recently proposed allocating a portion of the state’s $7 billion fund to Bitcoin, suggesting an initial exposure of 1% to 10%. Dennis Porter, founder of the Satoshi Act Fund, has been pushing similar legislation in Texas and believes other states will follow suit soon. Porter stated that up to 10 states could introduce similar plans this year, with Texas likely to lead the charge. Excitement about Trump’s pro-crypto stance has fueled optimism in the market. On November 21, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $99,100, reflecting growing investor confidence in the cryptocurrency's future role as a strategic asset. David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine and a key figure in Trump’s appearance at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, anticipates that top executives from major US crypto firms will play a prominent role in the council. Additionally, Trump’s administration is reportedly considering appointing a ""crypto czar"" to lead the initiative. Names like Heath Tarbert, former CFTC Chair; Brian Quintenz, an ex-CFTC Commissioner; and Christopher Giancarlo, a former SEC official, are being floated as potential candidates for the role. The proposed council would work with federal agencies like the SEC, CFTC , and Treasury to create consistent crypto regulations and streamline enforcement. Trump’s team also plans to undo President Joe Biden’s stringent enforcement actions, ensuring crypto companies maintain access to banking services and are positioned as a strategic economic asset . Executive orders are expected to play a significant role in these early moves. Despite the enthusiasm, critics are raising ethical concerns. Consumer advocacy groups warn that allowing the crypto industry significant influence in policymaking could lead to conflicts of interest. These concerns could slow the appointment process. However, industry leaders argue that experienced voices are necessary to shape effective regulations. Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley supports the move, saying it’s essential to involve experts who understand both the need for regulations and the strategic importance of the industry. Trump’s pro-crypto platform represents a shift in the government’s approach to the sector. With the potential establishment of a Bitcoin reserve, supportive policies, and a dedicated advisory council, his administration aims to integrate crypto into the US economy strategically while addressing regulatory challenges.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-plans-bitcoin-reserve-pro-crypto-council,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36699307.jpeg

On-chain activity shows large traders are participating in the price rally.  As bitcoin {{BTC}} gets closer to the $100,000 mark for the first time — it crossed $99,000 earlier Friday — capital is rotating into alternative cryptocurrencies, creating a buzz in the broader crypto market.  Amid the excitement, proof-of-stake smart-contract blockchain Cardano's native cryptocurrency ada {{ADA}} is having its moment. The token has surged 10% in the past 24 hours, trading at 90 cents early Friday on Coinbase and other exchanges. That's the highest price since May 2022, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  The price has risen 22% this week, taking the month-to-date gain to 152%. That has raised the token's market capitalization to $30.85 billion, making it the world's 10th-largest digital asset. In contrast, the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, has advanced 14% this week and 58% this month.  ADA's rally is accompanied by continued accumulation from whales, hefty crypto addresses with more than $10 million in the token. According to Tagus Capital, whales now hold over $12 billion in ADA.  On-chain activity confirms the involvement of whales and institutions, indicating that this rally could have staying power. Data from analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows the number of large transactions involving ADA has skyrocketed by 300% in two weeks.  It's a sign of ""heightened interest from institutional investors,"" Tagus Capital said in a daily newsletter, noting the spike in large transactions.

36698140,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654334,1732264249,Solana ETF Prospects Brighten Amid Productive SEC Talks With Issuers,"On Thursday, Fox reporter Eleanor Terret revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is actively engaging in discussions with several asset managers regarding the launch of the new spot Solana ETF market. The firms involved include VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise, all seeking to introduce products tied to the Solana price. SEC Progresses On Solana ETF Talks According to sources familiar with the matter cited by Terret, discussions between SEC staff and issuers are currently “progressing.” The SEC is reportedly reviewing S-1 filings, critical to the Solana ETF approval process. Terret further disclosed that there is growing optimism among stakeholders that the industry may soon see 19b4 filings from exchanges representing these issuers, a key step necessary to move forward with ETF listings. Related Reading: FTX Provides Details On $16 Billion Distribution Timeline For Customers And Creditors These 19b4 forms will be submitted by exchanges, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), on behalf of the issuers, seeking SEC approval to list the proposed ETFs. Upon receiving these filings, the SEC has a 240-day window to either approve or deny the products. To date, VanEck and 21Shares, who are also in the Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF markets approved by the agency earlier this year, along with Canary Capital, have submitted their S-1 filings for a Solana ETF, while Bitwise recently announced its intention to file earlier this week. However, Terret notes that the submission of 19b4 filings does not guarantee approval. Previous applications from VanEck and 21Shares faced setbacks, with their filings removed from the CBOE’s website in August. The reporter claimed that industry observers speculated that the regulatory agency, under its chairman Gary Gensler, was reluctant to approve such listings because of a tougher regulatory stance. Potential Shift In SEC Approach For 2025 Despite these previous setbacks, there is renewed optimism among investors following recent engagements with SEC staff and the anticipated pro-crypto policies of the incoming administration led by President-elect Donald Trump. This change in leadership is expected to foster a more favorable environment for cryptocurrency-related financial products, potentially paving the way for a Solana ETF approval in 2025. The anticipation around the Solana ETF gained additional traction after Gensler announced his departure from the SEC, confirming that January 20, 2025, will be his last day in office. This announcement follows months of speculation regarding his future, particularly as Donald Trump had previously indicated intentions to replace Gensler on his first day in office. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Neutral Netflow On Binance: What Does This Signal? Besides the Solana ETF, other cryptocurrency ETFs, including those for XRP and Hedera’s HBAR token, are also in the pipeline and may benefit from the evolving regulatory landscape. As the situation unfolds, the potential for a more accommodating regulatory approach could significantly reshape the cryptocurrency investment landscape in the United States, even more so with the plans Trump laid out during his presidential campaign.

Shiba Inu Is Currently Trying To Break Past The $0.000025 Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed a pattern that has been forming in the SHIB price recently. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that depicts the technical analysis (TA) pattern in question. As is visible in the graph, Shiba Inu has been consolidating inside a bull pennant recently. A pennant is a pattern that consists of three parts: a pole, a triangular consolidation channel, and the succeeding breakout. The ‘pole’ is made up of an initial sharp uptrend or downtrend in the coin’s price. In the context of the current topic, a bull pennant is of relevance, so the pole corresponds to the former type of trend. Related Reading: XRP Binance Inflows Spike: What It Means For Price The consolidation channel that succeeds the pole (the region that’s actually the ‘pennant’) has the asset move back and forth between two converging trendlines. The upper level of the channel generally provides resistance, while the lower one supports. A break out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. The likelihood of a breakout taking place naturally goes up the closer the asset gets to the apex of the pattern. From the chart, it’s apparent that Shiba Inu has been closing in on the converging point of this bull pennant recently, implying that a break could take place soon. In the scenario that this breakout happens towards the upside, it’s possible that the resulting uptrend would last for a similar length as the pole. If so, SHIB would rise to the $0.000037 mark. Such a rally would imply an increase of more than 53% from the current price of the meme coin. However, Shiba Inu must clear one major obstacle for the run to occur: the $0.000025 level. Not only does this level roughly coincide with the upper line of the pennant, it also hosts a major on-chain demand zone. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, around 40,000 addresses purchased a total of 54.6 trillion tokens of the asset around an average price of $0.000025. Investors who bought their coins around this level would naturally be holding them at a loss right now. As such, it’s possible that when the SHIB price retests this level, some of these holders will decide to sell, fearing that their holdings will dip into loss again in the future.

U.S. spot BTC ETFs have seen over $1 billion in net inflows, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading at $600 million.  While there's strong demand and bullish long-term bets with futures and options pricing above $100,000 into 2025, a short-term pullback near $100,000 is anticipated.  Bitcoin (BTC) prices are a little over 1% away from reaching a landmark $100,000, close to 15 years after the asset was first issued.  BTC prices spiked above $99,200 early Friday, dipping to $98,600 before holding over $99,000 in Asian afternoon hours. Overall market capitalization stands at a record $3.4 trillion, adding 4.5% in the past 24 hours, mainly on BTC’s 2% jump (BTC is over 56% of the total market cap).  Spot BTC exchange-traded funds offered in the U.S. recorded over $1 billion in net inflows, data shows, led by BlackRock’s IBIT at $600 million in purchases. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded over $300 million inflows, with no outflows from any of the eleven ETFs.  Strength in BTC is leading to a rotation in other major tokens ahead of the weekend, buoyed by renewed bullish hopes about a crypto-friendly Trump administration that takes office in January.  Ether (ETH) is up nearly 9% in the past 24 hours, boosting various indexes that track the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) sector by at least 8%. Notable Ethereum-based memecoins such as mog (MOG) and pepe (PEPE) are up as much as 27% on their tendency to act as beta bets on ETH’s growth.  Solana’s SOL is up 8%, setting fresh highs above $260 amid exchange-trading fund (ETF) filings in the U.S. and continual usage of the blockchain for speculative trading. Cardano’s ADA is up 12%, the second-most gains among majors after XRP.  Elsewhere, XRP zoomed 25%, leading growth among major tokens, as SEC chair Gary Gensler announced he would step down in January, clearing headwinds for tokens related to U.S. companies.  Traders expect BTC prices to continue holding strong in the short term.  “We continue to see strong demand for BTC alongside further easing of monetary policy by global central banks, BTC prices are likely to remain supported as we approach the end of the year,” traders at QCP Capital said in a Friday broadcast. “Throughout the week, our desk observed aggressive demand in March and June Calls, signaling investors' long-term bullish sentiment for next year.”  Deribit's BTC futures expiring in March, June and September 2025 trade above $100,000.

36694061,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654224,1732255230,"Bitcoin Breakout At $93,257 Barrier Fuels Bullish Optimism","Bitcoin has shattered expectations once again, surging past the critical $93,257 level in a display of unstoppable momentum. This breakout has ignited fresh waves of bullish optimism across the crypto market, as traders and investors anticipate greater gains. With market sentiment shifting and key indicators aligning, could this be the spark for Bitcoin’s next major rally? As optimism steadily increases in the market, the goal is to take a closer look at BTC’s impressive breakout above the $93,257 mark, analyze the positive sentiment driving its climb, and assess the potential for continued upward strength in the market. Bullish Indicators: What’s Fueling BTC’s Uptrend? Currently, on the 4-hour chart, BTC is sustaining its position after successfully surpassing the $93,257 mark while trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). By maintaining its position above this level and the 100-day SMA, BTC demonstrates resilience and capability for more price growth, targeting new highs. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a significant surge, climbing to 70% from its previous low of 56%, indicating strong bullish pressure for BTC. While this increase signals growing positive market sentiment, it raises concerns about the rally’s sustainability since a price correction could occur if profit-taking ensues. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Bullish Symmetrical Triangle, Crypto Analyst Says Next Stop Is $100,000 Bitcoin is showing strong positive movement after breaking past the $93,257 level, supported by a rise above the 100-day SMA, reflecting sustained bullish strength and potential for continued upward movement. The fact that BTC is consistently above the 100-day SMA suggests a solid trend and that the bulls are eager to push prices higher, possibly leading to an extended growth if pressure continues to build. Finally, the RSI on the daily chart is currently at 81%, well above the key 50% threshold, signaling a strong uptrend for Bitcoin. With the RSI at this level, it suggests that the upside pressure is likely to continue, which means that Bitcoin’s price could keep rising in the near term, as there are no signs of a reversal or decline. What The $93,257 Breakout Signals For Bitcoin The $93,257 breakout opens the door to a more optimistic future outlook for Bitcoin. This key resistance level has been decisively breached, suggesting that BTC may continue its upbeat momentum, potentially targeting higher price levels such as the $100,000 mark and beyond. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price on the Rise: Is There More Fuel for the Rally? However, careful monitoring is essential for any signs of resistance or market corrections that could hinder its ascent. Should such a scenario occur, Bitcoin’s price could begin to drop toward the $93,257 mark. A break below this level might trigger further declines, possibly testing additional support levels in the process.

The derivatives market surge, while driving prices higher, also increases volatility and the risk of liquidations. ETF inflows have approached $2 billion in three days, further boosting Bitcoin’s rally. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin prices continue to rise and print fresh highs as speculation continues to grow around a favorable outlook toward crypto from the incoming Trump administration. To further support these rumors, leaks about a potential White House crypto expert appointment and rumors of Trumps social media companies interest in a buyout of crypto trading firm Bakkt has aided the rally. The Crypto Fear and Greed index shows markets are in a period of extreme greed. Source: FinancialJuice The question is whether this will lead to pullback, or are we set for more gains in the coming weeks? Bitcoin’s Impressive Climb Amid Derivative Market Surge One big reason Bitcoin’s price has gone up is because institutional demand continues to rise. They’re putting a lot of money into Bitcoin, which makes it more trustworthy. For example, MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has bought a lot of Bitcoin and made a good profit as its value has increased. The way the market works also helps. More people are accepting Bitcoin as a real type of investment. Since there’s only a limited amount of Bitcoin available and more people want it, the price keeps going up on the basic rule of supply and demand. The derivatives market is a big factor in Bitcoin’s price increase. Bitcoin’s Open Interest, which shows how many contracts are active, has reached $63 billion. This is a record amount and is much higher than in 2021, when it was over $20 billion. Back then, Bitcoin’s price was at its highest, around $69,000. Source: CoinGlass The derivatives market surge does pose risks, however, with volatility expected to be higher and price swings a more common occurrence. This is simply down to leverage, with wild price swings likely to lead to an increase in liquidations. Over the past 24 hours, liquidations have totaled $450 million, with around 60% of this coming from short positions. The old adage rings true for Bitcoin as well, ""the trend is indeed your friend"". ETF Flows Surge Approaches $2 Billion in Three Days ETF flows have only increased over the past few days, with a total nearing $2 billion over the period November 18-20. Since November 1, Bitcoin ETFs have only experienced 5 days of outflows with 9 days of inflows. The rise in ETF adoption is likely to continue now given the hype around the Trump Presidency and his perceived pro crypto stance. If the ETF flows continue to grow, it is likely that we have not seen the last of the current Bitcoin rally. Source: CoinGlass Technical Analysis BTC/USD Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is on a tear this week in particular, having traded just below $90k handle on Monday. Since then, we have had 3 consecutive days of gains boosted by a combination of factors. The difficult part about the technical outlook is that there is no historical price action to base any analysis off. As we discussed earlier in the article, there is the risk of swings due to the surge in the derivatives market. Looking at the RSI, it has been in overbought territory since Bitcoin has breached $75k. Another sign that despite the RSI being in overbought territory, there is no guarantee that a pullback will materialize. For now, immediate support is at 95000, with a break lower eyeing a move toward 91804 and then the 90000 psychological level. Looking at a move to the upside and the 100000 mark could lead to some wild price swings, as market participants may eye some profit-taking as well. Beyond this at the moment, I will be keeping an eye on the round numbers/psychological numbers around 105000 and 110000.

DOGE is holding gains and eyeing more upsides above $0.400. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.3750 resistance level. The price is trading above the $0.3800 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $0.390 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could continue to rally if it clears the $0.400 and $0.4080 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes More Upsides Dogecoin price remained supported above the $0.350 level and recently started a fresh increase like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE was able to clear the $0.3650 and $0.3750 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4208 swing high to the $0.3652 low. Besides, there was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $0.390 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair.

Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.3950 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4208 swing high to the $0.3652 low. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.400 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.4080 level. A close above the $0.4080 resistance might send the price toward the $0.4200 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.4500 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.500. Are Dips Supported In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.400 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.3850 level. The next major support is near the $0.3750 level. The main support sits at $0.3550. If there is a downside break below the $0.3550 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.3200 level or even $0.300 in the near term.

This period of sideways movement has brought some volatility, but market conditions suggest DOT might be gearing up for its next major move. Investors watch the asset closely as it maintains a bullish structure despite temporary resistance near the $6 level. Related Reading: Last Chance To Buy Ethereum? Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared a technical analysis highlighting Polkadot’s resilience. According to Martinez, DOT is holding the firm above a critical demand zone, a sign that the asset could prepare for a significant breakout. His insights point to growing interest and optimism around Polkadot, fueled by its potential for another bullish leg. As one of the leading blockchain ecosystems with robust interoperability solutions, Polkadot continues to capture attention in a market increasingly favoring quality projects. The next few days will determine whether DOT can capitalize on its recent momentum to push past key resistance levels. All eyes remain on Polkadot’s price action as it tests investor confidence and market strength. If the anticipated surge materializes, DOT could soon reclaim higher ground, further solidifying its position in the crypto space. Polkadot Preparing For A Breakout Polkadot appears to be on the verge of a breakout as it maintains bullish momentum despite a recent pullback from the $6 resistance level. After a nearly 10% retrace, DOT has found stability above the critical $5.7 demand zone, signaling buyers are still firmly in control. This resilience has sparked optimism among investors and analysts, who view the current price action as a setup for a significant rally. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared his insights on X, pointing to Polkadot’s weekly price chart as evidence of its potential. According to Martinez, DOT has shown remarkable strength by holding above the $3.6 support level, which has served as a foundation for its recent recovery. He suggests that if the current momentum continues, DOT could climb to $11 in the coming weeks, representing a substantial gain from current levels. Martinez also emphasized that reaching and consolidating above the $11 mark could set the stage for an even bigger rally. He predicts that such a move would open the door for a surge to $22, aligning with broader bullish expectations for the altcoin market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Outweighs Supply As LTH Enter Active Distribution Phase With Polkadot’s fundamentals and technical setup aligning, all eyes are on its ability to overcome key resistance levels. If these predictions materialize, DOT could reestablish itself as a leading player in the crypto market. DOT Price Action: Technical Details Polkadot is trading at $5.6, maintaining its position above the critical 200-day Moving Average (MA) at $5.3. Breaking above this key indicator is a strong bullish signal, suggesting that DOT shows long-term strength as buyers gain control. The price is also holding firmly above the $5.6 demand level, which served as crucial support during June and July but was lost until its recent recovery. This regained demand level at $5.6 has reignited optimism among investors, as sustaining this zone could provide the foundation for further bullish momentum. If DOT manages to hold steady above this level in the coming days, a move toward new supply zones is likely, with the next target at approximately $6.5. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Charts Signal Potential Breakout The combination of breaking the 200-day MA and reclaiming a significant demand level demonstrates that DOT has the potential to maintain its current upward trajectory. However, sustained buying pressure will be necessary to overcome resistance and push toward higher targets. For now, all eyes remain on DOT’s ability to consolidate above $5.6, which will be a key indicator of whether it can continue climbing in the coming weeks.

XRP prices surged 25% in the past 24 hours, with most of the gains in early Asian hours Friday, amid widespread belief of a shift toward a crypto-friendly regulatory environment for U.S.-based companies.  XRP is closely-related to Ripple Labs, a high-profile payments company targeted by the SEC since 2020 on allegations of selling the token as a security to U.S. investors. Ripple fully cleared a long-drawn court case in 2024, bringing the spotlight back on XRP, a major token that commands a $77 billion market capitalization.  The token is now up 65% in the past 7 days and 150% in the past month, data shows, with CoinDesk market analysts targeting a short-term price level of $1.40.  Donald Trump's election victory in 2024 has been positively received by the crypto community due to his previously expressed pro-crypto sentiments. Investors are betting that his administration might foster policies conducive to the growth of the crypto industry.  There are also expectations of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. among some traders amid the perceived lenient regulatory environment.  This week, XRP, alongside dogecoin (DOGE), recorded significantly higher trading volumes than usual leader bitcoin on South Korean exchanges in a sign of frenzied demand.

The new record came two years after the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire FTX and Alameda Research, prominent backers of the Solana ecosystem. SOL plummeted to as low as $8 late in 2022 before beginning its turnaround to the current level.  Now having survived 2022's near-fatal blow, Solana is benefitting from multiple catalysts, including bustling meme coin trading and surging decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on the network, as well as increasing institutional interest.

BTC is showing positive signs and might soon hit the $100,000 milestone level. Bitcoin started a fresh increase above the $95,000 zone. The price is trading above $95,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $95,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $100,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Sets Another ATH Bitcoin price remained supported above the $92,000 level. BTC formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $95,000 level. It cleared the $96,500 level and traded to a new high at $98,999 before there was a pullback. There was a move below the $98,000 level. However, the price remained stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,500 swing low to the $98,990 high. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $95,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $91,500 swing low to the $98,990 high. Bitcoin price is now trading above $96,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $98,880 level. The first key resistance is near the $99,000 level. A clear move above the $99,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $100,000. A close above the $100,000 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $102,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $104,500 resistance level. Downside Correction In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $100,000 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $98,000 level. The first major support is near the $96,800 level. The next support is now near the $95,500 zone and the trend line. Any more losses might send the price toward the $92,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.

The analyst made this prediction based on previous election cycles, which were also bullish for the flagship crypto. Bitcoin Price To Reach $139,000 Based On Previous Election Cycles In an X post, TechDev predicted that the Bitcoin price could reach $139,000 in this bull run based on previous election cycles. In 2012, the Bitcoin price was $10 on election day, and a year later, BTC witnessed a 22.7x increase as it rallied to $245. In 2016, Bitcoin was $710 on election day and then recorded a 10.12x increase as it rallied to $7,200. Related Reading: $4,000 Solana Price Possible As SOL Breaks Out Of Massive Cup And Handle Pattern Meanwhile, in 2020, the Bitcoin price was at $13,588 on election day. Then, it witnessed a 4.51x increase and rallied to $61,300 a year later. The analyst highlighted a pattern whereby Bitcoin’s price replicates its increase from the previous cycle plus an additional 44.5% surge, which led to Bitcoin’s price a year after the US elections. Based on this, TechDev noted that the BTC price could reach $139,000 if it replicates its 4.51x increase from the previous cycle plus an additional 44.5% surge. Bitcoin was trading at $69,400 on the day of the US presidential elections earlier this month. The US presidential elections have historically been bullish for the BTC price as the flagship crypto always hits new highs after every election cycle. It is also worth mentioning that Bitcoin never dropped below its price on election day. Moreover, this election cycle looks more bullish than others, considering the US now has its first-ever pro-crypto president. The Bitcoin price has reacted positively to Donald Trump’s victory, continuing to pump since Trump defeated Kamala Harris. The flagship crypto is now eyeing the $100,000 milestone, having surged over 37% since the start of this month. What Happens Next When BTC Hits The $100,000 Milestone Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided insights into what could happen next after the BTC price hits the $100,000 milestone. In an X post, the analyst said that Bitcoin’s price action looks like it did in December 2020. He added that the Relative Strength Index is also nearly identical to the one in December 2020. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Test Of 0.786 Fibonacci Level, What Happens Next? If Bitcoin is to replicate the price action from that period, Martinez predicts that the Bitcoin price will rally to $108,000 after it hits $100,000 and then drop to $99,000 before it continues its uptrend and further rally to $135,000. Coincidentally, this comes close to TechDev’s target of $139,000 for Bitcoin. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $97,000, up over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Our strategy that tilted into Bitcoin mining companies underperformed, leading us to consolidate back to 100% Bitcoin according to plan. Past bull runs suggest buying the breakout is more favorable than waiting for a significant pullback, as the current price offers the next best profit-risk profile. Introduction In September 2024, we published 2 events consistent with a bull run toward a new ATH. Towards the end of October 2024, the 2 events finally occurred . Within a month of the occurrence, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rose from $70,000 to $95,000 (Fig 1), as we expected. The $90,000 resistance level (the yellow curve in Fig 1) is one of the most, if not the most, significant resistance levels for Bitcoin because it has guided the Bitcoin price over the past decade and had never been broken through. By referring to Fig 1, we can observe that this decade-old resistance level has guided all of Bitcoin's past all-time highs ('ATHs') since Bitcoin's inception. Back in 2021, it also served us well when we used it to predict the top of the 2020-2021 bull market and the sequence of events of the 2021-2022 bear market. Nevertheless, our findings suggested that the $90,000 resistance level is meant to be broken because it can only project up to a $90,000 Bitcoin. This week marks this historic moment where Bitcoin has likely broken through this decade-old resistance. Although Bitcoin is now entering uncharted territory where we can no longer rely on it to predict Bitcoin's new ATH, Bitcoin is finally free from being confined to a peak of $90,000, which now makes our $200,000 bull case price target more attainable. As Bitcoin realized our base case scenario, we'll follow up on our Bitcoin investment thesis and update our action plan in this article. Fig 1. Bitcoin's Decade-old Cycle is Broken (Author) Performance To Date Our previous article detailed our game plan to time the market and trade the Beta of Bitcoin mining companies. We first established our bullish thesis, which is that we expect Bitcoin to reach a new ATH as high as $200,000 based on the diminishing magnitude of each bull run over each halving cycle. After we waited for the 180-day wait period to lapse and for the Coppock curve to turn positive, we tilted 25% of our Bitcoin portfolio to 2 Bitcoin mining companies (CleanSpark ( CLSK ) and MARA Holdings ( MARA )) that we showed to have the best odds of beating the market. You can refer to our thesis below: MARA Holdings: A Market Mistake Where Investors Can Exploit CleanSpark Offers A Unique Proposition And Is Now Heading To Undervaluation At the time of writing, Bitcoin has fully reached our base case price target of $90,000, which is our minimum price target for Bitcoin. We also mentioned that it is within our plans to consolidate our crypto portfolio back to 100% Bitcoin once this price target is realized. If Bitcoin reaches $90,000 as we expect, we'll consolidate the portfolio back to 100% Bitcoin by selling all Bitcoin mining companies. This aligns with our stance to be conservative. So we've proceeded to liquidate our CLSK and MARA positions back into spot Bitcoin. The reason for this early consolidation is because MARA and CLSK may still be among the top 3 best-performing Bitcoin mining companies among the major Bitcoin miners (beaten only by Hut 8 ( HUT )), none outperformed Bitcoin as we hoped. We think that this could be a sign that the market no longer perceives Bitcoin mining companies as a levered Bitcoin play and is increasingly aware of their systematic and unsystematic downside risk . This implies that Bitcoin mining companies might now have a lower Beta to Bitcoin on the upside but a higher Beta on the downside. In other words, Bitcoin mining companies might appreciate less than Bitcoin in a Bitcoin bull run but decline more than Bitcoin in a Bitcoin bear market. Fig 2. Performance of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Mining Companies (YCharts) The Updated Thesis Now that Bitcoin has broken through the historic $90,000 resistance level, the most likely dilemma for investors and traders is whether to wait for a pullback (retest). The consensus to identify a support resistance ('SR') level is that the price has to bounce off a specific level at least twice. Once broken, a resistance will turn to support, and vice versa. Then, the common breakout trading strategy is to wait for a retest on the resistance-turned-support or the support-turned-resistance level to avoid a fakeout. While it may be a valid strategy, the retest might not come. The dilemma would be whether to enter at a less optimal price with a less attractive profit-loss ratio, or risk completely losing out on the opportunity. Whether to buy on a breakout or a retest depends on the trader's expectation of Bitcoin's probable price action. Our findings suggest buying on this breakout now is better than waiting for a retest. Firstly, we are still early in the Bitcoin bull market. Past halving cycles suggest that the minimum Bitcoin bull market spans one year and can extend for another six months starting from the halving event. This implies that the Bitcoin bull run is expected to last at least until April 2025 and up to October 2025. This is why we expected Bitcoin to hit our $100,000 base case price target with minimal headwinds before April 2025 . With 5 to 11 months left in this bull cycle, it is increasingly likely that Bitcoin will reach our bull case price target of $200,000. If one intends to wait for a retest, the 2 potential levels for retest are the $90,000 price level and the $73,000 price level (Fig 3) Therefore, it should be fine whether Bitcoin retests or not. Secondly, if Bitcoin were to pull back and retest significant support levels, it would unlikely reach the $73,000 support level (marked in yellow) based on the two past bull runs. Fig 3. 2 Major Support Level Marked in Yellow Horizontal Line (Author) (Author) As we've explained in our previous thesis, the first 6 months of a Bitcoin bull market involve reclaiming the existing ATH (Phase 1), while the subsequent 6 to 12 months involve reaching for new ATHs (Phase 2). Looking closer, the price coming out of Phase 1 usually marks the lowest price for Phase 2. Coming out of Phase 1 in the 2016-2020 cycle, Bitcoin continued its weekly pullback down to the nearest (and significant) $740 support level and has never retested that level again in Phase 2 (Fig 4). Fig 4. Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Bull Market in the 2016-2020 Cycle (Author) (Author) Coming out of Phase 2 in the 2020-2024 cycle, Bitcoin exited Phase 1 at $16,000 and continued to break the 2016-2020 cycle ATH ($20,000) without any significant pullback back into Phase 1 price levels (Fig 5). Fig 5. Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Bull Market in the 2020-2024 Cycle (Author) (Author) These observations suggest that it is unlikely for Bitcoin to revisit the $73,000 price level, even though it is a significant support level. It is more likely for Bitcoin to retest the $90,000 price level. However, a retest to the $90,000 support level now only represents a 3.6% drawdown, which is insignificant considering the potential bull case upside is a 120% return (if Bitcoin reaches $200,000 from the current $93,000 price). Conclusion Although our attempt to replicate our success via Bitcoin mining companies didn't yield the desired result, we are excited to see our base case scenario for Bitcoin realizing this early in the second phase of the 2024-2028 Halving Cycle. While we're still experimenting with magnifying Bitcoin returns via Bitcoin options contract (just like our past trade on BITO ), more work is required before we're comfortable with the added risk. In this article, our findings suggest that buying the breakout is more favorable than waiting for a significant pullback. Firstly, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will revisit the $73,000 support level while it remains close to the historic $90,000 support level. Secondly, Bitcoin is likely still in the early stages of a bull market, with more upside potential lasting anywhere from 5 to 11 months. If you've missed our previous entry to enter below $70,000, this might be the next best entry price before Bitcoin reaches new ATHs",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739472-bitcoin-buy-the-breakout?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36688055.jpeg

Related Reading: Upbit Listing Sends BONK Skyrocketing 67% For A Fresh ATH In Memecoin Mania Within a single week, these whales have amassed over $526 million in XRP, representing the most significant accumulation in nearly three years.

Whale Activity Indicates Assurance About 453 million XRP tokens, or a sizable portion of the asset’s circulating supply, are recent whale acquisitions. Crypto experts claim that this degree of hoarding usually indicates strong belief in XRP’s future performance. These big players reduce the supply on exchanges as they acquire tokens, and as a result raising demand and price. Notably, while large institutional buyers are buying a lot, smaller individual traders seem to be selling off their holdings.

This prediction comes after DOGE’s recent upswing in the last few weeks, suggesting a revival of its bullish momentum. Dogecoin Poised For Massive Gains In The Upcoming Weeks Amidst rising optimism in Dogecoin, Trader Tardigrade, a seasoned crypto expert and investor, has declared that the meme coin is gearing up for its next major run. Trader Tardigrade shared his prognosis on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, which has sparked excitement within the Dogecoin community. Related Reading: Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Test Of 0.786 Fibonacci Level, What Happens Next? The market expert claims DOGE is poised for its next bull run after citing key price patterns on its chart, particularly the Hidden Bullish Divergence formation, showing that the dog-themed meme coin is building strength for a potential breakout. A bullish hidden divergence formation typically happens within a downtrend, indicating a possible reversal or slowing of the downward momentum. Trader Tardigrade cited the key pattern in the 4-hour time frame of Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to the analyst, this crucial indicator offers early signs of a sustained upside trend in Dogecoin, allowing the digital asset to reach higher highs. As DOGE prepares for its next significant rally, Trader Tardigrade expects 2 major pumps to take place in the short term, demonstrating his robust confidence in the asset’s near-term prospects. His prognosis is based on historical price trends, whereby DOGE saw multiple rallies to its market top in the last two bull cycles. For the first pump, the expert has placed his next target at the $2 price level. Meanwhile, the second pump is set to trigger a move to the $20 threshold should history repeat itself. As a result, the analyst believes DOGE’s bull run has just started, noting it is still early to capitalize on the upswing. DOGE’s Market Top Coming Soon Than Expected? According to crypto analyst, Dima James Potts, Dogecoin’s market top appears to be much closer than widely expected. He made the claims after identifying price trends akin to previous cycle tops. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price To $1 Soon? Textbook Weekly Golden Cross Shows What’s Coming Next In the first and second cycles, DOGE witnessed a surge of 21,821% and 54,890%, respectively, from its bear market low to its peaks. Although the third cycle has not yet topped, should past events reoccur, James Potts expects DOGE to top around January 19, 2025, since the meme coin has often reached its peak in approximately 1446 days. DOGE’s market top for this cycle might be fast approaching, but the expert is confident that this cycle’s rally might be larger than the past occasions as the percentage gains in each previous cycle have risen, placing his target at $36. With indications of a resurgence in the general cryptocurrency landscape, Dogecoin might take advantage of the renewed momentum and see more increases in the upcoming days.
