42426204,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk3zh,1418683508,Court Strikes Down FTC Request for More Butterfly Labs Oversight,"A US District Court has denied a request filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that would have seen Butterfly Labs continue to operate only in a limited capacity under court direction.  Butterfly Labs  will now be allowed to resume business, though it will need to report information about its revived operations periodically to the court. However, it will notably no longer need a court-appointed FTC receiver for the duration of its ongoing litigation.  The FTC receiver had previously been granted the ability to manage and administer the company's finances, among other responsibilities.  Judge Brian C Wimes found that evidence submitted by the FTC to be ""insufficient"" at demonstrating that Butterfly Labs was likely to continue violating the law, and therefore needed additional oversight. The prosecution had argued that the company was likely to continue to misrepresent facts about its mining equipment if allowed to interact directly with consumers.  The ruling states:  ""Plaintiff moves for a preliminary injunction, asset freeze, appointment of a receiver and other equitable relief. Defendants oppose the motion. After reviewing the premises, the record, and the applicable law, the court denies plaintiff’s motion.""  Butterfly Labs has been under court-appointed receivership since it was shutdown by the FTC this September.  Court 'troubled' by some evidence  The court found that the FTC was unable to prove its assertion that Butterfly Labs misrepresented delivery dates, thereby misleading customers.  Further, it indicated that while it was to some extent compelled by the claims brought against Butterfly Labs, this sentiment was not enough to grant the motion requested by the prosecution.  The court filing reads:  ""Admittedly, the court is troubled by some of the evidence. But plaintiff has not established 'questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult, and doubtful as to make them fair ground for thorough investigation, study, deliberation and determination by [plaintiff] in the first instance and ultimately by the Court of Appeals.'""  Also dismissed were the agency's allegations that Butterfly Labs overstated the profitability of its mining equipment. Such accusations were largely based on the fact that the company made available a mining profitability calculator on its Facebook page.  The filing concluded that allegations of disingenuous marketing, including one in which a company representative described its products as ""money-making machines"" on an online forum, were not widely disseminated or made systematically to customers.  The ruling went on to take a broader look at Butterfly Labs' advertising practices:  ""Conversely, defendants offered evidence that it has published more than 400 [million] ad impressions through Google that advertise hashing speeds and power efficiency of BFL products but do not mention profitability. Based on all the evidence, the court finds plaintiff fails to establish a likelihood of success on this claim.""  End of the pre-order business model  Perhaps most notably, Butterfly Labs assured the court that it will not revert back to its previous pre-order business model when it resumes operations.  Many bitcoin mining hardware companies, including Butterfly Labs, relied on the pre-order business models to develop their products, a system that found them collecting funds for units sometimes months before their release. The model came under criticism as companies in the sector failed to deliver on projected dates.  Judge Wimes explained:  ""The pre-order business model has resulted in a class-action lawsuit, another civil lawsuit, the instant lawsuit and an investigation by the Kansas Attorney General. As a result of these lawsuits, defendants have lost employees, upset consumers, and suffered business delays. Based on the current evidence, there is not a clear showing at this time that Defendants intend to reactivate the pre-order business model sufficient to justify the requested relief.""  Butterfly Labs proposed to voluntarily submit monthly reports that will document progress made on its commitments.

42426211,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk4Dh,1418682017,"Crypto 2.0 Roundup: Ethereum's ÐΞVCON, Vizor's Virtual Reality and a Blockchain University","The crypto 2.0 community has continued its overall emphasis on consumer awareness in the past few weeks, with several high-profile events finding notable projects taking a pause from their ongoing experimentation to provide a greater depth of clarity to the public.  Further, there were signs that the part of the industry most aggressively building on bitcoin's vision is succeeding at this effort. At press time, decentralized social messaging platform Gems had raised more than $500,000 in its ongoing crowdsale, an event that suggests consumer interest in crypto 2.0 projects is high, even as questions about their viability linger.  Ethereum's show of strength  Following a few weeks of publicity that it felt may have led to consumer confusion about its brand and goals, the Ethereum team launched an impressive display of solidarity with its widely publicized first development symposium.  Held from 24th to 28th November, the event sought to showcase the strength of interest in the platform, which has been criticised in the wider bitcoin community for seeking to build its own blockchain in support of what developer Gav Would called its overall ""mission"" of decentralization.    ""Our mission is decentralization"" #DEVCON @gavofyork pic.twitter.com/TRYcpbAzXl      — ethereum (@ethereumproject) November 24, 2014    The event, backed by a strong social media presence on Twitter, Vine and YouTube, helped personalise a project that, like many of the more ambitions attempts in the bitcoin space, has sometimes seemed more theoretical than practical.    Meanwhile in Geneva, eight #Ethereum projects are taking shape! #TranspHackGVA pic.twitter.com/DeRE1VN577      — ethereum (@ethereumproject) November 26, 2014          This was succeeded partly through posts introducing the various Ethereum projects in development, including its Mist browser and Whisper secure messaging system.  Additional talks touched on Ethereum's security, blockchain theory and blockchain interoperability. A more detailed recap can be found on the project's official blog, while videos of complete sessions can be viewed on its official YouTube channel.    28/11/14 - #DEVCON 0 concludes - Thank you to all the attendees and everyone who made this unique event possible! pic.twitter.com/n1yDaJIdFt      — ethereum (@ethereumproject) November 29, 2014      2.0 goes to college  Following the start of its Gems crowdsale, decentralised application (DApp) platform Koinify has teamed with stealth crypto 2.0 supply chain project Skuchain to launch a developer education course that intends to involve a who's who of developers in the 2.0 space.  The free, three-month course, entitled Blockchain University, will kick off on 17th December with a panel moderated by author and cryptocurrency enthusiast Tim Swanson, and including Koinify CEO Tom Ding, Skuchain founder Sri Sriram and Chain CTO Ryan Smith.  The intent, Ding told CoinDesk, is to encourage developers to think about the larger applications of bitcoin's blockchain and alternative ledgers, without emphasizing their ability to function as a means of exchange.  ""People focus too much on the currency part – once they hear about bitcoin, they think the value is not stable, it's volatile, it's this and that, that doesn't matter,"" he said, adding:  ""You could throw away anything you don't like about cryptocurrency and you still have an impactful technology, more impactful than the currency itself.""  Ultimately, Ding hopes that Blockchain University will help emphasize this distinction, while encouraging developers to think about how ledger technology can be used to build ambitious products and services.  ""We wanted to be clear that it is a blockchain program, not bitcoin. I think there is a divergence that's happening,"" Sriram said. ""Blockchain is diverging from bitcoin proper.""  Swanson suggested that apart from ideology, however, the course will offer a unique experience to developers interested in the space.  ""If you're a software developer, even in Silicon Valley, there are few physical locations you can visit to get hands on practice and feedback in building decentralized applications,"" he said.  A virtual reality YouTube  Wendell Davis, CEO of bitcoin wallet startup Hive and creator of dogecoin's answer to Counterparty, Dogeparty, has released new details about his forthcoming crypto 2.0-powered virtual reality (VR) project Vizor in an interview with CoinDesk.  While he acknowledged the website might not be impressive without a virtual reality headset, Davis described Vizor as a ""YouTube for virtual reality"".  ""The same way that YouTube is a paradigm for watching and uploading videos, we're doing the same thing for VR, and the idea behind that is that browsers are just now starting to support VR headsets,"" Davis explained.  Davis asserted that what makes Vizor compelling is it is seeking to appeal to two underserved demographics: those who want to experience great virtual reality content and those that want to build it.  Included in Vizor will be tools that allow users to build VR experiences, including built-in marketplaces for existing content to be purchased and sold.  ""The idea is if you want to create an experience – say, you want to make a tunnel that you can go through and at the end you want a creature to be there – if you don't want to make it all from scratch, you can go to the Vizor store, pay with some amount of [the vizor token] to buy that tunnel or texture,"" he explained.  Davis described Vizor as a long-term passion project that builds off his existing love for flow-based programming and creating graphics.  The Vizor team intends to hold an upcoming presale and crowdsale, with the latter event taking place during January's Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Vizor hopes to garner $2m from both of its fundraising events.

42426208,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk49h,1418672158,Overstock's 2014 Bitcoin Sales Miss Projections at $3 Million,"International retail giant Overstock.com is reporting that it expects to complete $3m in total bitcoin sales for 2014.  The figures are notable given that the e-commerce company had issued a wide range of potential estimates for its first-year bitcoin sales over the course of the year. In March, CEO Patrick Byrne suggested Overstock was on pace to achieve $10m–$15m, or even $20m, in bitcoin sales.  Such estimates were also below the $5m Byrne said Overstock originally anticipated, though on par with those suggested by Overstock chairman of the board Jonathan Johnson in interviews.  Judd Bagley, director of communications and general manager of Overstock’s Cryptocurrencies Group, confirmed, however, that the company had expected a higher figure than $3m.  Bagley told CoinDesk:  ""While we’re still very happy with sales to customers paying with bitcoin, the numbers didn’t meet our initial expectations.""  The company reported that, in total, roughly 11,100 customers have so far paid with bitcoin at both its US and international websites.  The release comes amid a potentially bearish cycle for bitcoin news, with many major news outlets emphasizing the decline in bitcoin's value against the US dollar over 2014.  Overstock became one of the largest merchants to accept bitcoin in January of this year, a decision that provided widespread publicity for bitcoin and arguably sparked an uptick in interest among US and international merchants.  Sluggish international sales  Bagley indicated that Overstock attributed its total sales shortfall to its ""lower than expected international sales"". The company said international customers now spend ""a couple thousand dollars a week"", though it expected figures to be closer to the $7,000–$8,000 a week it sees from US shoppers.  However, Bagley stated that international shoppers tend to spend more than the average US customer.  ""Something interesting to note is that the average sales were unusually high, on the order of $400-$500 at times,"" he said. ""So the few people making purchases were buying a lot, but they were very few, like four or five a week internationally.""  Overstock did not provide exact details into how much of the $3m total could be attributed to international sales. Although, it confirmed in early March that it had generated $1m in sales over a roughly two-month period, a time during which bitcoin payments were available solely in the US.  Such estimates would suggest that bitcoin spending declined over the course of the year, with only an additional $2m in spending having been observed from US and international consumers over the remaining 10 months.  Bagley went on to confirm that US sales have tapered off since January, but that the company's sales have solidified at a steady rate.  ""It's been a very gradual decline,"" he said. ""It certainly has been a decline from the first month, but it's reached a steady state of $7,000–$8,000 a day. As I recall, it's been that way since about September.""  The company opened bitcoin payments to worldwide consumers in September, extending the option to 107 new markets via its international website O.co.  Powerful metrics  Though bitcoin sales were less impressive than hoped, Bagley stressed that Overstock has seen significant gains, and more importantly, no drawbacks, from its support of the bitcoin ecosystem.  In particular, Bagley emphasized that 50% of its bitcoin sales were completed by customers who had previously not shopped at Overstock.  ""It’s impossible to overstate how valuable this is to the company, given the high cost of new customer acquisition in this extremely competitive marketplace,"" Bagley said.  Bagley pinned the average cost industry-wide for e-commerce merchants to acquire a new customer at around $20, suggesting Overstock could have saved as much as $200,000, minus the cost of the initial integration, acquiring bitcoin customers.  The comments provide further evidence that one of bitcoin's most powerful value propositions currently may be the decrease in marketing costs the decision can provide.  A CoinDesk poll from April found that nearly 25% of all merchants cited the marketing opportunity presented by bitcoin as key to their decision to accept the digital currency.

42426202,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk3xh,1418654024,Chinese Official: Bitcoin Can 'Co-exist' with Fiat Currencies,"A former vice-governor of China's central bank, Wu Xiaoling, has said that digital currencies like bitcoin ""could co-exist with fiat currencies"".  Wu, who is currently a member of National People's Congress Standing Committee and a vice-chairperson of the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee, made her remarks as keynote speaker at the Sanya International Financial Forum, a mainstream event featuring political and business leaders.  The forum's guidebook contained the following introduction to its digital currency stream:    ""Does 'digital money' refer to a set of digits or a type of money? Neither is true, perhaps. It denotes an underlying technical protocol for virtual economic value exchanges in the digital world. An exploration of the future of digital money offers insight into the status quo of digital money development today. We need to view digital money as a technical framework with an open-minded and tolerant attitude.""            High-profile speaker  It was the first time digital currency played a formal role at a high-profile Chinese event, with its own dedicated track named ""Digital Currency: From Information Network to Value Network"".  The comments make Wu one of the highest-ranking Chinese officials to speak publicly about bitcoin, and likely the first to have discussed cryptocurrencies at length in such a setting.  In April, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan stated that the bank did not intend to 'ban' bitcoin. In other unconfirmed comments, Xu Nuojin, deputy head of the PBOC's Statistics and Analysis Department, described bitcoin as a ""kind of folk currency"".  Coexistence with fiat, but no threat  According to translations posted on Bitcoin Talk and news site Bitell, Wu claimed that currency competition was a normal and inevitable phenomenon in human society. Whether digital currencies have the ability to become widely-used mainly depends on their acceptance, the recognition of industry participants and stable pricing, she said.  Digital currencies, while they could co-exist with other forms of money, fiat currencies remain a key factor in national sovereignty and would not be challenged by any private money system.  Cryptocurrencies solve the trust issue, she added, but they miss a supply-demand mechanism that is required to meet economic demand and avoid price volatility.  Though Wu said digital currencies were unlikely to make effective daily currencies, she said they could function as financial products or assets and provide key technological benefits to users.  ""We can utilize the Internet's open-source distributed information technology to publicize digital currency, achieving value transmission in a low-cost and high-efficiency way.""  Like other government officials worldwide, Wu also referred to issues regarding international money transfers, including money laundering and traceability.  She said she foresees a future where multiple settlement protocols will co-exist, adding that using technology to build a decentralized value transfer network is an idea that deserves further consideration.  Chinese industry represented  Also invited to speak on digital currencies at the event was Leon Li, CEO of major Chinese trading platform Huobi.  Sharing facts and statistics from his time in the industry, Li took the opportunity to inform attendees of the history and nature of bitcoin, as well as the development and status quo of the bitcoin industry in China.  Bitcoin's history and development mirrored that of the early Internet, he said.  Comparing China's situation to that of the rest of the world, other countries have more user and merchant adoption, while mining and trading are strong in China.  Li examined the regulatory and tax approaches in the US, UK and Japan, compared to China. While the US has not explicitly prohibited banks from working with bitcoin businesses, many banks remain reluctant to work with them.  ""There are two possibilities for the future development of cryptocurrency: it will either become a lower-cost channel of value transfer within the existing centralized financial system, or it will evolve into an entirely new financial system altogether, one that is lower-cost, more efficient, decentralized, and operates in parallel with the traditional system.""  Private ownership and use of bitcoin is legal in all major countries, he noted, and there are no indications of prohibition coming.  https://twitter.com/huobicom/status/544011058046717952  China's bitcoin year  The news comes at the end of a year that has seen Chinese authorities show everything from veiled hostility to seeming indifference towards bitcoin, as its value continued to slide.  Earlier this year, Chinese banks closed accounts attached to bitcoin businesses, and in May exchanges withdrew at the last minute from the country's first bitcoin conference in Beijing. Local media were also conspicuously absent from the event.  Since then, however, exchanges have been allowed to operate as normal and expand into new areas without interference, while a second conference in Shanghai in September raised controversy only over its remote locationhttp://www.thecoinsman.com/2014/09/asia/china/shanghai-bitcoin-conference-awesome/.

42426198,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk3rh,1418646652,Safello Partners with UK Bank for Faster Payments,"Swedish-based bitcoin exchange Safello has announced a new banking partnership that will see it add local deposit options for UK customers.  The firm says the move opens up the ""underserved"" British market for bitcoin buying and could spark a ""wave of interest"" in the digital currency.  Thanks to its new arrangement, Safello now supports payment methods including CHAPS, BAC and Faster Payments – the latter of which is free for standard UK bank accounts and takes around two to three hours to transmit funds.  Frank Schuil, Safello's CEO and co-founder, told CoinDesk:  ""Hopefully we are at the start of wider bitcoin adoption in the UK ... There's no reason for your stubborn colleague or conservative friend to stay on the sidelines anymore. Get with times, Uncle Phil!""  While confirming that the company's new London-based partner is indeed a bank and not an intermediary financial services company, Schuil said he was not at liberty to divulge the name of the institution.  He did add, however, that the bank is aware that Safello operates in the bitcoin space.  The banking issue  The company's announcement is notable because most bitcoin startups in the UK are currently forced to bank elsewhere in the EU. This is due to the fact that financial institutions are reluctant to get involved with cryptocurrency businesses due to their perceived high-risk factor.  As a result, customers are being asked to deposit funds via either international bank wire or SEPA transfers, which take several days to arrive and often charge hefty fees.  When asked why banks are so reluctant to engage with bitcoin companies, Schuil said:  ""I would say that they are hesitant to potentially damage their relationship with other banks. They are dependent on each other and cannot isolate themselves.""  He continued: ""That is why challenger banks are often on the forefront of bitcoin adoption. Additionally, the perceived AML [anti-money laundering] risk often outweighs the perceived reward at this stage of the market.""  Notably, London-based cryptocurrency exchange Yacuna has just announced GBP deposits for UK customers via SOFORT Banking. While fast, this does incur a 4.9% fee.  Building trust  Schuil indicated the new relationship had come as the result of his company's consistent operation since its founding in 2013.  He said:  ""We had to build trust with our banking partners and this simply took time. However, the risk perception is changing and we expect other banks to follow suit in 2015. Bitcoin is no longer a fad.""  Since its formation, Safello has sealed two $600,000 and $250,000 funding rounds, and has been energetic in launching new features and forging new banking relationships.  In late spring, the company partnered with Jumio for instant ID verification and, three months later, launched a free bitcoin fundraising service for charities. Since then, the exchange has also announced a new social media-inspired bitcoin wallet.  With 87 banks supported in 11 countries, the firm also offers a variety of fast payment methods for customers across the region.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/15/safello-partners-with-uk-bank-for-faster-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e03aa97bc13895486e2aad1cfebe7a150a74b1c-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426193,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIk3hh,1418615024,Living Room of Satoshi Reopens After Sales Tax Issues,"Australian bitcoin bill payment processor Living Room of Satoshi (LRoS) has announced it is reopening for business, after closing in October citing the country's sales tax rules.  Founder Daniel Alexiuc said that, while the Australian Tax Office's imposition of the 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST) on customers acquiring bitcoin has not changed, ""the resourceful bitcoin industry has"".  ""There are now many more options for small Australian businesses like ours to buy and sell bitcoins internationally and locally in compliance with the tax ruling, which has allowed us to reopen for business.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, Alexiuc would not elaborate on exactly which services were offering the better deals, but recommended any of his fellow bitcoin businesspeople attend local meetups in their state/city to hear the latest information.  It is still not economically possible under the ATO's rules for GST-registered businesses for LRoS to continue buying all its bitcoins on the local market, he continued.  ""As a company, I am disappointed that we can't support most Australian exchanges at the moment, because there are some very talented and professional outfits operating here. However, we are able to sell our coins overseas, and to Australian exchanges that comply with the GST ruling for business customers.""  The industry's development, he said, means there are now more options to do this cheaply without needing to charge customers extra fees.  Free bitcoin bill payment service  Living Room of Satoshi  is a non-profit company and Alexiuc has provided the service for free since its launch last April, citing bitcoin promotion and user adoption as his main motivating force.  Focused entirely on bill payments and with Alexiuc as its only full-time employee, LRoS was previously processing AUD$20-25,000 ($16-20,000) worth of bill payments per week.  Being able to make mundane payments like utility and commercial bills is vital to bitcoin adoption among the general public, Alexiuc said, along with making it easier for people to receive their salaries in digital currency.  LRoS works by integrating with the popular national electronic payments network BPAY, which allows Australians to pay utility and commercial bills directly from bank accounts via phone or web.  Australian bitcoin exchange igot also allows customers to pay with BPAY from their accounts, while CoinJar uses it as a means for users to fund their accounts.  Double taxing  The ATO's sales tax ruling in August upset several stakeholders in the Australian bitcoin community, who say it unfairly ""double-taxes"" users: once to acquire the bitcoin and then again when purchasing everyday goods or services with it.  A campaign supported by local businesses is underway to petition the government to legislate on the matter, with some telling CoinDesk they are quietly confident the current Senate inquiry into digital currency will convince those in power to adopt a more favorable approach.  It is still infeasible for Australian businesses to use bitcoin as a day-to-day currency due to the ATO's stance, Alexiuc continued, though adding it was ""just an unfortunate side-effect of the existing legislation"".  ""I don't think the government is specifically interested in preventing bitcoin adoption in Australia. I was heartened by the questions asked during the recent Senate hearing, and impressed by the efforts of Ron Tucker and the ADCCA.""  The ATO's view  The ATO, for its part, acknowledged the provisional nature of its ruling in its own submission to the Senate inquiry, describing it as a ""preliminary view"" and a ""draft ruling"". The submission dated 26th November reads:  ""The ATO’s views were developed by an impartial consideration of the existing law and without any pre-conceived preference to whether bitcoin should, or should not, be regarded as money for tax purposes.""  Whether bitcoin or other crypto-currencies should be treated as ‘money’ or ‘currency’ is a question of government policy, it said.  BPAY widely used  Nationwide, the BPAY network processed over A$260bn ($218.5bn) in regular dollar payments last year, with the average payment being around A$785 ($647).  Living Room of Satoshi users, meanwhile, pay with bitcoin through the service by entering their BPAY reference code and bill amount, for which the service generates a unique payment address with QR code.  Alexiuc said he has some assistance with development and marketing, but that LRoS is ""always keen to explore partnerships or funding"".
