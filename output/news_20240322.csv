24688159,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599198,1711148459,"Dogecoin Whales Go On Massive Buying Spree, Here’s How Much They’ve Bought","Dogecoin has seen a steady rise in activity in the past two days to reverse the period of stagnancy recorded earlier in the week. At the time of writing, DOGE is up by 7% in the past 24 hours, reversing some of the corrections it has experienced in the past week. Turns out some Dogecoin whales have been going on a massive buying spree, as indicated by on-chain data. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this accumulation trend by tweeting that DOGE whales have bought over 25 million DOGE worth around $3.75 million in the past three days. Crypto Analyst Reveals Dogecoin Whale Accumulation According to the Santiment chart shared by Ali Martinez on social media, wallets holding between 10 million to 100 million DOGE tokens have now pushed their total balance to 15.63 billion DOGE after adding 25 million DOGE in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Don’t Panic: The Bitcoin Bull Market Is Far From Over, Quant Says Interestingly, the chart dynamics indicate this is a major change in sentiment from this cohort of traders, as their collective balance has been in a freefall since March 14th. #Dogecoin whales have bought 25 million $DOGE in the past 72 hours, worth around $3.75 million! pic.twitter.com/y1RnRffWhv — Ali (@ali_charts) March 21, 2024 Why Does This Matter? Crypto whales typically move the market. Increased buying or selloff from a few large traders could change the sentiment of other investors, and they could further cascade a price surge or decline. Notably, the chart shared by Martinez shows that the total balance of DOGE’s whale addresses has largely corresponded with the price increase. For example, the drop on March 14 in the total whale balance corresponded with a 33% drop in DOGE’s price from $0.1878 on March 14 to March 20. However, DOGE is now showing signs of recovery and is currently trading at $0.1629. While Dogecoin whales and FOMO buyers may temporarily push DOGE higher, its long term success really depends on whether it can transform from a memecoin into a widely used cryptocurrency. Dogecoin recently scored a point in its bid to achieve mainstream adoption. Coinbase, America’s biggest crypto exchange, revealed plans to introduce Dogecoin along with Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash to its regulated futures contract offerings. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals The Possibility Of Bitcoin Reaching $500,000 According to an earlier prediction by Ali Martinez, DOGE could reach the $1 mark in April. His prediction was based off of the crypto’s performance after similar breakouts in 2017 and 2021. A large part of this prediction coming to manifestation is a bullish sentiment from whale addresses, especially if they continue on an accumulation pattern. A key price level to watch is $0.20. If DOGE breaks above this resistance level, it could continue surging higher on buying momentum. But if it fails to break $0.20 and starts dropping again, it may indicate the rally is running out of steam.

24687754,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680027-avoid-bitcoin-miner-terawulf-inc?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1711147425,Avoid Bitcoin Miner TeraWulf Inc.,"Summary TeraWulf stock recently surged over 20% after highlighting its low-cost Bitcoin producer status and recent debt repayment. In its first two full years of operations, the Company generated more cash from issuing stock than it did from operating revenue. The Company has substantial credit facilities coming due in 2024. Introduction I saw the following news headline on Seeking Alpha and decided to look under the hood of TeraWulf Inc. ( WULF ) (the "" Company ""). TeraWulf stock surges over 20% after highlighting low-cost status, debt repayment"" While I am mildly bullish to neutral on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ("" Bitcoin "") in the short-term , I have been increasingly cautious on several crypto miners, as noted in a recent article about Bitfarms Ltd. ( BITF ). Having reviewed the Company's most recent financial reporting materials, I am BEARISH on the Company for several reasons: First, the Company's stock soared in 2023 as shown in the chart below, and, in my view, a repeat of 2023's stellar performance is not likely, particularly if the Company cannot show a GAAP profit (and it is not close to doing that). 2023 Stock Performance (Seeking Alpha) Second, the Bitcoin halving expected to occur in April (the "" Halving Event "") will cause Bitcoin's mining rewards to decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, and likely result in a lower hash rate, making it more difficult for the miners to generate revenue. Indeed, the Company's CEO has acknowledged that its cost to mine bitcoin will increase by more than 40% after the Halving Event: 'We estimate that our cost to mine a bitcoin is among the lowest compared to other publicly-listed bitcoin mining companies at approximately $25,000 per bitcoin before the halving and $37,000 after the halving,' said Chairman and CEO Paul Prager."" Third, the Company is heavily reliant on raising funds in the capital markets in order to fund operations. In this regard, the table below shows that common stock outstanding at the end of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, as per the Consolidated Statements of Stockholder Equity included in the recent 2023 10-K Annual Report filing (the "" 10K "") The chart also shows net proceeds from equity issuances and total annual revenue in the respective years. Overall, the shareholder dilution from 2021 to 2023 has been substantial. Moreover, the table below shows that, to date, stock issuances are more important than actual operating revenues in terms of financing the Company's operations. Date No. of Common Shares Outstanding Net Proceeds (thousands) Yearly Revenue (thousands) 12/31/2021 99,976,253 $104,376 $ 0* 12/31/2022 145,492,971 $47,326 $15,033 12/31/2023 276,733,329 $135,917 $69,229 Totals: $287,619 $84,262 *No revenue during start-up period of February 8, 2021 to December 31, 2021 Fourth, for all the talk of the Company being a low cost producer in its earnings-call presentation , the Company has an accumulated deficit of nearly $260 million and its Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2023 shows a net loss of $75 million. Fifth, and I saved the worst for last, the Company has $123 million of debt that needs to be paid off, renegotiated or refinanced in 2024. Even if the Company is able to stay afloat, it will be at the expense of shareholders in favor of the Company's creditors. And further material dilution of equity holders has already started to happen in the first quarter of 2024. According to the 10K: In February 2024, the Company repaid $40.0 million of the principal balance of the Term Loans, in the aggregate.... The Company does not indicate how much cash it has on its balance sheet after the payment. The 10K does give a hint as to how the payment was made, however: Additionally, if a business need requires its use, the Company has an active at-the-market sales agreement for sale of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $200.0 million (the “ATM Sales Agreement”), which had a remaining capacity of $81.2 million and $29.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and March 19, 2024 , respectively. The issuance of Common Stock under this agreement would be made pursuant to the Company’s effective registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration statement No. 333-262226). In short, it looks like the Company has issued an additional $51.4 million of common stock in the first quarter of 2024, further diluting shareholders in order to make a debt payment. *** For the foregoing reasons, the Company should be avoided. Brief Background Per its recent earnings press release, the Company ""owns and operates vertically integrated, environmentally clean bitcoin mining facilities in the United States . Led by an experienced group of energy entrepreneurs, the Company currently has two Bitcoin mining facilities: the wholly owned Lake Mariner facility in New York , and Nautilus Cryptomine facility in Pennsylvania , a joint venture with Cumulus Coin, LLC."" The mining operations of the Company generate Bitcoin ""powered by 95% zero carbon energy resources including nuclear, hydro, and solar with a goal of utilizing 100% zero-carbon energy."" The Company seeks to provide industry leading mining economics at scale. At the time of writing, the Company had a market capitalization above $500 million and was trading at $2.54. Stock Performance The Company began trading on the Nasdaq on December 14, 2021 under the symbol WULF. Since that time, as shown in the chart below, the Company's stock price has 1) been on a steep downward trajectory, losing more than 90% of its value, and 2) in a material fashion, trailed both the S&P 500 and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) (the "" Bitcoin Miners ETF ""). Seeking Alpha While the Company has not performed well, its stock price recently jumped after its most recent earning announcement. Below, I briefly review some highlights of those earnings. Q4 2023 Earnings On March 19, 2024, the Company reported financial performance for the quarter ended, and year ended, December 31, 2023. A few highlights from the Company's press release are included below [all data from such press release]: Revenue increased 360% to $69.2 million in 2023, as compared to $15.0 million in fiscal 2022 driven by increased bitcoin production and higher average realized bitcoin prices during the period. Reported cash and cash equivalents of $54.4 million as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $1.3 million at fiscal year-end 2022. Self-mined bitcoin production increased 550% to 3,407 in 2023, as compared to 524 in fiscal 2022. On the plus side, it is good to see the Company's production of Bitcoin has increased materially year over year and debt is going down. However, per Note 9 of the Company's audited financial statements, the Company has nearly $123.5 million of debt due in 2024. Review of Balance Sheet Selected Balance Sheet Items (in thousands) Dec. 31, 2023 Dec. 31., 2022 Dec.31, 2021 Cash 54,439 1,279 43,448 Digital Currency 1,801 183 ----- Total Assets $378,106 $ 317,687 $264,911 Long-Term Debt (LTD) 56 72,967 94,627 LTD due within 1 year 123,465 51,938 ----- Total Liabilities $155,617 $199,933 $141,732 Accumulated Deficit (259,895) (186,474) (95,683) Total Equity $222,489 $117,754 $123,179 Source: Company Website ( Financial Information ) A couple of things stand out in looking at three years of balance sheet figures. First, total cash increased by approximately $11 million from 2021 to 2023. In context, however, the company raised over $180 million in equity proceeds during the period as shown in the earlier table. Second, while the Company has $123 million of long-term debt due in 2024, it has generated less than $90 million of revenue in its first two full years of operations. Even with the $40 million debt pay down in the first quarter of 2024, the Company has a lot of wood to chop to pay down that debt. If the Bitcoin price falls in a material way, the Company will really be in a bind. Third, the Accumulated Deficit (representing the cumulative amount of net losses the Company has generated since its formation) of nearly $260 million now exceeds Total Equity. Needless to say, it is important for the Company to start generating some profits and reducing the deficit out of free cash flow. Risks and Conclusion The risks of investing in the Company are included in the linked 10K above. Particular concerns about investing in the Company, among others, are as follows: First, the Company has not been able to generate net income. Second, the Company is dependent on equity and debt issuances to finance operations. Third, the Halving Event will cause a material increase in the Company's operating expenses (i.e., costs of producing Bitcoin). Fourth, there are significant risks that the Company will not be able to satisfy its debt obligations due in 2024, or if it does satisfy them, it will be to the detriment of the common shareholders via (further) material dilution, a process which has already started. *** For the reasons set forth in this article above, the Company should be avoided for the foreseeable future. The Company is currently being run for the benefit of its creditors. Given the Bitcoin bull market, however, I would not short it (at this time), unless it was part of a pair trade.

Notable highlights include the launch of regulated digital banking accounts, integration with the Venus decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, the Floki debit card’s introduction, and the Valhalla mainnet’s upcoming release. Floki Inu Aims To ‘Bank The Unbanked’ Floki Inu plans to introduce regulated digital banking accounts, enabling users to create and fund bank accounts using FLOKI tokens. Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Jumps 180% In 4 Weeks: Just The Beginning? In partnership with an unnamed licensed fintech company operating in key jurisdictions such as Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE, these accounts will support SWIFT payments and SEPA IBANs. In addition, the upcoming launch of Floki Debit Cards will allow users to link their digital bank accounts to debit cards, providing a convenient and secure way to spend their FLOKI tokens in traditional currencies such as Euro (EUR) and US dollars (USD). According to the proposal, the initiative aims to “bank the unbanked” by enabling a broader user base to access traditional banking services using their FLOKI tokens while increasing the utility and adoption of cryptocurrency. Pending governance approval, Floki Inu also seeks to list its native token, FLOKI, on the Venus Core Pool. This integration aims to unlock deeper liquidity, comparable to established blue-chip cryptocurrencies and allow FLOKI holders to use their tokens as collateral to borrow various assets such as Maker (DAI), Circle’s USDC stablecoin, Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH). By integrating Venus Markets directly into Floki’s user interface (UI), the protocol states that users will have frictionless access to the liquidity provided by the platform, further integrating Floki into the decentralized finance ecosystem. FLOKI-Powered Trading Bot And Valhalla Mainnet Launch Floki Inu plans to introduce a cross-chain Telegram and Discord trading bot powered by the FLOKI token. This bot will allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on leading blockchain networks. Specifically, 50% of the fees generated will be used to buy and burn FLOKI tokens, increasing their utility and contributing to a deflationary mechanism.

The shares were purchased in 2021 for $500 million – but are worth $1 billion at today’s valuation.  FTX’s slice of artificial intelligence firm Anthropic is up for sale, and global investors including sovereign wealth funds are lining up for the chance to purchase the shares, according to a new report from CNBC citing unnamed sources.  The sale is expected to wrap up in the next few weeks, according to the report, and proceeds will be used to pay back FTX investors.  Lawyers for FTX said in January the defunct exchange expects to be able to pay back customers 100% of the value of their holdings at the time of the bankruptcy – a fact disgraced founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has attempted to use to his advantage in advocating for a significantly shorter sentence than the 40-50 years recommended by federal prosecutors.  FTX and Alameda jointly purchased an 8% stake in Open-AI competitor Anthropic for $500 million in 2021. Today, those shares are reportedly worth an estimated $1 billion. The class B shares do not come with voting rights.  The FTX estate got the go-ahead from a New York bankruptcy court to sell the shares in February. An earlier attempt to sell the shares in June 2023 ultimately fell through after months of due diligence stalled.  According to CNBC’s report, Anthropic will not consider allowing any investment from Saudi Arabia due to national security concerns, but has not ruled out investments from other sovereign wealth funds including the United Arab Emirates’ Mubadala.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/22/bankers-are-lining-up-buyers-for-ftxs-8-stake-in-ai-startup-anthropic-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd5aad5c861b8701f4209faa0070c62206afcd17-1919x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, not all of their investments result in massive gains. A recent report by Lookonchain revealed that a trader lost more than $1 million within three days. Related Reading: Leading The Pack: Solana Captures Nearly 50% Of Global Crypto Attention When Buying High Doesn’t Result In Selling Higher According to the blockchain research platform Lookonchain, a crypto trader lost 6,039 SOL over the last three days after FOMO-buying a memecoin. Per the report, the trader bought Slerf (SLERF) for 4,958 SOL, worth around $1 million. The different transactions occurred when the price hovered between $0.8 and $1.4 on its launch day. A couple of hours later, the trader sold its SLERF tokens, losing 2,793 SOL after the token’s price plunged to the $0.4-$0.6 range, for a loss of $564,000. This #FOMO buyer sold all $SLERF at a loss of 6,039 $SOL($1.15M) again. Then he deposited all his $SOL to #Binance and may no longer trade #MEMEcoins.https://t.co/ubHQwYoM54 pic.twitter.com/RIJkDF103C — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 21, 2024 Seemingly, the fear of missing out made the trader buy SLERF a second time when the price neared its all-time high (ATH) of $1.30. The address bought 3 million Slerf at $1.17, spending 19,133 SOL, worth around $3.152 million. At the time, the pending question was whether the trader would profit from this second attempt or lose more money. As Lookonchain reported, the FOMO buyer sold all their SLERF tokens at a loss again, losing 6,039 SOL, worth $1.15 million. The Slerf token, which has been all over the news for its dramatic launch, saw a significant price decrease of 52.39% from the ATH registered the day after launch. At writing time, SLERF is trading at $0.6351, an 18.4% decrease in the past 24 hours. oh fuck#Slerf #Slerfthesloth #slerfsup $slerf pic.twitter.com/MZes6fVjHN — Slerf (@Slerfsol) March 22, 2024 A second trader lost 3,731 SOL, worth $775,000, just one hour after buying 790,236 SLERF at its ATH price. The trader then doubled down on its bet and bought another 650,000 SLERF. Unluckily, the token’s price plummeted after both purchases. Is The Crypto Presale Meta Hand In Hand With FOMO? To paint an even bigger picture, another crypto trader lost money yesterday after buying a different ‘presale meta’ memecoin. Although the figures are more modest than the other two cases, this trader bought SMOLE and lost 371 SOL. Later, the address spent 2,549 SOL to buy SLERF. This guy always buys high and sells low. He lost money on $SMOLE twice in just 20 minutes, with a total loss of 371 $SOL($70K). Then he spent all 2,549 $SOL($484K) to buy $SLERF.https://t.co/X4aRpNrZuC pic.twitter.com/oZlWkyKD8B — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 21, 2024 SMOLE, despite only being out for one day, has already seen massive criticism and a 17.1% price drop. At writing time, the memecoin is changing hands at $0.0001499, a 70.39% decrease from its highest price of $0.0005086. As this might suggest, FOMO seemingly drives memecoin traders’ decisions during this presale meta. The trend has seen hundreds of millions of dollars sent to memecoins, most of which report millions in losses for investors. 2024 is a #FOMO #YOLO kind of year go for it ! pic.twitter.com/AT8iMZchdQ — Crypto Damus (@AstroCryptoGuru) March 20, 2024 Despite experienced traders being able to profit from this trend, the current numbers hint at a considerable amount of traders losing massive figures while trying to catch the next memecoin to go “turbo parabolic,” even if it doesn’t have a long-term roadmap.

This follows a revised report in which they boosted their year-end target for the flagship crypto token’s price. Bitcoin To Hit $90,000 By The End Of 2024 According to a report by CoinDesk, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra have raised their year-end prediction for Bitcoin’s price from $80,000 to $90,000. Their research report cited the strong Spot Bitcoin ETF inflow and a record mining income as the reasons for this increased bullishness on BTC’s price. Related Reading: Top 3 Solana Meme Coins To Buy Amid The Bitcoin Crash That Could 10x Since launching, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded an impressive amount of inflows into their funds and have significantly contributed to an increase in BTC’s price. As such, it is understandable why these analysts believe they could still positively impact Bitcoin’s price in the long run. Despite miners’ rewards being cut in half during the Halving event in mid-April, these Bernstein analysts also foresee a record mining income for BTC miners. They believe this would have a positive impact on BTC’s price. Bitcoinist recently reported that Bitcoin Halving could force some miners out of business, paving the way for the remaining miners to enjoy increased revenue. Meanwhile, Chhugani and Sapra also recently reaffirmed their prediction that Bitcoin will hit $150,000 by mid-2025. They believe that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs will be one of many factors contributing to this massive price surge. BTC Could Even Hit $150,000 This Year Standard Chartered is another financial institution that revised its year-end target for Bitcoin’s price. As against their initial prediction of $100,000, they recently stated that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000 by the end of this year. Like Bernstein, Standard Chartered also alluded to the influence of the Bitcoin ETFs as the primary reason for their bullishness on Bitcoin. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Is Headed For $27 As 2017 Pattern Emerges The bank noted in the research report that these investment funds provide a more robust and sustainable positioning for Bitcoin, unlike when the crypto token hit new highs solely based on speculations. Standard Chartered also predicts that BTC could rise to $200,000 by the end of 2025. Interstingly, they added that an “overshoot to $250,000 is likely at some point in 2025 if ETF inflows continue apace and reserve managers buy BTC.” These predictions, however, look conservative when one considers Samson Mow’s prediction that BTC could hit $1 million this year. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,200, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Altcoin funds offered by Grayscale are trading at enormous premiums to the net asset value, indicating speculative mania. The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund presents an arbitrage opportunity as it again trades at a 37% discount to its net asset value. If you haven't read my recent article for Seeking Alpha covering MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) stock, I would invite you to consider reading it through and also perusing the comment section. It's been a little over two months since the spot Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) ETFs were approved for the US market and the price action in BTC and several BTC proxies like MSTR has been incredible to say the least. Data by YCharts Bitcoin is up over 40% and MSTR shares are up about 200% since the ETFs were approved. Much of what is driving the returns in BTC is the enormous flow of capital to the new US-based spot funds. A byproduct of the excitement about BTC has been what is, in my opinion, irrational exuberance in some of the other crypto-based products in the market. And I think some of the comments in that MSTR article highlight that irrationality pretty clearly. We see this in other tickers as well. I've covered enormous premiums to crypto asset values in other articles for Seeing Alpha over the last few weeks: Grayscale Solana Trust's 800% Premium Is A Massive Sell . Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust: Still Playing With Fire . I can't stress this point enough; in my opinion, there is no justifiable reason for price premiums on funds (or stocks) that hold crypto assets that are not earning yield either through staking rewards or through providing liquidity to DEX/lending protocols. Froth Is Back If there was any doubt about ""crypto winter"" being over in December 2023, that doubt should be gone at this point. With the exception of Grayscale's top two non-ETF single asset funds by market capitalization, every single altcoin fund that Grayscale is offering is trading at least double the net asset value of the underlying digital assets represented by the products: Grayscale Single-asset Fund Ticker NAV Share Price Premium Rate Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ) ( ETHE ) $32.72 $26.79 -18.1% Ethereum Classic USD ( ETC-USD ) ( ETCG ) $24.72 $14.64 -40.8% Litecoin USD ( LTC-USD ) ( LTCN ) $7.48 $25.24 237.4% Bitcoin Cash USD ( BCH-USD ) ( BCHG ) $3.57 $10.35 189.9% Solana USD ( SOL-USD ) ( GSOL ) $67.23 $394 486.1% Decentraland USD ( MANA-USD ) ( MANA ) $5.86 $47.94 718.1% Grayscale Livepeer Trust (LPT) ( GLIV ) $17.42 $37 112.4% Stellar USD ( XLM-USD ) ( GXLM ) $11.61 $56.95 390.5% ZCash USD ( ZEC-USD ) ( ZCSH ) $2.49 $7.46 199.6% Grayscale Horizen Trust ( HZEN ) $1.19 $7.54 533.6% ChainLink USD ( LINK-USD ) ( GLNK ) $17.18 $122.50 613.0% Basic Attention Token USD ( BAT-USD ) ( GBAT ) $2.84 $24.24 753.5% FileCoin USD ( FIL-USD ) ( FILG ) $8.33 $195 2240.9% Source: Coinglass, 3/21/24 closing figures In my view, there is just no other way to view this than as a speculative mania. Perhaps these traders are simply expecting someone else to pay a higher premium for the shares. Perhaps there is an expectation that the underlying value of the fund will grow into the market price. I don't know. I'm floored that this is still going on if I'm being totally honest. But there is a shelf-life on this. It may take a year from the recently opened private placements in these funds for the share prices to correct. But in my view, the eventual depression of these premiums is the closest thing to a certainty that we have in the market today. GDLC Market vs NAV (Grayscale) This froth for altcoin exposure has not translated to the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( GDLC ) which closed on March 21st at a 37% discount to the net asset value of the fund. For me, this fund is once again an interesting arbitrage opportunity. Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund I've covered GDLC for Seeking Alpha a handful of times over the last 18 months and my thinking can be generally summed up in this way; it's not a great product for diversified crypto exposure given how little the altcoin allocation is, but what it lacks in diversification it makes up for in being one of the cheapest crypto-proxy assets in the public markets from a NAV discount standpoint: Asset ASSETS/SHARE WEIGHT Bitcoin 0.00037618 69.33% Ethereum 0.00230872 22.39% Solana 0.00822414 4.14% Ripple USD ( XRP-USD ) 1.0367784 1.87% Cardano USD ( ADA-USD ) 0.67920129 1.21% Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) 0.00699889 1.06% Source: Grayscale, as of 3/21/24 You can see in the table above, Grayscale now has six assets in the fund yet GDLC is still over 90% allocated to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Given the massive surge in the price of Solana from the lows, SOL has become the third largest coin in the fund with a 4.1% allocation. Those who have followed my previous work on this fund may recall I've modeled the way I personally value the fund with price adjustments that correlate with the NAV rates for Grayscale's single-asset funds. This time around, I'm going to provide a couple of different methods for that model because Grayscale's Bitcoin fund has since converted to an ETF. GDLC Value Adjustment Models The standard way that I've adjusted the GDLC share value is by writing down all of the smaller altcoin positions and rerating the BTC and ETH based on the NAV rates from Grayscale's single asset funds. If we do that again, GDLC's fair value calculation looks like this: Asset Asset price Holdings/Share $ Val/Share Adjusted Val BTC $63,570 0.00037618 $23.91 $23.91 ETH $3,332 0.00230872 $7.69 $6.31 SOL $171.2 0.00822414 $1.41 $0.00 XRP $0.61 1.0367784 $0.63 $0.00 ADA $0.62 0.67920129 $0.42 $0.00 AVAX $53.49 0.00699889 $0.37 $0.00 Share Value $34.44 $30.22 Source: Author's Calculations, Grayscale's shareholding data, intraday 3/22/24 In this table, Bitcoin's discount rate is now zero due to the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) ETF ( GBTC ) to an ETF. The Ethereum discount is 18% per the closing valuation on March 21st. The rest of the coins have been zeroed out and we get an adjusted share value of $30.22 - a 35% premium to the closing price on March 21st. The possible issue with this method is that GBTC is no longer a closed-end product. In a second attempt at creating a NAV rate adjustment for the Bitcoin, I'm using the discount in the Osprey Bitcoin Trust ( OBTC ): Asset Asset price Holdings/Share $ Val/Share Adjusted Val BTC $63,570 0.00037618 $23.91 $21.76 ETH $3,332 0.00230872 $7.69 $6.31 SOL $171.2 0.00822414 $1.41 $0.00 XRP $0.61 1.0367784 $0.63 $0.00 ADA $0.62 0.67920129 $0.42 $0.00 AVAX $53.49 0.00699889 $0.37 $0.00 Share Value $34.44 $28.07 Source: Author's Calculations, Grayscale's shareholding data, intraday 3/22/24 In this attempt, the BTC adjusted value is marked down by 9%, which again is in line with OBTC's closing price from March 21st. Using this valuation method, we get an adjusted share value of $28.07 - a 25% premium to the 3/21/24 close. Of course, there is also Solana in GDLC and Grayscale does have a single-asset Solana fund. Just for kicks, and perhaps to show the absurdity of these pricing inefficiencies all over this market, I decided to build another rerating the SOL value in GDLC, this time up in line with GSOL : Asset Asset price Holdings/Share $ Val/Share Adjusted Val BTC $63,570 0.00037618 $23.91 $21.76 ETH $3,332 0.00230872 $7.69 $6.31 SOL $171.2 0.00822414 $1.41 $6.84 XRP $0.61 1.0367784 $0.63 $0.00 ADA $0.62 0.67920129 $0.42 $0.00 AVAX $53.49 0.00699889 $0.37 $0.00 Share Value $34.44 $34.91 Source: Author's Calculations, Grayscale's shareholding data, intraday 3/22/24 Here we're still using the OBTC discount for the Bitcoin. But now we're also revaluing the SOL in GDLC 486% higher to reflect what the market believes Grayscale's Solana in GSOL is worth. With this model, GDLC should trade at a premium to NAV. To be clear, I don't think GDLC should trade at a premium . But even if we just take the average of the first two models, GDLC shares should be trading closer to $29 per share yet we can buy it for about $22. Risks Though it has worked in the past, this valuation adjustment model is just a theory and should be viewed as such. GDLC still has a high degree of risk and is very unlikely to be converted to an ETF any time soon. Just because other crypto-proxy products trade at enormous premiums, it does not mean GDLC will trade like them. Like other Grayscale funds, GDLC is arguably way too expensive with its 2.5% management fee. Additionally, there is an opportunity cost in buying GLDC as a long-term investment due to the fact that the fund's assets are not staked for passive yield even though they could be very easily. Finally, it's possible that the NAV discount closes while the NAV itself declines far enough that arbitrage traders could still come out behind. Summary I like this trade again and I've re-entered it in recent weeks. If you like single-asset funds at 100-500% premiums, you have to love the idea of being able to buy many of the same cryptos at a discount. But I have to stress, that just because this worked very well the last time I highlighted the opportunity, it doesn't mean it will work again. But for my money, it's a worthy speculation given all of the exuberance elsewhere in the market. GDLC is currently the only Grayscale product that I have any exposure to.",POSITIVE,BCH | SOL,ALTCOIN | BCH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4679990-gdlc-too-cheap-to-ignore-again?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/24682942.jpeg

Wood, whose Ark Invest recently became one of the issuers of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), ARKB, said the asset manager is focused on emerging markets and the macro environment worldwide, which has been “shocked” by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s increase in interest rates, she said during a fireside chat at the Friday Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York.  “There are signals that not all is well in the world,” she said about countries like Nigeria, one of the biggest adopters of bitcoin because of the strong depreciation of the country’s currency. Because of that, Wood sees bitcoin as a risk-off asset and a risk-on asset.  Ark’s spot bitcoin ETF has become one of the more successful bitcoin ETFs among the ten funds issued in January.  Wood said that with more institutions entering this space, mathematically speaking, bitcoin’s price could easily rise above $3.5 million. However, she wouldn’t give a new specific price target.  “Bitcoin has miles to go,” she said instead and pointed out to her previous call of $1.5 million price target.

It aims to propel the total value locked (TVL) of its layer 2 blockchain, Fraxtal, to $100 billion by the end of 2026. This notable surge would represent a 760,000% increase from the current TVL levels, which stand at $13 million. Frax Finance Singularity Roadmap According to the protocol’s announcement, Fraxtal, the substrate that powers the Frax ecosystem, serves as Frax Finance’s operating system. With the launch of Fraxtal and achieving an effective 100% Collateralization Ratio (CR), Frax Finance claims to have consolidated its core product offerings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETFs See 4 Consecutive Days Of Outflows, Here’s What Happened Last Time To reach the ambitious $100 billion TVL goal, the protocol has announced that it has already generated over $45 million, reaching the coveted 100% CR. As announced, with this milestone achieved, the FRAX stablecoin, which has remained relatively dormant during the process, and the FXS revenue share, which has been temporarily reduced by 90% to conserve assets, can now undergo a “transformative change.” In addition, the upcoming introduction of Layer 3s (L3s) on Fraxtal is expected to be a key factor in further contributing to the growth and adoption of the protocol. Fraxtal, which is built on the Optimism (OP) network, stands out as one of the most widely used layer 2 solutions on top of Ethereum (ETH), according to the protocol. The Frax team says it has developed its underlying incentives to provide a seamless experience for developers and users, further encouraging adoption. In particular, by owning the entire stack, Frax can introduce advanced features such as account abstraction, new precompiles, privacy features, aggregated decentralized applications (dApps), and interoperability with Superchain. The protocol believes these features will enhance the on-chain experience, making Fraxtal the “preferred” platform for holding, staking, and transferring crypto assets. Expansion Strategy The proposal also unveils Frax Finance’s plan to establish 23 Layer 3s within 365 days, kicking off the “Fraxtal Nation” community. By supporting these 23 chains with developer access, incentives, and investment, Frax aims to foster a positive-sum approach and provide additional support to official partners. The protocol also suggests that these partners will receive “substantial allocations” of FXTL points, aiming to solidify the role of the FXS token as the ultimate beneficiary of the Frax ecosystem. Moreover, Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian intends to allocate 50% of the revenue from protocol fees to veFXS token holders. In comparison, the remaining 50% will be used to acquire FXS and other Frax assets for pairing in the FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE). This initiative will increase liquidity, strengthen the Frax balance sheet, and provide additional incentives for the protocol’s stakeholders. Related Reading: Stablecoins Steal The Spotlight: $150 Billion Market Cap, $122 Billion Daily Trades Frax Finance’s proposal also seeks to reactivate the protocol fee switch, which was temporarily turned off during the consolidation phase of the protocol. By reigniting this switch, a portion of the yield generated from protocol fees will be directed toward veFXS token holders. veFXS, or veiled FXS, represents a locked version of the native token, FXS, and offers enhanced voting power and participation in the Frax ecosystem. As of the time of writing, FXS has not responded favorably to the news. Its current trading price is $6.93, reflecting a 3.5% loss in the past 24 hours. It is important to note that the proposed protocol features are still in development, and the impact on the Frax Finance ecosystem and the token’s performance is yet to be determined.

Interestingly, the bullish outlook hinges on the Bitcoin market cap retesting all-time highs at press time. Will BTC Rally? Market Dynamics Changing So far, the Bitcoin price is around 2021 highs in USD terms but recently broke all-time highs, peaking at around $73,800. This fluctuation is also reflected in its market cap. It currently stands at $1.25 trillion, down 5% in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETFs See 4 Consecutive Days Of Outflows, Here’s What Happened Last Time Notably, it is at the same price level as in 2021, when Bitcoin prices peaked, recording new all-time highs. While optimism abounds and the trader expects more sharp price expansions in the days ahead, it is not immediately clear whether the coin will rip higher, aligning with this forecast. Bitcoin is volatile and has remained so despite changing market dynamics. At the same time, unlike in the past, Bitcoin prices are driven not only by retail forces but by institutions. These institutions are regulated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which also approved the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This Bitcoin derivative product has been the primary driving force in the past ten weeks. This is from looking at how prices have evolved since its approval in mid-January 2024. However, since BlackRock and Fidelity are regulated by the United States SEC, unlike retailers, they cannot act as they wish. Considering the millions and billions of dollars at play, their comments or assessments on the coin, now and in the future, can greatly impact sentiment. Sentiment Is Dented, BTC Facing Headwinds Sentiment has been dented when writing. Even with the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) ‘s decision to hold rates at 5.5%, the highest in 2023, lifting prices, there has been no solid follow-through in price action. The coin remains steady below $70,000. Whether prices will rally over the weekend remains to be seen. However, for now, there are some headwinds to consider.

42408605,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaqQjK,1711129426,Remembering ‘True Names’ Author Vernor Vinge,"Science fiction pioneer and inspiration to many a cypherpunk, Vernor Steffen Vinge, passed away Wednesday at the age of 79 in La Jolla, California. The five-time winner of the prestigious Hugo Award is perhaps best known for popularizing the term “singularity.”  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Vinge, born Oct. 2, 1944 in Wisconsin, was also a beloved professor of mathematics and computer science at San Diego State University, where he received a PhD in math in 1971. In 2000, he retired from academia to write hard science fiction full time.  “A titan in the literary genre that explores a limitless range of potential destinies, Vernor enthralled millions with tales of plausible tomorrows, made all the more vivid by his polymath masteries of language, drama, characters and the implications of science,” American author David Brin said in a farewell message on Facebook.  Vinge (pronounced VIN-jee) received Hugo Awards for his novels A Fire Upon the Deep (1993), A Deepness in the Sky (2000), and Rainbows End (2007) as well as novellas Fast Times at Fairmont High (2002) and The Cookie Monster (2004). Perhaps his most well-known work, the 30,000-word novella “True Names” (1981) was an early exploration of cyberspace, transhumanism and hacker culture.  As weird as Thomas Pynchon and as prophetic as Nostradomus, Vinge’s writing has major implications for the age of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The technological singularity, a term now in vogue to describe the theoretical moment when AI surpasses human intelligence, is an idea Vinge returned to over and over throughout his career.  He explored the concept in the seminal cyberpunk tome, “True Names,” which follows a group of hackers who plug into a virtual reality system called the ""Other Plane"" to explore a network of computers. In true cypherpunkian style, the hackers (called warlocks), try to keep their “true names” secret.  Unfortunately for the protagonist, “Mr. Slippery"" (a.k.a. Roger Pollack), the ""Great Enemy"" (a.k.a. the U.S. government) discovers his real identity and uses that knowledge as leverage to get him to investigate a newly arrived hacker accused of treason known as Mailman. Thus begins a romp that involves a rogue AI “personality simulator” (SPOILER: created by the National Security Agency) that replicates itself, eats all the information stored in databases around the world and causes chaos on- and offline.  Written eight years before the launch of the World Wide Web, and inspired by Vinge’s experiences using an early messaging platform Talk, “True Names” anticipated a number of the internet’s runaway effects on society and essentially the entire field of artificial intelligence.  ''The import of 'True Names’ is that it is about how we cope with things we don't understand.,” AI pioneer Marvin Minsky wrote in a (since revised) afterword. Nowhere is this more evident than in today’s large language models, which are black boxes to even the researchers who build them.  See also: The Metaverse: From Science Fiction to Virtual Reality  Although he was convinced that technology will eventually outcompete and outperform humanity as a whole (actually saying the singularity would arrive between 2020 and 2040), Vinge was an eternal optimist. And his techno-optimism was infectious. As Minsky wrote:  “I too am convinced that the days of programming as we know it are numbered, and that eventually we will construct large computer systems not by anything resembling today's meticulous but conceptually impoverished procedural specifications … Once we learn better ways to tell computers what we want them to accomplish, we will be more able to return to our actual goals–of expressing our own wants and needs.”  It’s a point of view that many manifesto writers nowadays may agree with — from the Effective Altruists looking for ways to “align” AI with humanity to the Effective Accelerationists wanting to speed up the rate of technological innovation.  We may not know the impact of introducing a new technology, but, as Vinge argued in his 1993 essay titled “The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era,” “we have the freedom to establish initial conditions.”  Technology is a tool. It is often also frightening. But it is a means to an end, not an end in itself, Vinge may argue. That’s why it matters how technologists and the computer cognoscenti go about building, and why Satoshi Nakamoto, who may have been alarmed by what he/she/it built, should be praised for starting the crypto industry off on the right foot.  See also: Cory Doctorow on Privacy, Web3, and Fighting the Surveillance Cartel  What comes next is not answerable in this lifetime, but, if you read Vinge, you might want to see it come to pass.  ""Accused by some of a grievous sin — that of 'optimism' — Vernor gave us peerless legends that often depicted human success at overcoming problems... those right in front of us... while posing new ones! New dilemmas that may lie just ahead of our myopic gaze,” Brin wrote. “He would often ask: 'What if we succeed? Do you think that will be the end of it?'""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/22/remembering-true-names-author-vernor-vinge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56698b1305702715538ab149f3a1ae80c0026bd2-640x360.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

24679390,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599196,1711126857,"Bitcoin Troubles Far From Over As More Carnage Looms, JPMorgan Analysts","Despite optimism about Bitcoin’s future trajectory heading into the Bitcoin Halving, analysts at JPMorgan have raised concerns that things may not go according to everyone’s expectations. They believe that a storm still lies ahead for the flagship crypto token before any massive move to the upside. Further Bitcoin Pullbacks Are To Be Expected According to a Bloomberg report, JPMorgan strategists have warned that Bitcoin could still experience further pullbacks following its recent decline. They alluded to the recent net outflows recorded by the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which underscored the current bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Is Headed For $27 As 2017 Pattern Emerges These strategists, led by Nikolaos Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, also highlighted the sustained open interest in CME Bitcoin futures as another bearish signal for Bitcoin’s price. They further argue that Bitcoin “still looks overbought” and expect further price dips leading up to the Halving event in mid-April. Meanwhile, these JPMorgan analysts emphasized the decline in net inflows into Spot ETFs, noting that this proves that a sustained one-way net inflow is not possible. Therefore, they expect investors in these funds to keep taking profits heading into the Bitcoin Halving. This wave of profit-taking is also more likely, considering that Bitcoin “still looks overbought despite the past week’s correction.” they claimed. This recent research note by JPMorgan further reaffirms their bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin’s price despite the flagship crypto exceeding expectations. Last month, the bank predicted that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $42,000 after April as “Bitcoin-halving-induced euphoria subsides.” Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, also echoed JPMoragn’s sentiments when he suggested that Bitcoin’s recent rally didn’t show enough strength. Aslam believes Bitcoin could fall below $50,000 if the Halving event “fails to really keep the momentum going.” What Could Happen After The Halving Event Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital recently provided insights into what could happen after the Havling event while elaborating on the four phases of Bitcoin Halving. According to him, there is usually a re-accumulation period after the Halving, which could last for up to five months. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees A Shift: Short Term Holders Take Possession Of 23 Trillion SHIB During this period, he noted that many investors get “shaken out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their BTC investment in the immediate aftermath of the Halving.” Rekt Capital added that this time could be different since it is the first time this re-accumulation could develop around the new all-time high (ATH) area. Therefore, he believes this “Re-Accumulation Range may simply take the shape of a regular sideways range and may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation.” BTC price struggles to establish support | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com",NEGATIVE,BTC | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-troubles-far-from-over/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42408602,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaqQZP,1711124100,SEC's Gensler Says Crypto Firms Skip Public Disclosures by Dodging Registration,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler used a speech on the ""public good"" of securities disclosures on Friday to point specifically at the crypto industry as a problem area.  Gensler, whose tenure atop the agency has been marked by a legal crusade against what he argues is a largely noncompliant industry, suggested that digital assets businesses are among those seeking to ""whittle away at the SEC's disclosure regime,"" which requires companies to register securities and provide information to investors about them.  ""There are participants in crypto securities markets that seek to avoid these registration requirements,"" he said in remarks prepared for an event at Columbia Law School. ""No registration means no mandatory disclosure.""  ""Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant,"" Gensler added.  The regulator is pursuing several enforcement actions against companies it accuses of failing to register as exchanges and listing unregistered securities, such as Coinbase Inc. and Binance. It's also reportedly investigating Ethereum {{ETH}}, potentially considering classifying that asset as a security – unlike bitcoin.  Gensler's rhetoric that crypto platforms need to get registered may be tested soon.

42408603,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaqQci,1711123563,Bitcoin Slips to $64K as Large Grayscale GBTC Outflows Continue,"Bitcoin fell below $63,000 early during the U.S. session Friday amid a broader crypto sell-off.  ""It will take some time"" until bitcoin recovers to $73,000, Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz said at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference.  ETF inflows will return once GBTC selling is completed due to favorable macro conditions, Coinbase analysts said.  Volatility in crypto markets continued Friday, with bitcoin {{BTC}} tumbling below $63,000 at one point from the $67,000 area just hours earlier. A modest rebound since has taken the price back to the current $64,000, down 3.7% over the past 24 hours.  The sell-off rippled through the market, with the broad CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by 4.4% over the same time frame, led by layer-1 network Solana's token {{SOL}} declining more than 10% at one point.  It's been more than a week when BTC turned sharply lower from its fresh all-time high price over $73,000 and crypto assets entered a corrective period. While Wednesday's steep, 10% rally on the back of a dovish Federal Reserve promised a quick recovery, the price action since suggests otherwise.  ""[It] will take some time before we take out that $73,000 again,"" said Mike Novogratz, CEO of digital asset investment company Galaxy Digital, during a panel discussion at Bitcoin Investor Day in New York Friday morning.  The weak price action comes as U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs have suffered what's now four consecutive days of net negative flows. To be sure, nearly all the funds continue to see inflows, but each day this week, they've not been nearly enough to offset massive outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). On Thursday, GBTC saw $359 million in outflows, leading to $94 million in outflows for the entire fund group. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) garnered the lowest daily inflow in its history, data compiled by BitMEX Research shows.  So far through the week, the spot ETFs have recorded over $830 million outflows, and are on track to endure their second negative week since late January when BTC corrected to $39,000.  Analysts at Coinbase Institutional noted that the increased GBTC selling is potentially in part due to Genesis selling shares as part of its bankruptcy process. Once the sales are completed, the report said, inflows to ETFs could pick up again amid favorable macro conditions and favorable central bank policy.  ""We think the macro environment remains amenable for more spot bitcoin ETF inflows following the Federal Reserve meeting that concluded on March 20,"" the Coinbase authors wrote. ""We expect the current US disinflationary trend to remain intact, financial conditions in the US to continue easing, and markets to be supported by the tapering of the Fed’s quantitative tightening program.""

""I can say that for our client base, bitcoin is overwhelmingly the No. 1 focus and a little bit Ethereum,"" he said during a fireside chat at the Friday Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York.  For every other crypto asset, he said, demand is ""very, very little.""  Perhaps it's only fitting that when asked about if BlackRock will be launching an exchange-traded fund that holds meme coin dogwifhat (WIF) anytime soon, Mitchnick said he didn't know what it was, noting that there's a misconception from the crypto industry that the asset manager will have a ""long tail"" of other services.  ""That's really not what we're focused on,"" he said.  BlackRock ushered in a bullish optimism within the digital assets market in January when it got approval to offer the Bitcoin Bitcoin Fund (IBIT) to investors, which in less than two months of trading, became one of the top five ETFs overall in the market.

Read more: BlackRock's ETF Demand Ranks Among Top 5  Part of the reason why the asset manager – which in previous years had been opposed to bitcoin – decided to launch a bitcoin ETF was because clients were consistent and enduring in expressing their interest in bitcoin through both bull and bear markets, Mitchnick said.

24677989,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599182,1711123251,This Bitcoin Halving May Not Result In Supply Squeeze: Glassnode,"Glassnode has suggested that the upcoming Bitcoin halving might not result in a supply squeeze that the market may have anticipated. Bitcoin Halving May Not Carry Same Impact Due To Spot ETFs In a new report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed the impact the next Bitcoin halving may have on the economics of the cryptocurrency. The “halving” is a periodic event for BTC where its block rewards (the rewards the miners receive for adding blocks on the network) are permanently cut in half. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Surges 15% As Coinbase Plans Futures Listing This event is built into the coin’s code, meaning it happens automatically. The halving kicks in after every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years. The next such event will take place sometime in the coming month. Historically, the halving has been considered an important event for the asset due to how it influences its supply dynamics. The block rewards the miners receive are the only way to introduce new BTC tokens into circulation. Since they get tightened during these events, the cryptocurrency’s production rate slows down following them. As such, halvings are considered bullish events, with the price increasing following them due to the constrained supply, as supply-demand dynamics would dictate. “However, the current market conditions differ from historical norms,” says Glassnode. The reason behind that is simple; there is something now that was never there in the past: the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that buy and hold Bitcoin and allow their users to gain indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price action through them. Since the spot ETFs are available on traditional exchanges, they can be preferable for those not looking to dabble with digital asset platforms and wallets. Thus, the ETFs have introduced a notable amount of fresh demand for the asset, with supply rapidly leaving the market and entering these funds. To put this demand into perspective, the analytics firm has compared it against the BTC amount miners issue on the chain daily. The trend in the spot ETF flows and miner issuance since the start of the year | Source: Glassnode As the above chart shows, the Bitcoin ETF flows have generally been much higher than what the miners have been introducing into circulation. Based on this, Glassnode believes “the upcoming halving might not result in the supply squeeze once anticipated.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Capitulate: Here’s What Happened Last 2 Times The report further says: The ETFs are, in essence, preempting the halving’s impact by already tightening the available supply through their substantial and continuous buying activity. In other words, the supply squeeze usually expected from halvings may already be in effect due to ETFs’ large-scale bitcoin acquisitions. Something to note, however, is that the ETFs aren’t certain to always be a bullish influence for the market. Should the current inflow-heavy regime flip to one dominated by outflows, the cryptocurrency could naturally witness extraordinary selling pressure. In fact, the spot ETF netflows have been negative for Bitcoin for four straight days now, so such a trend shift may already be in action.

42408596,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaqQCG,1711121205,There Can (Probably) Be Only One Bitcoin,"One of my key questions about the next era in crypto and blockchain is this: How will all the capital likely be deployed into digital assets and cryptocurrencies as they become better regulated?  More than 90% of the world’s financial and business assets are considered “on-shore” – that is, they are owned and managed by entities and people residing in the countries where they are bought and sold.  Today, most crypto-assets are bought and sold off-shore (I estimate about 80% based on data from CoinGecko). However, as more regulated opportunities open up, new capital will flow into these digital asset environments. I don’t, however, think there will be a huge new range of cryptocurrency growth opportunities.  If you read my columns regularly, you know that I strongly believe that Ethereum will follow the path of many other technology ecosystems towards dominance. Ethereum is, first and foremost, a technology platform. Yes, ETH is a cryptocurrency, but its main demand driver is for use, as a payment for transaction processing. I think over time, ETH will largely be subject to the laws of supply and demand for processing power on this “world computer.”  The technology industry needs and thrives upon standards that provide economies of scale and network effects. Ethereum has won the standards war for programming and has largely fixed its scalability issues, making it the default choice. Digital assets will, by and large, exist in the Ethereum ecosystem.  Digital assets can be much bigger than just a digital version of gold  Bitcoin isn’t subject to the same rules. Though people tend to lump them together, Bitcoin is a true crypto-asset and very much like gold; people don’t buy it with plans to use it. They buy it for its scarcity value and to see it appreciate as an asset. Like gold, people do not expect Bitcoin to generate a cash flow, just to appreciate through its scarcity.  Nor do I think that recent efforts to add a Layer 2 ecosystem to Bitcoin, similar to what exists in Ethereum, is likely to change this outcome. The Ethereum ecosystem has an enormous lead and Bitcoin users that want to make their asset programmable have already been migrating it into “wrapped” Bitcoins on Ethereum for some time.  So, can there be only one Bitcoin?  Theoretically, there can be infinite Bitcoins. It feels like there practically already are. Litecoin, Dogecoin, and countless other meme coins and cryptocurrencies are nearly identical copies of Bitcoin. And while there is no BrodyCoin as of yet, I do offer complimentary NFTs (get yours here!).  Despite the effectively infinite supply of Bitcoin copies, I suspect that there really can and only ever will be one Bitcoin, and it’s the one we already have. Let’s stick with the gold analogy. While there isn’t an infinite supply of gold, there are quite a few other precious metals out there. We could just as easily trade in silver or diamonds as gold.  Despite there being multiple options available, however, gold absolutely dominates the market for precious metals. The total market cap of global gold stores is estimated at $13.7 trillion. Silver comes in at just $1.3 trillion and the market cap. An order of magnitude separates gold from the next alternative and so I believe we will see Bitcoin retain a position in the order of a magnitude higher than any other alternative crypto asset.  I think this has a couple of important implications for people as they prepare for the next wave of growth in these markets that will come from a regulated era. The first is that inventing a new cryptocurrency isn’t necessarily going to be a path to success. Bitcoin has that role and, as people want digital gold, that is what they are going to buy.  Second, the world of digital assets should, and can be much bigger than just a digital version of gold. Oil is essential (for the moment) to the global economy and it’s 10 times larger than gold – doing $1.7 trillion in revenue (not to be confused with market cap) annually. Net new growth opportunities are likely to be much bigger by creating something that is used by consumers or needed by enterprises. That space is much larger than holding reserve assets. It’s where I’ll be looking for the next opportunities for real growth.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/22/there-can-probably-be-only-one-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fab0f62d1904d83e7cda05c41aabc9aa43e87455-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

24676469,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599187,1711119621,Fantom (FTM) Jumps 180% In 4 Weeks: Just The Beginning?,"Over the past 24 hours, Fantom (FTM) has emerged as the standout performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, registering a remarkable 13.5% gain. This surge is part of a broader rally that has seen the FTM price soar by 180% over the last four weeks, propelling it from $0.42 to $1.20. This upward trajectory has significantly boosted Fantom’s market capitalization to $3.3 billion, positioning it as the 41st largest digital asset worldwide. Here’s why this might be just the beginning: #1 Sonic Upgrade: The Catalyst for Fantom’s Rally The anticipated Sonic upgrade is central to Fantom’s recent success. Designed to enhance the Fantom technology stack, Sonic introduces major scalability improvements without necessitating a disruptive hard fork. Key components of the Sonic upgrade include: Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM): Aims to significantly boost transaction throughput. Carmen Database: Promises to reduce storage requirements by up to 90%. Optimized Lachesis Consensus: Improves upon the existing consensus mechanism for enhanced performance. With these enhancements, Fantom targets a throughput of over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), marking a substantial leap in scalability. Importantly, the upgrade ensures that existing Fantom Opera smart contracts and tools remain fully compatible with the Sonic mainnet, which is scheduled to launch in Spring 2024. Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Bull Run: Can FTM Hit $2 After 20% Price Spike? Recent testnets have demonstrated Sonic’s potential. The closed testnet, focused on ERC-20 swaps, achieved an impressive ~4,000 TPS with ~1.3-second finality. Furthermore, a reconfiguration to process only ERC-20 transfers led to a groundbreaking ~10,000 TPS at ~1.6-second finality, showcasing the capabilities of next-generation decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and wallets. 10k tps achieved. Publicly verifiable. Can test for yourself, on public infrastructure. No need for ""trust me bro"". Available today, no need to wait. And we havent even started with the parallel execution meme. https://t.co/q2QRKM9WXe — Andre Cronje (@AndreCronjeTech) March 15, 2024 Reflecting on Sonic’s impact, Reflexivity Research highlighted, “Fantom Sonic unlocks new possibilities for the Fantom ecosystem, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, blockchain games, high-frequency applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT).” The research firm added that another cornerstone for Fantom is its exemplary 99.9% uptime. “Fantom’s novel solutions position it as a frontrunner in the development of decentralized networks,” Reflexivity Research stated. #2 Andre Cronje: The Innovator’s Promise Andre Cronje, the founder of Fantom and one of the brightest minds in the crypto industry, has been instrumental in driving innovation within the ecosystem. Cronje recently underscored his commitment to advancing the crypto space, stating, “The number 1 dex on Base, and the number 1 dex on Optimism are both built with code I wrote and pioneered. Stick to where the innovators are, post Sonic I will be adding some new primitives to crypto.” Related Reading: Fantom Launches Recovery Plan For Funds Lost In Multichain’s $200M Exploit, FTM Soars #3 Coinbase Announcement: A New Milestone Another factor driving today’s price rally is probably today’s Coinbase International announcement that it will launch Fantom perpetual futures on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced, set to commence on or after 9:30am UTC on March 28, 2024. This move by Coinbase is expected to further enhance Fantom’s liquidity and accessibility, contributing to its growing appeal among investors. @CoinbaseIntExch will add support for Fantom and THORChain perpetual futures on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced. The opening of our FTM-PERP and RUNE-PERP markets will begin on or after 9:30am UTC on 28 MAR 2024. pic.twitter.com/CHBVF58ISc — Coinbase International Exchange 🛡️ (@CoinbaseIntExch) March 21, 2024 #4 Technical Analysis: FTM/USD The bullish momentum of Fantom price is apparent in the weekly FTM/USD chart on Binance, signified by the latest candlestick closure above the key exponential moving averages (EMAs) of 20, 50, 100, and 200 periods. This week’s candlestick represents a notable increase of approximately 50% from the intra-week low. Fantom’s ascent has propelled its value beyond the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, situated at $0.9176. This bullish breakout suggests the market may target subsequent Fibonacci levels, with $1.38 (0.382 Fib) acting as an intermediate psychological and technical resistance, followed by $1.76 (05 Fib), and potentially extending towards the golden ratio at $2.13, which corresponds with the 0.618 Fibonacci level. On the flip side of this bullish scenario, should a correction occur across the broader crypto market, immediate support for FTM can be anticipated at the $0.92 level. Stability at or above this threshold could reaffirm bullish market control. Conversely, a downward breach could intensify selling pressure, possibly leading to a retest of support around the $0.56 mark.

The decision effectively puts a time-out on the ongoing tug-of-war over Kwon between South Korea and the United States. Both countries want to try Kwon for criminal charges, including fraud, relating to the $40 billion collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022.  Kwon has fought extradition for a year, but a decision from a Montenegrin Appellate court earlier this month to extradite him to South Korea seemed final – until the country’s top prosecutor stepped in.  On Thursday, the Office of the Supreme State Prosecutor issued a statement arguing that the court’s decision overstepped the limits of its power. The prosecutor claimed that a decision on where to extradite Kwon can only be made by the country’s minister of justice.  The Supreme Court has said that Kwon’s extradition will be halted ""until a decision is made.""

42408600,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaqQW6,1711118503,"U.S. SEC Asking for More Millions, Dozens of Lawyers to Beef Up Crypto Oversight","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Treasury Department are all asking for additional resources for the 2025 fiscal year, saying they will go toward crypto and other areas.  The budget requests will go to Congress.  Gary Gensler wants 33 more people in the enforcement division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to deal with ""new and emerging issues,"" according to the regulator's annual budget pitch. Much of that office's recent, emerging workload has come from the agency's pursuit of cryptocurrency businesses, such as Coinbase Inc., Kraken and Binance.  A number of U.S. financial regulators noted the rise of crypto as a justification for their latest budget requests – an annual exercise that tends to say more about agencies' priorities than the actual funding they necessarily end up with. The SEC, for instance, has to justify its programs to Congress – including to highly critical Republican lawmakers – in the appropriations process.  Spending plans at the Department of the Treasury and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also highlight the extent to which they think cryptocurrencies need better monitoring, with both entities asking for more resources to address the digital asset market and other areas.  SEC Budget  Gensler's executive summary of the budget request opened with a dig noting the difficulty of policing the digital assets sector.  ""We’ve seen the Wild West of the crypto markets, rife with noncompliance, where investors have put hard-earned assets at risk in a highly speculative asset class,"" he wrote.  The SEC, which has often been accused of regulating the crypto sector through legal actions, had already ramped up its headcount for enforcement lawyers to dig into digital assets, and an influx of cash would allow that trend to continue. The agency is also asking for another 23 people in its examinations division, in part to address ""evolving risks"" that include crypto activity, according to the $2.6 billion overall spending plan.  Read More: Coinbase Accuses U.S. SEC of Breaking the Law in Rejecting Crypto Rulemaking  And the securities watchdog -- concerned about what decentralized finance (DeFi) might bring to the financial sector -- also wants to add a data scientist in its innovation hub.  ""New products and services, such as decentralized finance in the blockchain space and computer-assisted financial activities in the AI space, are being introduced on a compressed timeframe and have an immediate impact on the financial industry.""  CFTC requests  The CFTC mainly mentioned digital assets in the context of its enforcement division, noting it brought nearly 50 cases against crypto companies over the past year and highlighting its recent settlement with Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange as an example of a successful action.  ""The CFTC has risen to the challenges brought by the burgeoning digital asset market by ensuring that the markets and market participants acting within its jurisdiction comply with their statutory and regulatory requirements,"" the request said. ""The CFTC also uses its anti-fraud, false reporting, and anti-manipulation enforcement authority over commodity cash markets in interstate commerce to investigate and address misconduct in the digital asset space.""  However, the CFTC request also noted that more companies are seeking derivatives clearing organization licenses for crypto products, which is bringing a fresh set of risks. The agency wants additional resources to better monitor and address these risks.  In the coming year, the CFTC intends to take on a rulemaking effort to include cryptocurrencies in data reporting efforts for futures and options markets.  And yet another section hints at the CFTC's repeated requests for Congress to grant it more spot market oversight, noting an office that provides ""technical advice to Congress with respect to draft legislation, including with respect to digital assets.""  The CFTC also wants to hire an external ad agency to create public service announcements warning the general public about various frauds – including crypto frauds.  Treasury  The Treasury Department's 2025 budget request details various actions it's taken in the cryptocurrency sector over the past year, requesting an overall $17 billion, with $12.3 billion going toward the Internal Revenue Service, $2 billion for various other Treasury Department offices and around $2.5 billion for international programs.  Various divisions within the broader Treasury Department structure are requesting budget increases to better engage with the cryptocurrency sector, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, Office of Financial Research, Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Office of Foreign Assets Control and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The 2025 budget did not include many line items specific to the cryptocurrency sector, instead mentioning digital assets within its broader office subsections.  For example, Treasury's Office of Financial Research is looking to hire five new employees, three of whom would be tasked with researching and analyzing cryptocurrencies, among other issues like cybersecurity and hedge fund monitoring.  The terror financing wing, including OFAC and FinCEN, is looking to better monitor and understand the role crypto might be playing in illicit finance, the request said.  ""Over the past year, this work has focused on better understanding and combating digital asset gaps in the U.S. and global financial system, as well as ransomware financing, Russia illicit financing, and money laundering from fentanyl and synthetic opioids among other important issues,"" the section said, pointing to Treasury's recent decentralized finance (DeFi) report.  Another passage referenced Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo's recent letter detailing FinCEN's work analyzing to what extent cryptocurrencies might be used by the Hamas terror group.  Executive branch budget proposals are gathered into a single push from the White House for its spending priorities, with more detail about how exactly the agencies want to spend the funds they're requesting. Then Congress gets its turn, sometimes embracing some of the president's wishes, and sometimes ignoring them. But even when lawmakers put together a plan for final consideration, the process can get derailed by politics, as the U.S. has seen in the current federal budget effort, which has flirted repeatedly with failure and government shutdowns. Congress is currently evaluating a budget for 2024, after several false starts and continuing resolutions.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Jesse Hamilton, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/22/us-sec-asking-for-more-millions-dozens-of-lawyers-to-beef-up-crypto-oversight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6362f3b914ae14de672ad822b121f8c64c956bc9-3391x1909.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418550,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTxDnJ,1711117777,El Salvador Doubles Down on Bitcoin,"In a series of strategic moves that underline its commitment to cryptocurrency, El Salvador continues to deepen its engagement with the digital currency market, particularly bitcoin {{BTC}}. President Nayib Bukele recently announced El Salvador's plan to buy one bitcoin every day, aiming to continue this practice until it becomes unaffordable with fiat currencies. This initiative has pushed the nation's bitcoin holdings to a substantial total of 5,690 BTC, valued at approximately $400 million.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Tatiana Koffman leads investment firm Moonwalker Capital, is the author of the popular financial newsletter MythOfMoney.com.  In tandem with its cryptocurrency endeavors, El Salvador has made a bold statement in the global investment landscape by eliminating income tax for international investments and money transfers. This tax cut, from 30%-0%, is designed to attract foreign investors and boost economic growth.  The country's commitment to bitcoin was further highlighted this week as it transferred more than 5,000 BTC into a cold wallet. President Bukele disclosed that a significant portion of these assets, amounting to $400 million worth of bitcoin, has been moved to an offline device stored in a physical vault within the nation's territory. This move to secure the digital assets in a ""Bitcoin piggy bank"" marks a significant step in El Salvador's financial strategy, offering a higher level of security and signaling strong faith in the cryptocurrency's future.  The decision to make the transfer to a cold wallet came after El Salvador's bitcoin treasury swelled unexpectedly, nearly doubling its previously known stash. The country had been acquiring bitcoin through various means, including daily purchases, sales of passports, currency conversions for businesses, mining and government services. This approach has dramatically increased El Salvador's bitcoin holdings, which were believed to be less than 3,000 BTC before this revelation.  See also: El Salvador Holds More Bitcoin Than Expected  El Salvador's pioneering stance on bitcoin began in September 2021 when it became the first country to adopt the digital currency as legal tender. Since then, bitcoin's value has seen significant fluctuations, recently hitting a record high of $73,800. The country's ongoing daily bitcoin purchases and the creation of a tax-free crypto haven powered by geothermal energy from a volcano showcase its innovative approach to harnessing cryptocurrency for economic development.  President Bukele's vision extends beyond merely accumulating bitcoin; he envisions transforming El Salvador into a wealthy nation through strategic investments and initiatives related to the digital currency. Despite criticisms and warnings from international bodies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), El Salvador's commitment to its bitcoin strategy remains steadfast, with the nation showing no signs of divesting from the cryptocurrency.  El Salvador's bold foray into the world of bitcoin and its efforts to create a conducive environment for cryptocurrency investments reflect a significant shift in how nations perceive and engage with digital currencies. As the country continues its bitcoin acquisition program and enhances its cryptocurrency infrastructure, it sets a precedent for others to follow, potentially reshaping the global financial landscape in the process.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Tatiana Koffman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/22/el-salvador-doubles-down-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67a31bb4ba157d05c0f665d6f8edc6f2e5282adc-1920x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These outflows, like before, are being led by the Grayscale Spot ETF as investors believe their fees are too high. This has led to four consecutive week of outflows, which is the second time it is happening since Spot ETFs were approved for trading. So, where does the Bitcoin price go from here? Bitcoin Spot ETFs Hit 4 Consecutive Days Of Outflows The outflows began on Monday and continued into subsequent days. So far, the highest single-day outflow happened on Tuesday, March 19, with total net flows for the day coming out to $326.2 million, a new record for Bitcoin funds. Related Reading: Top 3 Solana Meme Coins To Buy Amid The Bitcoin Crash That Could 10x Subsequent days have seen lower figures when it comes to overall net flows but they continue to come out in the negative. On Wednesday, net flows were $261.5 million, and on Thursday, March 22, net flows came out to $94 million. This marked the second time that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing four consecutive days of outflows this year. The vast majority of these outflows, as mentioned above, are coming from the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF. In the last day alone, the fund saw outflows of 5,900 BTC, which translates to $339 million at current prices. Then, over the last week, Coinglass data shows that 28,207.5834 BTC has left the fund, causing its total BTC under management to fall by 7.35% in one week. Other funds have also seen outflows during this time but to a much lower degree. For example, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF saw the second-highest outflow of all the funds, but only 667 BTC flowed out of the fund in the last day. The WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund saw 10.8.2635 BTC in outflows, while all other outflow figures came in below 100 BTC. What Happened To BTC The Last Time? The last time that Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw four consecutive days of outflows was in January, lasting from January 22 to January 25. This also bears some similarities to the current outflow trend in some was, one of which was the outflows began at the start of the week and carried through to the end. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Is Headed For $27 As 2017 Pattern Emerges However, a difference between both times is that the ETFs had just begun trading with trading days fluctuating between inflows and outflows. Meanwhile, the current trend has come after almost two consecutive weeks of inflows, something that could have an impact on the BTC price going forward. In January, after four days, the outflows had begun to slow down, and by Friday, there was a change in direction, with inflows beginning to dominate. Once the tide turned and ETF inflows began to rise, the BTC price followed sharply. With the climb came a more established rally in the Bitcoin price, causing it to go from $40,000 to over $70,000 in the space of two months. If this trend repeats and inflows into Spot BTC ETFs outpace outflows, then the BTC price is expected to start climbing again. However, if the outflows continue, then the BTC price could be in for further crashes.
