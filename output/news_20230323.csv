42387864,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQuXG9,1679615551,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Regains Momentum as Investors Shrug Off Banking, Fed Concerns","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin rebounded past $28K a day after an unwelcome – in some corners – U.S. central bank interest rate hike sent the price spinning downward. Will the momentum last?  Insights: Bitcoin addresses with a balance of 1,000 bitcoins are declining. What does it mean?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,218 +43.7 ▲ 3.7% Bitcoin (BTC) $28,392 +1054.0 ▲ 3.9% Ethereum (ETH) $1,821 +81.8 ▲ 4.7% S&P 500  3,948.72 +11.8 ▲ 0.3% Gold  $1,995 +47.7 ▲ 2.5% Nikkei 225  27,419.61 −47.0 ▼ 0.2% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin Shows Its Resilience, Rebounds Past $28K  So much for fears about federal monetary policy, increased regulatory activity and banking unrest.  A day after bitcoin plunged following a disappointing – to some observers – U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike, investors sent the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization floating above $28,000 again, about where it stood earlier in the week when hopes were high for a cessation of central bank hawkishness.  BTC was recently trading at about $28,393, up 3.8% over the past 24 hours. Even that level represented a retreat from loftier air nearer to $29,000 earlier in the day. Bitcoin has risen about 22% this month and more than 65% since January 1.  ""The crypto ecosystem is under attack. You're seeing all of those regulation by enforcement attempts, but also the banking crisis that has spread to banks (that) serve the crypto community,"" Benoit Bosc, global head of product at crypto trading firm GSR Markets, told CoinDesk TV. ""As a result, you have this flight to quality to the majors. Bitcoin has benefited the most, and it's rallied significantly ever since those events have started. This been the case with the action of the Fed yesterday in their refusal to really consider any cuts but even refusal to pause in the cycle of hikes.""  Bosc said that markets recoiled from comments on Wednesday by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who reiterated their concerns about inflation. Powell fell short of guaranteeing that the bank wouldn't raise interest rates again, which some Fed critics have blamed for recent banking calamities, and Yellen would not promise to protect all bank deposits in the event of a more widely spread sector collapse without congressional approval. In the aftermath, risk assets of nearly all stripes plunged, sweeping up cryptos.  ""The first reaction is one that's correlated to all risk assets; it's a little leg down,"" Bosc said. ""But then after that, you do become, you know, you have that store of value, digital gold feature of bitcoin, which is that, you still have inflation. They're fighting it, but it still exists.  He added: ""Bitcoin has a limited supply, and so that's a better alternative. You also have issues with stable coins. So bitcoin suddenly seems more stable and safe than those at the moment.""  Ether, the second-largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at $1,810, up 4.6% from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos were largely in the green, regaining ground lost the previous day. Stablecoin XRP and TRX, the token of blockchain-based platform Tron Network, recently rose 5.7% and 9.4%, respectively. TRX dropped the previous day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) charged its founder with selling and airdropping unregistered securities, fraud and market manipulation. Litecoin (LTC) continued its recent momentum, rising 7.8%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of overall market performance, was up 4.2%.  Misdeeds continued to buffet the industry as New York federal prosecutors charged Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon with fraud hours after he was arrested by police in Montenegro. On Wednesday, the SEC warned Coinbase that the agency was pursuing an enforcement action against the exchange.  In an email to CoinDesk, Ilya Volkov, CEO of YouHodler, a Swiss-based international fintech platform providing Web3 crypto and fiat service, noted bitcoin's resilience following the Fed decision. ""Crypto is an integral part of the global financial markets,"" Volkov said.  GSR's Bosc was upbeat about crypto's future. ""You have just this morning Do Kwon, and this market, just shrugged it off and continued to rise and stabilize at a level that seemed very elevated,"" he said. ""A couple of months ago, it was no one thought we would be there. Those events a couple of years ago would have decimated the market. It's very interesting to see how strong the market is.""  He added: ""I don't see it as a risk on rally. But it does give me a lot of confidence in this ecosystem, this community and in the chance for adoption a lot faster than people anticipated.""

42393750,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA1Kd,1679610275,Is This Finally an Atomic Bomb From the SEC?,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s notice to Coinbase (COIN) that it’s likely to be accused of breaking securities laws could foreshadow an agency effort to break the back of the crypto sector as it now operates, but it also may finally force court rulings that define how the industry can move forward.  The so-called Wells Notice that informs Coinbase about the looming potential enforcement action is sparse on details, but it said the next steps could bring injunctions and cease-and-desist orders against aspects of its business, including its staking service and some of its asset listings. Because the company has already announced its intention to keep going, such legal orders will likely be fought in court, where judges may finally settle the questions the industry had previously hoped the SEC would answer.  “Cases need to get before judges in order to get clarity on when tokens become securities and when the trading of tokens requires registration as an exchange,” wrote Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst at TD Cowen, in a note to clients. “The SEC bringing an action against Coinbase is a long-term positive for the space.”  Neither the regulators nor a sluggish U.S. Congress have so far produced any sector-specific rules of the road.  “Who can define what is a security? The Congress, of course, the SEC or the courts,” Caroline Pham, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), said this week at a crypto event in Washington, D.C. “And out of those three tracks I think you see courts moving the fastest,” observed the commissioner, whose agency is considered a possible leading watchdog for crypto trading.  Litigation  Coinbase has so far signaled it intends to take the SEC to court.  “We remain confident in the legality of our assets and services, and, if needed, we welcome a legal process to provide the clarity we have been advocating for and to demonstrate that the SEC simply has not been fair or reasonable when it comes to its engagement on digital assets,” Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote in a company blog post.  Of course, the three-year battle between the SEC and Ripple – possibly approaching its conclusion – demonstrates that court cases can stretch out for years, and appeals can make that even longer.  For its part, the SEC’s notice was short on information about just how the company is in violation. Grewal indicated the complaint is focused on “an undefined portion of our listed digital assets, our staking service Coinbase Earn, Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Wallet.”  A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment.  Though the SEC signed off when Coinbase became a public company with this same business model in 2021, the agency’s lawyers have slowly built a case against the exchange. Though they hadn’t yet directly confronted the public company, enforcement cases established an agency view that unregistered securities have been traded on the Coinbase platform, potentially supporting a case that the company is operating illegally as an unregistered exchange. The regulator has also pursued crypto staking as another category of unregistered securities, possibly leaving Coinbase vulnerable on that front, too.  Wells Notices are meant to give a company a chance to rebut the findings of the SEC’s enforcement staff before it pursues charges, but the “vagueness of this notice deprives Coinbase of that opportunity and lacks due process,” tweeted Brian Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner who is now head of policy for a16z Crypto.  Runway  SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been threatening that the runway was getting short for firms to comply with rules that the industry says are fundamentally at odds with how crypto works. With Wednesday’s formal warning, Gensler may have found the end of the runway.  He claims that crypto tokens are generally securities, except for bitcoin. If registered exchanges can’t trade unregistered securities, such crypto platforms would stand empty. So the industry has so far maintained a standoff in which many advocates of virtual assets argue Gensler is setting an impossible task as a means to kill U.S. crypto.  The Coinbase development is ratcheting up that open contempt. “The SEC has abandoned its mission of protecting investors and is using fear tactics to effectuate a political power grab,” said Perianne Boring, CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce in Washington.  The case of Coinbase undermines Gensler’s oft-repeated rhetoric that industry players should come into the SEC to figure out how to comply, because one person familiar with the situation said that Coinbase has had dozens of direct interactions with the agency, including in-person meetings, in an attempt to find a way to meet SEC expectations. The person said the regulator declined to answer questions or respond to proposals from the company.  Before now, the SEC has pursued an array of enforcement actions against what it considered issuers of unregistered securities. Recently, those accusations have come at a furious pace, including in a settlement with crypto exchange Kraken over the staking of tokens in the U.S. But the agency hasn’t yet directly targeted a major exchange for its core business as a trading platform. Is it doing that now? The Wells Notice isn’t clear on that point.  “A reprehensible amount of resources and brainpower have been spent in the U.S. trying to engage with this SEC and trying to create substance and a path out of the wraithlike comments issued by the agency,” said Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation. “Are we really going to allow one agency in the U.S. to set the entire trajectory of an innovation for the entire country, especially if that agency refuses to engage with the industry it is trying to regulate?”  Steering with enforcement  One senior official inside a U.S. regulatory agency told CoinDesk this week that there’s plenty of internal frustration over watching famously sluggish bureaucracies in Europe move ahead of the U.S. on crypto oversight. But rather than waiting for formal authorizations from Congress to approach digital assets on tailored turf, Gensler has chosen to use existing laws to treat those businesses exactly the same as traditional financial firms, steering their behavior with enforcement actions.  His agency also issued an investor warning on Thursday, less than 24 hours after its Wells Notice was revealed, advising that people who put their money in crypto should be prepared to lose it. The alert said that investors “may not benefit from rules that protect against fraud, manipulation, front-running, wash sales and other misconduct when intermediaries for those products do not comply with the federal securities laws that apply to registered exchanges.”  Coinbase executives took to Twitter on Thursday, where some 3,700 people tuned in to a live session to hear the company’s complaints.  CEO Brian Armstrong ended it by encouraging people to sign up to the political organization his company started, Crypto435, that’s meant to lobby members of Congress in support of digital assets.  “We’re going to ask people to show up at town halls, contact their congresspeople,” he said. “The government works for the people, not the other way around.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/23/is-this-finally-an-atomic-bomb-from-the-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea8e1928d0d5811a7ae0cae6f6d5ad3d5dd2b714-2932x1649.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That’s sparked dissent from some of its token holders – and on Thursday a response from the CEO.  In a governance call on ROOK’s Discord server that CoinDesk attended, the project’s pseudonymous leader Hazard pushed back on perceptions that management has failed to deliver. Their recent silence on progress and lack of a road map is a function of ROOK’s clientele and their “conservative” lawyers' preference for staying quiet, he said.  “We’re bound by the will of the order flow providers,” Hazard said of those who want to use ROOK to capture transaction value – aka maximal extractable value, or MEV – on Ethereum. “They’re the customer, and the customer is always right.”  The comments came as some in the ROOK DAO chafe at what they view to be a stagnating project no longer working in the best interest of its community. One recent proposal calls for the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to dissolve and split ROOK’s treasury – worth nearly $50 million in various cryptos – among holders of the ROOK token.  ROOK’s token has gone largely sideways this year even as many other crypto assets have rallied hard. Still, it was trading around $15.71 at press time, up nearly 12% in 24 hours.  On the call Hazard downplayed the importance of the token and cautioned speculators not to think it will perform based on the output of ROOK – a key prong in determining what is and isn’t a security. ROOK token gives its holders voting power in decisions put before the DAO.  But the DAO has had little operational say recently in what ROOK’s been doing – or even transparency into what ROOK’s management has been doing. Hazard acknowledged this on the call and blamed it on the “large projects” interested in using ROOK: “Their constraints are what's causing us to be a little bit more gagged about what we can talk about.”  “It's difficult to have public governance with private information,” Hazard said on the call. “Perhaps it’s the case that it has swung a little bit too far toward private information and maybe we need to swing back a bit.”  For Wismerhill, a pseudonymous self-described trading fund who recently called for ROOK’s dissolution, Hazard’s demurring on road map transparency “can be understood,” but only to a point.  “If this is the case this project can no longer be governed by a DAO, which relies on public information to operate,” Wismerhill said in a message with CoinDesk.

Kwon, whose location had been a mystery for months, also faces an investigation in South Korea and has been on an Interpol wanted list in connection with last year's terraUSD (UST) collapse. Kwon already faced civil charges filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged in February that he misled investors.  According to the complaint, Kwon is being charged with conspiracy to defraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to engage in market manipulation. A spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk that the Department of Justice would seek his extradition to the U.S.  The filing alleged that Kwon made a number of ""untrue and misleading statements of material fact"" over the course of several years, citing TV appearances and tweets from accounts tied to Terraform Labs (TFL).  ""Kwon agreed with others to defraud purchasers of cryptocurrencies issued by TFL, by deceiving those purchasers about the effectiveness of the algorithmic mechanism that purportedly ensured the stability of UST's price through false statements and market manipulation,"" the filing alleged under one of the charges.  The filing said that Kwon ""contacted representatives of a United States trading and investment firm"" for help in ""altering the market price of UST,"" which the company provided. The Securities and Exchange Commission made a similar allegation in its own complaint, and CoinDesk later reported this firm appeared to be Jump Crypto.  Filip Adzic, the interior minister of Montenegro, announced Kwon had been arrested by police at an airport with falsified documents earlier on Thursday. The Korean National Police Agency later confirmed his identity.  Read More: Do Kwon Arrested in Montenegro: Interior Minister  CoinDesk  UPDATE (March 23, 2023, 21:55 UTC): Adds detail throughout.

These are tokens that have yet to enter the market. Eligible addresses have 184 days left to claim their tokens, if they haven’t already.  The effect that token supply can have on emerging markets was on full display Thursday morning when Arbitrum’s claims website collapsed due to heavy traffic, artificially restricting the airdrop’s initial redemption rate.

BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading at around $28,200 Thursday afternoon, up over 4% in the past 24 hours.

""The recent crypto rally has been fueled by bank runs that have led many to become skeptical with traditional banking, given all the vulnerabilities with deposit flights,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote Thursday. Moya believes that BTC needs ""a fresh catalyst"" to break above $30,000 and enjoy a more extended rally.  Ether (ETH) jumped over 5% to recently trade at $1,818 Thursday afternoon. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value surged as high as $1,858 earlier in the day – its highest level since August.  Litecoin (LTC) recently rose 12% for the day to hover at $93.

In an email, Chen also told CoinDesk that “the Fed’s concerns about inflation may have also fueled interest in cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against inflation.” He added that the market's spike also coincided with news that Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs, appears to have been arrested in Montenegro, which may have contributed to ""short-term volatility.""

The buyback agreement marks the ongoing efforts of FTX CEO John J. Ray III to maximize what creditors recover from Sam Bankman-Fried’s collapsed crypto exchange, a process that includes the liquidation of several crown jewels in the FTX Ventures portfolio.  Mysten Labs, which has yet to release its highly anticipated SUI token, offered to repurchase the assets in an offer letter to the FTX estate on March 16. According to court filings, the FTX bankruptcy estate retained investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners (PWP) to solicit interest from other potential buyers before ultimately entering into the deal with Mysten.  Read More: FTX Bankruptcy Estate to Claw Back $460M From Modulo Capital  In August, FTX Ventures led Mysten Labs’ high-profile $2 billion Series B fundraise, just months before FTX filed for bankruptcy in November. The firm invested $101 million in the round, receiving about 570,000 shares of preferred equity in Mysten Labs and warrants to purchase up to about 890,000,000 SUI tokens, according to court filings. FTX entities paid about $101 million for the equity and an additional $1 million for the token warrants.  “After thoroughly evaluating alternatives with the assistance of PWP, the Debtors determined that it was in the best interest of their estates and their constituents to proceed with [Mysten Labs, Inc.] and work toward executing a mutually agreeable transaction, with the expectation that the Debtors will continue marketing the Interests and confirming that no higher and better offer exists over the course of the coming weeks,” said the filing.

The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, which have been tightly correlated throughout much of their histories, have differed in performance this year. That difference has accelerated since the middle of this month. The ETH/BTC pair has declined 17% since mid-January and 11% since March 12.  BTC and ETH have had different levels of success in 2023, with BTC increasing in price by 65% and ETH rising an impressive but less robust 45% for the year to date. The disparity between the two highlights the resilience of one and the potential opportunity in the other.  Wednesday’s Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points resulted in both BTC and ETH selling off, but under different circumstances.  BTC’s daily trading volume on Wednesday was nearly identical to its 20-day moving average, falling 3%. ETH’s 4% decline, however, was fueled by trading volume that exceeded its 20-day average by 24%  Why?  The answer appears to link to recent turmoil involving Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the banking industry in general. Two events appear to have occurred:  Bitcoin enjoyed a flight to safety as concerns about the banking industry ramped up. As a result, the ""bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currency debasement"" argument resurfaced.  The subsequent guarantee of deposits at SVB alleviated some concerns about digital assets, given the institution's ties to the crypto sector.  So on one hand, BTC catches a bid higher because investors see value in an asset that resides outside traditional banking landscape. It then catches an additional bid as concerns about crypto firms’ deposits at beleaguered banks subside.  The combination of factors has driven bitcoin higher. BTC’s correlation with the dollar index (DXY) has moved to -0.78, indicating a growing inverse relationship between BTC and the U.S. dollar.  Asset correlations range between 1 and -1, with numbers close to 1 indicating a direct pricing relationship, and numbers closer to -1 indicating an inverse relationship.  BTC’s correlation with ETH remains strong at 0.97 but declined to 0.39 on Wednesday as the FOMC made its rate announcement.  Little changed specific to the assets themselves, just the degree to which they respond to Fed monetary policy. Following the intraday decline in correlation, BTC and ETH rapidly regained their ties.  This trend could well catch the eye of bullish ETH traders who view the disparity in performance as overdone and unjustified.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/23/bitcoin-ether-diverging-paths-show-resilience-and-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3123065164b48202e243631aec5030bda34b0c88-2992x1683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token bounced as much as 4.8% to $28.75K earlier in the session, but then erased some of those gains to change hands at $28.18K as of 3:46 p.m. ET, even as regulators continued to crack down on the crypto industry. On Wednesday, BTC hit an intraday low of $26.74K, so the current rebound is notable. Similarly, ethereum ( ETH-USD ) perked up 5.4% to $1.81K after reaching as low as $1.73K post-Fed. Overall, the global crypto market cap gained 2% to $1.17T, data from CoinMarketCap showed. Crypto prices were unbothered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sending a Wells notice to crypto exchange Coinbase Global ( COIN ), whereby SEC staff recommended enforcement action against the company for allegedly breaching securities laws. COIN plummeted 15% at the time of writing. Shortly thereafter, the regulator voiced concerns about the crypto trading platforms that may not be complying with federal securities laws, warning that the risk of loss for crypto asset investors ""remains significant."" Some suggest increased crypto regulation is a positive for the space as it pushes out the so-called bad actors and protects investors from fraud and manipulation, thus boosting investor confidence. Crypto-exposed stocks were mostly gapping higher towards the end of the session, with Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), +15% , Bakkt ( BKKT ), +14.7% , BIT Mining ( BTCM ), +11.8% , and Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ), +8% , among the biggest gainers. While their relationship has been weaker than usual in recent weeks, it's worth noting that higher crypto prices were accompanied by a stronger stock market .

Details are limited, but I suspect Coinbase's staking service is the target. Staking, or ""blockchain rewards"" happens to be one of COIN's only growth segments in 2022. If staking services are indeed in the crosshairs, a loss in court will likely have implications for Ethereum. The war between the Securities Exchange Commission and the entire domestic cryptocurrency industry seems to be hitting a fever pitch after a post-market close Wells Notice disclosure from Coinbase ( COIN ) yesterday. In response to the announcement, Coinbase shares traded down 14% after hours Wednesday and opened more than 20% off at the start of today's session. With this notice, the SEC is telegraphing legal action and Coinbase appears ready for a fight : We are confident in the legality of our assets and services, and if needed, we welcome a legal process to provide the clarity we have been advocating for and to demonstrate that the SEC simply has not been fair or reasonable when it comes to its engagement on digital assets. It seems fairly certain at this point that the two sides will be meeting in court and the company is left guessing what the exact battlefront will be. According to Coinbase's blog post detailing the notice: Today's Wells notice does not provide a lot of information for us to respond to. The SEC staff told us they have identified potential violations of securities law, but little more. We asked the SEC specifically to identify which assets on our platforms they believe may be securities, and they declined to do so. Today's Wells notice also comes after Coinbase provided multiple proposals to the SEC about registration over the course of months, all of which the SEC ultimately refused to respond to. At this point it isn't entirely clear what the SEC will be bringing to the table but if we look at other clues, I think it's reasonable to assume Coinbase's staking services are going to be the main target. In addition to the Wells notice disclosure yesterday, Coinbase also informed customers on Wednesday that the company would be ending Algorand ( ALGO-USD ) rewards through the Coinbase platform. Staking as a service was also the catalyst behind Kraken's settlement with the SEC earlier this year. Staking Revenue & Broader Implications If it is indeed staking products that the SEC takes issue with, that line of business is quickly becoming an important part of Coinbase's monetization model as it's grown from just 3% of revenue in 2021 to nearly 9% of revenue in 2022: Q4-21 Q1-22 Q2-22 Q3-22 Q4-22 2021 2022 Blockchain Rewards 102.7 81.9 68.4 62.8 62.4 223.1 275.5 Total Revenue 2,490.0 1,164.9 802.6 576.4 604.9 7,354.8 3,148.8 Blockchain Rewards % of Total 4.12% 7.03% 8.52% 10.90% 10.32% 3.03% 8.75% Source: Coinbase, millions of $ While staking is certainly not the main source of Coinbase's revenue, blockchain rewards have been one of only real revenue growth areas for Coinbase outside of interest accrued on USCoin USD ( USDC-USD ) holdings over the last year: Revenue Type 2021 2022 YoY Transaction; Consumer 6,491 2,236.9 -65.54% Transaction; Institutional 346.3 119.3 -65.55% Blockchain Rewards 223.1 275.5 23.49% Custodial fees 136.3 79.8 -41.45% Interest Income 25.8 327 1167.44% Other subscription and Services 132.3 110.3 -16.63% Source: Coinbase, millions of $ The biggest source of the blockchain rewards revenue comes from staking Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and that brings us to the broader implications of what could be an important court battle with the SEC. ETH Stake (Dune Analytics/hildobby) Coinbase is one of the largest stakers on the Ethereum chain and accounts for 12.7% of the 17.9 million ETH staked. Kraken is also a significant supplier of ETH stake and together they make up nearly 20% of the ETH stake. The Shanghai upgrade is expected any week. Shanghai will allow the beginning of ETH deposits to be withdrawn from stake. If it is ultimately determined by a court that Coinbase can't continue to offer its ETH staking service, it is almost certainly going to have an impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. We're still probably a long way from that being decided, but it is something that COIN holders and ETH holders should keep in mind. Why These Services Exist I think it's important to note that there is a key difference between what Kraken's staking service was offering and what Coinbase's staking services offer. Kraken's product was more similar to what companies like Celsius ( CEL-USD ) and Nexo ( NEXO-USD ) typically offered customers. Those products were marketing set yields on deposits with less clarity on how the yield was being generated. For Coinbase, the product is more straightforward. Proof-of-Stake blockchain validation requires staked assets directly on the chain rather than dumping capital into expensive mining machines that consume a lot of energy. However similar to the high cost associated with running a mining rig operation, many of these PoS blockchains require staking minimums that are too onerous for everyday users who want to participate. Ethereum is a good example of such a blockchain and this problem has led to the rise of on-chain staking-as-a-service protocols like Lido Finance ( LDO-USD ) and RocketPool ( RPL-USD ). These protocols allow smaller holders to pool their assets together to generate staking rewards for a fee to the protocol. These pooled asset protocols are very similar to what Coinbase offers, but Coinbase does so through a centralized KYC/AML compliant exchange. Summary The Wells Notice is almost certainly foreshadowing a court battle between Coinbase and the SEC. While Grayscale is fighting the SEC in court on a completely different front, there is little doubt in my view that the war between the crypto industry and US regulators is beginning to intensify. That war is probably going to be expensive and it could ultimately result in Coinbase being required to eliminate one of its revenue growth segments. I think it takes some guts to long COIN here and I'd personally rather use Coinbase as a consumer than invest in the business today.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589665-coinbase-wells-notice-what-at-stake?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10980490.jpeg

The danger, however, is that crypto companies may simply move outside the U.S., she said.  “There are other jurisdictions around the world that are looking at ways to embrace the technology, to embrace the innovation and the developers that are working on it and they're establishing regulatory clarity,” Quick said.  On Wednesday, the SEC issued a Wells Notice to Coinbase for allegedly selling unregistered securities on its exchange and through its staking service.  “The silver lining, to the extent there is one of this type of development, is that it will force the establishment of case law that will inform how crypto is regulated and it will set some rules of the road for crypto to comply with,” Quick said.  In a blog post, Coinbase said it has met with the SEC more than 30 times in the last nine months, seeking more “reasonable crypto rules.”  Quick said that it isn’t so much that there are “onerous disclosure requirements” or hefty lumps of money to register, it’s that “there are elements of existing securities laws that simply don't work with the technological innovation of crypto.""

42393747,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA1AN,1679595601,Dreams of Rebooting FTX Face Cold Reality That Its Technology Wasn’t Well-Regarded,"When the new boss of FTX, John J. Ray III, told The Wall Street Journal in January that he was thinking of rebooting the disgraced cryptocurrency exchange, the comment made a splash in the industry.  Before spectacularly collapsing in November, FTX had been one of largest players in crypto, with an especially big presence in derivatives trading. So a resurrection was tantalizing – both for Ray, whose job is to maximize how much money creditors recover, and for its former customers.  But interviews with people in major trading firms that once did business at FTX raise questions about whether there’s really anything worth bringing back, possibly explaining why no public progress has been made since Ray’s ear-catching comments two months ago.  While the financial woes that ultimately wrecked FTX became clear in late 2022, these interviews with CoinDesk make clear the technical side of the exchange was weak since its inception, a thorn in the side of Ray’s revival plans. Woefully high latency, bugs in the application programming interface (API) traders use to interface with FTX and coding mishaps plagued the exchange, according to several former clients who spoke to CoinDesk.  FTX was “slow, incomplete, buggy and coded by people who had never done it before,” said Max Boonen, the founder of B2C2, one of the most active FTX market makers.  Round-trip latency on FTX – how long it took a customer to be told its trade had gone live in the exchange’s order book – was about 150 milliseconds typically and 600 to 800 milliseconds during busier periods, said Abraham Chaibi, co-founder of Dexterity Capital, another speed-sensitive former customer. (There are 1,000 milliseconds in a second.)  That’s much slower than Binance, he added, noting round-trip latency there is about 5 to 10 milliseconds.  “Propagating notifications of your fills was very slow on FTX. If you actually wanted to know promptly that your order had been filled you needed to repetitively query the state of your order” every millisecond, Chaibi said.  Speed matters quite a lot for market makers like B2C2 and Dexterity. There was good reason for them to do business there, regardless, given that so much volume took place at FTX during its glory days. But market makers are a key group of firms an exchange needs to thrive, supplying liquidity by purchasing from essentially anyone who wants to sell, and selling to those who want to buy.  Given FTX’s fall from grace, there’s a high bar to bringing it back to life. And those technical deficiencies, in the face of that, may matter more.  “In terms of latency they are by far the slowest exchange to be traded on,” said Mike van Rossum, founder and CEO of trading firm Folkvang.  Aside from slow order routing, FTX also famously went down during periods of volatility. This came to a crescendo when the Federal Reserve released a market-moving economic report on U.S. inflation in September. FTX buckled under the pressure and froze for 55 minutes as traders watched prices bounce around on other exchanges.  There were “tons of issues,” van Rossum said. “The API fell over for a few hours during high volatility. It was a very messy exchange and it was the exchange that we had most problems with.”  Firms like Folkvang stayed because FTX monopolized retail liquidity. It was easier to trade with larger size because order books were populated with the orders of a million retail customers. “FTX was loved for its features, not latency,” van Rossum added.  FTX pioneered a user-friendly collateral model that would eventually contribute to its downfall. Alameda Research’s balance sheet, as revealed by a CoinDesk report in November, was laden with illiquid altcoins Serum, Maps and FTT. This was then used as collateral on a series of loans. When the market eventually slumped, the value of those altcoins dropped to a level that meant FTX could no longer honor customer withdrawals.  The collateral feature allowed users to hold assets such as bitcoin, ether, stablecoins or even lower-market capitalization altcoins, and trade derivatives – effectively allowing traders to hold a diverse portfolio while being able to trade perpetual swap contracts that can be used to hedge or increase exposure. And while this feature was lauded by users, it was ultimately unsustainable. If FTX comes back without such features, the bugs and sluggish software could matter more.  “FTX let you withdraw cash (USD) collateralized by other coins,” Chaibi said. “For example, if you have a huge balance of FTT you could withdraw USD and FTX would treat it as a ‘loan’ with very little haircut. No other exchange lets you withdraw a negative balance like this. It is and was insane.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Oliver Knight, Helene Braun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/23/dreams-of-rebooting-ftx-face-cold-reality-that-its-technology-wasnt-well-regarded,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e606bf82601067c85c534cb24d2285a3c4f34c7-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move comes after Quasar raised $5.4 million in a funding round led by Shima Capital earlier this year at a $70 million valuation, bringing the total fund raised to over $11.5 million, the protocol said in a press release on Thursday.  Quasar said it aims to become the leading decentralized asset management platform by enabling connectivity among blockchains via Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). ""Powered by IBC-enabled smart contracts, Quasar’s goal is to empower investors with easy access to the emerging interchain landscape of numerous individual blockchains, within the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond,"" the press release said.  In the wake of the spectacular failure of centralized exchanges such as FTX, both crypto natives and investors have increased their focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and security. Quasar is aiming to address these issues by creating a dedicated layer 1 protocol that will allow investors to deposit funds into permissionless, non-custodial investment vehicles known as ""vaults,"" that are optimized to work across multiple blockchains, the press release said.  The system is also designed to eliminate the need for cross-chain bridges, which have proven to be risky for DeFi investors, resulting in over $2 billion in losses in 2022 alone.  By giving investors access to the developing interchain landscape of independent and interoperable blockchains, both within and outside the Cosmos ecosystem, Quasar hopes to allow investors to have greater control over their investments.

According to the report, virtual land trading reached an all-time high this past quarter with 147,000 trades, thanks to platforms such as Yuga Labs' Otherside and MG Land that dominated the space.  Interested in keeping up with Web3 news and trends? Subscribe to The Airdrop here.  Otherdeed NFTs, which are linked to land in the Otherside metaverse, registered $222 million in trading volume in the first quarter – a 237% increase from the previous quarter. According to the report, one Otherdeed NFT sold for 186 ETH (about $2.85 million at the time) – the highest recorded sale for virtual land last quarter. Earlier this month, Yuga Labs announced the official date of its ""Second Trip"" for holders of Otherdeed NFTs, which likely contributed to its uptick.  Another reason for the increase in trading volume is due to NFT marketplace Blur's ""airdrop seasons and farming,"" according to Sara Gherghelas, blockchain analyst at DappRadar. ""The NFT whales decided to farm [virtual] land, especially the MG Land project, which is an NFT collection.""  The Sandbox, Axie Infinity and Decentraland also made the list of top virtual world decentralized apps (dapps) last quarter, though all were topped by lesser-known Createra Genesis Land with $14 million in trading volume. Createra Genesis Land raised a $10 million funding round in January 2023 led by A16z and focuses on enabling user-generated metaverse creations.  Decentraland's upcoming Metaverse Fashion Week has increased the number of unique active wallets on Decentraland over the last week, the report says, and also boosted trading volume on the platform by 63%. Meanwhile, 10KTF, a digital fashion shop launched in 2021 and acquired by Yuga Labs in November 2022, also experienced a major spike in trading volume last quarter across several of its collections.  ""Everything related to 10KTF are the highest NFT collections traded this quarter,"" noted Gherghelas. ""After they announced 10KTF was acquired by Yuga, we saw this massive increase.""  According to DappRadar, $417.5 million was invested into blockchain gaming and metaverse projects in Q1 2023.

42421290,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXno6P,1679592383,The SEC’s Scattershot Approach Shows Its Weakness,"It was a triple whammy from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Coinbase said it received a message saying the SEC essentially intends to sue over violations related to the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange’s staking service and possibly token listings. And separately, the SEC filed a lawsuit against one of crypto’s wealthiest and most influential entrepreneurs, Justin Sun, and it took aim at more than half-a-dozen celebrities who promoted TRON-related blockchain projects.  The particulars in Coinbase’s case are still mostly unknown. The exchange was served a “Wells Notice” – the same legal formality the SEC issued to stablecoin company Paxos last month derailing its Binance USD product – that serves as a fire alarm that the securities watchdog intends to bring the heat. The document hasn’t yet been made public, though many are interpreting it as a sign the agency is finally taking action against crypto exchanges simply for being crypto exchanges.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Just like when the SEC sued Kim Kardashian for failing to disclose she was a paid promoter of EthereumMAX, a project in no way related to Ethereum, the agency today is trying to send a signal. Chair Gary Gensler does not have the resources to go after every celebrity shill or wannabe influencer, so he has to pick his battles. He shoots for the top (the top being someone with millions of Insta followers) and hopes the message trickles down.  In the case of Justin Sun, the megalomaniac crypto billionaire who’s hard not to love, the SEC charged him and his companies, Tron Foundation Limited, BitTorrent Foundation Ltd. and Rainberry Inc., with offering and selling unregistered securities. He was also charged with manipulating markets, including allegations of wash trading TRX to artificially inflate the price of the token as well as directing payments to eight celebrity endorsers to create a false perception of investor interest.  See also: An Alleged Tornado Cash Developer Was Arrested. Are You Next?  Six of those celebrity endorsers, including “Parent Trap” star Lindsey Lohan, YouTuber Jake Paul and rappers Lil Yachty, Ne-Yo and Akon, have settled with the agency, paying in total more than $400,000 in fines, disgorgement and interest payments. On paper, this is a win for the underfunded agency, which under Gensler has taken the entire crypto industry into its purview. Gensler has stated quite frankly that nearly all cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin are securities, and that all paid promoters must disclose that they were paid.  But the fact that this stuff keeps happening, and that the SEC has to keep escalating its enforcement actions, only shows how ill-equipped the agency is to rein in crypto. Six celebrities settled but how many remain? How many could the SEC even go after – if they’re even aware of all the bad actors?  The irony here is that by trying to signal strength over the crypto industry, the SEC is essentially showing it has a very weak hand. The Kardashian suit looked bad enough after the collapse of the FTX exchange, which exemplified the poor priorities of the nation’s top securities regulator. And now that eight additional celebs with household names have been sued, it makes it seem like the agency is powerless to stop even low-effort (and frankly, comparatively, low-impact) crimes like failing to say an obvious crypto promotion is indeed a crypto promotion.  If I were a scam artist I wouldn’t feel scared now, I would feel relieved. Maybe emboldened. The SEC has its sights on targets that will garner impressive headlines, rather than the web of scams, “pig butchering” schemes and faulty projects across the crypto industry. And it’s not just the SEC’s fault but other agencies that seem to at random determine what projects to regulate. When enforcements are stochastic, they cannot be a deterrent – because “maybe getting arrested” is just part of the job for a scammer.  See also: Legal Expert Says Mango Markets Exploit Case Is Wake-Up Call for DAOs  The alternative, of course, is providing regulatory clarity. I won’t go into the details here, but you know it, I know it and Gensler knows it. The problem is, especially by threatening Coinbase, Gensler has backed himself into a corner. There are no new rules that need to be written, none of the particularities about how decentralized projects function need to be taken into account, he is suggesting. Crypto itself is bad. That’s a losing prospect for consumers who could benefit from crypto, people the agency is meant to serve – because crypto is too big to tackle and because much of it isn’t bad at all.  How all of this plays out remains to be seen. The U.S. government has essentially declared war on the industry and taken steps designed to debank and ostracize even registered crypto firms. Coinbase is likely going to take the matter to the courts. And if the exchange has grounds to question the SEC’s reasoning, the lawsuit may extend well past the point when Gensler leaves office in two years. But he’s made his mark. Let’s hope he doesn’t embolden actual scammers by muddying the water.

But the asset manager just moved the majority of its SUSHI token holdings, sparking fears in the Sushi community that it is exiting its position.  At press time, GoldenTree’s crypto wallet held just $1 million in SUSHI tokens, a precipitous drop from its nearly $7 million in exposure earlier this week.  The move comes as Sushi, a decentralized exchange for trading cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum blockchain, faces fresh scrutiny from U.S. regulators. On Tuesday, Sushi’s leader, Head Chef Jared Grey, revealed he and the decentralized autonomous organization were subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Grey didn't elaborate on the focus of the apparent investigation but called on the DAO to raise a $3 million legal defense fund.  SUSHI is the governance token for Sushi DAO and gives its holders a voice in how the exchange operates. It was trading at $1.22 immediately before Tuesday’s news but has fallen 11% in the days since and was around $1.08 at press time, according to CoinGecko.  A GoldenTree employee who goes by MarkOKW, who last October announced the firm’s SUSHI investment, didn't immediately comment. Grey declined to comment on GoldenTree’s SUSHI position.  On-chain activity reveals how GoldenTree has shuffled its holding in recent days. The asset manager started the week with xSUSHI tokens worth over $7 million. Then on Wednesday, it swapped 4.4 million of those tokens for 5.95 million SUSHI tokens that it had staked with Sushi. CoinDesk identified the wallets using Nansen.  On Wednesday night and Thursday morning, it sent two batches of tokens valued at $5.4 million total to an address controlled by crypto trading desk Cumberland. Cumberland sent the first half to a Binance deposit address Wednesday night; the other half hadn't moved out of Cumberland’s wallet at press time.

42421287,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXno7R,1679587568,Just Saying No to Digital Dollars Means Cementing the Surveillance Status Quo,"Earlier this week, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced legislation to amend Florida’s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) to prohibit central bank digital currencies (CBDC) from serving as money under Florida law. Gov. DeSantis, a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, is not the only political figure to propose that we “just say no” to CBDC. Congressional leaders from House Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), another former presidential contender, have echoed that call with legislation to restrict the Federal Reserve from deploying certain types of digital dollars without congressional authorization.  J. Christopher Giancarlo is senior counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher and previously served as the chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He is the author of “CryptoDad: The Fight for the Future of Money” and co-founder of the Digital Dollar Project, a nonprofit initiative to advance a U.S. central bank digital currency.  The problem with the “just say no” approach to CBDC is that it acquiesces to the rampant and undue commercial and government surveillance of the existing analog financial system. It does so at a time when the rest of the world is building efficient, networked digital economies that may, if designed right, better protect financial privacy and economic freedom.  CBDCs: Choice of surveillance or freedom  Gov. DeSantis says: “What the central bank digital currency is all about is surveilling Americans and controlling behavior of Americans."" The governor raises a legitimate concern. He is right that the rise of certain foreign CBDCs – particularly China’s e-CNY – create a benchmark for one kind of CBDC that will provide enormous financial surveillance and social control. You might call this form of CBDC a “surveillance coin.” DeSantis is also right that money in the United States must reflect the values of a free society, including individual privacy, free enterprise and economic freedom – a “freedom coin,” so to speak.  But DeSantis and other opponents of a U.S. CBDC are wrong to assume that a digital dollar is foreordained to be a surveillance coin and not a freedom coin. That will only be the case if the American people and their political leaders allow it to be so. In digitally designed currency, characteristics such as surveillance and censorship are design choices. There is no reason why the U.S. could not design a digital dollar with very different features that adhere to the democratic values of a free society, using cutting-edge, privacy-enhancing technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, digital credentials and homomorphic encryption.  Encoding freedom into a digital dollar  In a recent report, American Enterprise Institute scholar Jim Harper and I expand on the privacy principles published in 2021 by the Digital Dollar Project. Our report includes three key prescriptions:  First, a U.S. freedom coin must not weaken the personal financial privacy available with today’s paper cash.  Second, a U.S. CBDC must not become a new, easier avenue for government agencies to surveil citizens, censor lawful activities, levy fines and enact punishments/  Third, the advent of CBDCs offers the opportunity to reassess contemporary financial surveillance activities in their entirety and rebalance them in better accord with American constitutional norms, the presumption of innocence and the rule of law.  The sad fact is that our current financial system – before we even turn to digital currency – is far more subject to government surveillance than it has become socially acceptable to admit. Right now, financial service providers build dossiers about their customers, share customer information with each other and report an enormous amount of conventional financial transactions to the government without being compelled by a subpoena.  Private sector no better privacy protector  With existing surveillance at unprecedented levels, many reckon that a U.S. CBDC would incorporate the same degree of government monitoring. Some say, therefore, that development of digital money should be left to private-sector “stablecoin” developers. Yet, there is nothing inherently superior about stablecoins and non-sovereign digital currency in protecting individual privacy compared to CBDC. In fact, the current widespread practice of financial surveillance impedes the development of a true freedom coin by both the private and public sectors.  Read more: JP Schnapper-Casteras - Gov. Ron DeSantis, Privacy and the Politicization of the Digital Dollar  It is entirely foreseeable that private-sector sponsors of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins or even commercial servicers of digital dollars, such as wallet providers and others, could be compelled by government to conduct covert surveillance, report on activity and disable financial transactions with disfavored groups and activities in the same way many social media platforms, most notably Twitter, have bowed to political winds.  Under government badgering, and without being bound by constitutional protections for civil liberties, digital wallet providers might bar transactions with out-of-favor industries, depending on which position’s advocates hold political power. Want to purchase ammunition or an abortion? Want to give money to a controversial cause such as Planned Parenthood or Right to Life? You had best check the stablecoins' fluctuating terms of service and seek permission from its in-house “Office of Community Standards.”  In democratic societies, lawful transactions in digital money – sovereign or non-sovereign – must be immune from political surveillance and censorship regardless of who is in power today, four years from now and 10 years from now.  The global advent of CBDCs provides the opportunity to fully reassess contemporary financial surveillance activities. It provides the chance to reestablish financial law enforcement in truer accord with American constitutional norms, the presumption of innocence and the rule of law. In fact, the “just say no” approach to CBDC development does nothing to address the constitutionally dubious financial surveillance that is already commonplace. “Just say no” to CBDC may imply saying “yes” to today’s burgeoning financial surveillance.  Ready or not, CBDCs are coming  Whether the U.S. participates or not, the rest of the world is exploring and deploying CBDCs. According to the Atlantic Council, 114 countries, representing more than 95% of global gross domestic product, are exploring CBDCs. Actively engaged in this digital gold rush are 19 of the G-20 countries, including India, Japan, Russia and South Korea, each of which has made significant recent progress. The European Central Bank is expected to introduce a prototype for a “digital euro” by the end of 2023, becoming more widely available by 2025. The central banks of some of the freest societies on Earth – from Sweden to Japan and England – are exploring their own CBDCs.  Americans and American multinational corporations will soon contend with CBDCs worldwide, whether or not the U.S. deploys a digital dollar at home. What remains unknown is whether surveillance coins, such as China’s e-CNY, will have the world to themselves, or whether they will encounter competition from freedom coins issued by traditional democracies such as the United States. The potential risks of failing to even consider a freedom coin form of digital dollar are too great to ignore.  Read more: Ananya Kumar - In Defense of a Digital Dollar  America’s economic competitors and economic adversaries have taken the lead in setting standards for the future of money. Their issuance of CBDCs will significantly impact the U.S. regardless of whether a handful of American states seek to prohibit their use. The assertion the U.S. should simply withdraw from global CBDC discussions is an unworthy position for the custodian of the world’s reserve currency. The prospect of letting the future of money pass by is a profound disservice to the American people and economy.  We should take our rightful place as a leader in developing standards for digital currencies and future-proof our economy for the increasingly digitally networked 21st century. These standards should reflect the U.S.’ enduring values of the rule of law, social and economic liberty, free enterprise, and personal and financial privacy.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION,J Christopher Giancarlo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/23/just-saying-no-to-digital-dollars-means-cementing-the-surveillance-status-quo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d82445d78220a371fcb0541d07fed34d66937e8b-541x304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

10979712,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589603-coinbase-all-is-not-wells?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1679584620,Coinbase: All's Not Well(s),"Summary Company received a Wells Notice after the close on Wednesday. The notice to Coinbase covers certain ""undefined"" portions of its assets listed on its exchange and the staking service Coinbase Earn, Coinbase Prime, and Coinbase Wallet. SEC moves come on top of what I believe is structurally unsound business model. The Update: Coinbase Gets a Wells Notice After the close on Wednesday (March 22) Coinbase ( COIN ) announced that it had received a Wells Notice from the SEC. The agency issues these notices after it has finished an investigation into potential violation of securities laws. Companies are allowed to respond to the notices and these responses can lead to negotiations between the company and the SEC. Enforcement actions (fines, settlements, ceasing of certain operations) often follow such events. Very little detail was released about what comprised the potential violations of securities law. The company did not speculate and nothing was released in the notice. The company claims they had met with the SEC over thirty times in the past nine months to resolve what I assume are a number of issues. The company came out swinging after announcing the notice. It published a response on its blog : Today, the SEC gave Coinbase a “Wells notice” regarding an undefined portion of our listed digital assets, our staking service Coinbase Earn, Coinbase Prime, and Coinbase Wallet after a cursory investigation. We are prepared for this disappointing outcome. We are confident in the legality of our assets and services, and if needed, we welcome a legal process to provide the clarity we have been advocating for and to demonstrate that the SEC simply has not been fair or reasonable when it comes to its engagement on digital assets. Rest assured, Coinbase products and services continue to operate as usual - today’s news does not require any changes to our current products or services. SEC Chairperson Gary Gensler has been extremely vocal in his views that cryptocurrencies are securities and should be subject to SEC regulation. Ironically, COIN argues in their blog that they have been asking the agency for clear regulation that they could follow. Regulatory uncertainty in the crypto industry is getting worse. Instead of developing a regulatory framework for crypto, the SEC is continuing to regulate by enforcement only. We recently explained in an amicus brief the lack of guidance for crypto companies to follow. Nevertheless, we have continued to try and engage with the SEC. In addition to our attempts to develop a registration path, we have repeatedly, formally asked the SEC to engage in rulemaking for our industry. We filed a petition for rulemaking last summer. On Monday, we submitted another substantive comment letter in support of the petition, detailing the need for clarity around the SEC’s views of staking services and the lack of notice to the industry about any SEC concerns. Since I am neither a lawyer nor a regulator and I was not present during these meetings between the company and the SEC (although I'd LOVE to have been a fly on the wall), it's hard to gauge whether the company is spinning actions that they know the SEC does not like into innocent course of business or SEC is acting in a heavy-handed manner. It might be a little bit of both. Either way, despite the company's protestations, it is decidedly NOT GOOD to have a Wells Notice hanging over your head. At the very least, it becomes a management distraction, costs a ton of money in legal bills, and injects uncertainty into future profitability (if COIN had profits). SEC Problems Lumped on Top of Questionable Business Model I have written several bearish articles on COIN. In my latest piece Coinbase: Low Quality Revenue 'Beat Can't Hide Bad Volumes or Low Visibility , I argued that retail transaction volume came in a 9-quarter low and Monthly Transacting Users declined q/q and y/y to 8.3 million. As an exchange, Users and Volume are the name of the game. The company has likely benefited from the price rally in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) but those prices are fickle. Volume and Users matter far more and I have believed for a while now that COIN's outrageously high commissions (called Take Rate) will eventually turn off customers when they realize they can trade the major cryptocurrencies for far lower fees. I also pointed out that the revenue ""beat"" last quarter was driven by interest income from USCoin USD ( USDC-USD ) deposits. That business has almost certainly trailed off with the issues facing Paxos and USDC and now that entire business line is under fire by the SEC. In short, COIN's core business model was already shaky; this Wells notice is the rumblings of an earthquake coming. Risks The risk to the short here is that cryptocurrencies keep rallying and everyone forgets about COIN's problems and just cares about return of profits generated by a high take rate on transactions of high-priced currencies. I don't think that should mean a close to $18 billion market cap (as of close on Wednesday) but things priced outrageously can get more outrageous. There is also risk of a short squeeze, but that's life with these companies. You just have to size and structure trades that limit your pain on the upside. Conclusion I think COIN was the beneficiary of being early in a disorganized market and took advantage of illiquidity to capture massive fees. Those early days of crypto are gone and COIN's business model is a relic of a less efficient time. They have tried to paper over that weakness with new products the SEC is apparently now calling foul on as well as putting the entire crypto industry in its regulatory crosshairs. I continue to think this stock should be materially lower with the risk of going away entirely at some point.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589603-coinbase-all-is-not-wells?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10979712.jpeg

42414098,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAw81x,1679580000,Ethereum Network DRPC Aims to Quell Centralization Risks Ahead of Shanghai Upgrade,"DRPC, a decentralized RPC (remote procedure call) network, went live on Thursday in an effort to curb some of the centralization risks on the Ethereum network.  An RPC is the communication protocol used by decentralized apps (dapps) to interact and transfer information, such as transaction detail, to and from blockchains.  Ethereum’s infrastructure layer remains the last holdout of centralized processing left, a situation which has been largely unaddressed. If RPCs are, for any reason, attacked or undermined, it threatens Ethereum’s network integrity and the security of dapps that rely on it.  DRPC developers said they are tackling this issue by leveraging its globally distributed decentralized network of RPC service providers, dividing the load between them.  “Decentralized RPC services form the bedrock for a trustless, secure, and scalable network. The launch of DRPC will enable end-to-end decentralization for Ethereum,” explained Constantine Zaitcev, chief product officer of DRPC, in a note to CoinDesk.  “In addition to the blockchain and application layer, the infrastructure layer will be decentralized as well. These efforts will help build confidence in Ethereum’s RPC nodes, the infrastructure that fuels the network’s growth,” he added.  The launch comes ahead of Ethereum's much-awaited Shanghai upgrade, which will allow ether stakers to withdraw tokens from the network. Such users rely mostly on centralized RPC providers for activities, which serves as a counterparty risk in case of any bugs or exploits.  DRPC currently supports projects built on Ethereum and will be expanding to other EVM-based networks including Arbitrum, Polygon, BSC and Optimism in the coming months.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | ARB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/23/ethereum-network-drpc-aims-to-quell-centralization-risks-ahead-of-shanghai-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca80db641705e540bb79f038e73c94e23275b7ef-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One of Radix's main aims is to tackle the risk of hacks in decentralized finance (DeFi). It does this through Scrypto, an ""asset-orientated smart contract language,"" which provides developers with an off-the-shelf tool for creating assets and setting the rules by which they can be transacted. The blockchain has more than 50 projects building on it, offering trading, saving, lending, gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and wallets.  DWF Labs has been splashing the cash of late with this funding round marking its fourth major investment this month. Earlier this week, it led a $40 million funding into decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) tomi, which followed multimillion-dollar purchases of the native tokens of blockchain infrastructure provider Orbs Network and derivatives protocol Synthetix.

42421293,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnoCb,1679575500,"Crypto Is the Solution to Bank Runs, Not the Cause","Over the last few weeks, we saw Silicon Valley Bank close and get taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which guaranteed deposits and put it up for auction.  We saw runs and failures at more banks, including Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, spurring fear of runs at others like First Republic Bank. And we’ve seen the bank contagion move across the pond to Europe – specifically Credit Suisse, to which the Swiss central bank recently granted a loan of 50 billion Swiss francs.  But the closure of Silvergate Bank and Signature in particular, the top two banks that worked with crypto companies, gave the impression that the U.S. government wants to push crypto out of the country.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  For financial professionals, this may seem like a good time to turn away from crypto and avoid devoting energy to it. However, this could actually be the best time to embrace it and learn more. Fallouts in traditional banking is the situation the Bitcoin blockchain was created for, and this is why crypto should continue to gain adoption.  So many crypto and blockchain technology characteristics could provide solutions to the issues we’re seeing. Self-custody, transparency and immediate settlement are inherent to crypto and could bring more adoption.  Self-custody  Banks and financial institutions are the custodians of most of our financial assets – including cash and securities. They hold the assets for us and make accounting notations regarding our “ownership.”  This scenario has arisen from necessity because for decades it has been impractical for us to take custody of our own assets. We have depended on custodians to facilitate the entire financial system, including trading, lending and borrowing.  The result: 1) extreme government regulation of custodians and 2) blind trust in those custodians, mainly due to that regulation.  In essence, most Americans and westerners have the general impression their money is safe at chartered banks because these banks cannot take too many risks with the money.  But what we’ve seen in the last few weeks is that our money might not be safe at the bank, even with all that regulation. Crypto, on the other hand, is built on the idea of self-custody.  I anticipate that more people and businesses will start viewing crypto self-custody as an option for some of their assets – not necessarily because they’re investors in crypto assets, but because they want to use the crypto rails as a way to circumvent the reliance on custodians regulated by the government.  The system is really only efficient when we all control our own assets.  Read more: Self-Custodial Onboarding Will Be the Norm in Web3's 2023  Transparency  Many current issues and regulations involve transparency, or lack thereof. One of the purposes of registering with the state, Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission is to make the books public and visible to us all, so we can feel comfortable making risk-based decisions. However, that transparency is usually quarterly, not up to the second.  The recent bank runs didn’t come from a worry about solvency, but of liquidity. Depositors start pulling deposits because no one wants to be the last one out and not have any cash.  If the asset pools were transparent up to the second, as we see in crypto, all depositors would know exactly how much liquidity the pools contained and could determine their relative need to withdraw in an efficient manner, rather than just out of fear.  Immediate settlement  In an attempt to grow their value and provide services to depositors and other customers, banks and other custodians need to either lend the money from deposit pools or invest in low-risk assets to try to earn some yield.  Of course, there is a time mismatch between loans and securities. While the securities are usually in very liquid markets, they don’t settle immediately and are still subject to certain market hours.  We recently saw bank runs where the panic extended to night and weekend hours, a difficult time for the bank to sell any securities and free capital.  Contrast this to the crypto system, which is always on and where we see instant or near-instant settlement. When I send you bitcoin, ether or USDC, those crypto assets move from my wallet to yours right away, and the transaction is settled. No need to wait for markets to open and money to transfer from my account to yours. Blockchain-based transactions are settled and final.  Proving the need  Over the last few years, with the rise and fall in price of crypto assets and the increased media coverage and conversations about crypto, we have heard so many naysayers argue that we don’t “need” crypto and that there is no way to justify its value. Even as an educator to financial professionals, I have said we don’t really need crypto in the U.S. or even in western democracies.  Over and over again, however, we’ve seen a need for one or more of the characteristics inherent to blockchains, crypto and decentralized finance. We are starting to observe realizations by individuals and businesses that a better financial system exists – one that they can use for financial transactions without government intervention, policy making and money printing.  As the realization occurs, and as crypto custody becomes safer, we should see a natural migration toward crypto and blockchain. But this will require a need for assistance from financial professionals, including advisors, CPAs and lawyers. Current financial professionals can look at the recent happenings as a sign that the U.S. government is anti-crypto, or they can view them as a sign that we need the crypto ecosystem.  Now might be the best time to start learning crypto and determining how to best incorporate it into a portfolio. The next bull run in crypto won’t be based on speculation.

Somehow COIN's FY2027 EPS growth is expected to be 350% on a 48.44% [both YoY] revenue decline. At the moment, COIN's YTD growth appears to have plateaued and absorbed the recent BTC rally. Coinbase's assets under management are shrinking and the trend is expected to persist. I rate COIN stock as a Sell with a target price of $53 per share in the medium term. Intro & Thesis From the beginning of the year through March 21, Coinbase Global ( COIN ) stock rose more than 137% before immediately falling 8.16% on March 22, and then dropping another >15% [post-market] following comments from SEC staff about a possible enforcement action over alleged securities law violations related to newly issued and actively traded securities. Seeking Alpha, the author's compilation Although COIN is ranked as the best player in the Financial Exchanges and Data industry [Seeking Alpha data], I believe the stock is likely to fall further, as increasing regulatory risks should theoretically confirm the pessimism of Wall Street analysts who believe the company will achieve rapid revenue growth rates but will not break even on earnings per share until FY2026. Why Do I Think So? First, I would like to share a few thoughts on why COIN is ranked first on the SA's Quant Rating System . Most likely, this system pays special attention to such a factor as Momentum; also, presumably, a lot of weight is on the side of Revisions. So the more positive earnings revisions a company has and the stronger its current [short-term] stock growth, the higher it ranks overall. It is the combination of these two factors that have placed COIN so high among the other 21 peer companies: Seeking Alpha, COIN stock, Quant Rating System [author's notes] Now let us understand what each of these two metrics is associated with. COIN's Momentum factor , in my opinion, depends on the overall state of the crypto market, the indicator of which is the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as the most highly capitalized financial instrument. This is confirmed both by the visual comparison of COIN with BTC and by the statistically significant correlation between the two instruments: YCharts, author's compilation, and notes In turn, COIN's Revisions , in my opinion, depend on 1) the dynamics of the forecasts and 2) the comparative position of these forecasts in the structure of the whole sector. The industry to which COIN belongs is part of the Financials sector - we all know what is happening there right now. All Wall Street analysts started to lower their forecasts for this sector en masse, expecting further tightening of lending conditions and consequently a reduction of banks' net interest margins. COIN, of course, looked relatively better in this comparison, which made it the first in its industry, in my opinion. When we look at the current revenue and EPS forecasts, we see a more deplorable state of affairs. The Street believes the company will continue to be unprofitable through FY2026: Seeking Alpha, COIN's Earnings Estimates The company's revenue projections seem a bit odd to me - somehow COIN is expected to break even in FY2026 against a backdrop of 6.76% [YoY] revenue growth. And in FY2027 EPS growth is expected to be 350% on a 48.44% [both YoY] revenue decline. Seeking Alpha, COIN's Earnings Estimates [author's notes] How can a company increase its net profit by 350% while losing half of its revenue for the year? Something doesn't add up here as far as I see it. Without looking too far into the future, let's just think about the next 1-2 years for Coinbase. Latin America expansion plans will clearly have a positive impact on base expansion - hence the strong expected revenue growth for FY2024. But how much R&D and CAPEX will need to be spent on this? They are already eating up all the revenue growth: Data by YCharts Add to these costs the potential risks of fines and regulatory penalties that may, if not directly, indirectly affect business operations. Given all this, how can COIN improve its negative EPS by almost half? Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen's recent policy address highlighted that depositors must take responsibility for their funds as the FDIC will not raise the $250,000 cap. It may potentially lead to increased caution amongst depositors and benefit major banks, while the high volatility of crypto exchanges and their instruments poses risks of runs or gradual slowdowns in client activity. Coinbase already has acute problems with shrinking assets under management - despite continued user growth, COIN's AUM has fallen by more than 64% in the last year [YoY]. Business of Apps, Coinbase COIN's growth appears to have plateaued and absorbed the recent BTC rally . Even the insiders have stopped adding new positions - if in January/February only the CEO sold [who always got rid of all his options and automatically stopped being a shareholder], then some other executives joined in late February/March: Openinsider.com, COIN stock [author's notes] Of course, management selling shares tells us little - but one has to admit that it's always nice when the CEO owns at least a small stake in the company he runs. Bottom Line Maybe I am wrong in my rather pessimistic assessments about Coinbase - maybe I am just missing something. Perhaps this ""something"" is the catalyst and cause for the revenue and EPS forecast inconsistencies I noted in my analysis to disappear. The continued growth of COIN stock after such a sharp and prolonged decline is quite likely to continue - in any case, the stock is not yet that crowded [according to Citi Research on March 21, 2023 - proprietary source]: Citi Research data, the author's notes Despite the presence of the upside risks to my thesis, I still tend to think that COIN stock has a slippery road ahead as its EPS and revenue estimates return to downward momentum. Dependence on the volatile dynamics of BTC and some crypto assets, as well as a decrease in user activity against the backdrop of AUM's continued decline, will continue to hang over the company like the sword of Damocles . I am not an expert in technical analysis, but on the short to medium-term chart [4 hours] I see the momentum slowing down - after the stock market opens on March 23, this will be confirmed. COIN could drop even lower in the next 2 weeks - right to its long-term moving average: TrendSpider Software, COIN stock [4-hour], the author's notes The forwarding EV-to-Sales multiple of nearly 6x is not saving the day. Valuation multiples look ""OK"" for a high-growth company, but the problem is that Coinbase is not having that much growth with its declining operating metrics all over the place. I rate COIN stock as a Sell with a target price of $53 per share in the medium term. As always, your comments are welcome!

42414100,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAw8Hs,1679573897,Coinbase Downgraded by Oppenheimer After Disclosing Possible SEC Charges,"Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau pulled his outperform rating on Coinbase (COIN), downgrading to the company's stock to perform after the crypto exchange disclosed the receipt of a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late Wednesday. Lau also noted Tuesday’s Economic Report of the President, which was highly critical of the digital-asset industry.  Shares of Coinbase were down 13% in premarket trading on Thursday.  Given the unhealthy regulatory environment, Lau – who is otherwise supportive of blockchain technology and digital-asset development in the U.S. – said he is becoming increasingly concerned about the “fairness of the enforcement actions and the ability for the [crypto] ecosystem to grow with seemingly limited and shrinking support from the banking system.”  With Coinbase stock up about 118% year-to-date versus a gain of around 3% for the S&P 500, Oppenheimer’s Lau said he is moving to the sidelines.  “Recent strength in bitcoin (BTC) indicates that people have called for alternative financial systems, but it could also become the victim of its success,” Lau added.

42414111,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAw8ni,1679573885,First Mover Americas: SEC Warns Coinbase,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Wells notice to crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), a step that may lead to the SEC suing Coinbase or taking other enforcement actions against it.Coinbase said the SEC alleged the U.S.-based company may be operating in violation of securities laws in the running of its exchange and providing staking services. Coinbase now has an opportunity to respond to the SEC and possibly reach a settlement with the agency.  The SEC sued Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, on Wednesday on allegations that his projects sold and airdropped unregistered securities and committed fraud and market manipulation. The SEC said in a press release it was suing Sun, the Tron Foundation, the BitTorrent Foundation and BitTorrent over the sale of the tronix (TRX) and bitTorrent (BTT) tokens, which the regulator described as unregistered crypto-asset securities. The Tron network’s native TRX token dropped 13% to 5.8 cents after the announcement, according to CoinDesk data.  Bitcoin gradually moved to just under $28,000 on Thursday as traders digested the quarter-point interest-rate hike Wednesday by the Federal Reserve, which was in line with expectations. The decision reinforced the Fed's concerns that inflation remains problematic and that it remains ""strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective.” Bitcoin slid to under $27,000 immediately after the Fed’s announcement as traders took profits on a 20% gain over a seven-day rolling period. However, traders of bitcoin-tracked futures took on over $150 million in losses amid the volatility, with billions in open interest – or the number of unsettled contracts – effectively getting washed out.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's rally has stalled at around $28,600, a resistance level marked by the swing low reached in April 2021.  ""The more BTCUSD resists a sharp pullback from $28.6K, the higher the chances of it breaking on the upside and price targeting $34K,"" chartered market technician Aksel Kibar tweeted.

42414104,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAw8SU,1679572063,Ethereum Usage Will Drop If the Blockchain Doesn’t Boost Speed: Bank of America,"The Ethereum blockchain remains the dominant operating system for decentralized finance, or DeFi, because few alternatives existed until recently, Bank of America said in a research report Tuesday.  The bank, however, said it expects Ethereum adoption and usage to decelerate if the blockchain is not able to increase its ""throughput,"" adding that application developers will probably choose other networks to build on. In crypto, throughput refers to the number of transactions a blockchain can complete per second.  “We view Ethereum’s long-term viability as dependent on its ability to fulfill the vision laid out in its road map, which includes implementing sharding architecture to expand its throughput capacity significantly,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.  Bank of America noted that Ethereum’s smart contract-enabled platform gave it a first-mover advantage as app developers gravitated to the platform, which led to network effects as the number of decentralized apps (dapps) and users grew.  That early success, however, was a “double-edged sword” as the large number of transactions resulted in network congestion and surging transaction fees, the note said.  A dapp is an application that uses blockchain technology to keep users' data out of the hands of the organizations behind it. Smart contracts are computerized blockchain protocols that execute terms of a contract.  “As in prior tech cycles (PCs, software, internet), new projects are likely to emerge and poorly positioned projects will exit,” the note added.

42414108,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAw8iP,1679571544,Floor Prices for Donald Trump NFTs Surge on News of Possible Indictment,"A set of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, related to Donald Trump have jumped over 30% in ether-denominated value over the past week amid a possible indictment and arrest of the former U.S. president and current GOP presidential candidate.  At the time of writing, Polygon-based Trump Digital Trading Cards were selling for over 0.59 ether (ETH), or about $1,033, up from 0.33 ETH, or $578, last week. More than 735 Trump NFTs have been sold during that period, attracting 401 ether in trading volume, according to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea.  The rally comes amid reports of Trump's possible arrest. Trump is expected to be indicted in the coming days, as Fox News first reported on March 17, on charges stemming from an alleged hush money payment made to adult actress Stormy Daniels at the height of the 2016 election.  The New York Times reported that prosecutors are looking at charging Trump for violating campaign-finance law and falsifying business records as the alleged payments to Daniels were entered into Trump’s books as a payment to his lawyer for legal services. Theoretically, that could land Trump in jail for up to four years, though lawyers say that it would be a tough case to prosecute.  The New York Times also reported that Trump could be facing multiple other charges regarding classified documents he illegally kept at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and false statements he made about it after. He also may face charges for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at Capitol Hill.  Trump NFTs a hit with his supporters  Trump released the collection of 45,000 fantasy cards last December for $99 apiece, featuring images of him in a style similar to collectible baseball cards.  Collectors who purchase one of the digital trading cards will be automatically entered into a ""sweepstakes"" to receive ""experiences"" with Trump, including a Zoom call, a dinner in Miami or a cocktail hour at Mar-a-Lago, as CoinDesk previously reported.  The cards sold out quickly at the time. As of Thursday, data shows wallet 0xfb65 holds the highest individual Trump NFTs with 1,000 cards followed by 0x75d2 at 362 cards. Neither of the two holders has listed his or her NFTs for sale.  When is the indictment?  The decision to indict and then arrest Trump hasn't been made final by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, though media reports – and Trump himself – have indicated that it is as a sure thing.  On Polymarket, investors have priced the likelihood of a Trump indictment happening by March 31 at 68%, or 68 cents. The figure was as high as 93% after Trump had said he expected to be arrested by March 21.  Polymarket is a crypto betting service that allows users to pick one of at least two options on given trades, such as election results.  There’s currently $93,000 of volume, and $11,000 of liquidity, on this contract, making it one of Polymarket’s more actively traded markets.  A contract that asks if Trump will be arrested by May 31 has the ""yes"" side trading at 87%, while another contract asking if Trump will be arrested by Friday, March 24 has the ""no"" side at 85%.  Complicating the indictment and the arrest are security concerns, and authorities are taking time to prepare for possible protests, which may be why investors on Polymarket are backing off the idea of an arrest by the end of March.  If indicted, Trump would be the first U.S. president to be indicted, but wouldn't be the first to be arrested as Ulysses S. Grant was arrested for speeding in his horse-drawn carriage in 1872, according to the Washington Post.  Investors on Polymarket are also pricing in a 10% chance that Trump tweets by April 1 and a 53% chance that he smiles in his mug shot.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | ZRX,"Shaurya Malwa, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/23/floor-prices-for-donald-trump-nfts-surge-on-news-of-possible-indictment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e947a3c6c3af57cb93d3d28ca04a9d60bec21c50-1371x771.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockchains like Near that increase their functionality and incentivize development are likely to become attractive for developers in the short term, the report said. Near’s sharding approach “mitigates common scaling issues related to increasing centralization due to pooling and decreasing security due to poorly aligned incentives.”  It's too early, however, to pick long-term winners and losers, according to the report.  “Over the longer term, we expect blockchains that prioritize usability and effectively market themselves to gain market share by attracting a robust and diverse ecosystem of applications that drives adoption, network effects and cash flows,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.

42414134,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwMUk,1679568483,Bitcoin Miners' Revenue From Fees Rises Suggesting Onset of Major Bull Run,"Bitcoin's (BTC) 60% year-to-date surge may be only the first milestone in its upward journey, as miner revenues from transaction fees are rising.  The two-year ""Z-score"" for miner revenue from fees, an indicator used to identify periods of high and low transaction fees, has turned positive for the first time since mid-2021, according to data source Glassnode.  The positive flip suggests miners' revenue from transaction fees is deviating higher from the two-year mean in a sign of increased network demand. Historically, a return of high fees has coincided with the beginning of major bull runs.  ""Bolstered by a new demand from Ordinals and Inscriptions, the 2yr Z-Score for miner revenue from fees has turned positive,"" Glassnode's lead analyst, James Check, said in a weekly market update.  ""Elevated fee pressure is a common precursor to more constructive markets, coincident with new waves of adoption, expressed via increasing demand for blockspace,"" Check added.  The Z-score measures the number of standard deviations from the two-year mean fee revenue. The Z-score is usually positive and rising during bull runs and negative during bear runs.  Bitcoin miners solve complex algorithmic puzzles to verify and add new transactions to the blockchain or distributed ledger in return for rewards paid in BTC. In addition, miners also receive a portion of transaction fees.  Fees are a function of transaction size and network volumes (how congested the network is). Transactions are processed in blocks, storing up to 1 megabyte of data. Hence, a sudden spike in activity often leads to network congestion – transactions waiting to get verified. In such situations, miners target transactions with higher fees first. In other words, the more a user offers in fees, the faster his transaction is likely to be verified.  The network has seen brisk activity since the launch in January of the Ordinals protocol, which allows users to inscribe references to digital art into small transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.  The seven-day average of the daily transaction count on the Bitcoin network has increased by 28% this year, reaching a two-year high of over 333,000.  ""Miners are of course key beneficiaries of this influx, seeing their total revenue spike up to $22.6M/day. This week, miner revenues have lifted to the highest level since June 2022, breaking convincingly above the yearly average,"" Check said, adding that this is typically observed near ""transition points towards a more constructive market.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/23/rising-bitcoin-miner-revenue-from-fees-suggests-onset-of-major-bull-run,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08c12c8140541bb43459d161ce08c30d7060cdba-1920x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414131,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwMEp,1679557239,Bitcoin Inches Toward $28K as Traders See $260M in Futures Liquidations,"Bitcoin gradually moved to just under $28,000 on Thursday as traders digested the quarter-point interest rate raise Wednesday by U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), in line with expectations.  The decision reinforced the Federal Reserve's concerns that inflation remains problematic and strong commitment ""to returning inflation to our 2% objective.”  Bitcoin slid under $27,000 immediately after the FOMC announcement as traders took profits on a 20% gain over a seven-day rolling period. However, traders of bitcoin-tracked futures took on over $150 million in losses amid the volatility, with billions in open interest – or the number of unsettled contracts – effectively getting washed out.  Over 75% of those losses came from longs, or bets on price rises, as traders likely positioned for a move higher after the FOMC meeting but were caught offside.  Ether slid under $1,600, recovering in Asian hours on Thursday with a gradual move to the $1,700 mark. Its futures saw over $50 million in losses, contributing to over $280 million in overall crypto futures liquidations.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Other major tokens fell. XRP fell 8% as traders took profits on a rise earlier this week amid positive sentiment for a favorable result in the ongoing Ripple vs. Securities and Exchange Commission case.  Meanwhile, bitcoin prices have since recovered as some remain optimistic about the asset’s strength in the medium term, stemming from a potential money injection into U.S. capital markets.  “Bitcoin is continuing to gain momentum amid the banking crisis, showing that investors are recognizing bitcoin as a secure store of value and a stable alternative to traditional finance,” said Alex Adelman, CEO of bitcoin rewards app Lolli, in a note to CoinDesk.  “The announcement of a $300 billion injection into the economy to save cash-strapped banks has also driven bitcoin’s price up. The intervention, which is being called a bailout, highlights that the traditional banking system is showing cracks,” Adelman added.  Elsewhere, FxPro markets analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk that the price action of bitcoin in the coming days could serve as a signal of where bitcoin may head in the coming months.  “From a tactical perspective, a break above $28.5K could have a dam-breaking effect and quickly take the price to $30K,” Kuptsikevich said, adding that the reaction of all markets to the FOMC move in this week could be vital as “the range of expectations is incredibly wide.”  The $27,000 resistance zone for bitcoin remains a key level to watch, as per Kuptsikevich. “A break below $27.5K would negate the bullish technical signal and open the way for a deeper correction,” he cautioned.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/23/bitcoin-inches-toward-28k-as-traders-see-260m-in-futures-liquidations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d3a1c512f821c51ebfb500279b1dee9da5c500b-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The X-Chain is the exchange chain, used to send funds back and forth. The P-Chain is the platform chain, which is used for staking AVAX and serving as a validator.  While the C-Chain recovered after an hour-long outage, some X-Chain nodes are still offline as of time of publication.  On-chain data shows the network quality of X-Chain has been degraded, and it's only able to process a handful of transactions. It appears that it's only able to process a few transactions per hour, making the chain virtually unusable.  Over 90% of validators have upgraded to the latest version of AvalancheGo. This is up from 12% earlier Thursday.  While Avalanche has yet to make a public statement regarding the outage, many contributors are working on its GitHub forum to resolve the issue.  AVAX is trading for $16.89 at writing time in Asian afternoon hours on Thursday.",NEGATIVE,AVAX,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/23/avalanche-blockchains-x-and-c-networks-see-brief-outage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d04f38a6a1b2aefc29f8b5f990bbd409b21bfc1b-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and most other major cryptos fell after the Federal Reserve raised the interest rate 25 basis points and made clear that inflation remained its focus even after recent banking debacles.  Insights: In a Q&A with CoinDesk, the chief technology officer of smart contract platform Conflux says the company's blockchain-enabled SIM card (BSIM) offers security and convenience.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,178 −30.9 ▼ 2.6% Bitcoin (BTC) $27,294 −820.7 ▼ 2.9% Ethereum (ETH) $1,738 −56.7 ▼ 3.2% S&P 500  3,936.97 −65.9 ▼ 1.6% Gold  $1,972 +25.4 ▲ 1.3% Nikkei 225  27,466.61 +NaN ▲ NaN% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  A Hopeful Day Ends With a Slump  The U.S. Federal Reserve took the apparent path of least resistance, raising the interest rate 25 basis points to quash investor hopes that it would turn more dovish in the aftermath of a banking crisis that has rocked confidence in traditional financial services firms and the strength of the U.S. dollar.  Bitcoin (BTC) dithered in the immediate aftermath of the bank's decision before edging down steadily, even dipping below $27,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $27,375, off 3.5%. Earlier in the day, as markets hoped for a cessation of the year-long regime of Fed rate increases, BTC zoomed above $28,700.  ""Risk aversion was able to drag down bitcoin as market jitters returned on banking worries and over a quickly weakening economy,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email. ""The Fed might be done tightening, but the risk of something else breaking in the financial sector remains elevated.""  Ether also tumbled from highs over $1,800 to its more recent $1,737. The second-largest crypto in market value was off more than 3.3%. Nearly every other major crypto by market cap in the CoinDesk top 25 was well in the red with the main exceptions APT, the token of layer 1 blockchain Aptos, and LTC, the native crypto of open-source blockchain Litecoin. They rose more than 5% and 6%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of the crypto market's overall performance, was recently down 2.7%.  The crypto world, meanwhile, suffered its latest shocks with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warning crypto exchange Coinbase it was pursuing enforcement action over securities violations and filing a lawsuit against Tron founder Justin Sun on allegations of selling and airdropping unregistered securities, fraud and market manipulation. Tron was recently down 10%.  Oanda's Moya called the allegations against Sun ""newsworthy.""  ""Market manipulation is one part of the crypto world that still has yet to be cleaned up or even close to fully being addressed,"" he wrote.

Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector XRP XRP −8.1% Currency Loopring LRC −6.3% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM −5.2% Smart Contract Platform     Insights  Everything You Might Want to Know About Conflux’s Blockchain SIM Card  Tokens of Conflux blockchains have been one of the top performers this year, rising 1,700% since Jan. 1 – from 2 cents to over 40 cents – and quickly reaching a market capitalization of over $800 million.  The growth has stemmed mainly from Coinflux’s deep roots in China and a blockchain-enabled SIM (BSIM) card that’s touted as a unique entryway for daily users to interact with cryptocurrency-based applications.  These are set to be built in partnership with China Telecom, the second-largest wireless carrier in China with an estimated 390 million subscribers, as CoinDesk has reported. China Telecom will launch the first BSIM pilot program in Hong Kong later this year, Conflux Network said at the time. This will likely be followed by pilots in key mainland China locations such as Shanghai. The BSIM card will manage and store the user's public and private keys in the card and carry out digital signatures in a way that the private key does not exit the card. Users who switch to a BSIM card will be able to store digital assets safely, transfer their digital assets conveniently and display their assets in a variety of applications. CoinDesk spoke with Ming Wu, Conflux's chief technology officer, to understand more about the BSIM, Conflux’s future plans, how the card is different than a crypto wallet and the disadvantages of using BSIM.  How does the BSIM card work, and how does it differ from a standard sim card?  The BSIM card essentially integrates the hardware crypto wallet functionality into the SIM card. It can manage and store the users’ public and private keys in the card and carry out digital signatures in a way that the private key does not exit the card. The BSIM card can also allow encrypted storage and key retrieval. The BSIM card has more than 10 times the storage capacity and computation power of a traditional SIM card.  How does the BSIM card “lower the barrier to entry” for metaverse applications?  Nowadays, there are a huge number of users of the SIM card. Most of them are users in the traditional world and outside of the Web3 world. They all are potential users who can be converted to Web3 users with the upgrade to the BSIM card. We are developing a mobile app wrapping the access to the BSIM card which will help those users to manage their digital assets based on their traditional habit and without requirement for the knowledge of the crypto keys. This will make it easy for them to take part in the activities in Web3 and the Metaverse. Meanwhile, for the original crypto users, BSIM card makes the access to the hardware wallet much more convenient. It brings a sweet spot of tradeoff between the security and the convenience to the users. So it will also be very attractive to those crypto users.  What are the primary advantages of the BSIM vs. a crypto wallet?  The major advantage of BSIM card is that it provides the security of hardware cold wallet and also the convenience and portability simultaneously. Users may obtain very high security of their wallet simply by equipping their mobile phones with the BSIM card. And this will not break their normal user experiences of the phone.  What are the potential disadvantages of the BSIM?  There will be a small disadvantage for some users who are very concerned about their privacy. In some regions, especially in mainland China, the BSIM card has to be acquired with [know-your-customer], so that your mobile phone number may be associated with your public key account. From another perspective, this may not be a weak point because this makes the way of using such crypto wallets more compliant in China so will get support from the Chinese government more easily. And this also makes it achievable to tie the users’ on-chain information in the virtual world with a bunch of off-chain information in the real world, and unify the metaverse and the real universe.  What are the product development timelines? When do you expect to have a prototype to test in Hong Kong?  We have built prototype chips and tested them on the Conflux network. The feasibility has been verified. We are planning the volume production together with our China Telecom partner. We are expecting to make the production roll-out in Hong Kong this year.  With policy changes, increased support of blockchain technology and Justin Sun moving cryptocurrency exchange Huobi's Asia headquarters from Singapore to Hong Kong, Hong Kong has a very friendly policy to the crypto industry. And it has more and closer connections to mainland China. It has an appropriate role as a bridge connecting the Web3 industry in China to the broader global market.  What will Conflux’s role be within this growth?  Conflux is the only regulatory compliant blockchain in China. It has solid technical design, implementation and maintenance supported by a world-class team with strong technical expertise. So, Conflux will naturally take the leading role to help Hong Kong and mainland China to carry out their expansions in the Web3 area.

Concern about the Shapella hard fork is not so much regarding validators or people taking profits, an inflow of new stakers provides downward risk on the staking rewards. Ethereum has its bumps in the development roadmap, but I believe it is scaling nicely to become a more accepted and applicable solution for payments. Ethereum (ETH-USD) has been doing quite well so far this year and there are good reasons for that outside of the cryptocurrency ecosphere. Focusing more on Ethereum, I will discuss why staking Ethereum might be wise but also why return on staking ETH might become pressured. Why Is Crypto Going Up Right Now? Seeking Alpha So far this year, Ethereum gained 45% which is very strong. Just like stock markets the start of the year was good. There was some optimism on inflation decreasing in December, which fueled hopes that interest rates would not explode further meaning that cheap money could pour into the system including the crypto currency system. As banking stocks came under pressure due to underwhelming earnings reports , risk appetite decreased so stock markets went down and crypto started moving more or less sideways. When crypto friendly banks collapsed that put pressure on crypto prices. At the same time when other names started collapsing such as the Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB) and Credit Suisse ( CS ), it had two side effects that are positive for crypto currencies. The first is that the expectation is that interest rates would not be hiked as aggressively and might even be lowered which makes borrowing money cheaper. Whether it is stocks or crypto, a lot of money flowing into the system is money borrowed in some way or profits realized with borrowed money. I wouldn’t call it a risk-on mode, but there certainly are expectations on the interest trajectory going forward. Secondly, failing banks in some way provide a validation for the need of decentralized systems. So, bank failures significantly improves sentiment in the cryptocurrency sphere. That’s not to say that everything is great with crypto and more specifically Ethereum. The crypto world had its own set of collapses last year. Crypto started a broad sell off in 2022 after the SEC announced new crypto regulations in April 2022 and the debacle with Terra Classic (LUNC-USD) as its stable coin depegged leading to its collapse. In September 2022, Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work concept to a proof-of-stake concept and that actually did nothing positive to the price. The sentiment in the crypto world so any positive development for a particular coin would not create waves and the FTX collapse in November 2022 did not help either. Generally 2021, was not great either. It started great especially for Ethereum as NFT sales for which Ethereum was used popped and Elon Musk stated that Tesla would start allowing payment in Bitcoin, but that decision was reverted citing environmental concerns and China became tougher on crypto currency mining. Specifically for Ethereum, an important implementation was EIP-1559, which is an upgrade that should burn part of the rewards miners received for validating transactions. For miners that wasn’t great, I saw my mining income decrease by an average of 25% due to the implementation of EIP-1559 but the idea behind the implementation of it was to reduce transaction fees making payments via the Ethereum network more affordable. As a miner you wouldn’t have noticed much of it, because while transaction fees were down there was no meaningful or notable change in transaction volumes. So, basically the implementation of EIP-1559 and the transition from a proof-of-work [PoW] consensus to a proof-of-stake [PoS] haven’t had a notable effect on the price of Ethereum partially because of the sentiment in the crypto world. How Much Do You Earn With Ethereum PoS? Ethereum With current high energy prices, mining already came under pressure even before Ethereum transitioned to the PoS concept thereby flooding all other cryptos with hashpower and removing profitable operations. On stable cost from the time before energy prices surged, but at current crypto prices my yield on costs (which is the sum of electricity cost plus equipment costs) would be nearly 30%. That is also why a lot of young people considered mining for income, it wasn’t cheap by any means, especially with the hardware prices going through the roof but there certainly was a big fat juicy yield on your investment. Reality is that too many miners started little too late with mining while paying a huge premium for mining equipment and they ended up selling some crypto sometimes all of their crypto to at least have the impression they covered their losses. Proof of Stake doesn’t require big upfront investments you would think. You need a computer and internet and some tools installed. That’s it, right? Not really. To keep validators committed and performing they have to pledge a total of 32 ETH, which at current prices costs north of $56,000. I know miners who have invested that kind of money for mining equipment but the reality is that for most a 32 ETH pledge is too steep unless you have been mining for a very long time or bought Ethereum when it had a very low price point. Even then, the yield is not great I would say and there are risks. One risk is that the yield fluctuates daily. I currently have some Ethereum staked via a pool and that gives me a 4.2% yield after fees and 4.9% before fees. Your earnings depend on how much Ethereum you have staked. The Risks Of Ethereum Proof-of-Stake With Proof-of-Stake there are a few risks. The first one has been that the official staking is a locked staking mechanism meaning that you cannot have your rewards and your staked Ethereum paid back to you until the Shapella (Shanghai and Capella) hard fork is implemented. There has been some uncertainty regarding timing and that was an obvious risk, especially after a core developer incorrectly claimed that Ethereum never said it would enable staking rewards to be payable in the hard fork following the transition to Proof of Stake. However, it is the case that the Shapella upgrade will include the ability to withdraw for Ethereum stakers. The next risk was that the timing was not known, so if you had your crypto staked you would not know when you could withdraw. The hard fork is now anticipated on 12 th of April, so that is a risk partially eliminated although as with each hard fork the timeline could still slide. You can wonder what risk will remain in that case? The risk is that to provide stability to the network, validators cannot all quit at once. You will have to queue for withdrawal of your staked rewards plus there will be an exit queue for the staked Ethereum. There is a maximum number of withdrawals per block allowed in order to preserve the stability of the system. However, I am not so much concerned about people unstaking. The people that are currently staking are the people that held on to their crypto and wanted to earn some in the process, some might want to unstake and take profits but the people that staked their coins are much more patient that the people that started buying GPUs in bulk with expectations of a 30% return on their investment each year. What might be reducing the yield of Proof-of-Stake is stakers flowing into the system. Previously it was not really attractive to stake your Ethereum without knowing when it could be unstaked. With that out of the way, I can imagine that the numbers of validators grow and the interest rate for staking will take a hit. I cannot say with certainty what will happen, but if logic applies here with reduced risk on the timeline of unstaking more people would stake their Ethereum but it would also mean lower interest. A simple case of lower risk, lower reward and having to share the proceeds with a bigger pool. So, while the hard fork needs to happen at some point to keep the number of validators growing long term I don’t think this will be a net positive for the interest on staking your Ethereum and another drawback is that the interest is a simple interest and does not compound. The reward you earn each day varies and that reward can come under pressure which is already not a high reward. The SP500 has a dividend yield of 1.7%, so PoS seems more rewarding at least for now but I believe you can easily build a dividend portfolio with a better yield. I did that the past years and without taking huge risks, my yield and yield on cost are over 7%. So, if you are looking for yield staking might not be most attractive. A reason why you want to consider staking is because else you would have your Ethereum somewhere stored on a cold wallet not creating any value for you while staking allows you to increase your Ethereum without really doing anything for it. No energy consumption and staking via a pool means that you have do nothing else than committing your Ethereum and after a waiting period it starts giving you your interest. Another risk that should not be ignored is that of improper behaviour of a validator. So, there is the risk of slashing where validators are penalized for bad behaviour losing some of the 32 ETH that were staked. Because validators have some skin in the game, the rationale is that bad behaviour can be avoided because if it still occurs, some of the 32 ETH is lost and losses compound for as long as the validator is in the exit queue. Conclusion: Ethereum Staking Low-Energy, Low Reward But Better Than Nothing. Staking is nowhere near as rewarding as mining and to be honest, my stock portfolio has a better yield. However, the risk and cost of staking are low. You can stake on some pools for as low as 0.1 ETH while mining required a significant upfront investment and some knowledge on power management to not burn down your house. So, you get a lower reward, but also a lower risk and capital burden. The risk of slashing remains, but that is only the case when validators are engaging in bad behaviour. The interest rates are in some way comparable to dividends yields as those also fluctuate daily but they differ in the sense that rewards differ daily which is not the case with dividends. Dividends only change when an adjustment is announced with no daily fluctuations on the reward paid. I would not consider staking over a dividend stock portfolio as I believe yields will come under pressure after the Shapella upgrade and you can easily build a nice yield portfolio with save stock investments. You should consider staking if you have some Ethereum and you intend to hold and don’t mind earning some extra on the side without doing much for it. Overall, while I am not quite charmed by the yields for staking I do believe that this is the best way forward for Ethereum and could create higher prices for the cryptocurrency.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589437-ethereum-bank-crisis-bull-run-but-staking-not-nice-dividend?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10976738.jpeg
