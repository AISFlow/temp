42429429,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyjTh,1532858451,A Small Crypto Coin Is Making Big Claims About a Private Proof-of-Stake,"If any coin is going to fly under the radar, it makes sense for a privacy coin to do so.  Spectre (not be confused with a separate project called SPECTRE), created two crypto tokens – the aptly named spectre token and the xspec token – in 2016, but hasn't received much notice from the crypto community so far. Sure enough, its tokens rank in the 500s according to data provider CoinMarketCap, with a total market capitalization of $5.7 million – paltry by many crypto standards.  But that might soon change, as the project is taking a growing interest in a technology called staking.  A number of alternative proof-of-stake systems have launched recently (EOS, Tezos, Neo, Tron), with varying degrees of success, though all of which have commanded large market caps buoyed by big investors.  These systems assign the task of verifying blockchain transactions to a certain number of delegates, representatives of sorts which are voted in by the token holders. While token holders don't necessarily identify themselves, according to Spectre's pseudonymous founder, Mandica, there's a huge privacy problem within these systems.  ""All the UTXOs [unspent transaction outputs] spent to generate staking transactions are traceable on the blockchain and all the staking transactions can be linked and your balances are visible to anyone who knows how to analyze the blockchain,"" Mandica told CoinDesk.  But the Spectre team, which has been tinkering away on various privacy tools for blockchains for the past couple years, thinks it's found a way to make staking stealthy as well.  While the technology isn't ready yet, the team hasn't been reserved about its ambitions.  ""From a user point of view you will be able to keep your entire balance of anonymous coins safe from any observer and you will just need to stake your wallet to receive further anonymous coins that nobody can attribute to you,"" Mandica said, continuing:  ""This is a unique proposition, and no other cryptocurrency, as far as I know, has a system to stake anonymous coins and generate fresh anonymous coins.""  Entropy in open wallets  While the full picture of how this all works isn't clear yet (the group hasn't put out a white paper, though, on social channels, it's promising one soon), the basic premise is borrowed from another privacy-oriented coin: monero, specifically its ring signature technology.  Ring signatures allow anyone in a particular group to sign a transaction, making it impossible to determine exactly which participants' keys signed the transaction.  But that still leaves the nodes, which aren't invisible, able to see the transactions. As such, the Spectre team went to work designing a fix.  ""The 'anonymous' coins are created using stealth address technology and one-time key pairs, and [they] reside on the blockchain as un-linkable UTXOs that can only be spent by proving ownership through the use of ring signatures and key-images based on the Cryptonote protocol,"" Mandica said.  While that's a bit challenging to parse – and the Spectre team was cautious about explaining in too much detail – there are some clues as to what the system entails.  For instance, users that contribute to the network by leaving their wallets connected to the internet can earn a minimum of a 5 percent annual income on their tokens. Although the fewer people that have their wallets open and online, the higher this yield goes (providing an incentive to others to do it).  Mandica declined to explain in detail what these wallets are doing, but he did say that the ""proof-of-stealth"" algorithm the team is employing is designed to take advantage of the creation of new tokens with no prior history to increase entropy used to mask the true transactions.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Entropy is key in a system using ring signatures to create a large pool of mixins or 'dummy' coins that can be used in the ring signature protected anonymous transactions.""  Based on other descriptions of ring signature schemes, protocols need a steady stream of unspent transactions to mask the real transactions. And this may be what those open wallets are doing.  Anonymous to the core  According to the team, in its next major release, the new proof-of-stealth staking mechanism for anonymous coins – the spectre coin is the anonymous one – will complement the proof-of-stake version 3 (PoSv3) algorithm the blockchain already uses.  But this work is just the latest privacy-centric tooling the Spectre team has come up with.  Even those without an unusually high privacy consciousness will be familiar with Tor, an acronym for ""The Onion Router,"" a scheme for masking internet users' activity online and even accessing sites intentionally invisible to search engines like Google. Spectre has already built Tor into its systems and even went further, implementing Tor product, ""OBSF4,"" which allows users to skirt national firewalls, such as those in China and Iran.  The team itself functions anonymously too. In fact, a spokesperson for the Spectra team told CoinDesk that the developers themselves don't even know each other's real names.  And even though, with this kind of anonymity it would have been easy to just walk away, the team didn't give up – even when it's initial coin offering (ICO) flopped and its project was lacking vitality, while all around them crypto projects, some without serious intent, raised millions by selling tokens.  ""We started out in 2016 with a very unsuccessful ICO that raised only 16 BTC at a time when the BTC price was around $600-$700, so we didn't make it far on those funds,"" Mandica said.  Spectre did secure private funding (amount undisclosed) earlier this year, but still the project remains just an after-hours project for the team. Instead of building with the monetary encouragement of the free market, Mandica and his team are building because they believe in the mission.  And that mission is all about one of crypto's favorite ideas: unbridled privacy.  In a newsletter from June, Mandica explains how best to think about the project:  ""The best way to understand Spectre today is to think of bitcoin + Proof-of-Stake.v3 + anonymous transactions (using similar technology to monero) + Tor to hide your IP.""

42429421,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLyjFh,1532854849,A Solution to China's Pharma Woes Might Be a Blockchain Away,"A still-evolving vaccine scandal in China prompted a range of social media discussions in the past week around how blockchain could have prevented such a situation – or how it might be used to stop it in the future.  To recap, ChangChun Changsheng Bio-technology, a pharmaceutical firm based in Jilin, is accused of having sold about 252,600 units of questionable DPT vaccine, not long after this Shenzhen-listed public firm was found forging data on about 113,000 substandard rabies vaccines, according to a report from the South China Morning Post.  Notably, this is not the first vaccine-related scandal occurred in China in the past year. Several pharmaceutical companies have been involved in producing and selling a great number of DPT vaccines, and a majority of them remain unpunished to this day.  There's little doubt that the latest exposure of wrongdoing has caused yet another outcry among the public and the scandal-plagued pharmaceutical industry. At its heart, the snowballing problems have raised a core question: how can Chinese families protect their kids and themselves?  The idea that blockchain could allow for the more efficient dispersal of data about vaccines spread soon after the rabies vaccine scandal broke.  A computer programmer under the username @wstart arguably got the ball rolling on V2EX, a Reddit-like online community. According to his post, after spending about 14 hours on data mining and coding, he was able to locate problematic vaccines in 30 provinces.  During the process, he explained, it became apparent how surprisingly difficult it was to gather all the information he needed, with some still remaining unavailable or unsearchable.  And that's when the crypto community in China started to come out and highlight blockchain as a possible solution.  Chaining data  As CoinDesk reported Monday, Xiaolai Li, one of the best-known of the country's crypto investors, was among the first to have sparked the discussion about blockchain adoption in the pharmaceutical industry.  In his WeChat article, the crypto investor argued that the technology could help offer visibility as medicines move through the supply chain – that is, as they transported from the facility at which they are made to the hospitals that distributed them.  According to anonymous commentary which appeared on Jianshu, a blog site in China, the author said that blockchain has largely been ""demonized"" by many people because of the many token sale scandals (China banned ICOs in 2017).  But people should also remind themselves that blockchain itself is only a technology, the anonymous poster argued.  And the idea of Chinese firms using blockchain for supply-chain purposes isn't exactly new. Companies like JD.com and Walmart are already applying the tech to tracing food shipments, for example.  Zhipeng Cheng, a financial commentator at China Finance Online, a China-based financial information company, offered a more detailed plan on how blockchain can be used in the pharmaceutical industry in an op-ed from earlier this week.  By using blockchain technology, he said in his article, the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) can form a public chain for its inspection technology and share its technology for vaccines tracking. Institutes and organizations can apply and participate in the public chain, he argued.  Though just a technology, Cheng said that he believes the country should ""embrace blockchain and put it into practice.""  From ideas to practice?  Local news stories suggest that movement toward this is already taking place.  Beijing News, a Beijing government-backed news outlet, reported on July 24 that several blockchain firms in China are already responding to the growing chatter about making vaccines safer and have responded by putting keywords like ""vaccines"" and ""embed vaccine on chain"" in their social media accounts.  Yet not everyone seems so enthusiastic about the concept.  The question ""can a mathematical algorithm really solve a trust crisis?"" was posted by a commentator on DoNews, a technology news website in China, earlier this week.  As they argued:  ""Blockchain technology cannot put an end to the production of the problematic vaccines, and it would even be hard to change the status quo - because the operation of this industry is deeply centralized. It is simply an abysmal 'black box.' Nobody can really be sure about the trace of the internal operation until any serious problems leak again. Once that happens, its ""system"" would give you some sort of 'data' which would make you feel stupid.""  The author then concluded that blockchain is only a technology, which will not solve the much more complicated social issues that deeply rooted in Chinese society.  Another article from July 23 appeared on Zhihu, the Chinese version of Quora, also doubted the feasibility of the blockchain adoption from a more technological side.  People cannot guarantee ""the authenticity of the original information,"" the author argued. ""For example, the information of the vaccine production can be false even before it gets on the chain.""  Indeed, at least one startup has attracted the interest from regulators regarding a claim that it is putting together a blockchain platform for this purpose, as CoinDesk previously reported.  Censorship at work  The examples show that there is an earnest discussion taking place within China's social media ecosystem on this dilemma.  But the ever-present issue of state censorship makes it difficult to get a firm grasp on how detailed the conversations have been beyond news outlets and blog posts and the comments that accompany them.  On Weibo, for example, no results are shown when searching the keywords ""blockchain"" and ""vaccine"" – an indication that those posts are being masked. Yet notably, it may be blockchain itself that helps enable conversations the one taking place around the vaccine issue.  The original article - dubbed ""the King of Vaccine,"" which unveiled the newest scandal – is currently blocked on Chinese social media. Yet someone has permanently recorded it on the ethereum blockchain, as shown on Etherescan.  As this post on BTC123.com, a China-based crypto online community, explained:  ""At 2.49. 54 (s) a.m. July 22, 2018, an article named 'the King of Vaccine' has been permanently recorded on Etherescan at 6007493.
