42381597,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nS2x,1550702132,A DIY Bitcoin Lightning Node Project Just Hit Its 1.0 Milestone,"A project aiming to empower people to build nodes that can send and route payments on bitcoin's in-development lightning network has officially released version 1.0 of its code.  Announced this week, RaspiBlitz has published finalized instructions for building a lightning node on a tiny hobbyist computer called a raspberry pi. Often used for custom tech projects, the raspberry pi toolkit aims to enable the creation of nodes that can send and secure small bitcoin payments in a trustless way.  Setting it apart from other lightning nodes, its final form is equipped with a LCD screen and software that boots up a colorful interface (showing a ASCII lightning symbol and the node's public key). As such, the finished product arguably gives a more visual window into what's going on with their lightning node.  Project lead Christian Rootzoll told CoinDesk:  ""In general, the version 1.0 signals that I see the RaspiBlitz package is ready to be shared with friends and colleagues for its intended purpose: To set up a bitcoin and lightning node during a workshop, which takes about 3 hours, or as a do-it-yourself (DIY) project over the weekend when you order the parts from Amazon.""  In total, the equipment, including a raspberry pi and memory, costs roughly $100. Some users have even been placing the pis in DIY 3D-printed cases, making the device look like a futuristic terminal.    Image via CryptoCloaks    A lot of lightning users already use RaspiBlitz since it's the cheapest option for running a bitcoin node, with hackers carving out a corner dedicated to putting them together at the NYC lightning ""hackday"" last fall.  The raspberry pi device has long been used to power the bitcoin nodes that store full copies of the bitcoin blockchain, making the small computers a vital part of bitcoin's infrastructure.  Still, Rootzoll admits that ""plug-and-play"" nodes like Casa are much easier to set up if less technical users want to give lightning a try. Though the disadvantage is they're more costly at $300.  He concluded:  ""For now if you like to have a little hands on and searching for a cheap starting point to become part of the lightning network - the RaspiBlitz project is the choice by a lot of people. And now with version 1.0 the package is ready to be spread across the world.""

42381598,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nS6j,1550696504,Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg Sees Pros and Cons in Blockchain Logins,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is seriously evaluating blockchain's potential to allow internet users to log in to various services via one set of credentials without relying on third parties.  Such a use for the technology would make a compelling alternative to services like Facebook Connect, the social media giant's single sign-on (SSO) application, Zuckerberg said in a recently posted video interview with Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain.  ""A use of blockchain that I've been thinking about ... though I haven't figured out a way to make this work out, is around authentication and... granting access to your information to different services,"" he said. ""So, replacing the notion of what we have with Facebook Connect with something that is truly distributed.""  In a nutshell, Zuckerberg added:  ""Basically, you take your information, you store it on some decentralized system and you have the choice to log into places without going through an intermediary,""  This arrangement for logins would appeal to software developers who don't want to rely on corporations that can cut off users' access, Zuckerberg said, noting that there would also be a downside to this since it would also prevent firms from dealing with bad actors.  Pros and cons  Citing a scandal that embroiled Facebook last year, he added: ""basically people chose to give their data which was affiliated with Cambridge University and that person sold that information to Cambridge Analytica, which was a violation of our policies. We cut off the developers' access.""  The lesson, he said, is that ""if you have a fully distributed system, it dramatically empowers individuals on one hand but ... it raises the question of consent and how people can really know that they're giving consent to an institution. In some ways, it's a lot easier to regulate and hold accountable larger companies. ... I think this is a really interesting social question.""  Underscoring his ambivalence about the idea, Zuckerberg added:  ""The question is, do you really want that? Do you have more cases where yes people would be able to not have an intermediary but there'd be more instances of abuse and recourse would be much harder?""  He further acknowledged the broad technical challenges created by decentralization.  ""Certainly the level of computation that Facebook is doing is really intense to do in a distributed way,"" he said. ""Decentralized things that are computationally intensive will be harder. They're harder to do computation on, but eventually, maybe you have the resources to do that.""

The Galaxy S10, formally unveiled Wednesday, includes a new function targeted toward cryptocurrency users in the form of the Samsung Knox, the world's largest smartphone producer announced.  In a press release, Samsung explained:  ""Galaxy S10 is built with defense-grade Samsung Knox, as well as a secure storage backed by hardware, which houses your private keys for blockchain-enabled mobile services.""  The S10 comes with an upgraded camera system that features ""advanced intelligence,"" the ability to charge other phones wirelessly, 8GB RAM and 256GB storage (on the base model) and a number of other features, according to the release.  Further details about the Knox solution were not immediately available, and Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Still, the S10 joins a slowly growing line of smartphones designed with cryptocurrencies in mind, including HTC's EXODUS 1 and Sirin Labs' Finney, both of which were announced last year.

The Galaxy is Samsung's flagship line, with four different devices falling under the S10 umbrella intended to fill as wide a market as possible. In contrast, the HTC EXODUS 1 can only be bought using bitcoin or ether, and the Finney can only be purchased using the Sirin token.

42381605,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nSEH,1550692800,A David vs. Goliath Battle Is Brewing in Ethereum Decentralized Exchange Race,"A project funded by one of 2017's largest initial coin offerings (ICOs) is facing fierce competition from a brand-new competitor funded by a modest grant.  Bancor, which raised $150 million during the ICO craze, was founded to make it easy to trade even illiquid ethereum tokens. That's the same mission as Uniswap, which launched in November and is funded solely by a $100,000 grant from the non-profit Ethereum Foundation.  Yet, despite the fact that Bancor has been live for over a year, and that it has more resources, new data from blockchain analytics firm Blocklytics reveals the two protocols are now locked in a tight competition to programmatically facilitate ethereum trades.  Blocklytics found Uniswap first overtook Bancor in total ether trading volume on Feb. 13, when it had a daily trading volume of $541,408 – a full $196,478 more than Bancor for the day.  But Uniswap’s advantage over Bancor was not permanent.  The difference narrowed on Feb. 14 and Bancor reclaimed the lead on Feb. 15. On Feb. 17, the last day with complete data, Bancor's $571,395 in trades amounted to $137,866 more than Uniswap's, according to the firm's findings, shared exclusively with CoinDesk.  The data presents only a snapshot of how the two protocols aimed at offering market liquidity have fared in recent weeks. Still, the new competition has been enough to spur notice from market observers who feel that Uniswap may offer improvements on the Bancor model, particularly in its decision not to introduce or require the use of its own ethereum token.  Robert Leshner of Compound Finance, a protocol for collateralized lending on ethereum, told CoinDesk that he'd been impressed with Bancor's design, at least until Uniswap went live.  Leshner told CoinDesk:  ""Uniswap ripped out the token and simplified the algorithm. It costs a fraction of the gas to trade, and incentivizes the community to add to the liquidity over time.""  The findings have imbued the Uniswap team with a new confidence in their approach as well, leading them to suggest Bancor wasn't able to build a moat around its service.  Project creator Hayden Adams says Uniswap's technology makes it easy for people who want to participate in market making to join in. ""This has led to a massive growth in the liquidity pools, which allows for larger trades and a higher volume,"" Adams told CoinDesk.  However, Bancor emphasizes that focusing on ethereum trading misses the larger story: Bancor's ability to trade tokens across more than one public blockchain.  Examining the data  Nevertheless, by either metric, the research by Blocklytics shows Uniswap, a smaller, newer application has quickly become competitive in facilitating ether token trading. From the start of 2019 to now, Uniswap's trading volume is up more than 10x, according to Blocklytics.  That said, it's not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison.  Caleb Sheridan, co-founder of Blocklytics, told CoinDesk that the nature of these apps makes comparing them complicated. In short, they each trade between tokens by first trading into a third, more widely traded token.  On Bancor, a trade from REP to ZRX would trade REP for BNT and then BNT for ZRX. On Uniswap, ETH would be in the middle rather than its own token.  ""We avoid counting the same volume more than once by treating each order as one trade regardless of how many trades the platform actually made to fulfill that order,"" Sheridan said.  Although, the data compiled by Blocklytics shows that Bancor remains ahead on several other metrics. Bancor is running 76 more ERC-20 tokens than Uniswap as of this writing.  Bancor told CoinDesk it did $3.67 million in volume from Feb. 3 to Feb. 9. The analysis from Blocklytics shows it running $2.89 million in volume over that period. (Bancor declined to provide daily volume, but Blocklytics' report does not include EOS trades.)  Additionally, much of Uniswap's recent growth can primarily be ascribed to trades for MKR, the governance token for MakerDAO's two-token system, with a healthy dose of DAI (MakerDao's stablecoin) in there as well. Bancor currently sees more individual trades and hosts more accounts than Uniswap.  From Bancor's perspective, a key value add for its automated market makers is also the fact that it aims to offer its service to more than one blockchain (today, ethereum and EOS), something Uniswap cannot do. From Uniswap's perspective, ethereum is the only blockchain it is interested in serving, so it could muddy the waters to compare Uniswap to Bancor.  Nate Hindman, a spokesperson for Bancor, told CoinDesk in an email:  ""Creating a dependency on ETH or any blockchain-level token by utilizing it as Bancor’s hub token would dramatically reduce the flexibility and reach of the network and protocol.""  ICO questions  However, the data opens up old questions about tokenized business and fundraising models, particularly how effective they can prove to be against those that do not require a new token.  Bancor, the largest token sale ever at the time, stirred controversy over its use of a token, BNT, drawing fire from prominent technologists, including researchers at Cornell University.  Nevertheless, it quickly saw adoption once its product went live, proving its thesis was right: people wanted an easy way to trade between any two tokens. Further controversy would arise when Bancor suffered a 2018 security breach. But it continued to see usage and growth.  Still, Bancor has had to continue to defend its use of a token. (For example, the Bancor team used a Twitter thread to defend its use of the BNT token last week.)  ""In total 1.2 million transactions have been processed through BNT across 40,000 wallets, totaling $1.5 billion in conversions,” the company wrote. “Around 10 percent of BNT’s total supply is staked in automated market makers facilitating these conversions, making BNT one of the most active utility tokens in the world.""  Nevertheless, by either metric, the Blocklytics research shows the smaller, newer application has quickly become competitive, perhaps opening the door for competitors to emerge on Bancor that facilitate trading by using a protocol's native token.  For now, Uniswap’s Adams told CoinDesk he’s focused on improving the usability of the service.  He wrote:  ""As Uniswap gains more users and integrations the trade volume (and fees generated) will increase. This increases the profitability of providing liquidity and will likely lead to even more liquidity.""  Bancor co-founder Galia Benartzi speaks at niTROn Summit 2019.

42430219,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCdh,1550686816,Global Cryptocurrency Trading Volumes Jump to 300-Day Highs,"The total volume of all cryptocurrency trading as tracked by market metrics leader Coinmarketcap hit a 300-day high Tuesday, reaching $33.85 billion, the most observed in 10 months.  As such, the data point is the latest to suggest that trading activity in the cryptocurrency markets is increasing – Coinmarketcap tracks the aggregate trading volume of 2,074 cryptocurrencies, including data about how they are being bought and sold across exchanges worldwide.  Daily cryptocurrency trading volume  But, the data hints that there may be more nuance at work than simply a market-wide surge; a large majority of yesterday’s trading volume came from the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.  The aggregate trade volume from the top 10 alone was roughly $30 billion, or 88 percent of all trading volume seen Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTC) and tether (USDT) recorded 24-hour trade volumes above $9 billion, each accounting for roughly 27 percent of the 24-hour total.  Still, the uptick in trading volume shows a renewed investor interest in the market, which perhaps should not come as a surprise seeing as the value of the broader cryptocurrency market has increased roughly 12 percent in the last seven days.  That said, trading volumes are still a fraction of what was seen toward the end of the most recent bull market in 2017. The most trading volume ever recorded in a single day occurred on Jan. 4, 2018, when just over $68 billion in cryptocurrency changed hands, an amount that's more than double yesterday's total.  Trading volumes are off to another strong start today, recording $29.8 billion at press time. Since the beginning of the week, $96.9 billion in total has been traded, which is already 68 percent of the volume recorded in the prior week, which at the time was a near nine-month high.

42430213,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCNh,1550681102,SEC Settles Unregistered Securities Charges Against ICO Issuer Gladius,"Crypto startup Gladius Network LLC has settled charges of running an unregistered securities offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulator announced Wednesday.  Gladius Network conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) near the end of 2017, raising $12.7 million in the form of nearly 24,000 ETH. In a press release, the SEC explained that this ICO was not registered under federal securities laws, and the ICO itself did not qualify for an exemption from any registration requirements these laws impose.  Under the settlement, Gladius will return funds to any investors who request a refund and register its tokens as securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The startup is not admitting to or denying the SEC's findings under the arrangement.  Notably, the SEC used the phrase ""unregistered ICO"" in the headline of its announcement, echoing past statements by the commission's chairman, Jay Clayton, every ICO he'd seen was a security.  The SEC previously settled unregistered securities charges against crypto startups Airfox and Paragon Coin, but did not explicitly use the phrase ""unregistered ICO"" at the time for either company.  No penalty  The SEC will not be imposing a penalty as it has in the past, due to the fact that Gladius self-reported its token sale to the regulator, the press release explained.  Gladius ""expressed an interest in taking prompt remedial steps,"" the release added.  In a statement, SEC cyber unit chief Robert Cohen noted that ""The SEC has been clear that companies must comply with the securities laws when issuing digital tokens that are securities,"" adding:  ""Today’s case shows the benefit of self-reporting and taking proactive steps to remediate unregistered offerings.""  The SEC release noted that Gladius' token sale came after its DAO report was released, which found in particular that ICOs can qualify as securities offerings.

The round was led by Aspect Ventures, with Neotribe Ventures and WestWave Capital also participating.  CipherTrace provides analytics and forensics products for cryptocurrencies and blockchains that it says are already in use by government, regulators, law enforcement and auditors to help enforce anti-money laundering laws and tackle crime.  By collecting a range of data points and using machine learning to crunch that data, the firm says it can de-anonymize blockchain-based transactions and trace flows of funds to ""legitimate entities as well as criminal enterprises.""  As part of the funding deal, Aspect venture partner Mark Kraynak will join the CipherTrace board of directors.  Kraynak said his firm believes that security and regulatory compliance will be ""a key first hurdle to mass adoption.”  Adding that demand for its products is growing, the firm said it will use the new funds to expand internationally and add more features to its products.  Greg Wasserman, co-head of principal investments at Galaxy Digital, said:  “Appropriate AML technology is critical for the mainstream adoption of digital assets. Institutional investors are increasingly looking to platforms like CipherTrace to monitor the integrity of transactions with their counterparties.”  Galaxy Digital is already a CipherTrace customer, he added.  Growth sector  With cryptocurrency's reputation (whether deserved or not) for use in criminal enterprise, compliance and security is a growing segment in the cryptocurrency space, and increasingly investors as a foundational part of industry as the technology gradually moves more mainstream.  Just today, Solidus Labs – a crypto surveillance startup led by former Goldman Sachs fintech engineers – raised $3 million in seed funding. while Chainalysis, also a cryptocurrency sleuthing startup, announced a $30 million Series B earlier this month.  Chainalysis CEO and co-founder Michael Gronager, said then that the round suggests a continuing appetite among investors to make a long-term bet on the foundations of the developing crypto ecosystem.  “The investment and the timing of it shows that, despite fluctuating prices, there is quite a strong conviction among some very big VCs that this is not a short term play,” he told CoinDesk.  Coinbase, too, has emphasized the importance of blockchain analytics with the acquisition of a startup called startup Neutrino last week. Made as part of its drive to offer more diverse crypto assets across borders, blockchain analytics-based compliance is ""important as we work with regulators and agencies in different countries to bring new assets there,” the exchange said at the time.  The news of the acquisition was timely, as it came several weeks after Israeli blockchain analytics firm Whitestream said a Coinbase account has been directing bitcoin donations to the Palestinian military-political group Hamas, which is deemed a terrorist organization by some nations.

42430218,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCbh,1550667634,Goldman Sachs Veterans Raise $3 Million to Fight Crypto Manipulation,"A U.S.-based crypto surveillance startup led by former Goldman Sachs fintech engineers has just raised $3 million in seed funding.  Solidus Labs, provider of a machine learning and artificial intelligence-powered trade surveillance platform for digital assets, announced the news on Wednesday, saying that the funding was led by early-stage investment firm Hanaco Ventures. VC firm Global Founders Capital and Wall Street veterans David Krell and Norman Sorensen also participated.  The investment will go toward expanding the firm’s expertise in engineering and machine learning, as well as boosting its sales, marketing and customer service teams, in order to further develop its platform, the firm said.  Solidus said that crypto exchanges are largely using “outdated” trading surveillance platforms that may work well with fiat currency, but are not well suited to the 24/7 world of cryptos. Further, traditional solutions are unable to “sufficiently accommodate” the crypto market’s operational and regulatory needs, Solidus’ founder and CEO Asaf Meir claimed.  “Our machine learning-powered surveillance system is able to continuously learn as new patterns emerge and reveal new manipulation schemes or openings for manipulation,"" said Meir. ""It enables responding as things happen rather than retroactively.”  Solidus said its web-based surveillance system is already deployed with clients including exchanges, broker-dealers, hedge funds and market makers in Europe, the U.S. and Israel. The firm also claimed to have already managed to reduce “trading manipulation false positives by 30 percent” by analyzing trading patterns and flagging anomalies in real-time.  Lior Prosor, general partner at Hanaco Ventures, said:  “Although it might sound cliched, the digital asset ecosystem is in dire need of good ‘picks and shovels’ rather than more end applications. We believe regulation and security are the ultimate ‘enablers’ in this space, and that regulating a market powered by groundbreaking technology requires groundbreaking compliance infrastructure.""  The issue of crypto market manipulation is seen as one that is holding back the entry of institutional investors to the market. It's also been raised by regulators and lawmakers as a problem to be addressed.  Jay Clayton, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, told CoinDesk last November that he doesn’t see a pathway to a cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval until concerns over market manipulation are addressed.  In September, the New York Office of the Attorney General also released a report on cryptocurrency trading platforms, saying that many are vulnerable to market manipulation (although some exchanges denied the claim).  Aiming to address the issue, two U.S. Congressmen in December introduced a bill to prevent crypto price manipulation.

42430203,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpC7h,1550664050,"Sparkpool to Freeze Mysterious 2,100 Ether Mining Payout for Now","UPDATE: Further analysis from blockchain analytics site Amberdata suggests yesterday’s abnormal mining rewards were likely a result of a buggy bot.    --------    Cryptocurrency mining pool Sparkpool has said it is temporarily freezing a mysterious 2,100 ether payment it received Tuesday and is waiting for the sender to reach out for a solution.  The transaction was received as an apparent reward for mining just one block on the ethereum blockchain, but the amount is roughly 600 times the network’s standard block reward.  The company notified its collective of miners in a statement on Wednesday that it will hold the ether – currently worth around $300,000 – for now, in case the abnormally high mining fee was attached in error.  ""Sparkpool has recently mined a block with a 2100 ETH mining reward, which was an anomaly that triggered our internal emergency mechanism,"" the company said in a statement. ""We have temporarily frozen this fee and are now waiting for the sender to contact us for a solution. If the sender does not reach out in the next a few days, Sparkpool will then allocate the fees to miners who are entitled for the reward.""  Xin Xu, CEO of Sparkpool, told CoinDesk via WeChat that the pool is holding the funds given the significant amount involved, and that the firm's users and miners understand the decision.  Xu added:  ""Unfortunately, and fortunately, blockchain is so far not completely run by machines; human are still involved. So we have an opportunity to correct the problem. Integrity is our pool’s priority.""  Sparkpool received the 2,100 ETH payout after mining block number 7,238,290 on the ethereum blockchain.  Since then, users have suggested such activity could be a random fluke when one or perhaps several users accidentally attached abnormally high transaction fees to their payments. Others said it could also be goodwill from anonymous supporters of the ethereum mining community, or even an attempt to launder money via the world's second largest public blockchain.  Possibly ‘a programming error’  However, subsequent analysis by blockchain analytics site Amberdata suggests yesterday’s abnormal block payout was “likely an automated bot that went wrong.”  Speaking to CoinDesk, CTO of Amberdata Joanes Espanol explained:  “I don’t believe it to be an attempt at money laundering, because the same ‘error’ happened five times within a couple hours, and different mining pools were the lucky recipients of the transaction fees.”  As shown on Amberdata’s blockchain explorer, four other transactions – outside of the one paying out 2,100 ETH – rewarded miners a combined total of roughly 1,890 ETH.  They occurred on block number 7,238,273, 7,238,275, 7,239,023, and 7,239,021. The first three of these transactions as listed were paid out to mining pool Nanopool and the fourth to Ethermine.  What's more, Espanol highlights that all five transactions including the one paid out to Sparkpool all ""originated from the same wallet, which saw their overall balance go from 4,000 to about 400 ETH, for what seems to be a programming error.""  ""Yet another good example of why auditing and battle testing smart contract code is vital,” concluded Espanol.  Editor's note: Xin Xu's statements have been translated from Chinese.

42430223,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCjh,1550661031,Bitcoin Price Looks North As Trading Volumes Hit 9-Month Highs,"View  Bitcoin witnessed an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on Monday and rose to $4,000 yesterday, confirming a bullish reversal on the daily chart.  The trend change is backed by a jump in trading volumes to levels last seen in May 2018. The rally, therefore, looks to have legs and December highs above $4,200 could come into play, albeit after a minor bout of consolidation or pullback, as the indicators on the 4-hour chart and daily charts are reporting overbought conditions.  A break below Monday's low of $3,614 would invalidate the bullish setup, although that looks unlikely, as longer duration charts are beginning to align in favor of the bulls.  Bitcoin (BTC) could revisit December highs above $4,200 in the near-term as the recent rally is backed by a surge in trading volumes.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $3,930 on Bitstamp, having clocked a 5.5-week high of $4,000 yesterday.  The 20 percent appreciation witnessed over the last 12 days is accompanied by a 28.4 percent rise in daily trading volumes, according to CoinMarketCap.  Notably, total trading volumes across all exchanges jumped 40 percent to $9.91 billion on Monday, validating BTC's bullish breakout above $3,800. Further, investor interest in the cryptocurrency has increased post-breakout, with volumes rising further to $9.93 billion yesterday – the highest level since May 3, 2018.  So, the recent rally appears to have substance and prices could rise towards $4,236 (Dec. 24 high) in the near-term.  Daily chart  Both the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout and the triangle breakout seen in the above chart indicate a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending north, indicating a short-term bullish setup. The 50-day MA has bottomed out (shed bearish bias) and the 100-day MA hurdle has been scaled.  While the path of least resistance is to the higher side, a rise toward the Dec. 24 high of $4,236 may not happen immediately. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has moved into overbought territory above 70.00, while the long upper shadow attached to the previous day’s candle is sending a similar message.  4-hour chart  On the 4-hour chart, the RSI is reporting overbought conditions and has diverged in favor of the bears (does not mirror the higher price highs) However, the stacking order of the 50-candle MA, above the 100-candle MA, above the 200-candle MA is a classic bullish indicator.  So, pullbacks, if any, could be short-lived – especially as the longer duration charts are looking increasingly bullish.  3-day chart  BTC's current 3-day candle looks set to close well above $3,711. That would add credence to the bullish outside reversal candle created in three-days to Feb. 8 and bring potential for a move towards $4,429 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from November highs to December lows).  Supporting that scenario are a bullish crossover between the 5- and 10-day MAs, confirmed earlier this month, and an RSI of 51.00.

42430214,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCTh,1550660411,US Advocacy Group Calls for National Action Plan on Blockchain,"The Chamber of Digital Commerce, a blockchain advocacy group, has called for the U.S. government to implement a national strategy for blockchain technology.  The organization released its recommendations for the plan on Wednesday, urging the government to promote and support the blockchain industry through clear and supportive public statements.  So far, most public statements from the U.S. government on cryptocurrencies have been in the form of warnings and enforcement actions, according to the chamber. Instead, there is a need for “clearly articulated statement of support for the private sector” on blockchain for the benefit of government, business and consumers, it said.  The U.S. government agencies should also coordinate with each other to develop blockchain policies, guidance and regulations. There should be a “light-touch regulatory approach” and the industry must have clarity on what laws apply to blockchain-based applications and digital tokens, the group added.  Chamber of Digital Commerce founder and president Perianne Boring said in a statement:  “Other developed nations are promoting the adoption of blockchain and digital assets. It is imperative that the U.S. also recognize the power and potential of blockchain technology. ...We can either step forward as visionary leaders or risk falling behind.”  The U.S. government should also create an office to coordinate on blockchain strategy, the chamber recommended, given the “multi-tiered and multi-stakeholder structure of U.S. financial services regulation.”  It argued that blockchain tech has potential to streamline processes across industries, including cybersecurity, financial services, healthcare, supply chain, and more, and that the lawmakers should reach out and cooperate with entrepreneurs in order to develop the national blockchain strategy.  Some U.S. lawmakers have already been making legislative efforts in the crypto and blockchain space. Back in October, a bipartisan bill was introduced, proposing the creation of a “consensus-based definition of blockchain.”  In December, two more bipartisan bills were introduced aimed to prevent crypto price manipulation and to boost acceptance of blockchain technology.  And, just last week, lawmakers in the U.S. state of Wyoming passed three bills related to blockchain and cryptos.  One bill is designed to recognize digital assets as property and clears the way for banks to act as crypto custodians, the others aim to enable securities to be issued in a tokenized form and create “special purpose depository institutions” to enable blockchain businesses to access traditional banking services. All three are now awaiting signature by the state governor to officially become law.

42387621,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlvVP,1550657721,The SEC Is Now Reviewing 2 Bitcoin ETF Proposals,"For the first time since August, there are now multiple bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals sitting before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The VanEck/SolidX proposal filed with Cboe BZX Exchange has now appeared in Wednesday's edition of the Federal Register, officially kicking off the 45-day clock to an initial decision. It joins another bitcoin ETF proposal filed by Bitwise Asset Management with NYSE Arca, which was published in the register last week.  Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategy at VanEck, told CoinDesk via email that he believes a bitcoin ETF will serve the public interest if approved.  The company has been actively working with regulators, as well as other major market participants, ""to bring simplicity, transparency and professional market standards to digital assets,"" he said.  VanEck is hoping that this collaboration will let it bring a regulated product with exposure to digital assets to market going forward.  ""I ... hope that our investment in regulatory and market education, hard work and commitment will be honored when the time comes,"" Gurbacs said.  SEC approval?  It might not just be the proposals themselves which secure an approval. Matt Hougan, Bitwise global head of research, told CoinDesk that the crypto ecosystem is ""evolving very rapidly,"" which may aid in getting a product launched.  (Hougan was speaking to his company's specific proposal, though his remarks reflect on the crypto industry more broadly.)  ""A year ago there was maybe one qualified crypto custodian ... and now there are half-a-dozen, and that number will go up from here,"" he noted as one example.  And this is not the only example. A number of advances and new products have entered the space in a relatively short period of time. Hougan explained:  ""A little more than year ago, we didn't have futures. A year ago we didn’t have nearly as many firms making markets. A few months ago, you didn’t have folks like Fidelity announced in the space. It’s evolving really, really quickly.""  Moreover, he noted, this progress comes despite the broader price movements (the crypto market is currently in its longest bear market since bitcoin was first born a decade ago).  While this progress may be ""overshadowed by the price movements,"" he said there remains a large amount of development within the space.  His comments echo those of Kobre Kim attorney Jake Chervinsky, who previously told CoinDesk that he believes several more months of development within the ecosystem should see the crypto markets mature to the point where the SEC may feel comfortable approving an ETF.  At the time, Chervinsky explained that the key points the SEC will evaluate are bitcoin's valuation, liquidity, custody solutions and market manipulation.  Ultimately, however, a bitcoin ETF approval will depend on how companies approach their proposals.  ""The SEC has been extraordinarily clear in the Dalia Blass letter and in the Winklevoss rejection letter in what they will require before you can list a product. It’s up to folks in the industry … to meet those standards,"" Hougan noted, saying:  ""All you can ask for a regulator is to lay out clear bars you have to clear before they will approve something.""

42430220,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCfh,1550656838,"Cryptos 'Not a Substitute' for the Precious Metal, Says World Gold Council","Cryptocurrencies are ""no substitute for gold,"" according to the World Gold Council (WGC).  The WGC, a market development organization for the gold industry, published the report late last month, arguing that gold is “very different” from cryptocurrencies. It's less volatile, has a more liquid market and trades in a regulatory environment, among other factors, it said.  Gold's price has appreciated 10 percent per year on average since the collapse of Bretton Woods monetary system (which pegged major currencies to the precious metal) in the 1970s, the WGC said, while its volatility has also reduced over the last four decades.  Bitcoin's price, on the other hand, the council said, has been “extremely volatile – some 10 times that of the dollar denominated gold price.” Therefore, it is not really a good as a currency, the WGC opined, “let alone a store of value, potentially limiting bitcoin’s use as a transaction token.”  Bitcoin trading volumes are also “very low” compared to gold and other currencies. Giving the statistics, the WGC said, bitcoin trades $2 billion on an average per day – less than 1 percent of the total gold market's volume of approximately $250 billion per day.  The WGC said that gold demand is diverse, supply is ""responsive"" and is a “tried and tested effective” investment option in portfolios as a diversifier, as well as having performed well during periods of inflation.  Further, gold prices and demand are not showing any signs of suffering from crypto competition, the council said, adding that cryptocurrencies compete more between themselves, as there are now thousands of tokens available.  The WGC concluded:  “[Bitcoin's] performance has, until recently, been remarkable, but its purpose as an investment seems quite different from gold. Cryptocurrencies have yet to be tested in multiple markets.”  On blockchain technology, the Council is taking a more positive stance, though. It said, the technology is “genuinely innovative” and could be useful across financial services and beyond, including within the gold industry.  PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel argued last year that bitcoin is tantamount to digital gold. Much like gold, he said, the cryptocurrency is destined to be a store of value rather than a means of payment.  “It’s like bars of gold in a vault that never move,” Thiel said. “It’s sort of hedge of sorts against the whole world falling apart.”  Gold and bitcoin image via Shutterstock; chart courtesy of the WGC report",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/20/cryptos-not-a-substitute-for-the-precious-metal-says-world-gold-council,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9245060a59f7f804d5c415ddfc54447ddf649ef1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430212,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpCPh,1550653228,Wyoming Lawmakers Pass Three Bills in Boost for State's Crypto Industry,"The U.S. state of Wyoming has passed several bills aimed to make the state a top destination for cryptocurrency and blockchain businesses.  The Wyoming House of Representatives approved bill SF0125 last week, which recognizes digital assets as property and clears the way for banks to act as crypto custodians. The bill passed a House vote 54-2 and was concurred in the Senate a day later, with 29 votes for and none against.  The bill defines a digital asset as ""a representation of economic, proprietary or access rights that is stored in a computer readable format, and includes digital consumer assets, digital securities and virtual currency.”  Once the bill is approved and signed by the state Governor Mark Gordon, it will officially become law effective July 1, and would classify digital assets as property within the Uniform Commercial Code.  According to the bill:  “Digital consumer assets are intangible personal property and shall be considered general intangibles, as defined in W.S. 34.1‑9‑102(a)(xlii), only for the purposes of article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, title 34.1, Wyoming statutes.”  The bill also includes a provision for allowing banks to provide digital asset custodial services providing they comply with all accounting, internal control and other standards. It was first introduced last month by a bipartisan group of the state legislators.  Caitlin Long, co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, told CoinDesk at the time that the bill is a big step forward for the state, and could prove a boon for crypto startups and users alike.  Stocks and banking too  And that's not all. Wyoming House of Representatives also passed two other major bills on cryptocurrency regulation last Friday – House Bill (HB) 0074 and HB0185.  HB0185 was introduced last month and enables securities to be issued in tokenized form. ""Normally, a stock certificate is a piece of paper. ... If you want to use a blockchain token to represent a stock certificate, [that would be] legal in Wyoming. [It would be] a legally issued security,"" Long told CoinDesk.  Meanwhile, HB0074 is designed to address one of the major challenges to the blockchain industry in Long's eyes – that ""banks have not been banking the [crypto] startups.""  ""There was a crackdown in the fall of 2017 and a number of banks went through and did a big compliance review that closed every account that was connected to digital assets at all. A lot of businesses when out of business because they lost their bank accounts,"" recounted Long. ""This [bill] is designed to be an industry utility. It's designed to serve a very important need that wasn't been served by the mainstream banking industry.""  As stated on Long's official website, HB 0074 creates ""special purpose depository institutions to serve businesses which may not be able to access traditional banking services, including blockchain businesses.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, Republican member and majority whip of the Wyoming House of Representatives Tyler Lindholm commented:  ""[With HB0074,] it's not required to have FDIC insurance in place, so that means they're not obligated to listen to [certain] federal government [requirements] ... Blockchain-type industries, gun industries, all sorts of industries down the line get discriminated against. So, that's what we're targeting here.""  Leading the pack  The passing of all these bills ""surpasses anything we did last year,"" adds Lindholm. ""I think you're going to see institutional customers such as Fidelity looking at this.""  Agreeing with this sentiment, Long told CoinDesk:  ""There's going to be an influx of a financial services industry to the state of Wyoming, both from the special purpose depository institutions that we talked about today – these are the non-FDIC insured banks – as well as separately there's going to be digital asset custodians coming into the state of Wyoming.""  All three bills are currently awaiting signature by the state governor.  ""Obviously it's not done until it's done so we're careful to say they're not law yet but they are heading there most likely,"" highlighted Long.  Back in January, the state also approved a fintech sandbox bill, aiming to let startups, including those in the blockchain space, test new technologies and determine how they might function within existing regulatory regimes.  ""I think right now Wyoming is the standard. We've got other states running in one form or another our legislation ... so they're trying to play catch-up. The unfortunate part of that is we passed the bills this year too, so that puts us out a little bit farther out front,"" boasted Lindholm.

42430205,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpC9h,1550649602,You Can Now Test Binance's Decentralized Crypto Exchange,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has rolled out public testing for a decentralized trading platform built on its own blockchain network.  The company announced on Wednesday the new platform – called Binance DEX – is now up for public testing where users can create their own wallets and interact with the trading platform's interface.  In addition, Binance revealed the blockchain explorer for the testnet of its proprietary public network called Binance Chain, which empowers the DEX so that traders can participate as individual nodes and hold their own private keys to their crypto assets.  While the launch of the testnet is a major step towards a final roll-out of the decentralized exchange, Binance said it now needs to gather feedback from the community before it can reveal a timeline for the final launch.  “With Binance DEX, we provide a different balance of security, freedom, and ease-of-use, where you take more responsibility and are in more control of personal assets,"" said Binance's co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao.  The company added that Trust Wallet, the blockchain startup Binance recently acquired, and hardware wallet maker Ledger, have already integrated with Binance DEX. Meanwhile, BNB, the ERC20-based token launched by the exchange, will be migrated to Binance Chain upon its final launch.  Binance first announced the plan to develop its own blockchain and a decentralized exchange in March 2018, after it kicked off its centralized spot-trading exchange Binance.com in mid-2017.  In today’s announcement, Zhao further boasted that Binance Chain has “near-instant transaction finality with one-second block time.” He added that such capability can potentially enable Binance DEX to handle the same volume Binance.com is handling today.  That said, Zhao also indicated on Twitter days ago that there will be a listing fee of around $100,000 for tokens to be listed on Binance DEX – a high entry bar he said was set to reduce the number of scam projects.
