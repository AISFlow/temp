7122440,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514924,1672959633,"Ethereum Could Jump 27% To Trade At $1,600, How Is This Possible?","Ethereum is currently following the general crypto market trend at this point and has been posting only slight gains in the last 24 hours. With the bear market in full swing, a large number of cryptocurrencies remain at risk of losing more of their value. However, for Ethereum, there could be a bull trend on the horizon and it has to do with staking on the network. Shanghai Upgrade Will Drive Ethereum Up Currently, compared to the other Layer 1 proof of stake networks in the sector, Ethereum sees the lowest percentage of supply staked. At less than 14 of ETH supply being staked, it comes down to there not being a withdrawal mechanism for those who stake on the network but this could change very soon and bring with it renewed vigor to the market. Related Reading: Solana Leads Crypto Market Gains, How Long Will This Continue? The Ethereum “Shanghai” upgrade is expected to take place sometime in March 2023 and a Matrixport report shared with NewsBTC via email expects this to be a bull trigger for the digital asset. As it puts it, “it seems extremely likely that more ETH will be staked after March and this could put upward pressure on ETH prices.” The reasoning behind this is a simple one; the more ETH is staked, the less supply in the market, and scarcity leads to higher prices. Instead of staked ETH volume actually declining, it is expected to increase because once withdrawals are possible, investors will be more confident to stake their coins, knowing that they can easily get it back. “With more ETH being staked and removed from circulation, the downside price pressure seems limited as long as ETH remains staked.” Another Rally To $1,600 for ETH The report further elaborates on its expected price reaction for Ethereum following the “Shanghai” upgrade. It notes that the digital asset is already breaking out of its sideways consolidation which is a good thing as such a breakout from previous consolidations had seen ETH rally as high as 39% in 2022. ETH jumps above $1,250 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com So if another breakout such as this were to take place, it is possible that the digital asset could see an over 27% increase just like it did in October 2022. This would obviously bring its price back up to $1,600 with a 27% rally, and above $1,750 with a 39% rally. It also predicts lower volatility for the year 2023, but still expects investors to see a 9.8% increase with a 63% implied volatility for March 23. Related Reading: Bottom Signal: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Falls To Three-Year Lows Besides the factors outlined in the Matrixport report, another thing that could support this bull case is a “buy the rumor” event. These often occur leading up to important upgrades such as “Shanghai” where investors capitalize on the anticipation to drive the price of a digital asset up. Therefore, in the months and weeks leading up to the upgrade in March, multiple rallies could be triggered which would bring ETH’s price to at least $1,500.

42388254,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRBiCb,1672957075,Microsoft Exec Says Metaverse Is a Must-Have,"LAS VEGAS — Technology company Microsoft (MSFT) is holding on tightly to its future in the metaverse.  Joining CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” live from CES 2023, Henry Bzeih, global chief strategy officer of mobility, automotive and transportation at Microsoft, said that as the world moves toward a more digital landscape, a hybrid model is likely to be the future of consumer and company relationships.  “When we talk about the whole customer experience, you have to factor in the metaverse,” said Bzeih, who has 28 years of experience in the automotive and technology space.  CES, considered to be one of the most influential tech events of the year, is known for setting the stage for some of the biggest forthcoming innovations.  Read more: Microsoft Bans Crypto Mining on Its Online Services Without Permission  What Microsoft is focused on now, said Bzeih, is “mobility cross functionality” in order to transform how customers use platforms to shop.  One example he pointed to is the way consumers buy cars today. Rather than making the trek to a local dealership, Bzeih said consumers – via the metaverse – will be able to “configure the colors, features [and] functions,” of a car. He pointed to the Fiat 500e, which Microsoft is featuring in its virtual car showroom. Microsoft’s partnership with metaverse company Touchcast to lead the data development of that Fiat model is a “natural progression,” he said.  “Microsoft is sitting behind the scenes in an enablement mode,” Bzeih said. “What we do is create that edge to cloud product and solution areas for our customers.”  However, challenges like bringing the metaverse-enabled car selling to the U.S. market linger. The process can be difficult as it calls upon the need to adjust to the ideas of independent franchise owners, who often, too, find the metaverse puzzling, said Bzeih.  The solution, he said, may be a hybrid model that gives businesses the assurance that the “millions of dollars” they’ve invested into physical places don’t just vanish. “To walk away from that and make the whole experience, not there, it just doesn't make any sense for them,” Bzeih said.

42393867,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brb0dv,1672953408,Crypto Markets Analysis:  On-Chain Data Shows Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Turning Profits,"On-chain indicators show that short-term bitcoin holders are turning slight profits, but long-term holders are continuing to sell at a loss.  The Short Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR) and Long Term Holder Output Profit Ratio (LTH-SOPR) have recently suggested that short-term investors have found small opportunities even as the bear market lengthens and volatility remains low, but that long-term investors who bought at higher prices will have to wait for their windfalls.  The STH-SOPR is an on-chain indicator measuring the price sold versus the price paid for BTC less than 155 days (roughly five months) old.  When the figure is above 1, it indicates that the asset is being sold on average at a profit. When the figure is below 1, the asset is being sold at a loss.  The Long Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (LTH-SOPR) is calculated in the same manner, but applies to bitcoin held in excess of 155 days.  Current STH-SOPR: 0.99  Current LTH-SOPR: 0.56  Most short-term BTC holders holding profitable positions likely entered their long positions in late November when bitcoin was trading at its five-month low of $15,599. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has risen about 8% since then.  The STH-SOPR metric has been climbing since a Dec. 19 reading of 0.95. A previous reading above 1.0 occurred on Dec. 14, before declining the subsequent week.  The likely entry point may hint where markets perceive a potential BTC bottom.  From a timing vantage point, Nov. 21 trading activity coincides with a sharp expansion, and subsequent contraction of bitcoin volatility.  BTC’s average true range increased 43% between Nov. 1 and Nov. 21, and has fallen 64% since then. The $15,599 low falls just below a high volume node, when using the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool to measure trading activity.  The combination of compressed volatility and high price agreement implies that short-term traders were comfortable with their entry points, and follow-on trading activity.  Long-term holders have not had the same fortune, as the LTH-SOPR fell below the profitability benchmark on Nov. 24, and has remained there since. But many long-term BTC holders are likely to maintain their holdings, rather than sell at a loss.  However, are many short-term BTC holders short-term in name only?  Investors truly holding a short-term outlook may wish to quickly capitalize on recent price appreciation should those prices push higher.  But those who have been holding bitcoin for only a short time but have longer-range goals may be unwilling to unload bitcoin. For this group, the accumulation of BTC between $15,999 and $16,500 months ago may reflect a level of price support.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/05/crypto-markets-analysis-on-chain-data-shows-short-term-bitcoin-holders-turning-profits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83087f6cbd67c294583015c48cfe9abde266f64a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Moreover, he was accused of making deceptive statements about his firm's safety, number of users, and investment strategies to recruit investors. He even claimed that Celsius, which allowed investors to deposit their crypto in return for huge yields, ""was safer than a bank,"" James noted. New York seeks to ban Mashinsky from conducting business in the state and require him to pay damages, restitution and disgorgement, James said.

The company also said it started utilizing wholesale funding due to the customer withdrawals. Then, in order to accommodate sustained lower deposit levels and maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the company sold debt securities for cash proceeds, it said. The crypto-focused bank made the moves after the collapse of cryptocurrency FTX exacerbated volatility in crypto markets and made investors more wary of the asset class. ""In response to the rapid changes in the digital asset industry during the fourth quarter, we took commensurate steps to ensure that we were maintaining cash liquidity in order to satisfy potential deposit outflows, and we currently maintain a cash position in excess of our digital asset related deposits,"" said CEO Alan Lane. The company will cut ~200 jobs, or 40% of its headcount and estimates a charge of $8M for costs associated with the cuts. After conducting an impairment analysis of the company's intangible assets, Silvergate ( SI ) will take an impairment charge of $196M in Q4 related to developed technology assets purchased from the Diem Group. The company now believes that the launch of a blockchain-based payment solution is no longer imminent, though it will continue to seek opportunities to realize value from the Diem technology assets. There's still people working on the project, Lane said in a conference call , though ""there's significant headwinds to launching something in the near future, so we'll have to look at the expenses that we're incurring."" The company exited its mortgage warehouse lending product in Q4 2022 and will take a restructuring charge of $4M in Q4 2022, primarily related to severance and employee benefits. It will also streamline its product portfolio in coming weeks. The Silvergate Exchange Network Platform (SEN) continues to operate 24/7 with average daily volume totaling $1.3B in Q4 vs. $1.2B in Q3. At Dec. 31, 2022, SEN Leverage commitments dropped to $1.1B vs. $1.5B at Sept. 30. The company reports zero losses and no forced liquidations for SEN Leverage loans. Average Q4 2022 outstanding balance of SEN Leverage loans was $328M vs. $308M in Q3. Silvergate ( SI ) total deposits from digital asset customers declined to $3.8B at Dec. 31, vs. $11.9B at Sept. 30, 2022. As of Dec. 31, ~$150M of Silvergate's deposits were from customers that have filed for bankruptcy. The 70% drawdown in digital asset customer deposits stemmed from ""a much more widespread deleveraging of the [crypto] ecosystem that obviously culminated with the collapse of FTX ( FTT-USD ),"" Lane explained. Cash and cash equivalents as of Dec. 31, 2022 was ~$4.6B, in excess of deposits from digital asset customers. During Q4, Silvergate ( SI ) sold $5.2B of debt securities for cash proceeds, resulting in a loss on the sale of securities and related derivatives of $718M during Q4 2022. As of Dec. 31, 2022, the company held $5.6B of total debt securities at fair value, all of which are U.S. government or agency-backed and available for sale, and which include unrealized losses of approximately $0.3B. Silvergate ( SI ) expects to sell a portion of those securities in early 2023 to reduce wholesale borrowings, which will result in the recognition of a Q4 impairment charge related to the unrealized loss on those securities expected to be sold. In wholesale funding, the company held $2.4B of short-term brokered certificates of deposit and $4.3B of short-term Federal Home Loan Bank advances as of Dec. 31, 2022.

Aurelien Michel, a 24-year-old French citizen who lives in the United Arab Emirates, was taken into custody on Wednesday evening after landing at John F. Kennedy airport in New York.  According to the complaint filed Jan. 3, Michel and other unnamed defendants marketed the Mutant Ape Planet NFTs to prospective buyers by promising them their purchases would come with benefits including “rewards, raffles, exclusive access to other cryptocurrency assets, and the support of a community wallet with funds to be used to market the NFTs.” Project developers also made vague promises about acquiring “metaverse land” for the NFT project, according to authorities.  However, none of Michel’s promises came to fruition. When all the NFTs had been sold, Michel and the other unnamed defendants allegedly transferred the nearly $3 million in earnings to other wallets, including wallets under Michel’s control.  When the Mutant Ape Planet buyers grew suspicious of the transfers, authorities say that Michel, posting under the pseudonym “James”, admitted to the rug pull in the community’s Discord channel.  “We never intended to rug but the community went way too toxic,” the developer posting as “James” wrote. “I recognize that our behavior led to this …”  “It’s alleged that Michel defrauded investors by making false representations of, among other things, giveaways, tokens with staking features, and merchandise collections,” wrote Thomas Fattorusso, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge with the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) Criminal Investigation team.  “Michel can no longer blame the NFT community for his criminal behavior.

Despite the selloff, shorts have continued to pile on and the short position is now 21% of the float. The street seems to think COIN is a going bust, I think U.S. crypto regulations may actually be a tailwind for Coinbase. Fortune favors the brave. That quote is actually from Matt Damon from his widely-despised Crypto.com (CRO) commercial from late 2021. Crypto.com is not Coinbase ( COIN ) but the sentiment still applies. Though at that time it was consumers who were ""brave"" when plowing fiat into Shiba Inu ( SHIB-USD ) and other dog-themed joke coins . Now it's all about Bonk (BONK-USD), the new dog money that everyone seems excited about. We know how the Bonk story will likely end. This time though it's seemingly investors in the very business of crypto who need to be brave as buying COIN today would be buying shares of a company that looks like a sinking ship. With so many obvious scam crypto coins and currencies, the rational question is what kind of regulatory wrath awaits this industry? Regulatory Game Theory Let's start with a simple question; can the U.S. government ban the use of crypto? The answer I have come to for years is probably not in a way that is actually enforceable. Crypto can very easily be criminalized but laws don't ultimately stop people from becoming criminals when they want to break the rules. Look no further than the recent FTX disaster ( FTT-USD ) or any financial fraud throughout history. Companies like Coinbase may ultimately survive crypto winter if it is in the interest of the US federal government that they do. The alternative is all crypto trading activity moves on-chain where, despite the transparent nature of a public ledger, it will likely be harder for the IRS to associate gains directly with Social Security numbers. Ultimately tax revenue is what matters and that is what is likely the real motivation behind the recently proposed Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act. It is interesting that after the failure of a centralized crypto custodian marketed as the ""trusted"" exchange, rather than guidelines for greater proof of reserves transparency from custodians, the push from some in the government has instead been to make it more onerous for self-custody wallets to do business. From CoinDesk : If it becomes law, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act will bring know-your-customer (KYC) rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners KYC rules for wallet providers would essentially make any self-custodial wallet application that doesn't collect personal identification information like physical addresses and driver's license data not compliant with the law. From where I sit, this would mean that self-custody applications like Trust Wallet ( TWT-USD ) would have to start collecting and reporting user data with the federal government. It is highly unlikely that any or most of these applications would be able to do such a thing. Many of them are built with open-source software and are maintained by volunteers. To be clear, I'm not saying the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act is likely to pass or that it should pass. But if it does pass, it's probably good news for centralized exchanges. Since there are numerous regulatory concerns about Binance ( BNB-USD ), I think the biggest beneficiary of more crypto-centric regulation would ultimately be Coinbase. However, predicting what Washington will do is difficult and not the main reason why COIN looks interesting today. Short Squeeze Setup The level of shorting that has taken place in Coinbase has been substantial. According to the last short interest report, COIN has 38.5 million shares short - essentially 17% of the shares outstanding and 21% of the float. Data by YCharts Short sellers have done incredibly well with Coinbase since $400 - it's truly been a remarkable trade. But I have to wonder if the trade has become too one-sided at this point. Looking at the iBorrowDesk data shows a stock that is very expensive to borrow currently with not many shares available left to sell: iBorrowDesk And this has actually been the case for a long time. COIN's shares available to short haven't touched pre-LUNA (LUNC-USD) collapse highs. Not only that, but the borrow rate has been extremely elevated as well. There is serious squeeze potential in this name right now in my view. In my experience, short interest ratios this high are generally for dying retail chains and companies that are clearly going bankrupt. I can't get there on Coinbase because the balance sheet doesn't yet reflect a company knocking on death's door. Balance Sheet and Valuation We have to caveat these metrics because they are the latest numbers we have and they pre-date the FTX collapse. The assets held for customers are likely much lower than they were at the end of Q3 but according to the last filing those were liabilities that were over-collateralized. Q3-22 Cash and ST Investments 5,009.10 Total Current Assets 107,680.00 Total Assets 111,168.40 Total Current liabilities 102,073.10 Long-Term Debt 3,391.20 Total Liabilities 105,542.00 Net Debt -1,324.50 Source: Seeking Alpha, figures in millions of U.S. dollars The company's liquid assets exceed the long-term liabilities with over $5 billion in cash and just $3.4 billion in long-term liabilities. With a current share price now well below $40, Coinbase actually isn't that expensive from a valuation standpoint based on a traditional P/S ratio. At 1.46, COIN is still near its all time low price to sales ratio of 1.41. Price to Sales TTM (Seeking Alpha) This prices COIN well below the sector median price to sales ratio of 2.84 trailing twelve months. On a forward looking basis, the discount isn't quite as steep with COIN trading at a P/S ratio of 2.4 vs a sector median of 2.73. Where COIN is still overvalued is with trailing price to book (1.35) and trailing EV to EBITDA (62.53) - each of which are premiums over sector median with EV/EBITDA being the most egregious multiple premium at 411%. This gets us to risks. Risks There are many. The most obvious one is that cryptocurrency as an idea could simply be out of gas. I don't personally take that view as we've seen these kinds of deep drawdown cycles in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and in the broader crypto market before. But if crypto is indeed dead in the eyes of the masses and adoption has peaked, then Coinbase is almost certainly in serious trouble as a business and will likely fail to ever deliver positive earnings again. That seems to be the most likely outcome according to the Street: COINBASE GLO 21/31 REGS (Business Insider) The market clearly has doubts about Coinbase's ability to pay its debt obligations. The company's corporate bonds are trading at a very large discount to par and currently offer a yield near 17%. This is with common shares that are down 92% from their peak. Like the crypto market broadly speaking, sentiment in Coinbase is awful. Coinbase may have a nice hoard of cash but if the crypto market doesn't turn around in the next 12-24 months, the company could theoretically burn through that cash well before Coinbase has finished paying its debt based on the negative net income figures we've seen in recent quarters. Summary This is a very contrarian trade for me. I'm a proponent of cryptocurrency but my area of focus is more in the native assets and the miners. I am very much in the camp that people should self-custody their assets. As a centralized exchange, Coinbase is not a company that I have a history of going long and it's not something I've advocated purchasing frequently in BlockChain Reaction . However, it is a platform that I use as a consumer and one that I will continue to use when I buy digital assets before taking custody. I believe COIN is priced as if crypto won't recover and I simply don't think that's going to happen. Short of the opinion that crypto is all going to zero, I don't see a great reason to sell Coinbase at these levels. I can't say I love it as a long-term investment, but as a shorter-term trade I believe fortune favors the bulls here with Coinbase. The fundamental thesis could ultimately favor Coinbase bulls as well if the U.S. government succeeds in making self-custody as difficult as possible - which is something that it seems to be attempting based on what is in the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act. AML/KYC regulations of the DeFi space is theoretically a tailwind for Coinbase. How that plays out remains to be seen.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568088-coinbase-fortune-favors-the-brave?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7113513.jpeg

42411272,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMaMo,1672943831,Anyone Who Took Money From FTX Ought to Repay It,"In his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, current FTX CEO Jay J. Ray III laid out the most convincing case that fraud was committed while former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried held the reins at the bankrupt crypto exchange. Evidence strongly suggests FTX user funds were commingled, Ray wrote, in part to fund a lavish “spending binge” by the “FTX Group” beginning in late 2021.  Some $5 billion alone was spent by SBF’s “hedge fund” Alameda Research, with billions more currently unaccounted for as Ray traces outflows from FTX, SBF and various shell companies. Some of that money – used to invest in startups, line politicians’ pockets and pay out personal loans to employees – conceivably came from profits made by the exchange and trading shop.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The rest, presumably, were misappropriated funds from customers and financiers – FTX, since its founding, had raised at least $2 billion (supposedly from some of the sharpest investors around). This is just one leg of the case brought by U.S. investigators against Bankman-Fried on Dec. 13, in addition to charges of money laundering, campaign-finance violations as well as wire and securities-related conspiracies. (He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.)  See also: Who Are Sam Bankman-Fried's Politically-Connected 'Wealthy Co-Conspirators'? | Opinion  To a large extent, these allegations are now concerns for the court to weigh. But there is a separate, extrajudicial question for those bankrolled by Bankman-Fried to decide: whether to proactively return the money they received from the millennial Bernie Madoff. FTX liquidators have said they’ll be pursuing clawbacks in and out of court, though the legal situation is murky if people accepted and spent funds in good faith.  Ethically, however, things could not be more clear: Anyone who took funds from Bankman-Fried should feel compelled to return them. Upward of a million customers were affected by the collapse of FTX. Their money was likely misappropriated to fuel one of the largest financial frauds in history. If “dollars were fungible” in Mr. Bankman-Fried’s universe, then all money that flowed out of his coffers should be considered tainted.  Anyone who took funds from Bankman-Fried should feel compelled to return them  A sham reputation  Bankman-Fried spent big building a sham reputation as a philanthropist and business operator with a keen sense of acumen. It was this persona that helped shield the fraud as it developed. He attempted to buy out the U.S. political apparatus, giving at least $40 million in the last election cycle, and funneled money to media outlets like ProPublica, Fox Media, the Intercept, Vox, upstart publication Semafor and crypto-native company The Block.  While his business was a fraud, the money SBF spent was real. The self-professed “Effective Altruist” looked to maximize the impact of a dollar given away – often to good causes. Political pundit Matthew Yglesias said the FTX Future Fund was perhaps the largest philanthropic entity while it operated – giving millions to causes as diverse as animal welfare, climate research and pandemic prevention. But how good could a charity be if financed by fraud?  In a forum post for the Effective Altruist community, Molly Kovite, manager of legal operations at Open Philanthropy, suggested that Future Fund recipients not spend the money if it could be avoided, putting aside the moral argument, because it’s likely FTX’s liquidators will likely ask for the money back. Is anyone else depressed that the conversation is about sequestering funds rather than returning them?  See also: US DoJ Is Seizing Banking Assets, Robinhood Shares Linked to FTX, Court Told  A number of SBF’s recipients have already returned their funds, or pledged to. That is a sound strategic move for politicians and paid influencers looking to mitigate the reputational damage in being associated with a criminal enterprise – even if those criticisms aren’t always justified. Most recently, Semafor announced it would “redeem” the cash it received from SBF as part of its $25 million seed round – which may clear the air of accusations of bias.  Untangling funds  No doubt it can be challenging for companies – especially in the notoriously cash-strapped media industry – to untangle their financial relationships. But it seems like a necessary step; FTX’s ability to pay its debts and make customers whole depends on it.  This is of course complicated by the fact that much of the capital has already been spent – like at Vox’s Future Perfect project, a recipient of funds from Sam and his brother Gabriel’s nonprofit Building a Stronger Future. Unlike, say, The Block’s former CEO Mike McCaffrey, who was essentially bribed with “loans” to fund the outfit and buy real estate, Vox cannot just liquidate an ill-gotten Bahamian apartment. Future Perfect’s reporting was paid for and published (and a lot of it is great). The project is on pause, but perhaps Vox can redirect a portion of advertising dollars to the bankruptcy estate.  If that sounds naive, know that it’s only because I’m arguing for a very simple solution to what is apparently a very complicated process. Semafor, for instance, claimed not to know who to give the funds back to – it sure didn’t want to reimburse SBF himself. There are more than 100 entities tied up in the FTX bankruptcy process, many spun up with the apparent purpose of funneling money around, which is made all the worse by FTX’s criminally shoddy record-keeping. But when an apparent injustice falls, the right thing to do is to do what you can.  See also: The Faulty Moral Universe of Sam Bankman-Fried | Opinion  Again, I should note the legal situation around clawbacks is at best murky. John J. Ray may have authority to request or roll back funds that were transferred out of the company in the days and months before the bankruptcy occurred – including $5 billion in withdrawals during the so-called “run” on FTX. Ray may also be able to argue that just about every political and charitable donation SBF made is what’s called a “fraudulent transfer,” within a window of two to four years under various bankruptcy laws.  But, really, the question isn’t whether the FTX bankruptcy estate can or should take back the funds.

42388260,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRBijL,1672943248,Declining Demand for Binance's BUSD Represents New Chapter in Stablecoin Wars,"Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, made a big push last year to promote its own stablecoin, BUSD, over those of rivals.  But recent speculation over the exchange’s health appear to have undermined the progress, following $5.5 billion on net redemptions from BUSD in a month. The decline in demand for the stablecoin coincided with other data in December showing outflows of cryptocurrency deposits on the exchange.  The market capitalization of BUSD – the number of stablecoins outstanding times its price, theoretically $1 – fell to an 11-month low of $16.4 billion on Tuesday from $22.1 billion at the start of December, according to data by CoinGecko. BUSD remained the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization.  BUSD is issued by the New York-based fintech firm Paxos Trust Co. under the Binance brand, anchored to the $1 price primarily by assurances that it’s backed by cash and U.S. Treasury bills in reserves. As is the case with rival stablecoins including Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, its purpose is to convert traditional fiat money to crypto assets and facilitate trading.  When BUSD or stablecoin holders redeem their tokens, the number of tokens in circulation decreases while the price ostensibly stays anchored to the peg.  The recent decline in the amount of BUSD outstanding wiped out the gains that came after Binance’s move in September to ditch several rival stablecoins and automatically convert deposits into BUSD; Binance officials described the move as an attempt to consolidate trading pairs on its exchange platform. The move was seen by some crypto analysts and industry observers as promoting BUSD as a challenger to USDT and USDC, the two largest stablecoins by market value.  The effort helped push BUSD's market capitalization to as high as $23 billion in November from $18 billion in August before the auto-conversion went into effect.  But then, last month, Binance endured a wave of user withdrawals after a widely criticized report on its crypto reserves by auditing firm Mazars rocked confidence in the exchange’s stability – especially because the industry was still on tenterhooks following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November. Subsequently, Mazars paused all work with crypto clients on proof-of-reserves assessments.  “Binance’s auto-conversion was a double-edged sword,” Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21Shares, an issuer of crypto investment products, said.  As Binance users withdrew stablecoins from the exchange, they did that in the form of USDC and USDT, and so Binance had to redeem BUSD to Paxos and prop up reserves of rival stablecoins to satisfy withdrawals, Wan explained.  Read more: Binance Failing to Get US Exchange Listings for BNB Is Yellow Flag for Crypto Analysts  Stablecoin war  Top rivals picked up market share amid BUSD’s recent $6 billion setback. The total market value of USDT jumped by about $800 million to $66.3 billion, while USDC’s grew by $1 billion to $65.5 billion, according to CoinGecko data.  Over the course of the full 2022, BUSD still managed to notch market-share gains versus the once-dominant USDT.  CoinGecko data shows that BUSD’s market cap climbed by 20% during the year, with USDC gaining 4%, while the USDT value fell by 15%. MakerDAO’s DAI dropped by 43% in the outstanding value and the FRAX stablecoin declined by 44%. Of course, the saga surrounding Terra’s UST was the most notable collapse.  “The stablecoin war seems to have just started between BUSD, USDT and USDC on centralized exchanges,” Wan said. “The metric to keep an eye on will be organic demand from people in need for USD given their currency debasement like in Lebanon, Venezuela.”  Conor Ryder, an analyst with the digital-asset research firm Kaiko, wrote in a report this week that growing adoption of stablecoins in developing countries prone to currency depreciation could be “crypto’s killer use case.”  “Stablecoins look to be crypto's best example of product market fit and they're genuinely improving a vast amount of lives in these countries,” he wrote.  While the once-$3 trillion cryptocurrency market’s overall value has plummeted to $840 billion, the stablecoin market has held up relatively well, contracting to $138 billion from a $188 billion high in 2022 – suggesting that fiat-pegged stablecoins are seen as a haven for many crypto traders during a bear market.  CORRECTION (Jan. 6, 17:58): Mazars said in a statement that it only suspended working on proof-of-reserves assessments and did not cut all ties with crypto firms, contrary to earlier news reports based on Binance's statement. Mazars's proof-of-reserves reports about Binance and other exchanges were moved from the auditing firm's website to another website and they are accessible here.",NEGATIVE,USDT | BNB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/05/declining-demand-for-binances-busd-represents-new-chapter-in-stablecoin-wars,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93b20d5c05002ca1f4d5a4b1dba042521aef419d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sometimes, the price action of crypto assets is the main attractive aspect for traders and Investors as they reap massively when there is high volatility. Related Reading: Solana Leads Crypto Market Gains, How Long Will This Continue? However, Cardano’s token is gradually staging a rebound this January. ADA has impressively reclaimed about a third of its lost value at the beginning of this year. At the time of writing, ADA is trading around $0.2687, indicating an increase over the past 24 hours. ADA price is spiking after a significant plunge the previous year. Currently, ADA boasts a market cap of about $9.123 billion and a market dominance of about 1.11%. Also, as per CoinMarketcap ranking, ADA is now rated in the 9th position of top crypto assets in capitalization. If ADA continues to stay in recovery mode and jumps above the $0.30 mark, it might replace Dogecoin taking the eighth top spot by market capitalization. Investors that bought ADA at the support level of $0.24 are minting profits, adding more pressure on the resistance at $0.27. Cardano Witnesses Whale Accumulation Cardano is witnessing more whale accumulation of its native token, ADA. Data from WhaleStats shows that huge holders of BNB tokens are now massively purchasing ADA. This trend places ADA at the top of the list of actively purchased tokens from the beginning of 2023. ADA has recorded about $250 million in its past 24-hour trading volume. This signifies about an 81.95% surge in its trading volume. The current report of the top BNB whales addresses shows that they hold a total of 19.9 million ADA tokens. This is worth about $5.19 million at the current crypto market prices. Price Sustainability For Cardano There are still doubts about the sustainability of the new Cardano bullish movement. Recall that these whales moved ADA tokens massively from their holdings last December. This brought a drop from 211,854 to 907 tokens in the ADA position size. Also, it created a price drop for Cardano as of December 2022 as ADA dipped without a correlation to the market trend.

42388257,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRBiVJ,1672942136,"MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital Shares Fall Amid Crypto Bank Silvergate's Woes","The stocks of business software company MicroStrategy (MSTR) and bitcoin miner Marathon Digital (MARA) both fell close to 5% on Thursday after their lender Silvergate Capital's (SI) shares plunged more than 40% amid large-scale layoffs and a nearly $200 million write-off related to acquisition of Facebook's former stablecoin project Diem.  The San-Diego-based crypto bank was a lender to both MicroStrategy and Marathon. Last March, entrepreneur Michael Saylor's software company said its subsidiary received a $205 million bitcoin-backed term loan from Silvergate. The loan had about a 6.20% annual interest rate as of Sept. 30 and is due on March 2025, according to a recent investor presentation.  There were questions last year of whether MicroStrategy would get a margin call on those loans when the price of bitcoin (BTC) slumped to $21,000. Saylor, however, was quick to dismiss the concerns, saying that the ""margin load is well managed.""  Saylor resigned as MicroStrategy's CEO in August, and now serves as its executive chairman.  Read more: Revisiting MicroStrategy's Pain Points as Bitcoin Tumbles  Meanwhile, Marathon – which had borrowed roughly $100 million from Silvergate via a term loan and a revolving line of credit – said on Thursday it had paid off another $30 million of that revolver in December, wiping out the balance (the amount still outstanding under the term loan wasn't disclosed). The move freed up 3,615 bitcoins that had been pledged as collateral.  MicroStrategy's shares were down 4.6%, and Marathon's shares lower by 4.9% on Thursday, while the price of bitcoin was essentially flat on the day at $16,800.  Outside of the lending activities, Silvergate also has highflying crypto firms as corporate banking customers through its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) leverage program, which issues U.S. dollar loans using bitcoin as collateral. The now-defunct FTX, stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto trading platforms Coinbase (COIN), Paxos, Crypto.com and Kraken were all SEN clients, according to a recent investor presentation.  Such ties have raised questions on crypto Twitter about possible knock-on effects for the industry if Silvergate were to go under.  The SEN has facilitated over $1 trillion in payments since its inception in 2017 and has over $1 billion in commitments, according to the investor presentation.  Coinbase's shares fell almost 10% on Thursday, partly due to a downgrade from Wall Street investment bank Cowen, which cited the lack of clarity on trading volume recovery following FTX's collapse.  Silvergate was deeply involved with FTX before its implosion. In December, the crypto bank issued a statement saying it was the “victim of FTX’s and Alameda Research’s apparent misuse of customer assets and other lapses of judgment.” Deposits by FTX made up nearly 10% of Silvergate’s $11.9 billion in deposits from digital-asset customers, the bank disclosed in November.  The bank also said on Thursday that it experienced an outflow of $8.1 billion in digital-asset deposits during the fourth quarter amid FTX's demise. To counter the outflows, Silvergate sold $5.2 billion of debt securities, incurring a loss of $718 million.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/05/microstrategy-marathon-digital-shares-fall-amidst-crypto-bank-silvergates-woes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0f052d562f2fca50eb84c979f97dda49f811b9a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ruling was said to impact ~600,000 accounts with assets valued at $4.2B when Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022. Of note, the firm does not have adequate funds to repay those deposits in full. In other words, customers who held non-interest bearing accounts as well as other secured creditors will be of higher priority than the majority of customers that held interest-bearing accounts. The ruling means that the latter group will be treated as unsecured creditors and will be last in line to get their deposits back. Still, Glenn noted that Earn users will not get ""nothing"" in Celsius' bankruptcy. In determining who owned the assets deposited in Celsius's interest-bearing Earn products, Glenn called the terms of use ""unambiguous,"" said Bradley Duke, co-CEO at ETC Group. ""This really drives the point home that before making an investment, it really is worth reading the fine print and thinking about what it would mean in a scenario of extreme stress.""

The lender on the revolver was Silvergate Capital (SI), which earlier on Thursday announced it saw digital-asset deposit withdrawals during the fourth quarter of $8.1 billion as it continues to reel from the fallout of crypto exchange FTX's collapse. Silvergate shares were recently down 46%.  Marathon's move is the latest in a series of similar actions from bitcoin miners to reduce their debt obligations through payments or restructurings as the bear market continues to take a toll on the industry.  The company's unrestricted bitcoin holdings are now 7,815 (about $130 million), and total bitcoin holdings – after production of 475 bitcoins in December – are up to 12,232. Unrestricted bitcoin holdings on Nov. 9 (prior to the FTX collapse) had been just 1,950. Marathon has repeatedly hinted at its intentions to sell some of its mined bitcoin, but hasn't done so yet. Its shares were recently down 4.1%.  As of Sunday, the company had an operating mining fleet of 69,000 rigs with 7 exahash/second (EH/s) in computing power. Marathon continues to expect to have installed computing power of 23 EH/s sometime around the middle of 2023.  As for Silvergate, the crypto lender had ties to crypto exchange FTX, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 11. To counter the deposit outflows in the fourth quarter, the bank said it has sold $5.2 billion of debt securities, resulting in a $718 million loss.  Silvergate had previously lent funds to Marathon through two different debt instruments. One is the revolving credit facility, which Marathon reduced from $30 million on Nov. 30 to zero by year end and which was initially signed in October 2021. The other is a term loan agreed to last August.  Marathon didn't respond to a request for comment about how much of the term loan was outstanding at the end of 2022.  Marathon spokesman Charlie Schumacher told CoinDesk in November the company had drawn about $100 million roughly equally from both debt instruments, meaning $50 million could still be outstanding with Silvergate.  Marathon's plan initially, Schumacher said, was to draw on the term loan to pay down the credit line, but FTX's collapse and resulting market uncertainty forced a rethink, with the company instead deciding it was a better idea to deleverage its balance sheet.

""We have sought a mutual agreement with Nexo to terminate the existing exclusivity arrangements, and we are continuing our active engagement with the shortlisted fund managers in developing a viable strategy that would best serve the creditors’ interests,"" Vauld said in a statement Thursday.  The two firms started talks in July after Vauld suspended all withdrawals, trading and deposits on its platform and filed for creditor protection in Singapore. It has until Jan. 20 to work on a restructuring plan. The talks looked to be over at the end of last year, when Vauld said the acquisition had been canceled. Nexo, however, responded that it wasn't calling off the deal and took the step of writing an open letter to Vauld's creditors.  Nexo, which is also a crypto lender, said it still wants to proceed with the acquisition.  ""Mid-next week, Nexo will host a live AMA (ask-me-anything) session to address all outstanding questions about our proposal, and we are adamant about the fact that this is the offer that creates most value for Vauld’s customers,"" a Nexo spokesperson said in an email. ""We will also be putting out another open letter on the topic to ensure transparency.""  As of July 8 last year, Vauld owed $402 million to its creditors, 90% of which originated from individual retail investor deposits. A month after it filed for creditor protection, Indian authorities froze assets worth 3.7 billion rupees ($46.4 million).

7105976,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514945,1672934427,Quant Explains How Bitcoin MVRV MACD Can Signal Price Trends,"A quant has broken down how the Bitcoin MVRV MACD oscillator could be used to check for signals in the price. Bitcoin MVRV MACD Oscillator As Price indicator As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, this metric can help detect both the lows and the highs in the price, as well as the greater trends. The “Bitcoin MVRV” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap and the realized cap. Here, the “realized cap” is a capitalization model for BTC that values each coin in circulation at the price at which it was last moved, rather than taking the same current BTC price as the value of all the coins, as the normal market cap does. Since the realized cap is sort of a “true” value model for the coin, its comparison with the market cap (in the MVRV) can tell us whether the coin is undervalued or overvalued at the moment. When the MVRV is greater than 1, it means BTC is overpriced right now, while having values below the threshold suggests it’s underpriced. Now, to use MVRV as a trading tool, the quant has taken the MACD oscillator of the indicator. A MACD oscillator is just the difference between the short-term and long-term exponential moving averages (EMA) of the metric in question. Here, these EMAs are the 50-day and the 100-day versions. Related Reading: Ethereum Surges 4% As Whales Show Elevated Activity The below chart shows how the Bitcoin MVRV MACD can be used for finding tops and bottoms in the price: The metric seems to have approached a value of 0 recently | Source: CryptoQuant According to the quant, whenever the MVRV MACD has been higher than 0.3, it has been a signal that BTC is overbought currently. On the other hand, values less than -0.3 have signaled underbought conditions. From the chart, it’s apparent that while these signals haven’t coincided with the cycle tops and bottoms, they have still correctly indicated some local tops and bottoms. Related Reading: Research Firm Issues Warning For Bitcoin And ETH Investors Over DCG Situation Now, here is another graph where the analyst has highlighted how divergences between the price and the MVRV MACD can signal future trends: Various divergences between BTC and the MVRV MACD | Source: CryptoQuant “A divergence occurs when the direction of a technical indicator and the direction of the price trend are moving in opposite directions,” explains the analyst. In the graph, it’s visible that whenever the MVRV MACD has moved up inside the negative region while the price consolidates sideways or declines, a bullish divergence has formed for Bitcoin. Similarly, a bearish divergence has taken shape when the value of the crypto has been rising, but the indicator has been going down in the zone above zero. At present, none of these signals have formed in the current bear market so far. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $16,800, up 1% in the last week.

42413233,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8B74,1672933986,Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research Joins Chorus Objecting to Binance Voyager Buy,"Alameda Research, FTX’s defunct trading arm that was controlled by Sam Bankman-Fried, has joined the list of protesters against a plan by rival exchange Binance's U.S. affiliate to buy the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital, according to legal filings posted Wednesday with a New York bankruptcy court.  The transaction has already been opposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which demanded more information on how Binance.US could afford the $1 billion deal, and by state securities and banking regulators from Texas, New Jersey, Vermont and New York.  The U.S. Trustee, an office within the Department of Justice, also objected, writing, ""Given [Voyager's] recent unpleasant experience with FTX US, the court should not countenance their attempt to rush headlong into another asset purchase agreement without sufficient evidence of due diligence and without affording parties-in-interest a full and fair opportunity for due deliberation.""  The Binance,US plan, which was announced in December, “unfairly discriminates against” Alameda’s claims and breaches provisions of the U.S. bankruptcy code that says no junior creditors can be repaid until higher-priority claims have been settled in full, said the legal filing, calling for the Southern District of New York court to deny approval.  The filing, made by Andrew G. Dietderich of Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm representing the FTX group, said that Alameda is a “substantial shareholder” of Voyager. Under a rescue plan made in June, Alameda offered the collapsing Voyager $200 million and 15,000 bitcoins (BTC), of which $75 million in stablecoins still outstanding as of the date of bankruptcy, the filing said.  FTX and Alameda declared bankruptcy on Nov. 11 after revelations published in CoinDesk concerning the relationship between the two supposedly separate companies. Bankman-Fried, FTX's former CEO, has been charged with multiple crimes, including money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, to which he has pleaded not guilty.  A hearing on the Voyager issue will be held next Monday, the filing said.

Attorney General Letitia James said the state intends to ban Mashinsky from doing business there, in addition to seeking damages and restitution for harmed investors, according to a Thursday statement.  “As the former CEO of Celsius, Alex Mashinsky promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin,” James said in the statement.  The lawsuit accuses the ex-CEO of the cryptocurrency lender of making many false claims about the number of Celsius users, its strategies to recruit investors and the nature of what it was investing in, claiming its money went to safe, low-risk investments with reliable businesses. The suit also accused him of incorrectly asserting that Celsius had been safer than a bank, though it operated without the typical regulatory safeguards that go with banking in the U.S.  Mashinsky didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a lawyer representing Celsius.  Celsius froze customer withdrawals in June, citing ""extreme market conditions,"" before filing for bankruptcy in July during a stretch of 2022 crypto failures that rocked the industry. Mashinsky, who resigned as CEO in September, reportedly withdrew $10 million from Celsius weeks before the company halted withdrawals.

The crypto market has seen a weak price action in 2023, but BTC has been notably more fragile than other digital assets.

Bitcoin Investors Hedge Their Positions? As price stalls in the Bitcoin spot market, the derivatives sector might provide more clues about price expectations. According to a recent report from crypto exchange Deribit, expectations of a spike in Volatility due to the New Year decreased. The report claims that market participants have been “hesitant” to jump into the current price action due to ambiguity around macroeconomic conditions. In addition, the crisis between Gemini and the Digital Currency Group (DCG) has added fuel to this sentiment. The DCG owns crypto lender Genesis, which owes Gemini Earn customers billions of dollars. If the first of these companies decides to liquidate one of their products to pay off their debt, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will likely trend to the downside. Deribit noted: The Option market is dismissing material directional reaction to the Gemini-DCG deadline, and the relatively flat Skew across Terms is not signaling strong bias. Implied Volatility, a measure of the market’s expectation around price movement, has declined. The option sector has been selling off under the current environment; the report notes some buying action around put (bearish) contracts for February and March. These contracts could be part of a hedging strategy from prominent players with Bitcoin spot positions. If the situation around DCG and Gemini resolves favorably, the market will likely trend higher.

The percentage of stables held by the smart money dropped to 27% after peaking in early December. The Fed became more dovish and began to consider a rate hike downshift. The market is entering a long bottoming stage. Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Bing Ventures as a new contributor.

Click here to find out more » In the past month, major events in the blockchain industry were still affected by the aftermath of the FTX fiasco. Several market makers and exchanges, such as Genesis and BlockFi, began to suffer runs. The panic in the markets was so intense that investors began to worry that Digital Currency Group might be headed for bankruptcy as well. Meanwhile, liquidity for altcoins has nearly dried up. But contrary to the sentiment indicators, price action across the market has not sunk further. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fell less than 3% before bottoming out. Combined with more indicators and the broader environment, we can say that the market has entered a long grinding stage. A narrow miner capitulation zone If Bitcoin's historical cycles are any guide, the shutdown price of the mainstream mining machine can serve as a bottoming indicator. According to F2pool, with bitcoin falling to $16,000, most mining machines with a unit power of more than 40 watts per terahash - including the popular Antminer S17 series, Hornbill H8 Pro, and Hummer H9 Pro - have reached shutdown prices based on $0.06/kWh electricity cost and the current mining difficulty. Since $16,000 is roughly the shutdown price for mainstream mining machines, support at this level should be strong - even stronger than the psychologically important $20,000 level. Reflecting the shutdown of miners, the Bitcoin mining difficulty fell by a great margin on Dec. 6, which surpassed the 5.01% cut on July 21, making it the biggest drop in 2022. F2pool In terms of technical indicators, the Bitcoin Hash Ribbon has formed a death cross with the hash rate 30MA falling below the 60MA, meaning that the market is entering a period of miner capitulation. It will be a buy signal when the market comes out of the miner capitulation. So far, with a majority of miners reaching their shutdown price, we believe Bitcoin is stabilizing at a more reasonable valuation. lookintobitcoin.com As small and medium-sized bitcoin miners are eliminated, the remaining strong miners are more likely to avoid selling in low-price areas, reducing the pressure to sell. That could stop the price of Bitcoin from falling. And as miners choose to hold on to Bitcoins rather than sell them at a loss, the dynamics of supply and demand in the market could shift, increasing the chances of a recovery. Who is the smart money? The smart money's allocation to stablecoin peaked at 38% on Nov. 9 before going into a sustained decline. Stablecoins now account for 27% of the smart money's wallet balances. Just as stablecoin holders choose to sell off Tether, crypto holders would sell crypto into stablecoins when the future value of crypto assets is under question. Investing in stablecoins helps crypto holders reduce risk while limiting potential portfolio shrinkage. What's more, by keeping money on-chain, whales can easily reallocate capital as they adapt to the evolving market conditions. At present, stables appear to be in the ""oversold"" zone. Coin Metrics When stablecoins' percentage in the total market cap drops, investors will be more inclined to invest in Bitcoin than in stablecoins. This could lead to increased demand for Bitcoin. Variables in the macro environment At present, the internal fragility and macro environment of the crypto market have become the main influencing forces. These two forces alternate over time. As the internal problems of the crypto market continue to burst out, the influence of the recovering macro environment on the crypto market becomes more and more obvious. The minutes of the Fed's November meeting showed that members agreed there was little sign that inflation was easing. A purposeful shift to a more restrictive monetary policy would be consistent with risk management considerations. Bringing inflation down to 2% remains the Fed's long-term goal, and that hawkish stance has not wavered. ING, Federal Reserve But, unlike the September meeting, the November meeting turned dovish: A majority of Fed members thought it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes in the near future. Some members even argued that continued rapid monetary tightening would increase financial market instability. Members also discussed the impact on U.S. financial markets of the collapse in UK government bonds and the pension boom. Combined with the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's recent proposal to buy back U.S. Treasury bonds, it can be seen that the deterioration of U.S. Treasury liquidity has become a major risk point of concern. Expectations for the new year The Federal Reserve announced a 0.50 percentage point interest rate hike, in line with market expectations, on Dec. 14. Meanwhile, it lowered its growth targets and bumped its unemployment rate outlook for 2023. Also, the Fed chair noted that the pace of rate hikes remains less important than the destination of the federal funds rate, and the Fed will continue to be focused on curbing stubbornly high inflation and supporting growth. As the rate approaches the expected terminal rate based on the FOMC's dot plot, it is highly probable that the Fed will be finished with rate hikes in the first half of 2023. Although both the monetary policy and the economic growth are likely to come to a turning point next year, the recent rally in U.S. stocks indicates that the market has not yet fully reflected the drag from the tightened policy. Under the backdrop of fast-paced rate hiking by the Fed and the ECB, the risks for financial market turmoil caused by the liquidity crunch cannot be ruled out. What's more, this round of massive rate hikes at unprecedented levels could trigger a hard landing of the U.S. economy, leading to an inevitable economic recession. That's what investors worry about the most. Before this round of rate hikes, the debt level held by U.S. companies had already reached record highs. And the rate hikes significantly increase U.S. companies' debt burdens, which means a debt crisis is possible if things continue. Bloomberg Also, the Fed's policy of raising interest rates next year could be influenced by the legal limit on federal debt. If the Treasury cannot borrow as usual, then the Fed will be under pressure to lower its cash balance and might have to reverse its policy of raising interest rates. In addition, with Congress unlikely to raise the debt ceiling in this year's lame-duck session and with it not expected to address the debt ceiling next year, there will be greater uncertainty about the Fed's policy of raising interest rates in 2023. In a low-liquidity environment, a Fed rate hike next year could lead to increased volatility and a potential sell-off in Treasury maturities near the debt ceiling deadline. In all, we predict that the U.S. economy will probably enter a recession in the first half of next year. Historically, when the U.S. economy recedes, the Fed lowers the interest rate within no more than two months. This was true even in the period from 1970-80 when inflation was at extremely high levels. Inflation in the U.S. is moving downward now, caused by falling energy prices, easing consumer demand, recovery of the global supply chains, etc. It might fall below 4% before June of next year. Therefore, we believe the Fed will only hike another 50 bps in 2023, with 25bps each in February and March, before stopping and turning toward rate cuts from the mid-year. In conclusion, the 50bps rate hike in December was reassuring. We believe the macro environment is showing signs of turning around, which bodes well for the bottoming of Bitcoin. We believe the crypto market is entering a bottoming stage, and traders could consider buying the dip if more convincing buy signals appear.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568018-crypto-market-shows-signs-of-bottoming?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7103369.jpeg

The BTC miner wrapped up last year on a relatively strong note, though, having produced 4,144 BTC in 2022 compared with 3,197 in 2021. It also managed to double its hash rate to 7.0 exahashes per second Y/Y in 2022, said CEO and Chairman Fred Thiel, with most of that mining capacity now located at the King Mountain wind farm in West Texas. As of January 1, its operating mining fleet consisted of ~69K active miners.

Ethereum Whale Transactions At Highest Level Since December 16th As per data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, whales have made 611 transactions in the past day. The relevant indicator here is the “whale transaction count,” which measures the total number of Ethereum transfers taking place on the chain that is worth more than $100,000. When the value of this metric is high, it means whales are making a large number of transactions right now. Since whale transactions involve the movement of a significant number of coins, enough of them taking place close together can cause visible effects on the price of the crypto. Thus, periods with high values of the metric can be quite volatile. On the other hand, low values suggest whales aren’t that active at the moment, which can lead to the price not observing any significant action. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum whale transaction count over the past month: The value of the metric seems to have been relatively high in recent days | Source: Santiment As the above graph displays, the Ethereum whale transaction count has observed a surge in the past day. During this period of elevated activity, whales have made 611 transactions so far, which is the highest level since December 16, when the price of the crypto saw a sharp downward move and created a local bottom of around $1,160. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Inflows Spike, Is This Bearish For BTC? This spike on the December 16 bottom was higher in magnitude than the current one and was a sign that a large number of whales were buying up the crypto at those low prices. The latest spike, on the other hand, has occurred while the ETH price has been climbing up, as is apparent from the chart. One possibility is that this could imply whales are optimistic about this latest buildup and are thus buying more while they still can. Such backing from these humongous holders could sustain the rally further, and take Ethereum to higher levels. Related Reading: Brace For Impact?

With 82% of its trailing 12-month net revenue coming from transaction fees it charges retail users, Coinbase's ( COIN ) business hinges on crypto asset prices, trading volumes, and volatility, he said. ""COIN’s monthly trading volumes have seen a fairly consistent drawdown each subsequent month since November 2021, and there remains low visibility into either a stabilization or rebound in retail trading volumes over 2023 given the macro backdrop and FTX contagion risks on crypto asset prices,"" Glagola wrote in a note to clients. December total trading volume of $35B was 25% lower than October's $47B, he pointed out. In addition, the risk of SEC enforcement action has increased after the FTX collapse. ""We think there is a risk to a material portion of COIN's non-BTC/ETH trading volumes (36%) and assets under custody (31%) that could be deemed securities by regulators, exacerbating trading volume deterioration,"" he said. The analyst also expects Coinbase ( COIN ) to start another round of job cuts in early 2023, potentially amounting up to 40%, to align its cost structure with lower trading activity.

42421416,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXo3eX,1672926300,The Fool's Game of Annual Crypto Price Predictions,"The price volatility of cryptocurrencies has been an issue investors have had to contend with over the past 14 months, and it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon. That means clients active in or curious about cryptocurrencies have likely already encountered the wild world of annual cryptocurrency predictions.  Perhaps no headline better encapsulates the unpredictability of token prices than this one from CNBC on Monday: “The boldest bitcoin calls for 2023 are out – and a 1,400% rally or a 70% plunge may be on the cards.”  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  The most optimistic call, $250,000 by year-end 2023, was made by digital venture capitalist Tim Draper, according to the report, while the most pessimistic call, $5,000, was made by Standard Chartered. In rough estimates, that’s the difference between bitcoin having a $4.75 trillion or a $95 billion market capitalization.  Predictions for last year’s price performance did little better, with many skeptics guessing that bitcoin prices would plunge below $10,000, while optimists like Draper and Morgan Creek founder Anthony Pompliano guessed that they would breach the $250,000 mark in 2022. By comparison, Ark Investment’s Cathie Wood sounded relatively reasonable predicting that bitcoin would breach the $100,000 mark last year.  Of course, none of that happened. Prices steadily legged downward as central banks continued monetary tightening and a series of bad headlines dented investor sentiment, but they never reached the depths predicted by the most dire bears.  Read more: Peter Brandt: BTC Will Hit All-Time Highs in 3 Years – but First, $13K  Why prices are so difficult to predict  As we’ve written about before, cryptocurrencies operate on different fundamentals from traditional investments, and investor sentiment plays a much larger role in determining prices. Human sentiment is notoriously unpredictable and can be significantly impacted by unforeseen events.  This is true across asset classes, not just in crypto. Which is why analysts generally suck at making one-year stock market predictions, too. In late 2021, when Wall Street was making its 2022 stock index forecasts, every major analyst was predicting at least a modest rise in the S&P 500 for the year. Obviously, it just wasn’t to be.  Read more: FTX and Crypto Bust Show Capitalism’s Limits  That’s part of the reason long-term investment prognostication is rarely taken seriously. Excessively pessimistic and optimistic calls – like 1,400% increases in value or 70% declines – make for good headlines, but rarely ever turn out to be right.  Why crypto is so much more uncertain  I think investors are waiting for clarity. Cryptocurrencies are still viewed as speculative investments by most investors interested in the asset class. When central banks tighten the spigot on easy money, one of the first places investors pull back is in speculative assets – they run for safety.  There are also a lot of what former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld would call “known unknowns” around crypto right now. These range from the simple existential questions – like “will this token collapse in 2023?” and “will I be able to access liquidity” – to questions around regulation, access and custody that policymakers still need to answer.  We can add to the known unknowns all of the issues facing all financial markets right now: inflation, rising interest rates and potentially a recession in the coming year.  Then there are the myriad “unknown unknowns,” in Rumsfeld’s parlance. These are the black swan-like problems that we can’t see coming, like the collapse of FTX. We can’t know if and when another decentralized finance project or stablecoin fails or another digital exchange falls apart in 2023. Given the still-young and wild state of the digital assets space, I think it’s fair to guess that there will be more bumps in the road moving forward.  What advisors can say  I am not an advisor, nor am I a financial analyst. But as a journalist covering the space I get questions from friends and family members all the time: What will the stock market do? What is happening with the economy? What is going to happen with crypto?  My go-to answer about the markets and asset prices is that they will fluctuate. Not only does this reflect how I feel about the volatility of risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrency, but it gives a reasonable prediction for what will happen over the next 12 months. Will prices end up higher or lower? I don’t think anyone is able to guess that accurately.  However, the more important answers that advisors can give their clients revolve around this: why cryptocurrencies are being invested in and what they are being used for in the context of an overall investment strategy or portfolio. Advisors using cryptocurrencies as part of a coherent investment strategy are thinking about these assets in terms longer than a mere 12 months.  Read more: 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023  Similarly, if cryptocurrencies are being used as part of a long-term wealth strategy, annual performance should not be the focus. Rather, the end-client and advisor need to ask themselves what they think bitcoin or ether or any other altcoin they are considering will look like at the time liquidity is needed.  Will these tokens survive to, or through, a financial horizon such as retirement? Will there be opportunities to liquidate or add to positions? These are the important questions.

7099800,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514900,1672925403,Research Firm Issues Warning For Bitcoin And ETH Investors Over DCG Situation,"Renowned crypto firm Arcane Research has issued a warning to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investors in light of the escalating events surrounding Digital Currency Group (DCG), Genesis, and Grayscale. In an article by analyst Vetle Lunde, the firm warns: Investors should pay attention to the ongoing financial distress related to Digital Currency Group (DCG) as the outcome could severely impact crypto markets. In the reasoning behind the warning, Arcane Research states that if DCG goes bankrupt, it could be forced to liquidate its assets. “This could force DCG into selling its sizable positions in GBTC and unknown positions in ETHE and other Grayscale trusts,” Lunde said. Further, the analyst argues that a “natural, less liquidity-constrained” solution could be a Reg M solution that allows holders of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH), and the other trusts to redeem shares at net asset value. This would resolve the near-record NAV – the value by which the fund trades below the Bitcoin spot price. GBTC was trading at -45.35% yesterday, while ETH was at a NAV of -55.83%. Dissolution of the trust via Reg M would trigger tangible impacts on crypto markets, as GBTC comprises about 3.3% of the circulating BTC supply and 2.5% of the ETH supply. Related Reading: These Altcoins Will Be Hit The Hardest If DCG And Grayscale Fall Arcane describes the threat to the market in the massive arbitrage opportunities: A Reg M would cause a massive arbitrage strategy of selling crypto spot versus buying Grayscale Trust shares. If this scenario plays out, crypto markets could face further downside. In the long run, however, Arcane Research calls this scenario a positive event, as the crypto market is “finally relieved of the huge burden” caused by the “Grayscale widowmaker trade.” According to Lunde, this could even be the potential final market bottom event. Bitcoin Facing Final Intrinsic Shock? As NewsBTC BTC reported, the pressure on DCG is growing day by day. Earlier this week, Gemini founder Cameron Winklevoss published an open letter claiming that Barry Silbert’s DCG was using stalling tactics in bad faith. Winklevoss gave Silbert a deadline of January 8 to return the $900 million in Gemini Earn client funds. Related Reading: Billion-Dollar Hedge Fund Is Betting Against Bitcoin And Grayscale, Not Just USDT If Silbert does not comply, this could culminate in the coordination of a voluntary DCG Chapter 11 filing, according to Arcane Research. In addition, Valkyrie Investments and $3.5 billion asset manager Fir Tree also took the stage. Valkyrie made an offer to become the new sponsor and manager of GBTC while announcing the launch of an opportunistic fund to take advantage of GBTC discounts. Fir Tree has filed a lawsuit, presumably in a tactical move to hurt DCG’s valuation and reduce the likelihood of investment by third parties. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $16,817, still lacking volatility.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn said in a court order Wednesday that Celsius' terms of service made it clear it took possession of crypto assets deposited into its Earn product, dealing a blow to customers who were hoping to recoup their deposits. Celsius held around $4.2 billion in cryptocurrencies in Earn as of last July, including $23 million in stablecoins.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a limited objection to Binance.US' proposed $1.02 billion purchase of the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital.In its filing, the SEC questioned the adequacy of the information in Binance.US’ disclosure statement, specifically details on the ability of the crypto exchange to “consummate a transaction of this magnitude,” as well as how Binance.US intends to secure customer assets and details on how Binance.US would rebalance its cryptocurrency portfolio.  Coinbase will pay a $50 million fine to the New York State Department of Financial Services to settle charges that it let users open accounts without conducting sufficient background checks. The regulators found that the crypto exchange's policies violated anti-money-laundering laws. The settlement will also require Coinbase to invest $50 million over the next two years to bolster its compliance program.

42413242,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8BCg,1672924341,Blockchain Project TON Enters Crypto Storage Market,"The TON Foundation, the stewards of proof-of-stake blockchain TON that was created by Telegram Messenger founders, is starting a data storage ecosystem called TON Storage.  The project aims to enable users to exchange files of any size while providing financial incentives to node operators to host files for users, the TON Foundation said in a statement to CoinDesk.  “A node operator and a user create a smart contract on the TON blockchain that guarantees that the user will pay a fixed amount in toncoin to store files for a predetermined amount of time,” the statement said. This will ensure users are able to store data “virtually in perpetuity,” the statement added.  A node is one of the computers that run the blockchain’s software to validate and store the complete history of transactions on the network.  Read more: Crypto Storage Protocol Tokens Slide as Traders Short FileCoin and Storj  How it works  Ton Storage operates like a peer-to-peer file-sharing system using the TON blockchain. In an attempt to decentralize the file storage, TON sites can be hosted on TON Storage, without the need for a centralized web server.  Due to TON Storage's alignment with peer-to-peer file sharing and similarity to traditional torrents – a way of storing a file among distributed locations over the internet – users can exchange files of any size safely and guarantee that all data will be securely backed up and encrypted.  Historically, however, with torrents there was not much incentive to store users' data and files could not be guaranteed to last. TON Storage aims to change that by offering users incentives to become node operators and host files.  “Anyone can become a node operator on the TON network and receive payments from other users for hosting files, even if operating just one node,” the developers said. “The accessibility of this new product will incentivize new, independent users to join the TON network, helping to grow the TON ecosystem even further.""  The move comes after a rough few weeks for similar decentralized file-storage tokens, such as Filecoin (FIL), Storj (STORJ) and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) as traders liquidated their long positions at record levels.  The traders who were selling the storage coins might be questioning the utility the protocols, which have a massive – and growing – storage capacity, but no obvious use case.",POSITIVE,ICP | TON,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ICP | TON,"Asa Sanon-Jules, Shaurya Malwa",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/05/telegram-related-ton-foundation-enters-crypto-storage-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85385bc802c51b6498654722cccec5ebc9395df3-4256x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7098835,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514933,1672923974,Protecting Your Crypto Assets: The Importance of Private Keys,"Cryptocurrencies offer a world of opportunities. Quick and easy payments, innovative financial services, and inclusivity to previously unbanked regions in the world are all made possible by the crypto ecosystem. But with these opportunities come challenges and risks. Many crypto platforms lack strong operational, governance, and risk practices. These problems have emerged with huge ramifications in 2022 with the collapse of Terra Luna — one of the biggest stablecoins — and FTX — the second biggest exchange that filed for bankruptcy. Beyond these collapses, there are also several high-profile cases of hacking-related theft of customer funds on centralized and DeFi platforms. These problems have reinforced the debate about the importance of private keys. We recently caught up with Georgios Kalmpazidis, co-founder and CEO of Swaps.app, who shared his thoughts on the topic. Q — What do you think about the current security problems plaguing the blockchain industry? Talking about blockchains, maybe this is the most transparent, secure and democratic technology and system humanity has ever created. It’s getting increasingly popular over the years, and today besides crypto, it is widely used in many other fields, such as health care, property, smart contract, etc. Blockchain is a relatively new technology that currently meets several security challenges, but I would like to look at those challenges from two perspectives – blockchain and users. From the blockchain perspective, most vulnerabilities are related to the sybil, 51% and routing attacks, which are common issues, are successfully taken care of by cyber security professionals. Regarding the user side, the main challenges are phishing attacks and the security of private keys, which are some of the top issues. When we look deeper, the problems here are similar to the ones in traditional financing, and consistently guiding and educating the users is the key to protecting their funds and fighting fraudsters. It should be one of the top priorities for the companies. Above all the mentioned factors, there is another major problem, which is the biggest roadblocker for the industry’s organic development. I call it an irresponsible and immature business strategy, which misleads and mistreats the users bringing them enormous losses. Unfortunately, we have several similar cases in the industry that we all can recall. Q — Do you think the collapse of major crypto platforms threatens crypto adoption? The drop in market capitalization and what happened with some of the major crypto platforms during 2022 led to a sense of uncertainty regarding the crypto adoption rate. Past events have eroded trust in the industry and affected the market, raising the urgency over keeping private keys independently and securely. At Swaps.app we are optimistic that the industry will survive after all those collapses. Definitely, the pace would be different, but through more comprehensive regulation, the industry will become much healthier, more trustworthy and more consistent. Q — How important is it for users to hold their private keys? As I mentioned earlier, the security of private keys remains one of the top issues, especially amid the current market situation. It’s the main key to the users’ funds and should be owned and kept by them. Of course, it also depends on the users’ needs and trading behaviour. Many crypto platforms offer custodial wallet services that offer high-level security and protection of the wallet and are convenient for those who actively trade crypto. In this case, users must be picky when choosing between public custodial wallets. Nevertheless, we advise always keeping most of your funds on your private key. Q —- How can crypto users best protect their private keys from being guessed or hacked? When protecting private keys, I always compare it with the situation when we lock the front door after leaving home. We never keep it open or leave the key on the lock. It’s the same with the private keys. If it is weak or unprotected, your funds are at risk. The first step, maybe a trivial one, for users to protect their private keys is to keep their credentials private from others. I call it trivial because it sounds basic, but in most cases, users mistakenly share it with hackers during phishing attacks. Also, it’s vital to use keep the two-factor authentication on, avoid simple combinations of passwords, don’t save your password in the browsers, regularly clear the cookies and caches of your browser, and save your credential in a safe way where no one, even a close friend or a family member, has access, use malicious link detection software or apps, improve device security with antivirus software, keep the device system and browser up to date, avoid connecting to the open or public WiFi networks. We constantly remind our users of these simple rules and encourage them to keep their personal information and credentials safe when they buy crypto at Swaps.app. Q —- What are the security features that crypto platforms need to incorporate to prevent high-profile hacks and scams Security is the cornerstone of the crypto industry, and while platforms compete over price, rates, speed and other important parameters, security wins the competition. After it comes the rest. A cryptocurrency system requires secure creation of cryptographic keys and seeds. Companies shoul examine their organization’s security measures in this area, paying close attention to confidentiality and unguessable numbers. Maintaining cryptocurrency wallet/key usage integrity is also critical. Risks such as lost or stolen keys or unintentional disclosure of the wallet holder’s identity can be avoided with best practices such as key storage and more firm ongoing assessments. Q —- What do you think will be the biggest trend in blockchain for the next 12 months? There are many blockchain trends to look out for in 2023, but the biggest one for me is the wide usage of CBDCs, as more governments will introduce their digital assets. At Swaps.app, we look forward to supporting CBDCs for users and business partners whenever they are public. The rising investment in stablecoins and more interest towards DeFi will be blockchain trends, too, during the next 12 months. Q —- What has been the toughest challenge you’ve faced in our industry so far? High velocity and trust issues in the industry were our toughest challenges. I can proudly notice that due to the consistent improvements and updates Swaps.app succeeds in providing high-quality and seamless crypto purchases for customers and quick and secure crypto and fiat payment processing for online businesses. Also, we are very careful and selective about choosing liquidity, fraud-prevention and payment partners, making us a secure crypto platform. During the last 12 months, we’ve finished our integration with industry-leading companies, including TrueLayer, Stripe, Sumsup, and Binance, updated our services, and introduced new coins and features, making a big leap to the next chapter of the company’s history. Swaps.app is a fully compliant and regulated European crypto company which effectively combines industry-leading security with a blazingly fast and incredibly easy-to-use platform to bring buying and selling crypto to everyone, beginner or expert, company or individual.

Whalestats recently reported LDO was one of the most used smart contract tokens among the top 5,000 ETH investors. While the reason for the token adoption may be quite glaring, its recent spike has begged questions from individuals wondering if whales are actively accumulating the Lido Finance token. Whales Accumulating LDO? According to on-chain data, whales are interested in LDO. LookOnChain reported earlier today some investors received a massive amount of LDO tokens. As on-chain data reveals, 3.5 million tokens were received by an investor, and almost half a million were sold on the market at an average selling price of $1.37. 9 hours ago, when the price of $LDO rose from $1.24 to $1.42, an $LDO investor received 3.5M $LDO ($4.8M) and sold 500,000 $LDO ($685,000) out, with an average selling price of ~$1.37.https://t.co/FNpLOXv8Ad pic.twitter.com/23vrf7KBOb — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 5, 2023 Though the sum was large enough to move the LDO market, given the token is not the most liquid asset, LDO survived the massive sell-off, remaining at a solid price. Related Reading: Lido DAO Shows Strength To Breakout; Will The Downtrend Line Be Invalidated? Aside from that, the rapid increase in trading volume is also a point worth noting on the accumulation of the liquid staking token. LDO trading volume has gone from $9.3 million at the beginning of this year to $85 million at present. LDO Gaining Momentum Just a few days ago, Lido Finance TVL (total value locked) overtook Maker DAO emerging as the largest DeFi protocol in terms of total value locked. The Liquid staking protocol’s TVL went from a ranging $5 billion to $5.99 billion. Alongside the protocol TVL increase, Lido’s LDO token also surged amid its TVL rise up by almost 20% in the past week. The reason behind the rapid increase in the momentum of Lido is the Ethereum Merge, which triggered the popularity of liquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance. Following the merge, the total ETH stake in Lido increased 10% from 4.43 million ETH on September 15, 2022, the date of the merge, to 4.9 million ETH today.

Cowen also cut its price target on the shares to $36 from $75. The stock was down 1.5% to $37.14 in premarket trading. It fell 84% in 2022.  The fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's exchange FTX will potentially result in sterner scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, while depressed crypto valuations will cause muted retail trading activity.  ""COIN's business is significantly correlated to crypto asset prices, trading volumes and volatility,"" analysts Stephen Glagola and George Kuhle wrote in a note.  ""COIN's monthly trading volumes have seen a fairly consistent drawdown each subsequent month since November 2021, and there remains low visibility into either a stabilization or rebound in retail trading volumes over 2023 given the macro backdrop and FTX contagion risks on crypto asset prices,"" they said.

42413251,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8BII,1672920115,Marex Issues Coinbase-Linked Structured Product Offering a 40% Coupon,"Marex Solutions, a derivatives-focused division of London-based financial-services provider Marex, unveiled a Coinbase (COIN)-linked structured product that offers enhanced coupons in return for only partially protecting capital risk on the cryptocurrency exchange's shares.  The six-month barrier reverse convertible (BRC) note issued Wednesday by Marex's Financial Conduct Authority-regulated entity Marex Financial offers a guaranteed annual 40% coupon paid monthly, providing holders with regular cash flow.  It also has a predefined ""barrier"" at 66% of the Nasdaq-listed stock's price – $37.80 on the issue date. As long as the shares stay above $25 during the term, Marex Financial will repay the invested amount in full at expiry. If the barrier is hit or breached, the partial downside protection disappears, and the holder will be allocated Coinbase shares at $25, exposing them to market vicissitudes.  One drawback is that the holder will miss out on potential rallies in Coinbase's stock. That's because the note is auto callable – by the end of the month, if Coinbase's shares trade higher than on the start date, Marex Financial will return the initial capital invested with the coupon and the product is redeemed.  Barrier reverse convertibles are popular in traditional finance and are usually chosen when the underlying asset is expected to consolidate or move only slightly higher.  Marex's issue of the BRC note tied to Coinbase's stock shows high-yielding structured products remain in demand despite the crypto bear market. Shares of Coinbase dropped nearly 86% to $35 last year as a result of the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening and collapse of several crypto giants, including stablecoin issuer Terra and rival crypto exchange FTX. The narrative, however, is that the crisis will bode well for Coinbase.  ""Many investors have the view that Coinbase will be one of the survivors, that they could gain a lot of market by positioning themselves as the anti-FTX, being publicly traded, fully U.S. regulated and offering a reliable corporate and custody service,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email.  ""With COIN shares so volatile and so much near-term uncertainly, a lot of investors prefer to express their view via structured products where they can get an attractive guaranteed coupon plus a lot of downside protection,"" Solot said.  A trader investing $1 million in the BRC note would receive a guaranteed $33,333 each month. If the auto call feature is triggered, the trader receives the initial capital of $1 million and the coupon earned, and the product is redeemed.  If, after six months, the auto call has not triggered, the holder collects the total coupon of $200,000 irrespective of Coinbase's share price. Moreover, if the share price is above $25, the holder also gets back his initial $1 million capital.  If, however, the price is below $25, the initial capital invested is at risk. That's because the holder is allocated $1 million worth of shares at $25 or at a value higher than the prevailing market price, exposing the holder to price movements in the market.  ""Taking coupon payments into account, COIN shares has to fall from the current price of $37.88 to around $20 (-47%) at the end of 6-month before the client starts to lose any money,"" Solot noted.  1:41 UTC: Clarifies that the BRC note has been issued through Marex's FCA regulated entity Marex Financial.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/05/marex-solutions-issues-coin-linked-structured-product-offering-a-40-coupon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a04b088fe2f530f1287e5a7009eac7d5b8c25ff-6016x4016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bank has also halted its plans to launch a digital currency and has written off the $196 million related to its acquisition of the technology and assets of Diem Association from Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META). Diem, formerly called Libra, was Facebook's attempt to create a stablecoin, which is a cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar or other stable asset.  Diem had said last February that Silvergate would be buying its assets and technology.  “In response to the rapid changes in the digital asset industry during the fourth quarter, we took commensurate steps to ensure that we were maintaining cash liquidity in order to satisfy potential deposit outflows, and we currently maintain a cash position in excess of our digital asset-related deposits,” Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said in a press release.  Macro headwinds and contagion from the collapse of crypto firms like Celsius Network and FTX led to a significant downturn in the industry last year. Some firms filed for bankruptcy, largely because of the poor performances of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Both fell by over 60% in 2022.  Still, the Silvergate Exchange Network continued to operate with an average daily trading volume of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $1.2 billion in the third quarter.  The bank, however, witnessed an outflow of $8.1 billion in digital-asset deposits during the fourth quarter. To counter the outflows, Silvergate sold $5.2 billion of debt securities, incurring a loss of $718 million.  Deposits from customers declined to $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter from $11.9 billion in the third quarter.  ""Digital asset industry gone under big shift. Significant overleverage has led to several high-profile bankruptcies and sparked crisis of confidence across industry. Many industry participants have shifted to risk-off,"" Lane said.

7090880,https://newsbtc.com/?p=514858,1672912812,Bitcoin Price Is Facing A ‘Pump And Whack’ Ranging Market,"The Bitcoin price has responded to yesterday’s release of the FOMC Minutes with a brief bounce to $16,990, only to revert back to the previous range of around $16,800 shortly after, within 30 minutes. And this trend could continue in the weeks and months ahead. Macro analyst Alex Kruger stated: Welcome to the 2023 Pump and Whack ranging market. Markets pump on falling inflation, and the Fed whacks it. The analyst based his opinion on a series of tweets from the chief economics correspondent at The Wall Street Journal, Nick Timiraos. The renowned journalist said that one of the key statements in the meeting minutes is that Fed officials are concerned that an “unwarranted easing of financial conditions” could “complicate” their fight against inflation. That’s probably one reason why the FOMC minutes contain almost no discussion of how much officials plan to raise interest rates at the February meeting. Instead, the minutes state that officials continue to face a difficult communication task and want to avoid broad “unwarranted” easing of financial conditions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Jumps To $17K and Prints Bullish Continuation Signal While investors see a faster decline in inflation and respond with relief rallies, the Fed could in turn squelch that euphoria. If the CPI data turns out much better than estimates, the phenomenon of December 13 and 14, when the CPI data and the FOMC meeting occurred in quick succession, could be repeated. In the run-up to and after the release of the CPI data, the Bitcoin price rose by almost 10% to $18,350, only to be brought back down to earth by the Fed’s hawkish statements. Bitcoin subsequently fell 12% to $16,280. This “pump and whack” trading could continue in January and February as numerous experts predict another significant drop in inflation. CPI data for December 2022 will be released on January 12, 2023, at 8:30 am EST. Thus, positive numbers could cause a rally, but with a tight expiration date. Related Reading: This Needs To Happen For Bitcoin And Ethereum To See A Bullish 2023 The next FOMC meeting will be held from January 31 to February 01. The subsequent press conference will then take place as usual at 2:00 pm EST on the second day. That’s when the Fed’s hawkish hammer could strike, bringing down the Bitcoin price again. At press time, the Bitcoin price was at $16,793, stuck in a tight range from $16,250-$17,000 till December 17. Bitcoin Price In The Run-Up To The Next FOMC Meeting The meeting minutes also show that Fed officials agreed that the Fed needs to slow the pace of its aggressive rate hikes (50 bps in December). At the same time, it noted that “most participants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality when moving policy to a more restrictive stance.” This could suggest that Fed officials might be willing to return to a quarter percentage point increase at the next meeting, but also that they remain open to an even higher than expected final rate if high inflation persists. The minutes also show that relatively few concerns were expressed at the December meeting that the central bank might go too far at this point and trigger a recession. Only some participants acknowledged that the risks to the inflation outlook must have become more balanced, meaning that the risk of doing too little was no longer much greater than the risk of doing too much. In response, Goldman Sachs commented that the “Fed either pivots too early and turns dovish into a high inflation scenario which is fairly bearish the USD thus helping gold or they pivot too late and cause a much bigger recession than is priced in right now, resulting flight to safety helps gold.” Featured image from Yahoo!

42413228,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8B1S,1672901507,"Celsius 'Earn' Assets Belong to Bankrupt Crypto Lender, Judge Rules","A federal judge ruled that customers of Celsius Network's interest-bearing ""Earn"" product had turned over control of their assets to the bankrupt crypto lender, meaning they are part of the company's bankruptcy estate.  Judge Martin Glenn, the chief U.S. bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of New York, said in a court order Wednesday that Celsius' terms of service made it clear it took possession of crypto assets deposited into its Earn product, dealing a blow to some customers hoping to recoup their funds from the company. Celsius held around $4.2 billion in various cryptocurrencies in its Earn product as of July 2022, with $23 million of that being in stablecoins.  ""The Court concludes, based on Celsius’s unambiguous Terms of Use, and subject to any reserved defenses, that when the cryptocurrency assets (including stablecoins, discussed in detail below) were deposited in Earn Accounts, the cryptocurrency assets became Celsius’s property; and the cryptocurrency assets remaining in the Earn Accounts on the Petition Date became property of the Debtors’ bankruptcy estates (the 'Estates'),"" he wrote.  Glenn also wrote that Celsius had ""established a good business reason to permit the sale"" of about $18 million worth of stablecoins, a move that state regulators and the U.S. Trustee's office had opposed. The proceeds from the sale of these stablecoins would fund Celsius' administrative costs for the next several months.  ""A rare point of agreement among all parties is that the Debtors’ liquidity is precipitously running out,"" Glenn wrote. ""The Debtors need to generate liquidity to fund these Chapter 11 cases and continue down the path either of a standalone plan reorganization, a section 363(b) sale, or even a liquidation plan.'  The ruling allowing Celsius to retain control over the assets in its Earn account will have ramifications for cryptocurrency investors using similar products across other platforms, a number of which have also entered bankruptcy in recent months.  ""The issue of ownership of the assets in the Earn Accounts is a contract law issue. The Debtors and Committee argue that the cryptocurrency assets deposited in Earn Accounts were owned by the Debtors and are now property of the Estates. Many Earn account holders ('Account Holders') argue that the Account Holders, rather than Celsius, own the cryptocurrency assets in the Earn Accounts and that cryptocurrency assets should promptly be returned to them,"" Glenn wrote.  Some of these account holders had argued that Celsius was in breach of its own contract or that Celsius had ""failed to uphold its fiduciary duties,"" but the judge called Celsius's terms of service ""unambiguous.""  The court will hold a hearing on Jan. 10, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss a motion on by when Celsius creditors can submit their claims. A filing from Kirkland & Ellis attorney Joshua Sussberg currently proposes Feb. 9, 2023, as the deadline for proofs of claim, extending certain existing deadlines if approved.  Earn vs. wallets  A less-contentious area of concern for customers of bankrupt crypto exchanges are wallet services. Platforms such as Celsius and BlockFi, another bankrupt crypto lender, have generally treated wallet funds as belonging to their users rather than the companies themselves. Still, even this area is not without some controversy.  Some customers from BlockFi have filed a motion in its bankruptcy proceedings, arguing they had tried to convert some funds from BlockFi Interest Accounts to Wallet Accounts prior to BlockFi's bankruptcy, but that BlockFi is now trying to reverse some of these transactions.  ""BlockFi evidently hoped no one would notice its attempt to sneak in a backdoor determination that customer assets are instead property of the estate through a largely evidence-free Motion on just 14 days’ notice over the Christmas and New Year holidays. BlockFi is required to seek such determination through an adversary proceeding, giving customers the full protections and safeguards of service of a complaint and summons, reasonable time to respond, the opportunity to take discovery, and a decision by the Court after a trial or other dispositive proceeding,"" the filing said.  In total, the sum of these accounts adds up to about $1.6 million, the filing said.  According to the document, the customers at hand transferred their funds from interest accounts to wallet accounts between Nov. 10, 2022, and Nov. 18, 2022. On Nov. 10, BlockFi announced it was suspending withdrawals, but, according to the court filing, the company did not say it was suspending these conversions.  According to the filing, at no point within this window did BlockFi say it would suspend transfers from interest accounts to wallet accounts.  ""According to the Debtors’ own Motion, instead of actually halting transfers from BIA to Wallet, they simply stopped truing up the Wallet Reserve,"" the filing said. ""... Each member of the Ad Hoc Committee received an email from BlockFi confirming that the transfer had taken place. Each member of the Ad Hoc Committee was able to see, in the BlockFi app, that assets had moved from BIA to Wallet.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/05/celsius-earn-assets-belong-to-bankrupt-crypto-lender-judge-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48d6a27412ed3ae6dffa59df23f725a4a89a7045-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A strong sign that the previous year’s interest hikes have a strong effect on managing the inflation problem. However, it remains to be seen whether it did lower or not. Image: CryptoSlate Investors Should Watch This Level… Good macros aside, the central bank is still hawkish on the acceptance of crypto on the financial system. But with that said, the crypto market and the traditional financial space are increasingly intertwined with one another and with the International Monetary Fund pushing for regulation. Although the markets should anticipate the introduction of legislation, CRO investors should still focus on the macro trends that will have an effect on the market right now. Next week, the Fed is expected to release the CPI data that would have an effect on the markets. Meanwhile, investors and traders should watch a breakthrough on the current CRO resistance at $0.0607 which would be a bullish indicator of things to come. But with the CPI data incoming, holding off any major decision could be the wisest choice to do.

Since after the collapse of the exchange, the ecosystem has been trying to distance itself from FTX former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, with Messari even releasing a detailed overview of the ecosystem and how it was impacted by the implosion back in December 15. But a new project called Bonk has been making headlines these past days, shooting up in price and giving Solana some welcome respite from the troubles it had to endure. Related Reading: Internet Computer (ICP) Sheds 5% In Last 24 Hours As Bulls Lose Aggressiveness What Is BONK And What It Can Bring To The Solana Ecosystem According to Bonk’s official website, Bonk stands for the Solana community who made the Solana ecosystem great in the first place. It is the first Solana dog coin “for the people, by the people.” “The Bonk contributors are tired of toxic ‘Alameda’ tokenomics and wanted to make a fun memecoin where everyone gets a fair shot,” the official website says. This certainly hit a spot on the Solana community and the crypto world as a whole as the token is now up 214% in the past 24 hours.

The metric proves that Solana, the “Ethereum killer”, is not dead and has a bullish community supporting it. With the token having an impressive burn rate and major exchanges listing it for open trading, Bonk is now making a name for itself. The expectations are high for the dog meme coin. For instance, many are asking: Will it save Solana from extinction? Vague Whitepaper & Extreme Yields Although the hot new memecoin is leading the charge for Solana in 2023, it isn’t without confusion. Their whitepaper itself is very vague, only detailing the distribution of the 100 trillion tokens to different parties. According to data from Orca, a Solana on-chain liquidity automated market maker (AMM), Bonk has a very unsustainable rate of over 1% per hour just for providing liquidity. Although this might only be in the short-term for it to attract additional capital from investors in the community. Crypto total market cap at $778 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Although 50% of the total BONK token supply has been airdropped, investors might be wary of the remaining half being held by the early contributors. To counter this fear, early contributors to the project have a vesting period of three years, meaning that the tokens allocated to them are locked until the three-year period is done. Related Reading: Optimism Edges Other L2s In Gas Efficiency, Despite Loss In TVL, Revenue It is important to acknowledge the contributors’ drive to give the power back to the community of Solana.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Insights: Square Enix has committed to investing in Web3, but the Japanese gaming company faces an uphill struggle given the country's strict regulations about anything that resembles gambling.  Prices  Favorable Economic Conditions Make for a Flat Market  By Sam Reynolds  By all accounts, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s moves to curb inflation are working, and that’s been good for crypto.  Bitcoin began the day in Asia fairly flat, up 1.2%, trading at $16,851 according to CoinDesk pricing data. Ether was up 3.46%, coming in at $1,254.  But the question is, has inflation peaked? Will the Fed ease off on raising interest rates?  Recently released minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee aren’t painting a clear picture of what’s next. The Fed says that price increases are stubborn, saying it “proves to be more persistent than anticipated,” while raising interest rates another half a percentage point.  A smaller increase than the three-quarter of a percentage point increases of before – indicative of inflation that has peaked – but still another rate hike.  “Participants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to [2%], which was likely to take some time,” the minutes say. “In view of the persistent and unacceptably high level of inflation, several participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy.”  The minutes also say that despite the need for a continued restrictive policy stance, flexibility is also on the agenda.  ""Most participants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality when moving policy to a more restrictive stance,"" suggesting that the next interest rate increase might be a quarter of a percentage point, or 25 basis points.  Before the tumultuous year that was 2022 for crypto, digital asset traders were eying interest rate hikes as a problem; its pricing pressure for bitcoin and ether, which are considered to be risk assets like tech.  But now that the Fed is easing off interest rates, and the market has shaken out the trifecta of toxin that is Terra, Three Arrows, and FTX, pricing recovery should be in the cards.

But corporate Japan is known for its caution and conservatism; the likes of Nintendo and Sega have shown no interest in Web3 gaming or non-fungible tokens (NFT). Nintendo has aggressively defended its IP against those that have tried to appropriate it for crypto gaming.  Square Enix is a rarity for the country, as the company's President Yosuke Matsuda recently committed the gaming company to investing in Web3.  ""In terms of new business domains, we named three focus investment fields under our medium-term business plan,"" Matsuda wrote in a blog post. ""Among those, we are most focused on blockchain entertainment, to which we have devoted aggressive investment and business development efforts.”  Although Square Enix isn’t as large as Nintendo or Sega, among gamers that are fans of Japanese RPGs the company holds plenty of clout. Officially licensed non-fungible tokens of some of Square Enix’s best-known characters, like Final Fantasy VII’s Sephiroth or Cloud Strife would definitely be a hot commodity with fans.  A likely face-off with regulators  But Square Enix will be up against regulations in Japan that many legal experts believe would be hostile to Web3 gaming, classifying it under the country’s gambling framework.  “In the case of blockchain games, it is also necessary to consider gambling laws,” wrote Tokyo-based law firm So & Sato in a 2021 review of how Web3 gaming and the laws of Japan intersect. “Blockchain games that include incentives for users, such as the free issuance of NFTs, must further comply with the Premiums and Representations Act.”  The Premiums and Representations Act, So & Sato wrote in a paper, regulates the free provision of goods and services by a business which aims to induce potential customers to buy the business’s products or services.  As CoinDesk previously reported, Axie Infinity’s gameplay structure would constitute gambling according to So & Sato’s analysis. “Since a user must pay a certain amount of smooth love potion [or SLP, an in-game token] to breed new randomly generated Axies, there is a possibility that the breeding of new Axies is considered illegal gambling,” the firm wrote. The game’s tournaments, which require an entry fee, would also fall under this category.”  To be sure, play-to-earn is only one kind of Web3 gaming, and a dying one at that. Ubisoft’s (unsuccessful) foray into Web3 gaming involved selling collectible skins to be used in one of its Ghost Recon games. But the market didn’t seem all that interested in the prospect – though that might change when it comes to recognizable characters from Square Enix.  NFTs and the unknown  If blockchain gaming for Square Enix just means that collectible NFTs for character skins are bolted on to an otherwise regular game, that’s probably OK under Japanese law.  “It is understood that NFTs are not subject to the financial or business regulations under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, the Payment Services Act or other Japanese laws,” wrote Japanese law firm TMI Associates in a recent paper.  TMI Associates warns that there’s a lot unknown about how NFTs would be viewed by the courts in the event of a dispute as their legal status has yet to be tested.  “While NFTs hold hidden possibilities as a new means of content distribution, their structure and legal positioning are not necessarily fully known at this time,” the firm said.  This great unknown is probably why cautious Japanese corporations, like gaming giants Nintendo and Sega, have yet to dip their toes in the space.

Core Scientific filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, giving Marathon Digital the opportunity to stand alone as the best North American publicly traded Bitcoin mining company. Bitcoin is about to bottom in my opinion as BTC reaches block #770,000. This could be the opportunity of a lifetime to buy MARA stock. Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) is my favorite Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining stock but things aren't looking good as crypto mining stocks continue to get destroyed during the current bear market. It's hard to believe that MARA shares once traded as high as $80 just a little over a year ago. Things have changed drastically now as crypto hype and euphoria has vanished along with quick and easy crypto trading gains. MARA stock trades currently around $4 per share, which is down nearly 90% over the past 52 weeks. Data by YCharts I'm absolutely shocked at how low MARA shares have fallen, considering I haven't sold a single share since first buying MARA stock in 2021. Marathon Digital Business Update In Marathon's latest November 2022 update , the company produced 472 BTC and increased its total Bitcoin holdings to 11,757. As of December 1st, Marathon Digital has deployed 69,000 active miners producing 7.0 EH/s. This is a remarkable feat considering the sheer amount of bankruptcies around the crypto industry. Marathon has not only retained its Bitcoin stash but installed a brand new 14,000 miners in its Garden City, Texas location to continue scaling operations. The company managed to avoid growing too fast and taking on too much debt to avoid an unfortunate bankruptcy situation. However, that's exactly what happened to Core Scientific and caused them to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Core Scientific Bankruptcy Makes Marathon Digital The Clear Leader One of Marathon Digital's competitors, Core Scientific, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to the inability to pay its debts. Core Scientific used a dual mining strategy of both self-hosted and third party miners to become the largest Bitcoin mining company in North America. Unfortunately, the company took on too much debt and responsibility and was forced to liquidate its entire Bitcoin stash to cover its electricity costs and mining costs. BlackRock bailed out Core Scientific with a $17 million loan but it won't fix Core Scientific unprofitable business model. On the other hand, Marathon Digital focuses on slow and steady growth while maintaining 100% of its mined Bitcoin as BTC reserves. This shows that Marathon Digital is focused on the long term and understands that Bitcoin's true value is not dependent on current market prices. While many crypto haters talk about the current bear market, I want to point out a key inflection point in the crypto markets surrounding Bitcoin's upcoming halving cycle in 2024. Bitcoin Could Rebound After Reaching Block #770,000 In one of my previous Bitcoin articles here on Seeking Alpha, I mentioned that Bitcoin will enter the 3rd stage of its current halving cycle sometime in January 2023. This is when Bitcoin has historically bottomed and started pumping higher leading up to the next halving cycle. Bitcoin Halving Cycle (Cointelegraph.com) Bitcoin's halving cycle cuts the amount of mineable Bitcoin in half every 4 years to make it more valuable and scarce. If history repeats itself then Bitcoin's price should bottom in January 2023 and start moving upwards throughout the rest of the year. Crypto mining stocks such as MARA trade alongside Bitcoin prices so this could be a good time to buy MARA stock when nobody else wants it. Risk Factors Marathon Digital has a ton of risk factors that could force the company to liquidate its Bitcoin stash or file for bankruptcy if the crypto winter continues further into the future. My biggest fear is that Bitcoin doesn't follow the historical 3rd stage of its current halving cycle and continues to drop in price. Marathon Digital must continue spending cash on electricity and mining costs to keep the company afloat. The company only had $61.7 million in cash on hand as of November 31st, 2022 and I wonder if Marathon Digital will need to raise more cash through a dilutive stock offering or borrow more cash to stay in business. Marathon Digital's debt is around $780 and the company is completely overleveraged in my opinion. It maintains a scary debt to equity ratio that could cause some future problems for the company. If Marathon Digital starts selling off its Bitcoin, then MARA shares will probably nosedive and head towards $1 in the short term. A prolonged crypto bear market in 2023 could send MARA stock even lower and that would really create a lot of unrealized losses for Marathon Digital shareholders. What's Next for MARA Stock? I haven't sold any MARA shares and will continue to add to my position when there is fear in the markets. MARA stock trades at an attractive P/S ratio of around 2, which is far below its Price to Sales ratio since the most recent crypto bull run. Data by YCharts From a fundamental standpoint, I think it's a good time to buy as many shares as possible while others are fearful. Marathon still HODLs all of its BTC and should survive the crypto winter to reap the benefits as we approach the next Bitcoin halving.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567900-marathon-digital-buy-crypto-mining-stock-before-bitcoin-recovers?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7065488.jpeg
42413235,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8B80,1672877380,Web3 Builders Lose Dozens of High-Value NFTs in Back-to-Back Attacks,"Two prominent Web3 builders lost dozens of high-value non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to scammers over the past few days after their crypto wallets were compromised.  The first victim was pseudonymous NFT collector CryptoNovo, who tweeted on Tuesday that he had been hacked.  The attacker appears to have made off with a hefty haul – three CryptoPunks, a Bored Ape, a Mutant Ape, three Meebits and two CloneX NFTs.  Within 16 hours of taking over the wallet, the new owner was able to sell all 10 NFTs for a total of 492.66 ETH, worth around $618,000 at the time of writing. The funds were then apparently transferred to an account on crypto exchange ChangeNOW, according to on-chain sleuth ZachXBT.  It appears that an attacker may have also taken over CryptoNovo’s Discord account in an attempt to steal more funds.  “DO NOT send anything to anyone using my name and account number!” CryptoNovo said in a tweet. “The Discord you see below is a fake account.”  Another attacker had targeted Nikhil Gopalani, chief operating officer at RTFKT, an NFT project now owned by Nike (NKE). According to Gopalani, his wallet was drained due to a phishing scam.  It appears that two wallets drained Gopalani’s collection, making off with 19 CloneX NFTs, 18 RTKFT Space Pods, 17 Loot Pods, 11 CryptoKicks and 19 RTFKT Animus Eggs. Not all of the NFTs have been sold, and it is difficult to estimate the exact value of each NFT, though the collection is likely worth upward of $140,000, based on the current floor prices of each collection.  Neither CryptoNovo nor Gopalani immediately responded to requests for comment.
