42376743,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpG9,1385578850,Man Accidentally Sends £4m of Bitcoins to Landfill,"A man from Newport, Wales, doesn't know whether to laugh or cry having recently realised he accidentally threw away £4m worth ($6.5m) of bitcoins.  James Howells decided to give bitcoin mining a go back in 2009 and managed to mine around 7,500 bitcoins using his computer, the Guardian reports.  At the time of writing, the price of 7,500 BTC, according to the CoinDesk BPI, is just under £4.2m.  Hype around digital currency was pretty low back in 2009 and Howells decided to give up mining after his girlfriend complained about the noise and heat coming from his computer as a result of the mining process.  The following year, Howells' computer broke, so he dismantled it and threw most of the parts away, aside from the hard drive, which contained the private keys needed to access the bitcoins he mined.  This hard drive sat in a drawer in Howell's desk for three years until this summer, when he had a clear out and put the hard drive in the bin. Howells, who works in IT, told the news provider:  ""You know when you put something in the bin, and in your head, say to yourself 'that's a bad idea'? I really did have that.""  On Friday (22nd November), the 28-year-old realised his mistake and figured out that he didn't have a backup, so he headed to the Docksway landfill site near Newport, in Wales.  ""I had a word with one of the guys down there, explained the situation. And he actually took me out in his truck to where the landfill site is, the current ditch they're working on. It's about the size of a football field, and he said something from three or four months ago would be about three or four feet down,"" he said.  One of the workers on the site said Howells would need a team of 15 guys and two diggers to even have the slightest chance of finding the hard drive. ""I've seen for myself the size of the area concerned and I knew straight away it was very unlikely to be found by a single person. You never know though,"" Howells told CoinDesk.  A spokeswoman from Newport council said any people attempting to access the landfill site to look for the buried treasure would not be allowed in.  ""I'm at the point where it's either laugh about it or cry about it,"" Howells said, but he added that if he was able to get the bitcoins back, he would first ""kindly thank"" a few people who have helped him out in bitcoin forums.  ""Without their encouragement to go down the local dump site and investigate, I'd still be sat in my computer office checking the same drawers and cupboards over and over again while constantly checking the BTC price ticker.""  He said he would then split the rest of the bitcoins, selling half of them and keeping the other half, just to hedge his bets. That said, Howells is pretty bullish about bitcoins and positive they have a large part to play in the future of finance.  ""Eventually, when enough people realise the benefits, I believe bitcoin will top all other currencies worldwide,"" he concluded.

42376733,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cp4p,1385571605,Is Litecoin the Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold?,"Editor’s note: Andrew Torba, a bitcoin fan and CoinDesk contributor, shares his insight into the relationship between litecoin and bitcoin. Article originally published on medium.com.  It's been an exciting week for bitcoin and litecoin. At the time of writing, bitcoin was up 4.36% in one hour alone, topping off at $944.99 on Mt.Gox. In terms of growth over the past month, Litecoin is off the charts: surging from $4 at the beginning of November to a new high of $16.86.  In trading, this is what’s known as a 'sympathy play'. This term is used when a stock, or in this case a digital currency, follows another stock’s path.  Sympathy play  As a rule, sympathy plays tend to lag behind the main play, so it’s likely that we will see litecoin piggyback on bitcoin’s recent success. This could either stabilise bitcoin, or it could potentially slow down its growth.  I’ve been following litecoin closely since October and I think it’s safe to say that litecoin is experiencing its shining moment. Max Keiser agrees:    Litecoin ($12) is up more than 100% since we recommended it last week. We are sticking to our $50 interim target.      — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) November 25, 2013    People are speculating that litecoin may be 'the silver to bitcoin’s gold'. Some argue that as bitcoin's value rises over time, smaller currencies will become more common for everyday transactions.  Think of litecoin as the change in your pocket, and bitcoin as your large assets and savings. The biggest argument from the bitcoin community against litecoin is that bitcoin’s ability to be broken down into uBTC (fractional pieces of one bitcoin) may render litecoin obsolete.  Growth potential  Of course, this will only happen if the world selects bitcoin as its digital currency of choice. I see a future where multiple digital currencies are being utilised by different parts of the world. Maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong, but what would need to happen for litecoin to gain traction?      As adoption increases, you can see quickly where microtransactions become important in daily life.  At the time of writing, there are over 1,060 merchants currently listed on the coinmap.org website that accept bitcoin. The site is adding roughly 50-100 new merchants each day.  Coinmap is an important resource: check it out and support your local bitcoin businesses. As litecoin continues to grow, more exchanges will take it on, specifically Mt.Gox and Coinbase.          When this happens, expect to see massive growth in both litecoin and bitcoin. Adoption by these exchanges will also make it easier for merchants to start accepting litecoin.  Many of the businesses listed on coinmap.org already utilize Coinbase for transactions, including the Subway owner I visited last week, so it would take only one app update for litecoin merchant adoption to be instantaneous.  Recently, I even found a local guitar shop that accepts bitcoin. I will be visiting later this week to get the owner's thoughts on both bitcoin and litecoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LTC | BTG,Andrew Torba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/27/is-litecoin-the-silver-to-bitcoins-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22aa663b96eb0fc60d4224eae71b23057f268845-1024x678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376749,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpMR,1385563950,"Bitcoin Price Hits $1,000 After Doubling in 7 Days. What Next?","Today bitcoin reached a whole new milestone, with the price of bitcoin on Mt. Gox – the world's largest USD-BTC exchange – reaching $1,000.  The price briefly topped the equivalent of $1,000 on Chinese exchange BTC China back on 19th November, but this is the first time this level has been reached in a US dollar denominated exchange rate. The current price on the CoinDesk BPI is $942.  With the passing of this psychologically important milestone the question now is where to from here? Bulls and bears abound on both sides of the price debate. What we can say is the price of bitcoin has been relatively consistent in terms of its response to certain classes of events.  Upcoming market forces  As with all freely traded instruments, the price of bitcoin is ultimately determined by supply and demand. Demand for bitcoins has been broadening based on measures such as the number of bitcoin wallets downloaded and the growing list of merchants joining the digital currency ecosystem.  On the supply side, the Fred Wilson-backed bitcoin startup Coinbase recently made headlines when it ran out of bitcoins. A squeeze in the supply of BTC available for purchase, particularly during periods of more frenzied trading we’ve seen of late, may also be putting upward pressure on the price. On the flip side, profit taking for holiday spending or other reasons may affect supply.  There was speculation earlier in the spring that part of the reason for the late-May/early-June price decline was due to selling pressure by bitcoin miners who needed to finance their purchases of new ASIC hardware. However, recent reports suggest many of those who purchased ASICs have been unable to mine bitcoins in sufficient quantity to earn a positive return on investment.  A secretive Who’s Who of Silicon Valley-backed mining startup may also be scaring off would-be mining competitors. So the next major upgrade to ASIC technology may not generate the same increase in the supply of bitcoin offered for sale as during the last upgrade cycle.  The big price driver  The price action around regulation has been fast and furious, and regulatory news is likely to remain a dominant force for the foreseeable future.  Several times already in 2013 we’ve seen the price of bitcoin increase dramatically around the time of major regulatory events. For example, the Bitcoin Price Index increased from $47 to $95 in 10 days after the US Treasury’s FinCEN issued its forward guidance back in March. Last week’s highly publicized US Senate hearings delivered an even more dramatic result, with the price jumping from $478 on the morning of Monday 18th November to $744 at midnight (GMT).  While positive comments from US federal regulators at the Treasury and even the chairman of the Federal Reserve have created the appearance of an amenable regulatory environment, much uncertainty still exists at the U.S. state level and outside the US.  China is emerging  as a massive bitcoin market. Digital currency regulatory guidance there has, so far, been positive, with the government adopting a seemingly paradoxical position. China is arguably the largest enforcer of financial repression, so the benign Chinese regulatory situation could shift unexpectedly, leading to a significant impact on bitcoin's price in China. However, as the price of bitcoins traded in China has fluctuated wildly around prices at exchanges located outside of the country, it is unclear what effect, if any, a clampdown by Chinese authorities would have on bitcoin's value in the rest of the world.  What big catalysts are on the horizon?  Great enthusiasm in the bitcoin community followed the announcement by Richard Branson that Virgin Galactic was to accept bitcoin as payment for tickets for its suborbital space flights. With space tourism a luxury of the elite, it is unlikely this move will drive mass bitcoin adoption. But Branson’s bold move is indicative of a growing willingness by entrepreneurial branded companies to embrace the formerly taboo bitcoin.  More companies are looking to piggyback on bitcoin’s publicity. In addition, bitcoin is rapidly minting a new class of affluent consumers around the globe, and businesses are keen to market themselves to this community. We can expect more high technology companies, particularly ones with unique and/or expensive products that can be purchased across borders, to adopt bitcoin as a means of payment. For example, given Elon Musk’s prior history as a payments system entrepreneur I wouldn’t be surprised if we soon saw Tesla automobiles priced in bitcoin.  An important breakthrough for bitcoin would really occur if a major consumer-facing business implemented bitcoin as a means of payment.  eBay and PayPal bosses have issued murmurings of interest, if not quite support, of bitcoin, but what is really needed is some decisive action and a bit of risk taking. If an eBay or Amazon added bitcoin acceptance to its payment platforms, digital currency would well and truly be in with a fighting chance of becoming a go-to payment option for a much wider group of consumers.

42376752,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpQD,1385562605,"Kid, 9, Sells Apple Shares to Buy Bitcoin","Andrew Karam isn't your average nine-year-old. While most kids his age ask for the latest must-have toy for their birthdays, Andrew requested shares in Apple.  His parents bought him $120-worth and Andrew watched the price of the stock with interest, checking regularly whether his investment had gone up or down in value.  Andrew's dad, Steve, later told him about bitcoin and the schoolboy was well and truly hooked.  ""He was incredibly excited about it and asked if I could take his Apple stock and cash it out for BTC, so I made him a paper wallet and … bought a bit at a time during the recent dip,"" Steve wrote in a post on reddit.  Andrew recently told his teacher about his investment, revealing he had made about $50 since his dad bought him some bitcoins. He said he was originally thinking of cashing out 25% of his investment, but the savvy youngster now wants to hold on to his cryptocurrency after hearing how well the Senate hearings went last week.  ""[It's] safe to say my son is bullish at this point,"" said Steve.  Andrew also came up with a new idea – a concept known to you and me as 'day trading', but previously unbeknownst to the young New Jersey resident.  ""He told me that he had an idea, that he could sell bitcoin when it goes up [in price] and buy it again when it goes down. I told him it was a great idea, but costly and a gamble even with the right knowledge, and told him sticking to buy and hold is a much better choice right now. He agreed,"" said Steve.  Spreading the bitcoin bug  The assistant principal at Andrew's school was impressed with his newfound hobby and passion for saving, and asked him to give a presentation on bitcoin in his maths class.  Steve sat down with Andrew and worked out some points he'll mention if the presentation goes ahead. The following are some ideas Andrew came up with (in his words, but Steve's spelling):    Bitcoins are created by really powerful computers solving insane math problems. That's called mining. The problems get harder and harder when more bitcoins get mined.    Bitcoins are digital money. It's kind of like money in online games except you can buy real things with it.    My paper wallet isn't just a wallet, it's like my own bank. People can use [it] to give me money. Inside the secret area is my key that lets me use the money. No one's allowed to ever see it but me or else it's like they broke into my bank.    There will only be 21 million bitcoins ever made! And I own .32164308 of them.  Andrew wants to do more than just a talk at school to get his peers involved in digital currency. He asked his dad whether he could sell bitcoins to his classmates, then get them back by accepting BTC as payment for his Wonder Bracelets, which he makes from colourful elastic bands.  Steve said some of their parents might have a problem with this, but he's set up an online store for the aspiring entrepreneur called Bracelets for Bitcoinshttp://www.diddit.net/wonderbracelets/.  Andrew made his first sale earlier this week to a bitcoin fan in Ireland.  ""I have to say I really am so impressed that a nine-year-old has just managed to sell one of his creations to an international buyer without any government interference, registration or payment problems - and with just a sprinkling of help from his dad, of course! This kid is going places and you've definitely got him on the right track,"" the buyer said in a reddit post.  Striking a chord  Andrew's story and enthusiasm has really struck a chord within the bitcoin community, with some members of reddit making donations to Steve, which are then transferred to the 4th grader's bitcoin wallet. Steve said his son is ""super excited"" by all the support he is getting and even commented that he wants to be a ""professional millionaire"" when he grows up.  When asked what he likes most about bitcoin, Andrew told CoinDesk: ""I like that it’s digital money that you don’t have to keep in your wallet. It can all fit on one piece of paper or on your computer.""  He said he wants his friends to learn about bitcoin so they can buy from his shop and see what technology can now do.  ""I think they would really like not having to worry about remembering to bring money to school or shopping because they can just have their phone or something and pay with bitcoin any time,"" Andrew added.  Steve used an online paper wallet generator to create a paper wallet for Andrew to store his bitcoins in – news the site's founder Canton Becker was ecstatic to hear.  ""Inspiring story. This is exactly how I hoped my design would be used. Kudos to your son,"" he said to Steve.  So, what next for the young bitcoin addict? Steve said Andrew is spending a load of his free time making more Wonder Bracelets to replenish the stock on his store. ""I posted about his online shop on reddit yesterday and it's already had over 1,500 views and sold out of all his stock!"" Steve added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/27/kid-9-sells-apple-shares-to-buy-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e10d72c1f4543cebe2f424acaf807817e3f7c92-941x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376734,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cp7L,1385558757,McxNOW Cryptoexchange Suspends Trading Following Support Request Overload,"Digital currency exchange mcxNOW has announced it will suspend trading for the next few months, due to overwhelming support requests.  McxNOW is an exchange that offers interest on balances held by its users. Users now have until 20th December to withdraw coins before the exchange closes for upgrades to its backend and support systems.  The company operates a non-fiat cyrptoexchange, which offers trades between bitcoin, litecoin, primecoin, feathercoin and other altcoins.  It was developed by a single person, going by the online moniker 'RealSolid'. Little is known for certain about the individual, and he declined to give his name when we spoke to him. He did confirm, however, that he is based in Australia.  Interest payments  The exchange's website states that 25% of all transaction fees received by the site are used to pay interest to its users. According to RealSolid: ""Over 200 BTC has been distributed back to users in the form of interest payments.""  Taking the idea of fee shares to another level was mcxNOW's ""mxcFEE shares"". Buying an mcxFEE share entitled the holder to 0.001% of all transaction shares across all the currencies on the exchange. McxFEEs are also tradable, and so their value (against bitcoin) fluctuates as with any other currency.  Suspension  According to RealSolid, the exchange has ""scaled well from 100 users up to a peak of about 3,500 users online at once, it shows the design here is pretty good"".  However, he went on to say he had not given enough thought to some aspects of running an exchange that are quite important, such as support. ""I need to work on this before allowing the site to grow,"" he added.  The suspension of trading was announced yesterday on the exchange's front page. Part of the statement reads:    ""Unfortunately the growth has been too fast to match with the support requirement as only one person can currently do all support.      This is a burden of 200 to 400 emails a day among many requests on IRC and through chat. This makes development of mcxNOW nearly impossible without neglecting valid user requests through support.""    RealSolid explained that the problem with the current version of mcxNOW is that the system doesn't allow for support staff to have anything but complete access to every part of the system, which would clearly be inappropriate.  He stated: ""V2 of the site, which is what we are on now, has a very limited admin interface. Basically, if you can do any support, you have control of the whole system.  ""So instead of risking the equivalent of $20m of people's funds by letting people do support that way, I need to code a better system. If I [had] hired someone it could have helped, but they'd have the keys to everything. It's too much.""  mcxFEE Shares  At the end of October, a large amount of mcxFEE shares were sold by RealSolid to mcxNOW users. We asked RealSolid if he had any idea trading would have to be suspended when the mcxFEE shares were offered for sale and he said he did not.  Disgruntled users have said the sudden announcement of the trading suspension has caused people to lose money invested in mcxFEE shares, which reportedly dropped from 0.25 BTC to as little as 0.05 BTC. At the time of writing a mcxFEE share is worth 0.073 BTC.  RealSolid said he never made any kind of agreement on the length of time mcxNOW.com would operate for, so he feels he would be well within his rights to close it down if he wanted to. However, he said: ""I don't want to disappoint the users which is why I am making v3.""  Some forum members are suggesting that mcxNOW was never anything but a scam, with user twentyseventy stating: ""Few things have screamed 'Scam Waiting to Happen' to me more than MCX did. Hate to say it, but this was a surprise to very few.""    Do you have experiences of using mcxNOW? Have you withdrawn your money or had a sizeable investment in mcxFEE shares?

Located in a Waves Coffee House in Vancouver, the ATM has already processed more than 1,500 transactions.  The machine enables people to buy and sell bitcoins and features a palm scanner to identify the user and regulate their daily transaction limit, which in Canada is CA$3,000.  When purchasing bitcoins, the user can either add them to an existing wallet, or create a new bitcoin wallet. According to the company, over half of the transactions made so far have seen users generate a new wallet, which suggests the ATM is attracting a lot of new bitcoin users.  On the machine's first day at the coffee shop, it processed CA$10,000 in 81 transactions. It then broke Robocoin's first-month goal of CA$50,000 by reaching a volume of CA$81,000 after just a week. By day 17, the machine had broken even for its operators.  ""For operators, Robocoin offers the best way to invest in bitcoin – a scalable and highly profitable exchange business that’s as easy as purchasing and plugging in a machine,"" a statement from the company claims.  It goes on to say that, over the next six months, Robocoin is gearing up to ship hundreds of ATMs across the world with a retail price of $20,000 or $18,500 for those who buy in 2013.  ""It's an amazing milestone that validates the demand for Robocoin and signals bitcoin's accelerating appeal. The untold story here is about Robocoin compliance - we're supporting bitcoin's legitimacy and brand with our Anti-Money Laundering and Consumer Protection leadership,"" said Robocoin's Sam Glaser.  He went on to say the company reached the CA£1m milestone faster than he and his colleagues had expected. ""Opportunities are coming in from all over the world and we're living a wonderful case study on demand management.""  Glaser went on to say he believes bitcoin has enjoyed a surge over recent weeks due to a ""Chinese buying frenzy, the favorable US Senate hearings and the present and perceived liquidity Robocoin has injected into the market"".  ""The surge will surely slow and likely dip-temporarily. But in the long run bitcoin is still so nascent it can't possibly be peaking.

42425143,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrnh,1385550035,4 Career Fields Bitcoin Could Replace,"Is bitcoin disruptive? You bet, enough so that eventually it might displace some jobs.  Just like the industrial revolution changed how things were made and the digital revolution displaced lots of clerical work, distributed money could automate a number of processes that currently require people.  That can be considered a scary thought, but bitcoin represents technological progression, which as history has proven pretty much always wins out versus any sort of old manual process.  So, what are the types of jobs that might be threatened by digital currencies? Let’s take a look.  Bankers  It’s no wonder banks are incredibly inflexible in their policies regarding bitcoin. The modern banker (not the investment sort) is, by his or her nature, adverse to risk.  Bitcoin represents perhaps the most risky asset since the days of trading in tulips. Yes, this is in reference to “Tulip Mania” back in 1637, when the price of the flower grew to an outrageous valuation.  Another reason bankers might not like bitcoin is that its nature doesn’t require as much human interaction as fiat currency does.  Bitcoin and other virtual currencies allow monetary values to move faster and require less friction. Replace the word “friction” with “bankers” in the last sentence, and you might see that the two words are pretty much interchangeable.  Cashiers  There are probably fewer days ahead of than there are behind a person taking physical (or perhaps even fiat) money and making exact change for people. Part of this has to do with the advent of new technologies such as ATMs.  Another element is that everyone increasingly uses plastic cards to pay for things. Do you know someone who never carries cash? Is that person you?  Commerce has made this possible for us. New devices like smartphones make paying for goods and services a much more simplistic process than ever before, eliminating the need for cashiers. These employees are only needed for complex tasks, and at that point it’s hard to argue that they would be called cashiers anymore.  Armored car guards  Did you know that the Treasurer of the United States printed a $100,000 note from 1934-35?  The reason for it was to move large amounts of gold-backed money around the Federal Reserve System. According to the Treasury: “Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System has any plans to change the denominations in use today.”  They don’t need to, because electronic forms of money are overtaking the need to move physical money around, which lessens the need for the job of an armored car guard.  Sure, these hardworking people will still be around to transport valuable items such as gold or priceless art, but they will be in less demand as paper money declines and doesn’t need as much costly transportation.  Accountants  The field of accounting is a respectable vocation. Many people know an accountant, and a number of businesspeople even employ one of their own.  But what is the role of an accountant going to be when decentralized virtual currencies can automate accounting functions such as a general ledger? The block chain appears to be doing this job just fine for bitcoin, and no certified public accounts required.  The explosion of accounting software to automate many financial tasks over the past two decades has, in some respects, lessened the role of accountants already.  It’s relegated the profession to more specialization in areas like taxation. And while the extinction of the accounting profession isn’t likely, let’s hope that it doesn’t adopt money laundering as one of its specialties if business does someday decline.  What else does the future hold?  The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that from 2010-2020, there will be a projected 0.7% increase in the US civilian labor force, which means 10.5m additional jobs will be created by 2020. That’s good, given the recent struggles that many Americans have faced finding work.  However, if you believe bitcoin will not at least displace some workers, think again. The same BLS report that forecasts job growth also points out areas of decline. One of these is in postal services, a field that is expected to decline by 48.5% from 2010-2020.  This seems logical on the surface, but think about what has displaced postal service workers: email.  Virtual currencies like bitcoin are replacement for paper money; much in the way electronic messaging has decimated the need for paper-based messaging.  And that’s just one component of postal mail’s decline. Think of the jobs that were based just on postal mail thirty years ago (company mail departments, mail-order catalogs, etc), and how much of that has dissipated.  The concept of bitcoin-type electronic money may ultimately disrupt industries the same way as email already has.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/27/4-career-fields-bitcoin-could-replace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00782c975e9628803ddea8ac2b6239ba1c77dfc3-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
