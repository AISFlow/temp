At the Ethereal Summit Tel Aviv 2019, on Sunday, the company announced a partnership with QEDIT, a developer of privacy technology for enterprise blockchains.  Through this partnership, the firm will allow clients to shield sensitive information through zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography when trading tokenized assets in their marketplace. While the technology is broadly applicable, it has particular utility in the energy and financial sectors.  “Tokens aren’t just about crypto anymore, they’re a digital construct of real world assets,” Kaleido CEO Steve Cerveny told CoinDesk. “They have a shared state [assets that can function on multiple platforms] and need to move from one party to another. In many cases you would want to obfuscate some amount of information.”  While transactions remain legible on the blockchain and verifiable by network participants, “observers cannot see who sent what, or how much, or to whom,” Cerveny said.  ConsenSys-backed Kaleido assists large organizations move from blockchain pilots to production. The latest integration removes the friction from experimenting with the emerging privacy tech. Further, the network is private and permissioned, meaning that organizations themselves will determine which information will remain publicly available.  To use the service, firms will register their wallets, sign up for the native zero knowledge token transfer service, transfer their assets to a shielded account, then press a button that leads to a “dark room” to make private trades.  QEDIT's solution was developed by the data scientists behind zk-SNARK proofs.  Cerveny concluded:  “Enterprise tokens are still nascent, but many firms are coming around to how powerful these things are to share state.

Either way, Lubin described DeFi systems like MakerDAO and Uniswap as some of the industry’s most important developments.  “I’ve always supported that project,” Lubin said of MakerDAO.  Lex Sokolin, co-head of global fintech at ConsenSys, told CoinDesk the Codefi software suite could be compared to Twilio or Stripe, serving businesses that need to process payment data.  “As ConsenSys has matured, it’s finding its business model,” Sokolin said. “This is us putting a flag in the ground about what we want to be doing in the market.”  The product suite includes four parts: data, networks, assets, and payments. Although the company is still yet to announce specific revenue goals or clients, it’s clear ConsenSys wants to serve enterprise customers by processing cryptocurrency payments, fiat payment information using blockchain systems and API access for a wide range of enterprise use cases.  Stepping back, there are already several ConsenSys-incubated startups offering such services, from Infura to BlockApps. This new software suite is strictly in-house, meaning the revenue generated stays with ConsenSys proper. Across the board, the conglomerate has struggled since 2018 to find revenue models that match its research costs and rampant growth. As CoinDesk previously reported, the company projected a $100 million burn rate for 2019.  Codefi will eventually be a core pillar of the ConsenSys business model, after it spends this initial phase targeting and onboarding enterprise clients.  “There have been many spokes [startups] and projects that have tried to build things, they did the pioneering work. ConsenSys has learnings from them,” Sokolin said, adding that ConsenSys leadership noticed a divide between startups’ products and enterprise clients’ needs.  Ecosystem synergy  “There are a series of smart contracts and workflows and capabilities that everyone needs. It doesn’t make sense for every organization or team working in DeFi or institutional assets to rewrite the same code,” Ethereum Enterprise Alliance founding board member Jeremy Milar, who is also chief of staff at ConsenSys, told CoinDesk. “It makes much more sense for a large, well-resourced, software organization to write a set of modules that will work together.”  For now, the suite is being developed under a “controlled release” with a few undisclosed pilots. Milar said there are more paying customers seeking such clients than the Codefi team of roughly 40 developers and product managers can support.  Meanwhile, Sokolin is also serving as a mentor in the Libracamp program for developers working on Facebook’s nascent cryptocurrency project.  “I definitely can foresee a world where there will be overlap,” Sokolin said of both Libra and ethereum. “We have to be smart about where the customers are. … We’re the connective bit.”  Speaking of the broader role Codefi will play in the ConsenSys business model, Milar said the project is focused on encouraging ethereum adoption among businesses. He added:  “The strategy here is to accelerate the growth of the DeFi ecosystem.”  Joe Lubin speaks at Ethereal Tel Aviv, photo by Leigh Cuen for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MKR | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/15/consensys-announces-codefi-project-to-boost-defi-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb40c753d560631abf597d91a4b4af8d42ab876f-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382634,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sX5f,1568550617,Browser Extensions Can Help Scammers Steal Your Bitcoin: Casa CEO,"Browser extensions can help scammers steal your crypto Casa CEO Jeremy Welch warned the audience at the Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga this weekend.  “Browser extensions impose major risks, and these risks haven't been discussed until this point,” Welch said.  Extensions can gather a wealth of data, which can be leaked, stolen, and used by scammers. One example is browser history, which can expose users’ online habits, including crypto-related site visits.  “Make sure you don’t expose your bitcoin addresses anywhere,” Welch warned.  Another thing to keep in mind is that some extensions capture users’ KYC information and can leak it to scammers. The only major multisig system that requires KYC at the moment is the one supplied by Unchained Capital, Welch said. He warns against commonly-used consumer software that gathers identity data.  As an example, Welch demonstrated how an extension providing wallpapers with inspiring quotes or other content was actually stealing data as you filled in KYC forms. The software also extracts graphical data, like a photo of your driver’s license, which is captured as a code and then easily decoded, providing an actual picture of your ID document to hackers.  Quiet data thefts  All this is happening on the background, without the user noticing.  “You got a nice background here and you don’t realize that your browser is actually dumping data,” Welch said.  The same wallpaper extension can alter a receiving address when you’re trying to send your crypto to somebody else (or to yourself), sending it to a scammer’s wallet instead. The ubiquity and popularity of browser extensions makes the situation quite dangerous, Welch noted:  “It’s terrifying, right? We all are using browser extensions all the time.”  Even if a user is very careful and selective in what they’re using, the software can be upgraded and get new, unsafe features without a consumer noticing, Welch added.  Welch noted that many well-known applications request enough permissions to gather personal data, including password managers, text editing app Grammarly, Joule extension for in-browser Lighting transactions, Casa's own Sats extension and the Lolli bitcoin-earning extension.  The solution? There is no easy one, Welch says. Developers can only keep building better tools that will make users’ experience safer and better.  “We all need to be discussing this issues more, because we’re not even in the phase yet when real attacks will be taking place.”  Welch added that Casa is planning to publish more security research soon and encouraged bitcoin developers and entrepreneurs to approach the company and share their concerns and ideas on how to address security issues.

42382638,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sXBx,1568541608,What Bitcoin’s Valuation Says About Its Volatility,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s Director of Research. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here. For a primer on crypto valuation concepts, you can download our free report here.      Most of us think we understand the term “volatility.”  We digest headlines about tense political situations around the world; we are wary of explosive chemical compounds; some of us have had relationships with their fair share of ups and downs.  “Volatility” implies sharp and unpredictable changes, and usually has negative connotations. Even when it comes to financial markets, we intuitively shy away from investments that would produce wild swings in our wealth.  But volatility, in finance, is usually misunderstood. Even the most commonly accepted calculation is often incorrectly applied.  Its desirability is also confusing. Investors hate it unless it makes them money. Traders love it unless it means too high a risk premium.  And few of us understand where it comes from. Many think that it’s the result of low liquidity*. This intuitively makes sense: with thin trading volume, a large order can push prices sharply up or down. But empirical studies show that it’s actually the other way around: volatility leads to low liquidity, through the wider spread market makers apply to compensate the additional risk of holding a volatile asset in their inventory.  (*The misconception also stems from our mistaken conflation of low liquidity and low volume – it is possible to have high volume and low liquidity, but that’s for another post.)  This confusion matters in the crypto sector.  Bitcoin’s volatility has often been cited as the reason why it will never make a good store of value, a reliable payment token or a solid portfolio hedge. Many of us fall into the trap of assuming that as the market matures, volatility will decrease. This leads us to believe in use cases that may not ever be appropriate; it can also lead us to apply incorrect crypto asset valuation methods, portfolio weightings and derivative strategies that could have a material impact on our bottom line.  So it’s worth picking apart some of the assumptions and looking at why bitcoin’s unique characteristics can help us better understand market fundamentals more broadly.  Changing uncertainty  First, there are different types of market volatility. Academic literature provides an array of variations, each with its distinct formula and limitations. Jump-diffusion models used to value assets hint at a helpful differentiation. “Jump” volatility results, as its name implies, from a sudden event. “Diffuse” volatility, however, is part of the standard trading patterns of an asset, its “usual” variation.  With this we can start to see that, when we assume that greater liquidity will dampen price swings, we’re talking about “jump” volatility.  “Diffuse” volatility, however, is a more intrinsic concept.  The standard deviation calculation – the most commonly applied measure of volatility – incorporates the destabilizing effect of sharp moves by using the square of large deviations (otherwise they could be offset and masked by small ones). But this exaggerates the effect of outliers, which are often the result of “jump” volatility. These are likely to diminish as transaction volume grows, leading to a misleadingly downward-sloping volatility graph.  JP Koning proposes an alternative calculation that uses the deviation from the middle value rather than the average, which reduces the effect of outliers and shows a more intrinsic volatility measure. As the below chart shows, this has not noticeably decreased over the years.  Now let’s look at why this might be. A clue lies in the methods used to value bitcoin.  Fundamental value  Bitcoin is one of the few “real assets” traded in markets today, in that it does not derive its value from another asset.  What’s more, it is a “real asset” with no discernible income stream. This makes it very difficult to value. Even junior analysts can calculate the “fair value” of an asset that spins off cash flows or that returns a certain amount at the end of its life. Bitcoin has no cash flows, and there is no “end of life,” let alone an identifiable value.  So, what drives the value of bitcoin?  Many theories have been put forward, some of which we describe in our report “Crypto’s New Fundamentals.” And as the market evolves, some may rise in favor while others get forgotten or superseded.  For now, though, the main driver of bitcoin’s value is sentiment: it’s worth what the market thinks it’s worth. In the absence of fundamentals, investors try to figure out what other investors are going to think. Keynes likened this to a contest in which “we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.”  Gold is in a similar situation, in that it is also a “real asset” with no income stream and a market value largely driven by sentiment.  So, why is its volatility so much lower?  Because of “radical uncertainty.”  Changing narratives  In his book “The End of Alchemy”, Mervyn King explains that under “radical uncertainty,” market prices are determined, not by fundamentals, but by narratives about fundamentals.  Bitcoin is a new technology, and as such, we don’t yet know what its end use will be. Everyone has their theory, but as with all new technologies, no-one can be certain, which makes its narrative changeable.  Gold, on the other hand, is neither new nor a technology. It has been around for millennia, and its narrative is not uncertain. Sentiment plays an important part in its valuation, and scientists may yet uncover an innovative use for the metal that affects both demand and price. But its “story” is well established, which gives it a lower volatility profile.  For now, bitcoin’s fundamentals are its narrative, and the uncertainty about bitcoin’s “story” means that its volatility is unlikely to diminish any time soon.  A more prominent role  This matters for its eventual use case: will it always be too volatile to be used as a payment token, store of value, etc.? This in turn impacts its narrative, which affects its valuation and volatility, which affects its eventual use case. The self-perpetuating loop will eventually be broken as the sector matures and bitcoin’s role as an alternative asset class becomes more firmly consolidated – when uncertainty diminishes and its “intrinsic value” becomes easier to quantify.  But until then, its price will continue to be driven by market sentiment, which is susceptible to changeable narratives that in turn are formed by global developments and also by market sentiment.  Until then, market shifts will continue to be amplified in either direction, whatever the trading volume.  Rather than fret about this, we should accept and even embrace it. Increasingly sophisticated providers are working on improving the access to and interpretation of sentiment data, which strengthens our analytical tools. Crypto Twitter provides an engrossing platform to gauge the sector’s mood. And the identification of the impact of narrative and sentiment on an asset class will open up new avenues of investigation that is likely to spill over into other areas of investing.  What’s more, volatility may be inconvenient for some and uncomfortable for many. But it is also an important component of superior returns. Perhaps the tools and skills we develop to hone our bitcoin valuation techniques will enable a more masterful handling of volatility’s inherent uncertainty, and allow for a deeper appreciation of what it has to offer.

""We are excited to see how the market and the community will adopt this new programming language in decentralized applications, on cryptocurrency exchanges and in institutional finance,"" Ross said.  Domain-specific language  Unlike “broad” programming languages used for the majority of blockchain development, Lira will be “domain-specific,” meaning it can only describe and perform a limited set of instructions. Lira’s only function is to enable counterparties to write, verify, and collect on the terms of a self-executing contract.  Ross said the typical length for scripting a financial contract in Lira is between 6-10 lines of code, leading to a simpler development cycle and less room for error.  “Essentially, financial contracts are trivial computations, typically involving a lot of money, making them a highly suitable use-case for domain-specific programming languages,” Ross said. ""It can only describe a very limited set of instructions but does so with the highest level of competence and integrity attainable.""  Contrarily, broad languages, like Solidity, the native scripting language used for ethereum, enable a wide range of use cases, but also introduce risk. Ross specifically mentioned the DAO “hack,” in which a malicious actor exploited the decentralized autonomous organization’s code and syphoned off 3.6 million ETH.  Ross joined eToro in March and has lead the development of the company’s 12 stablecoins.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculated the overall size of the derivatives market to be $500 trillion, in 2017.
