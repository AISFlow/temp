27938568,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608402,1715900408,End Of The Road For BNB After 200% Surge? Mounting Resistance Threatens Rally,"BNB, the native cryptocurrency of the BSC network, has undoubtedly been one of the winning altcoins scene the bull market began. The price has been able to go from around $200 to over $600 in the space of a year, notching over 200% gains in the process. However, it seems that this outperformance by the altcoin is coming to an end, as an analyst predicts that it is about to hit massive resistance that could stop its growth dead in its path. BNB Headed For Mounting Resistance In an analysis that was shared on the TradingView website, crypto analyst Trade City Pro revealed that the BNB token might have to fighting massive resistance soon. The analyst points out that this is a culmination of the bullish rally that the altcoin has seen in the last year, and now bears are maki g their stand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Reveals Why $57,938 Is The Level To Watch This Week The analyst points to Bitcoin’s performance during this time as something that could help to pinpoint where the BNB price is headed next. As they explain, BNB risks falling into correction and consolidation after that, making its current level a perilous one for investors. Mainly, the crypto analyst credits the altcoin’s performance from here on what Bitcoin does next. BNB, which is currently the 4th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, mirrors Bitcoin’s movements to a larger extent compared to smaller altcoins. So, Trade City Pro’s analysis with respect to Bitcoin is not far off. For confirmation of whether the BNB token continues to be something to sell or hold, the analyst places the ultimate decision around the $48,000 level for Bitcoin. They explain that a dump below $48,000 would be a sell signal. However, if the Bitcoin price were to maintain strength above $48,000, then they would continue to hold the altcoin. What Happens In The Event Of A Price Crash? Should the BNB price crash from here, the crypto analyst has prepared an action plan that could help investors take advantage of it. For example, a Bitcoin crash below $48,000 could send the BNB price below $400, and at this level, the analyst believes buying would be a good move. This is what the analyst refers to as the “Potential Re-Entry” point. Then, for “Entering After Resistance,” the analyst advises investors to buy the altcoin if the price is able to reclaim $616 and stay above it. This level is important because the $616-$660 range is identified in the analysis as a significant resistance zone, and so beating it is important for the BNB price to continue its rally. Related Reading: How High Can The XRP Price Go? Crypto Analyst Unveils 6-Month Prediction Additionally, Trade City Pro adds that the Fibonacci Retracement Levels might offer a level for re-entry into the altcoin. “In case of a correction, the key Fibonacci levels from the last upward wave at 0.5 and 0.618 (between $394 to $430) might offer good entry points. Wait for a reaction or momentum change at these levels before entering,” they stated. Lastly, the analyst points out that BNB has not really followed the broader market in recent times, which could mean something is coming. “It’s intriguing that BNB seems relatively unaffected by broader market conditions, suggesting Binance might be positioning for something unique,” Trade City Pro said in closing.

27936143,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608478,1715896854,ICP Price Drops 10% As DFINITY Foundation Unveils Updated Internet Computer Roadmap,"The DEFINITY Foundation, the company behind developing the Internet Computer protocol, has recently unveiled an updated roadmap to facilitate increased artificial intelligence (AI) blockchain adoption. As the native token of the network, ICP continues to lead among AI tokens and holds the 22nd position in the top 100 cryptocurrencies. However, recent price drops have prompted the Foundation to focus on key areas of development to revitalize the token’s price action and further advance the protocol’s capabilities. Internet Computer Roadmap The highlighted aspects of the roadmap outline two critical steps called “milestones” in the Internet Compute platform domain: Tokamak and Stellarator. Tokamak focuses on reducing latency by maximizing the block rate of each subnet and introducing a new synchronous ingress submission endpoint. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Makes Decisive Move: Is Now The Ideal Time To Buy? Stellarator, on the other hand, will reportedly increase the storage layer, enabling subnet blockchains to host over 1TB of canister smart contract storage while improving the efficiency of the consensus layer. The DEFINITY Foundation aims to integrate AI capabilities as smart contracts on the Internet Computer protocol to address the resource-intensive nature of AI training and inference. The Cyclotron milestone outlined in the roadmap will increase on-chain inference for larger AI models through performance improvements in the WebAssembly runtime and inference engine. The Gyrotron milestone, on the other hand, explores the integration of AI-specialized subnets with GPU support, enabling compute—and memory-intensive computations on-chain. ICP’s Interoperability With Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana ICP’s Chain Fusion technology will allow direct interoperability with major blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs). Nonetheless, the roadmap introduces several milestones to expand interoperability. Tritium milestone enables ICP to interact with Ethereum and EVM smart contracts, facilitating cross-chain communication. Deuterium milestone extends Chain Fusion support to emerging Bitcoin protocols. Interestingly, the Helium milestone aims to increase Chain Fusion for the Solana network, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) leveraging the capabilities of both networks. Related Reading: Whale Watch: Ethereum Fresh Buy Signal Sparks Speculation Next, the Solenoid milestone decentralizes the operation of the ICP boundary nodes, “empowering” the network’s participants. The Levitron milestone provides visibility into the Internet Computer’s edge infrastructure, allowing developers to gain insights into dApp usage patterns and generate user statistics. Lastly, ICP will incorporate two governance systems: the NNS (Internet Computer’s DAO) and the SNS framework governing individual dApps. Tokenomics incentivizes voting participation and aligns DAO decisions with long-term interests. These governance mechanisms will allegedly ensure decentralized decision-making and community involvement. As of the current press time, the price of ICP has experienced a significant increase of 120% year-to-date. However, it is currently trading at $12.05, 98% lower than its previous all-time high (ATH) of $700 achieved in September 2023. Once implemented, the impact of the roadmap on the cryptocurrency’s price and its potential to regain bullish momentum and drive adoption for various use cases remain to be seen.

42418220,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrVd,1715893725,Biden Order to Halt China-Tied Bitcoin Mine Beside Nuke Base Came as U.S. Firm Just Bought it,"CleanSpark had just finished hailing the benefits of its purchase of a Wyoming crypto-mining site when the White House declared that the current operation was a national security threat that must be halted.  The company saysit was unaware of the order before buying the properties but intends to move forward with the acquisition.  Order would mark first ""the first presidential prohibition relying on the expanded authority over real estate transactions granted to CFIUS and the president.""  An American bitcoin mining company, CleanSpark (CLSK), got caught up in the U.S.-China political war after buying mining sites in Wyoming within close proximity of a U.S. nuclear missile base from MineOne, a company with Chinese ties.  On Monday, President Joe Biden ordered a bitcoin mining facility near Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming to stop operations, citing a threat to national security as it uses foreign-sourced technology. The order said that MineOne is majority-owned by Chinese nationals, and all mining equipment on the property must be removed from within a mile of the military facility in Cheyenne, which houses Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).  While this may not be a surprising move in itself, the timing stands out, as MineOne sold the sites to CleanSpark less than a week prior to the order.  On May 9, CleanSpark said it was buying two mining sites for nearly $19 million in cash, with a 45-day closing, without naming a specific seller. The miner said it will deploy China-based Bitmain's latest generation mining machine, noting that it plans to expand the sites by an additional 55 megawatts (MW) from 75MW.  A spokesperson for CleanSpark said the company was unaware of the order prior to buying the mining sites but acknowledged the concerns in the executive order and intends to press forward with the deal.  ""The executive order and the involvement of CFIUS, both of which we were unaware of before signing the deal, has added an unexpected layer to the closing process, but we are working through these developments toward a satisfactory closing,"" the spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement.  ""We respect the oversight process and are dedicated to ensuring that our operations bolster national security and benefit economic development, particularly in Wyoming, a state that has been at the forefront of developing and nurturing a pro-Bitcoin environment,"" the statement said.  Neither MineOne nor lawyers at Loeb & Loeb who handled the property deal for the company responded to requests for comment.  The details of the $19 million deal, though, were fully described in filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from CleanSpark. The purchase was highly dependent on the securing of massive amounts of energy required to run the business.  The larger of the two properties is about 4,000 feet from the closest edge of Warren Air Force Base.  From MineOne, the sale agreement was signed by Jiaming Li, identified as the company's director. Li, who couldn't be reached by CoinDesk for comment, has also been president of China Xiangtai Food Co., a partner in TCC Capital and reportedly managed almost $12 billion in assets at Sinatay Insurance Co.  He has a doctorate in economics from Fordham University, according to past press releases. Li was also briefly the president of Bit Origin Ltd., a MineOne investor and a company that was reported to have garnered similar scrutiny previously from Washington.  Due diligence  The SEC-disclosed contract with CleanSpark outlined a due diligence period extending 15 days from the May 8 date the deal was signed, and the purchase could be scrapped if MineOne didn't satisfy several conditions, including ""government compliance matters.""  ""I have been deeply involved in National Security affairs for nearly four decades, and am well aware of the potential risks of many different types of encroachment on important defense infrastructure,"" said Tom Wood, a CleanSpark board member who once served in senior U.S. Navy roles and as a military analyst, in a statement. ""The presence of a CCP-owned data processing facility near a facility like Warren which houses a portion of the nation’s ICBM force is legitimate cause for concern as noted by the president’s order.""  He said he's familiar with the CFIUS process, calling it ""impartial, data-driven and non-arbitrary,"" and he said that if the U.S. mining business can address the concerns in the order, ""I would consider this a significant win-win for the United States and for CleanSpark.""  This use of Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) powers to shut down the acquisition by owners tied to China marked the eighth time the president has used the authority – seven of which involved China, according to lawyers at Hogan Lovells who specialize in this issue. Anne Salladin and Brian Curran said in an emailed analysis that this was ""the first presidential prohibition relying on the expanded authority over real estate transactions granted to CFIUS and the president under the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MINING | REGULATION | SPONSORED,"Jesse Hamilton, Aoyon Ashraf",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/16/biden-order-to-halt-china-tied-bitcoin-mine-beside-nuke-base-came-as-us-firm-just-bought-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75839ea0a6e2730560877f2e1d9558a6767697b0-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The recent pump has propelled different sectors, with memecoins being 9% up and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tokens increasing 11.2% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Shares Top AI Altcoin Investments This Month Fetch.AI (FET) is at the forefront of the AI sector with its remarkable 14.5% increase in the past day. Some analysts foresee a bullish breakout for the token soon. Are AI Tokens Taking The Lead? As reported by NewsBTC, many market experts consider Artificial intelligence tokens a contender for the cycle’s biggest narrative in round 2. Alex Wacy said the artificial intelligence industry is “on the brink of a multi-trillion-dollar boom” due to the increasing interest over the last year. As a result, the analyst considers the sector could create a market valued in the trillions, reaching $2 trillion by 2030. This week, AI tokens have performed strongly. Altcoin Sherpa pointed out that the sector is “looking decent overall,” with tokens like Arweave (AR), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), and Fetch.ai performing the best. Renowned traded Daan Crypto considers the AI sector to be “bouncing the strongest” on this new market move, while memecoins seem to be the “weakest.” The trader shared his thoughts on Fetch.AI’s recent performance. Daan highlighted the token’s attempt to break above the diagonal trendline. Per the chart, FET is testing the diagonal resistance, with the $2.35 mark being the first resistance level to reclaim. A breakout above this level could be a “good start to a further trend change.” Moreover, the token broke “above the 4H 200MA/EMA already.” Per the trader, FET would need to test the $2.5 mark and remain above the $2.35 price range to “break the trend and head higher over the next couple of weeks.” Similarly, crypto trader Scient considers the token consolidating inside a one-day ascending bullish triangle. His chart highlights the $2.12 mark as support for the diagonal trendline. He forecasted a deviation below the trendline “towards 1D 100EMA” before reclaiming the $2.12 price range and moving back inside the triangle. If a retest and confirmation of the trendline reclaim occurred, the trader suggested he “would long it.” Analysts Forecast $4 For FET Crypto analyst World of Charts identified a “textbook” bullish pennant pattern on FET’s chart. The analyst expects an upside breakout soon, potentially leading to a 2x bullish wave. If the breakout is successful, the token’s price could move above the $4 price range. $Fet Formed Text Book Bullish Pennant Expecting Upside Breakout Soon Expecting 2x Bullish Wave Incase Of Successful Breakout #Crypto #Fet #Fetchai pic.twitter.com/Y3c0pqNFgN — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) May 15, 2024 Moreover, CryptoBoss seems to concur with this forecast.

42418200,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrD3,1715890057,LocalMonero Shutdown Is Another Blow for Privacy Tech,"As of May 14, all trades on LocalMonero have been disabled. And in six months the entire website will be taken down, parent company AgoraDesk, which is also winding down, said in a statement.  “After almost seven years of operation, due to a combination of internal and external factors, we have made the difficult decision to close our platform.  “We're extremely thankful for the love and support we've received over the years. We couldn't have done it without you. We love you all,” the statement read.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  As mentioned in the announcement, the peer-to-peer exchange created to trade the eponymous privacy coin monero {{XMR}}, LocalMonero has been around for most of Monero's existence.  Although AgoraDesk did not provide a specific reason for shutting down, it’s easy enough to intuit why. In recent months, a slew of P2P crypto trading platforms including LocalBitcoins and Paxful have called it quits – a trend largely driven by regulatory headwinds. To wit:  “Regulatory challenges for the industry continue to grow, especially in the paper-to-peer market and most heavily in the U.S. While we work through these issues,we have taken the most secure option and ask you to explore self-custody and trade elsewhere,” Ray Youssef, ex-CEO of Paxful, said in a statement at the time the now defunct platform closed.  Problems for LocalMonero were largely compounded by pressure from regulatory authorities on privacy coins. Crypto exchanges OKX, Binance and Coinbase have all proactively delisted privacy-preserving tokens like monero and zcash {{ZEC}}, leaving services like LocalMonero one of the few places to purchase XMR.  LocalMonero functioned a bit like Craigslist, providing a place where individuals could post an ad to either buy or sell XMR via a variety of different methods – essentially any payment method the counterparties agreed upon would work. One ad was for someone looking to trade cash for monero in person listed Detroit Zoo as a meeting point.  There was generally a slight markup on LocalMonero token sales because users were willing to pay a premium to buy the token on a platform that asked for limited identification (though it was customary for sellers to request ID as a kind of failsafe.) The platform also offered “arbitration bonds” that would hold an equivalent amount of monero in escrow so that if a seller failed to send the funds, LocalMonero could reimburse users.  Where to buy monero now?  LocalMonero has been “a cornerstone of the no-KYC Monero ecosystem,” semi-pseudonymous privacy advocate Seth For Privacy said on X, adding that with its closure monero users are left with few fiat-to-crypto rails for the token. It is an “incredibly sad day,” he said.  On Reddit and the LocalMonero forum, users discussed alternative means of buying XMR, which, with a $2.5 billion market cap, is the largest privacy coin. These include buying another cryptocurrency like bitcoin {{BTC}} or litecoin {{LTC}}, sending it to the privacy-focused Cake Wallet and then swapping for XMR.  The Bisq peer-to-peer network also enables swaps between cryptocurrencies into monero. Kraken also still offers monero purchases, though it excludes users from certain countries including the U.K. and Australia and will extend that list to Ireland and Belgium in June. Less secure buying options include purchasing directly from someone on messaging apps like Telegram.  For its part, LocalMonero recommended the non-custodial, decentralized exchanges Haveno Serai, which are open-source alternatives that have yet to fully launch. Haveno runs on the Tor network and functions using atomic swaps, while Serai will use a multisignature setup.  While the old adage that “if there’s a will, there’s way” will likely always remain true for those looking to make anonymous transactions is cryptocurrencies like monero, it is undoubtedly the case that blockchain-based privacy tech is becoming harder to access. And it’s hard to see this trend reversing.  But, every day the Monero network is maintained, and every day that XMR is used for purchases, is another day that proves the power and resiliency of decentralized systems.  “Feds really must hate monero.

27931114,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608400,1715889629,Why Is This Crypto Pundit Warning XRP Investors To Be At Alert For The Next 3-12 Months,"A crypto analyst identified as ‘Egrag Crypto’ has recently taken to X (formerly Twitter) to issue a warning to XRP investors regarding a potential bear market that could trigger a massive correction for the price of XRP. XRP Holders Prepare For More Declines In 2025 According to Egrag Crypto, XRP is expected to enter a steep bear market stage in 2025. The analyst based his predictions on a technical analysis tool he called the “Gaussian Channel,” revealing three distinct technical phases for XRP, including a Green A, Green B and Green C phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish He noted that the bearish phase in Green A had already been completed. However, the Green B phase is expected to end by June 2025, and Green C is anticipated to conclude by January 2025. The analyst further emphasized that the aforementioned dates do not represent cycle tops but indicate the beginning of a “deep bear market phase.” He also revealed that the Gaussian Channel was a technical analysis tool used to visualize price movements of cryptocurrencies around a mean average price. The purpose of the tool is to help identify volatility, risks, and certain support and resistance levels. Additionally, analyzing the historical trends and durations of the green phases provided by the Gaussian Channel provides valuable insights that can be used to interpret future price movements. Presently, the price of XRP has remained relatively unchanged for the past few months, primarily consolidating around the $0.5 mark without witnessing any significant momentum. This lackluster performance can be attributed to the ongoing legal challenges the cryptocurrency has faced with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the past four years. While Egrag crypto anticipates more bearish sentiment for XRP in the coming year, the crypto analyst also suggests that the next 3 to 12 months could present critical trading opportunities as the market evolves. He cautions XRP holders to remain vigilant and prepared for potential market volatility, which could lead to a “life-changing window.” Analyst Highlights XRP’s Resilience In a previous X post, Egrag Crypto maintained an optimistic outlook for the price of XRP. He emphasized the cryptocurrency’s strength and resilience, noting that XRP was indicating strong bullish signals in its price fundamentals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analyst Reveals Why $57,938 Is The Level To Watch This Week He revealed that if XRP can maintain a critical position within the “Launching Channel,” a trading pattern identified by partial wicking candles and ascending consolidation, the cryptocurrency could see its value potentially surging to $6.4. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Buy The Blood, Snatch Up 70,000 BTC At the time of writing, the price of XRP is trading at $0.51, reflecting an increase of 3.51%, over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Egrag Crypto has advised the broader XRP community to remain “calm and steady,” as the next three to six months could present significant opportunities for investors.

27928513,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608452,1715886013,QCP Capital Sees Bitcoin Reclaiming $74K Highs – Here’s Why BTC Could Continue Its Rally,"QCP Capital, a prominent institutional-focused firm, has recently projected that Bitcoin could revisit its peak price levels, potentially reaching up to $74,000 shortly. This prediction follows the latest United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which has significantly boosted risk assets. The firm noted that the positive surge in the market is partly due to the renewed buy-side demand, as evidenced by the buying patterns that resemble those of Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market makers. Related Reading: Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon? Institutional Inflows And Market Indicators Point To A Bitcoin Bullish Trend In a detailed analysis shared through their Telegram channel, QCP Broadcast, the firm stated: “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of 74k.” Substantial institutional interest in Bitcoin supports this sentiment, as large asset managers like Millennium and Schonfeld have allocated about 3% and 2% of their Assets Under Management (AUM), respectively, to spot BTC ETFs. The optimism surrounding Bitcoin is not just theoretical but backed by significant market activity. For instance, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US reached a two-week high of $303 million as of May 15th, signaling a robust renewal of institutional confidence. Fidelity’s FBTC fund led this influx with $131 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB fund, which saw $86 million, marking its highest since early March. Grayscale’s GBTC, which had experienced outflows for four months, reversed this trend with a $27 million inflow. Yesterday, May 15, the total net inflow of Bitcoin spot ETFs was $303 million. Grayscale ETF GBTC had a single-day net inflow of $27.0466 million, Fidelity ETF FBTC had an inflow of $131 million, and Bitwise ETF BITB had an inflow of $86.2578 million. https://t.co/npjWVH3bMi — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 16, 2024 Further underlining this bullish sentiment, Millennium Management holds a roughly $2 billion Bitcoin ETF portfolio, making it the largest holder of specific Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. Other hedge funds, including Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital and Apollo Management Holdings, have also disclosed significant holdings in Bitcoin ETFs, showcasing the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Market Performance And Future Outlook Bitcoin’s market performance has been quite notable. It has increased nearly 10% over the past week, including a 2.7% rise in the last 24 hours alone. QCP Capital attributes this trend to several factors, including significant “sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflation concerns, and the upcoming US elections,” all of which contribute to a favorable market outlook. The positive sentiment is also partly due to the CPI data released on May 15th, which met expectations and eased concerns about inflation. This is crucial as lower inflation rates influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates, making riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. James Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, also cited the Global Money Supply (M2) index as a critical indicator of Bitcoin’s price movements. According to Coutts, the M2 money aggregates, which include cash and checking deposits and are easily convertible near money, are central to understanding liquidity flows within the global financial system. He noted, “The money stock often moves in one direction, with significant drops like those seen in 2022 being rare and typically brief.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Free: Emerging from Bearish Sentiment, Crypto Market Optimism Rises Coutts predicts that any significant break above Bitcoin’s all-time highs could pave the way for it to reach around $150,000 in this cycle. He remarked, “Watch the 101/102 level on DXY. If that breaks, then we should see ~$150k BTC this cycle,” emphasizing the interplay between liquidity and market cycles.

42418201,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrF7,1715884632,Coinbase Shares Sink 9% on Report CME to Consider Listing Spot Bitcoin,"Shares of Coinbase fell nearly 8% on Thursday to a price of $202.49.  The drop came after a report from the Financial Times that futures exchange CME was considering offering spot bitcoin trading to its clients.  Shares of Coinbase dropped nearly 8% to $202.49 during U.S. morning hours on Thursday after a Financial Times report that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) might soon offer spot bitcoin trading amid strong interest from clients.  Cryptocurrencies were up on the day. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks 20 of the largest digital tokens by market capitalization, is 0.91% higher over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin {{BTC}} was up by half a percent as it continued to profit from Wednesday’s better-than-expected inflation report. COIN is up 29% year-to-date as crypto prices have rallied since the beginning of the year.  Chicago-based CME, with a history dating back more than a century, is the largest futures exchange globally and a financial powerhouse. Until recently, Coinbase profited strongly from being the most trusted crypto exchange in the U.S., but that advantage could change if CME comes into play.  The CME has been designated by U.S. regulators as a ""systemically important financial market utility,"" a designation that implies it's subject to more strict supervision. Many investors also assume that the designation implies the government would never let the CME fail in the event of financial duress.  CME is already the biggest bitcoin futures exchange by open interest in the U.S.  The exchange said that it has been holding meetings with traders who wish to trade bitcoin on a regulated marketplace, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times.  A common reason for traders not wanting to touch digital assets is the lack of trust in crypto exchanges, especially after a series of bad players were outed in recent years, including the once highly-popular crypto exchange FTX.  Recently launched spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gave traders a safer way to invest in the token, which over 500 institutions took advantage of within only the first three months of existence, allocating over $10 billion in the funds alone. The rest, over $40 billion, came from retail traders.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/16/coinbase-shares-sink-9-on-report-cme-to-consider-listing-spot-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe2b42d4ad0257a42ab52d39e8c7168e7112c703-794x447.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We are aware that the bonding curve contracts have been compromised and are investigating the matter,"" the months-old project's Twitter account announced two hours into the chaos. ""We’ve paused trading – you cannot buy and sell any coins at the moment.""  Trading has been paused for now, according to Pump.fun, but prior to the announcement, traders were left to speculate on what was happening on the platform.  Details of the attack were still coming together at press time.  According to people who are helping with the early stages of the investigation, an exploiter was using a combination of trading tactics to overwhelm Pump.fun and seemingly corner the market for dozens of meme coins. Oddly, on-chain evidence suggests the attacker was not making much of a profit. The people spoke with CoinDesk on the condition of confidentiality since the inquiries are still preliminary.  Pump.fun is a months-old project for creating and gambling on meme coins on the Solana blockchain. It advertises itself as a ""fair launch"" platform where investors can buy into joke tokens in their earliest moments. Coins sometimes hit it big for their investors, but most implode before they reach the critical market cap of $69,000 where tokens get released into the wild.  Thursday's exploit hit smart contracts responsible for issuing the meme coins on Pump.Fun curve, people said. The attacker tricked the platform's bonding curve into accepting phantom SOL tokens they had borrowed and quickly repaid in what's known as a ""flash loan."" This resulted in the bonding curves filling up with nonexistent SOL, making tokens look valuable despite no real buy-side interest.  The attacker has caused losses of $300,000 in SOL tokens, according to on-chain researchers.

27925886,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608409,1715882404,Whale Watch: Ethereum Fresh Buy Signal Sparks Speculation,"The Ethereum market has been a whirlwind of activity in recent days. After a brutal price correction last week, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has staged a mini-rebound, leaving investors wondering if this is the start of a sustained bull run or a fleeting flicker before another dip. Related Reading: Floki Inu Moment Of Glory: Analysts Forecast Explosive 200% Rally Ethereum Rallies, But Questions Linger Ethereum (ETH) surged 3.7% in the last 24 hours, buoyed by a general uptick in the crypto market. This positive movement comes after a significant price drop that saw ETH fall to $2,850. The recent rise has sparked optimism among some analysts, with popular crypto figure Ali calling for a potential “one to four candlestick rebound” based on a buy signal he identified on ETH’s chart. The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the #Ethereum daily chart! It anticipates that $ETH could see a rebound of one to four candlesticks. pic.twitter.com/Vg7FTl9X2a — Ali (@ali_charts) May 15, 2024 However, not everyone is convinced. A closer look at on-chain data reveals some conflicting signals. CryptoQuant’s data shows a sharp rise in ETH’s exchange reserves over the past few days, suggesting that investors might be offloading their holdings rather than accumulating. This is further supported by Santiment’s data, which indicates an increase in ETH’s supply on exchanges over the past week. The behavior of large investors, often referred to as “whales,” also paints an unclear picture. While Ethereum’s supply held by top addresses remained flat, suggesting whales haven’t made any significant moves, this could be interpreted in two ways. Some believe it indicates a wait-and-see approach from whales, anticipating a potential market top before re-entering. Undervaluation Hints At Potential Growth Despite the mixed signals, some metrics point towards a potential price increase for ETH. The token’s Network To Value (NVT) ratio, as analyzed by Glassnode, has declined significantly over the past week. Market Sentiment, Technical Indicators Send Conflicting Messages Meanwhile, adding another layer of complexity to the prediction puzzle is the current market sentiment surrounding ETH. While some analysts are turning bullish, evidenced by the rise in ETH’s weighted sentiment on social media platforms, technical indicators paint a less clear picture. Related Reading: Solana On The Brink? Price Stalemate At Crucial $140 Support The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) have both dipped recently, potentially suggesting a loss of momentum in the recent upswing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, however, has presented a bullish crossover, hinting at a potential continuation of the uptrend. A Potential Bull Run For Ether While the recent price increase and some on-chain metrics suggest a potential bull run for Ethereum, the conflicting signals from exchange reserves, whale behavior, and technical indicators make it difficult to predict with certainty.

The meme coin has also drawn the attention of crypto whales who have accumulated the crypto token lately. Whales accumulating the meme coin will suggest that now might be a good time to buy PEPE, but that might not be the case. Crypto Whales Buy 720 Billion PEPE Tokens On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain recently drew the crypto community’s attention to a whale who purchased 520 billion PEPE from the crypto exchange Binance. This move might, however, have been motivated by the fear of missing out (FOMO), as Lookonchain noted that this trader hasn’t always made the smartest investment moves, having lost $6.1 million so far. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Buy The Blood, Snatch Up 70,000 BTC Meanwhile, on-chain data shows another whale who bought over 200 billion PEPE tokens through the trading firm Cumberland. Irrespective of their intention, crypto whales accumulating a crypto token usually paints a bullish outlook for the coin in question. Based on this, crypto investors will usually assume that this is an excellent time to buy the meme coin in expectation of further price surges. However, this might not be a good time to buy, as data from IntoTheBlock suggests that a price dump may be imminent for PEPE before it makes another move to the upside. The market intelligence platform revealed that 100% of PEPE holders were in profit thanks to the meme coin hitting a new ATH. Given such development, many of these holders are expected to book profits from their PEPE investment, leading to a wave of sell-offs that could negatively impact the meme coin’s price. Therefore, those looking to invest in PEPE right now may be better off waiting for PEPE to bottom out from this selling pressure before purchasing the meme coin. Still Has Enough Bullish Momentum To Go Crypto analyst and trader Rachid Crypto recently highlighted several factors that suggest that PEPE has yet to reach its peak. The analyst noted that the “mega meme cycle” and altcoin season are yet to begin. These are events that could still spark a further rally in the meme coin’s price. Related Reading: How High Can The XRP Price Go? Crypto Analyst Unveils 6-Month Prediction Furthermore, PEPE is yet to be listed on major crypto trading platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood. That means there is still a lot of liquidity that could flow into the meme coin’s ecosystem. PEPE’s price will likely enjoy an upward trend whenever these trading platforms decide to list the meme coin. Meanwhile, Rachid Crypto also stated that Ethereum will surpass its ATH, meaning that PEPE’s price will benefit from ETH’s run when this happens. PEPE’s price is known to have some correlation with Ethereum’s and will most likely enjoy a significant rally as Ethereum’s price picks up. At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at around $0.00001056, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418206,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrJF,1715878142,"U.S. Senate Votes to Kill SEC's Crypto Accounting Policy, Testing Biden's Veto Threat","The U.S. Senate joined the House of Representatives on Thursday in seeking to erase the controversial Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crypto policy known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, though President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the resolution. The Senate voted 60-38 on the effort to overturn the policy, commonly referred to as SAB 121, though the crypto industry may not breathe a sigh of relief over the initiative's banking constraints, because Biden said that letting the rule be removed this way would disrupt ""work to protect investors in crypto-asset markets and to safeguard the broader financial system.""  A dozen Democrats voted alongside a majority of Republicans in favor of the resolution, easily giving it well over the simple majority of votes needed to pass. However, the resolution did not receive enough votes to make it veto-proof.  Even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) bucked the leader of his party in opposing the SEC's crypto effort, alongside other leaders in the Democratic Party.  Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who pushed for the resolution in the Senate, said the bulletin was ""a disaster"" that did not protect consumers.  ""This is a win for financial innovation and a clear rebuke of the way the Biden administration and Chair Gary Gensler have treated crypto assets and marks the first time both chambers of Congress have passed standalone crypto legislation,"" she said in a statement.  Issued by the agency in 2022, SAB 121 held that a company keeping a customer's cryptocurrencies should record them on its own balance sheet – which could have major capital implications for banks working with crypto clients. Republican lawmakers bashed the SEC for instituting a policy without going through the necessary rule process, and the Government Accountability Office agreed, finding that the regulator erred in how it handled what should have been a rule instead of staff guidance.  ""SAB 121 is non-binding staff guidance that, if followed, enhances important disclosure to investors in firms that safeguard crypto assets for others,"" an SEC spokesperson said in a statement after the vote. ""Time and again, we have seen crypto firms fail and watched as their customers lined up at the bankruptcy court in hopes of getting what they thought was legally theirs.""  For years, Republican lawmakers have fought with the federal financial agencies over the role of ""guidance"" documents, arguing that regulators stretch their authorities, and that the regulated industries feel they can't afford to ignore guidance, whether it's ""non-binding"" or not.  Read More: House Resolution to Overturn Controversial SEC Rule Likely to Pass in Senate: Sources  Lawmakers in the House and Senate went after SAB 121 under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn federal rules. A number of Democrats – including 21 in the House – joined with the largely Republican effort, defying the White House's warnings.  Rep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.), one of the architects of the resolution, called the vote a ""landmark result,"" noting the bipartisan support.  ""It is clear there is overwhelming opposition to SAB 121, and I urge President Joe Biden to reconsider his previous statement of intent to veto the resolution. The President should sign my resolution to ensure the SEC reverses course and sets America on a path to growing our digital financial future,"" he said. Because they sought to kill the policy with the Congressional Review Act, a successful reversal would – by law – mean the SEC wouldn't be able to pursue similar policies in the future, which the White House statement suggested ""could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets including financial stability.""  Rep. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.), who also cosponsored the House resolution, said the House ""never should've had to resort to"" the Congressional Review Act and reiterated his call to the SEC to withdraw the bulletin before it goes to Biden's desk.  ""Today's Senate vote to repeal SAB 121 sends a clear bipartisan message: Congress will not stand idly by as Gary Gensler and the SEC deliberately sidestep the statutory rulemaking process and overstep their regulatory authority,"" he said.  Apart from a previous crypto taxation provision that made its way into an infrastructure law despite the industry's resistance, this marks the first time that Congress has moved on an issue that focuses on the crypto industry, and it was in a way meant to aid the sector.

42418203,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrG9,1715878119,How MIT Brothers Allegedly Cheated a Noxious-But-Accepted Ethereum Practice for $25M,"They had it all planned out.  In late 2022, the brothers Peraire-Bueno – twenty-something graduates of Massachusetts Institute of Technology who had turned their sights on blockchain – embarked on an effort that ultimately netted them $25 million, in one of the most sophisticated exploits in a decade or so of frequent crypto exploits. At the outset, according to U.S. prosecutors, they outlined a four-step plan.  First there was ""The Bait."" Then there was ""Unblinding the block,"" followed by ""The Search,"" and ultimately ""The Propagation.""  ""In the months that followed, the defendants followed each stage as outlined in their Exploit Plan,"" according to an indictment.  The U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday charged two brothers, Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, for exploiting a vulnerability in a popular software program used by trading bots on the Ethereum blockchain, netting an estimated $25 million of gains during a 12-second exploit in April 2023.  Their father is Jaime Peraire, the former head of MIT's department of aeronautics and astronautics, CNBC reported.  How did it all work?  The exploit happened thanks to a vulnerability that the brothers discovered in MEV-boost, a piece of software used by roughly 90% of the validators that run the blockchain, allowing them to see the transactions in blocks before they were officially sent off to validators.  MEV, or maximal extractable value, is sometimes known as an “invisible tax” that validators and builders can collect from users by reordering or inserting transactions in a block before they’re added to the blockchain.  Sometimes the practice is compared with frontrunning in traditional stock markets, but due to the difficulty of eradicating it completely, the Ethereum community has more or less accepted the practice, and simply tried to minimize the deleterious effects.  One of those mitigating strategies is through the use of MEV-Boost, a software program used by roughly 90% of Ethereum validators. The idea is that all comers could earn MEV more equitably.  Such a this-is-just-how-it's-done attitude was explicitly acknowledged by the prosecutors in their charging document.  ""Tampering with these established MEV-Boost proposals, which are relied upon by the vast majority of Ethereum users, threatens the stability and integrity of the Ethereum blockchain for all network participants,"" according to the indictment.  Bots, searchers, relays, bundles and builders  On Ethereum, users submit transactions that are added to a ""mempool” – an area where transactions are in a holding pattern.  MEV-boost lets ""block builders"" assemble those mempool transactions from the mempool and put them into blocks.  Then, MEV bots, or ""searchers,” look into the mempool and assess which transactions could make profitable trades, and sometimes bribe those block builders to rearrange or insert certain transactions to squeeze out some extra profits. Ethereum validators then take those blocks from MEV-boost and ink them to the chain, where they become irreversible.  All these steps are typically executed automatically by the software in fractions of seconds.  What the Peraire-Bueno brothers did in this case was target three MEV bots who didn’t have certain checks in place, and set up 16 validators designed to entice the bots.  When the searchers bundle transactions together, they have a target transaction, a signed transaction before it, and a signed transaction after.  “The rules of the game are, ‘Well, I give you this bundle, and the bundle has to execute atomically,’ meaning it will only go if all three transactions are included in exactly this order, and any other thing than that, it's not going to work,” Matt Cutler, the CEO of Blocknative, a blockchain infrastructure firm, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Because the brothers set up malicious validators, their intent was always to seize on the opportunity to exploit the bots that did not have those checks, by pulling apart those transactions.  “Because the honeypot transactions were very lucrative, and the bots didn't have checks in place to prevent certain conditions from happening, and they fundamentally trusted the integrity of the validator and MEV-boost ecosystem, the malicious validator got access to signed transactions that were secured and they were then able to manipulate those signed transactions to drain the bots of $25 million of funds,” Cutler said.  'False signatures'  In its allegations, the government went out of its way to demonstrate that the activities – targeting a crucial juncture of the blockchain's inner workings, at a level that's technical even for experienced blockchain developers – diverged from the community norms, and into the realm of fraud.  Specifically, the brothers were accused of sending a ""false signature"" in lieu of a valid digital signature to a crucial player in the chain known as a ""relay."" A signature is needed to reveal the contents of a proposed block of transactions – including all of the potential profits contained inside the bundle.  ""In this process, a relay acts in a manner similar to an escrow account, which temporarily maintains the otherwise private transaction data of the proposed block until the validator commits to publishing the block to the blockchain exactly as ordered,"" the prosecutors wrote. ""The relay will not release the transactions within the proposed block to the validator until the validator has confirmed through a digital signature that it will publish the proposed block, as structured by the builder, to the blockchain.""  Based on their research and planning, the prosecutors alleged, the brothers ""knew that the information contained in the false signature was designed to, and did, trick the Relay to prematurely release the full content of the proposed block to the defendants, including the private transaction information,"" according to the indictment.  As Cutler put it, “Stealing is stealing, regardless of the terms that enable that stealing.”  “Just because your car door is unlocked, doesn't mean it's okay to break into your car, right?” he said.  Ethereum is often susceptible to some controversial MEV trading practices, like front-running and so-called sandwich attacks. But many leading figures in the MEV ecosystem view the exploit that took place last year as pure theft.  Taylor Monahan, a lead product manager at MetaMask, wrote on X that “Yes, if you steal and launder $25 million dollars you should expect to go to prison for a long time lmfao.”  “It’s a little bit robbing the robbers you could arguably say, but regardless it was clearly an exploit, a manipulation of rule sets, in a manner that is seen to be in violation of established laws of the jurisdiction, right,” Cutler said.  Almost to underscore the point, the government alleged that in the weeks following the exploit, Anton Peraire-Bueno ""searched online for, among other things, 'top crypto lawyers,' 'how long is us statue [sic] of limitations,' 'wire fraud statute / wire fraud statute [sic] of limitations,' 'fraudulent Ethereum addresses database' and 'money laundering statue [sic] of limitations.'""  The prosecution also noted that the day after the exploit, James Peraire-Bueno emailed a bank representative asking “for a safe deposit box that was large enough to fit a laptop.”  Read more: Brothers Accused of $25M Ethereum Exploit as U.S. Reveals Fraud Charges",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/16/how-2-brothers-allegedly-cheated-a-noxious-but-accepted-ethereum-practice-for-25m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb2f88265cdb09ae4e207c26234a55258fc942a6-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Technical analysis of the daily SHIB/USD chart reveals a descending trend line where price has been rejected on every single daily close for the past two months. However, today’s price movements have led to a shift. The descending trend line that previously governed Shiba Inu’s downward trajectory has recently been breached, suggesting a potential reversal or at least a weakening of the bearish pressure. Renowned crypto analyst Cold Blooded Shiller remarked, “One of the commandments of memes is thou shalt always long the meme when the trendline snaps.” One of the commandments of memes is thou shalt always long the meme when the trendline snaps pic.twitter.com/iPDpuX46ZH — Cold Blooded Shiller (@ColdBloodShill) May 4, 2024 Prior to the breakout, he noted, “In 20IQ szn you’re looking for 20IQ entry signals. Breaking the trendline that has been respected on every single daily close for the past 2 months will be one of those. SHIB starting to tick.” Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu to Soar 50% Amidst Meme Coin Market Rise The shift is supported by the positioning of Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs); the 20-day EMA at approximately $0.00002238 and the 50-day EMA at $0.00002131 which were both breached with yesterday’s daily close. Further down, the 100-day and 200-day EMAs at around $0.00001831 serve as significant support zones, indicating strong buy levels should any major retracement occur. The interaction of price with these EMAs in the coming days will be crucial in determining the sustainability of the current breakout. The application of Fibonacci retracement from the recent peak to the trough are also illustrating a pivotal development for Shiba Inu’s price action. The 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00002483, recently surpassed in yesterday’s trading session, now serves as a critical support in the short term. This level’s importance is accentuated by its role in confirming the legitimacy of the recent breakout from the descending trend line—a breakout that might otherwise be dismissed as a mere technical anomaly or ‘fakeout.’ Currently, a retest of this $0.00002483 level as support is underway. A closure of today’s daily candle above this mark would solidify the argument for a more sustained upward trajectory in SHIB’s price. Such a close would reinforce investor confidence that the breakout is genuine and that the market sentiment may be shifting more firmly to the bullish side. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Volume Flips Dogecoin, Will SHIB Price Flip DOGE If This Analyst’s Prediction Comes True? If SHIB’s price remains steadfast above this newfound support, the immediate subsequent target would be the $0.00002882 level, correlating with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. A breach of this resistance would likely set the stage for further gains towards $0.00003205 and $0.00003527, the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels, respectively. Reaching the 0.618 level, often referred to as the ‘golden ratio,’ could potentially yield a substantial 40% gain from current prices, offering a lucrative scenario for investors closely monitoring these technical cues. The heightened trading volume (+30% in the last 24 hours) underlines active participation in the market, crucial for supporting the legitimacy of the breakout. Alongside, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 55.05 indicates that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, leaning towards a neutral to slightly bullish position. This provides room for upward movement without immediate concerns of entering overbought territory. Overall, with the recent breakout above the descending trend line, Shiba Inu’s price action invites a bullish outlook, suggesting that the downtrend may be losing its grip. The key for traders will be to watch for a daily close above $0.00002483. A confirmed hold above this level could pave the way for further ascents towards higher Fibonacci levels.

42418209,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrNN,1715875200,Crypto Custody for Advisors,"Crypto custody can be a challenging topic, as there are many options investors and advisors face when considering the storage, security and accessibility of digital assets. In today's main article, Todd Bendell, from Amphibian Capital, discusses the different custody options financial advisors need to know.  Meredith Yarbrough from LaHoja Capital Partners answers questions about bitcoin custody and collateral in today’s Ask an Expert.  –S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Crypto Custody for Financial Advisors  In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, strategic foresight is a necessity. Financial advisors seeking to navigate this volatile landscape must understand the full spectrum of crypto custody options, balancing innovation with risk management to optimize client portfolios.  Self-Custody: The Ultimate Control  Opting for self-custody equates to holding the reins of responsibility. This approach involves securing private keys through cold storage – hardware wallets isolated from online threats. It’s a fortress of solitude for crypto, offering maximum security but requiring technical acumen. For the savvy investor or the privacy-centric individual, self-custody is best suited for those prioritizing absolute control over their digital assets.  On-Exchange Custody: Convenience with a Catch  The convenience of on-exchange custody cannot be overstated. Cryptocurrencies remain readily accessible, facilitating swift transactions. However, this method is not without its pitfalls—security is only as robust as the platform’s weakest link. Here lies a paradox: the more convenient the access, the greater the vulnerability. The collapse of FTX highlighted the potential vulnerabilities and the importance of selecting platforms with strong, transparent security practices and regulatory compliance. Advisors must thus choose platforms with military-grade security protocols, yet even the most fortified castles have fallen.  Off-Exchange Solutions: Institutional Assurance  For those managing substantial assets, off-exchange custody solutions represent a strategic chess move. This type of arrangement can include additional verification layers by involving a third party in the authorization of transactions, aligning with the stringent demands of institutional investors. It represents a strategic blend of old-world banking safety and new-tech efficiency.  Investing in Crypto Quant Funds  Venturing into crypto quant funds offers a compelling narrative. These funds utilize algorithms for high-frequency trading and other market-neutral strategies, potentially reducing risks through diversification and sophisticated strategies. This method can allow for diversified, long-term exposure to flagship cryptocurrencies while minimizing the typical complexities and risks associated with direct crypto asset management and custody.  Navigating the Regulatory Landscape  Advisors must also master the complexities of regulatory frameworks governing digital assets. The landscape is as politically nuanced as it is technologically advanced, requiring a judicious balance of compliance and strategic innovation.  Concluding Thoughts  In summary, integrating cryptocurrencies into investment portfolios requires a confluence of knowledge, strategic acumen and a keen understanding of risk. The paths of self-custody, on-exchange custody, and innovative off-exchange solutions offer diverse strategies that cater to different needs. Whether directly holding assets or investing in algorithmically driven funds, the key lies in leveraging these tools to achieve superior outcomes, reminiscent of digital assets’ ethos of bold, strategic innovation.  - Todd Bendell, co-founder and managing partner, Amphibian Capital  Ask an Expert  Q. What do credit fund managers look for when choosing a custodian for bitcoin collateral assets?  Credit fund managers prioritize minimizing business risk when selecting a custodian for bitcoin collateral. Since bitcoin collateral is typically held for the duration of the loan, custodians are evaluated for their long-term viability, including their audit practices and business continuity plans. Safety is also a key concern; managers assess both general safety policies and specific procedures tailored to bitcoin, along with any additional services the custodian might offer. The biggest challenge in choosing a custodian is lack of standardization as many institutions retrofits traditional frameworks to include bitcoin programs.  Q. How does custody of bitcoin collateral differ from traditional asset custody?  While there are shared concerns like cybersecurity risks across both traditional and digital assets, bitcoin custody carries unique challenges. For example, the cyber risks associated with digital assets can potentially translate into physical risks through the unauthorized access to keys. Competent bitcoin custodians mitigate this risk by implementing robust key ceremony procedures, where the keys controlling the assets are distributed across multiple geographic locations with strict protocols governing their access and use.  Q. Is it possible to insure bitcoin assets?  Obtaining insurance for bitcoin assets is possible, though not commonly practiced among credit managers handling bitcoin collateral, similar to the lack of standard insurance policies for traditional financial assets. Instead, managers rely heavily on stringent security protocols and existing regulatory frameworks to protect these assets.  - Meredith Yarbrough, Managing Partner, La Hoja Capital Partners LLC  Keep Reading  The state of Wisconsin disclosed that it had acquired close to $100 million of BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF.

The department published its 2024 ""National Strategy for Combatting Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing"" strategy on Thursday, outlining its priorities for taking on illicit financing. Treasury highlighted its ongoing work around crypto, including sanctions against certain exchanges and groups like Bitzlato and Lazarus, its settlement with Binance and its warnings about pig butchering scams. The annual document lays out how Treasury is looking at illicit finance and what role crypto regulations may play in tamping down on this issue.  Broadly, Thursday's strategy document said its four priorities are closing gaps in anti-money laundering regulations, supporting ""a more effective and risk-focused"" framework, boosting law enforcement agencies' effectiveness and taking advantage of technology innovations.  Updating existing supervisory frameworks for cryptocurrencies would support these priorities, the strategy document said.  This includes potential updates to the U.S. regulatory framework (for anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing) as well as working on ""global implementation of [Financial Action Task Force] standards,"" the document said.  ""Successfully applying the existing AML/CFT supervisory and enforcement framework to virtual asset activities requires that the United States allocate sufficient supervisory and enforcement resources and continue to invest in technology and training for analysts, investigators, and regulators to develop further expertise related to new technologies, including analysis of public blockchain data,"" the document said.  In a press call, a Treasury official said Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo and Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson have discussed the department's request for greater authority and oversight of certain crypto issues with legislators.

42418217,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrQT,1715873163,Crypto Community Voices Outrage at Tornado Cash Developer Verdict,"A developer of the anonymizing tool Tornado Cash, Alexey Pertsev, was sentenced to spend 64 months in prison.  Many members of the crypto community say the decision is outlandish.  'S-HERTOGENBOSCH, Netherlands — As 31-year old Russian Alexey Pertsev stood outside the courtroom on Tuesday awaiting a verdict from a judge at the s-Hertogenbosch courthouse in the Netherlands, he looked calm. When the judge ruled the Tornado Cash developer was guilty of money laundering, he did not appear to be outraged.  It wasn't until the Dutch police edged toward him that he seemed surprised he wouldn't get to say goodbye to his loved ones – to anyone – and was instead immediately escorted to a cell under the large courthouse while the police found an appropriate jail for him to live out his 64-month sentence. Spectators in the courtroom were dumbfounded.  Shock also rippled across the crypto community. Once the verdict was reached many took to X (formerly Twitter) to express their woes.  ""Wow, 64 months for developing software, that's crazy,"" one user wrote.  ""Sad day for privacy, crypto and open-source,"" Pablo Sabbatella, head of security research at crypto protection company Blockfence said, a view other users echoed.  ""This has gone too far,"" saidAlexandre Stachtchenko, the former director of crypto and blockchain at KPMG France.  ""Another awful decision that will ultimately harm all of us,"" another user wrote.  ""This is the battlefield for privacy, speech, individualism, and yes, crypto,"" Ryan Selkis, founder and CEO of market intelligence products provider Messari Crypto said on X.  A necessary step  The response, however, was not unanimous. Zumo founder and CEO Nick Jones saw the decision as a necessary step in crypto's development.  ""This is essential for fostering exemplary practices among all industry participants, ensuring a sector that people can trust,"" Jones said.  Regulators and legal bodies worldwide have been tightening money laundering requirements for crypto. The European Union recently adopted a set of anti-money laundering rules that affect the industry, while the U.K enforced a crime bill to help seize and freeze crypto used for money laundering and other crimes in April. Money laundering is the process of disguising financial assets to make them look legitimate.  The Dutch judge argued that Pertsev, who co-developed the anonymizing tool Tornado Cash, helped execute money laundering transactions.  ""It was Tornado Cash that executed the concealing and disguising [of] activities,"" an English translation of the verdict said. ""When executing these activities with cryptocurrency derived from crime, Tornado Cash carries out money laundering activities.""  To Louise Abbott, a partner at Keystone Law, the decision makes sense given nations' anti-money laundering objectives.  Tornado Cash is ""a very popular offering for those with something to hide because it causes massive problems from a compliance and regulatory perspective. Tracing these transactions is almost impossible,"" Abbott said in an interview over email.  The platform has been a key tool for North Korean hacking group Lazarus, which has been tied to a $625 million hack of Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network and other major crypto thefts.  ""In my opinion, the Dutch Courts have rightly found Alexey Pertsev, its developer, guilty of money laundering offenses,"" she said.  Not every lawyer shares her views.  ""It’s a harsh punishment,"" said David Schreuders, a partner at law firm Simmons and Simmons' Amsterdam office.  Crypto lawyer Fatemeh Fannizadeh told CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn that the decentralized nature of crypto technology called for a ""more nuanced legal approach,” than the traditional one.  Read more: The Hard Truths and Worrying Consequences of the Tornado Cash Verdict  What's next?  Pertsev's trial is not the only one related to Tornado Cash. Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, who also helped develop the platform, face allegations of money laundering and sanctions violations in the U.S. Storm is expected to go to trial in September. Semenov has yet to be arrested. Pertsev's verdict could have an impact on those trials.  ""The guilty verdict in the Dutch Courts will have persuasive power in the U.S. Presumably the Dutch Court held there was sufficient evidence to link Pertsev’s conduct to akin to money laundering,"" Abbott said. ""If those same links can be made with Storm, then that will undoubtedly help prosecutors in the U.S.""  It may not be over yet. Pertsev has applied to appeal the judges verdict. If his appeal is successful and a different verdict is reached, that new verdict could overrule the previous decision.  ""Any appeal would require Mr. Pertsev to prove that he as an individual was not responsible for the systems that allowed the anonymity of the Tornado cash programme,"" Abbott said.

This quarter saw 3x the transaction revenue. The company’s revenue tends to move with the price of Bitcoin. I believe that Bitcoin prices are only set to go higher from here. Coinbase has also made serious strides to expand its business internationally. The company has 6.5% to 7% market share worldwide indicating plenty of room to grow. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase ( COIN ) has recently reported earnings. The company’s stock is up 26.4% YTD and has more than doubled year-on-year. This article will examine whether or not this valuation is justified and if the stock still has room to run. End of Crypto Winter results in exceptional Q1 Coinbase had a great Q1 2024 where the company blew past analysts' estimates. The company’s total revenue for the quarter was $1.64 billion. This was 22% higher than the $1.34 billion consensus estimate and nearly doubled from the $772.5 million reported the same time last year. In fact, revenues have been accelerating these past three quarters as interest in cryptocurrency recovers. In the previous three-quarters, Coinbase had revenues of $662.5 million, $623 million, and $904.7 million respectively. The company also delivered with its bottom-line results for the quarter as well. Net income was $1.2 billion for the quarter and was much higher than the loss of $78.9 million recorded the same time last year. The company’s massive Net Income of $1.2 billion also included pre-tax crypto asset mark-to-market gains of $737 million. Even removing this “one-time gain”, Net Income for the quarter would have been $439 million, which is still a stark improvement over previous quarters. Recall that the company ended the entire 2023 with a Net Income of only $94.9 million. Massive Increase in Coinbase Transaction Revenue Coinbase makes the majority of its revenue from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions. In Q1 2024, transaction revenue was $1.07 billion, or 68% of the company’s total revenue. This particular portion of the company’s revenue is extremely volatile and is one of the main drivers of the company’s blow-out earnings this quarter. In Q1 of last year, transaction revenues were only $374.7 million, therefore this quarter saw an increase of nearly 3x. Stockholder Letter Coinbase Because of its reliance on transaction revenues, the company’s revenue is correlated with the price of Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as volumes tend to increase during a bull market. This pattern can be seen in the chart below where Coinbase’s quarterly revenues track Bitcoin prices. Data by YCharts I believe that Bitcoin prices are only set to go higher from here, which will bode well for Coinbase’s trading volume. According to an article by Forbes , there are many key reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin. The first is due to an increased demand for block space on Bitcoin’s network due to “inscriptions”. These inscriptions and the adoption of Lightning Network enable faster transactions, turning the cryptocurrency into a proper “mode of payment”. The second important catalyst is the Federal Reserve reaching the “peak of its rate hike cycle”. While inflation remains persistently higher than the Fed’s target rate of 2%, Jerome Powell has signaled that the “U.S. central bank should remain patient and let high interest rates do its thing”. Lower rates and a “risk-off” sentiment in the markets tend to do well for Bitcoin prices. The final catalyst has to do with Bitcoin’s recently concluded “halving” event, which reduces the amount of Bitcoin that miners receive as rewards. In simple economics, the less supply of something increases its price in the long run. According to Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick "" For 2024, given the sharper-than-expected price gains year-to-date, we now see potential for the price to reach the $150,000 level by year-end, up from our previous estimate of $100,000. "" These banking analysts expect the rally to continue into 2025, with Bitcoin potentially reaching as high as $250,000. International Expansion to Drive Further Volume Coinbase has also made serious strides to grow its business internationally. The company has made a push into Europe in 2023 and is continuing those efforts this coming year. In Q1 2024 approximately 17% of total revenue came from international operations. The company has been officially registered as a “Restricted Dealer” by the Canadian Securities Administrato rs ( CSA ), t he first and largest international cryptocurrency exchange to do so. The entry into the Canadian market would increase the company’s transaction volume, as the country is home to a “tech-savvy” population. The company’s foray into Canada is part of Coinbase’s larger international strategy of actively engaging regulators in order to properly bring in their services to a country. The company has also received regulator approval in the following countries namely France, Spain, Singapore, Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Coinbase’s approach is a huge contrast to that of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The former has taken a slow and steady approach to working closely with regulators and ensuring compliance. For example, when Canadian regulators required registration, Coinbase put in the work to make sure it is in compliance. Binance, on the other hand, ceased all its operations in Canada. Apart from that, Binance has recently been fined C$6 million ($4.38 million) by Canadian authorities for money laundering. Being part of a clear regulatory framework is a competitive advantage for a centralized exchange like Coinbase, as it assures traders and investors of the safety of their funds. In my view, out of all the large international cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase has done the best job engaging with the relevant local authorities. According to the company’s press release; A new survey Coinbase conducted in partnership with Angus Reid found that 72% of Canadians think that the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges is important. Nearly a third of Canadians (29%) said they would be more inclined to buy cryptocurrency if there was more regulation in the industry.” It is my opinion that people in countries other than Canada view the importance of regulation in a similar way. Therefore, when more “normal” people worldwide decide on a cryptocurrency broker, Coinbase could be a top choice given its size and scale and the fact that it is regulated by the relevant authorities. Valuation In terms of valuation, the company is quite expensive in the short to medium term. The company is trading at a forward ratio of 30.7x earnings. Wall Street analysts are actually forecasting slow revenue growth, as 2024 and 2025 estimates are $5.59 billion and $5.61 billion respectively. Nine Wall Street analysts estimate EPS to be $3.78 for 2025 translating to a 2025 forward P/E of 58.2x Seeking Alpha If you look at the revisions data for the last three months 12 analysts have revised their EPS estimates upward while 22 have revised their revenue estimates upward. Looking at Seeking Alpha’s quant revision grade, Coinbase gets a solid “A+”. Seeking Alpha There is a chance for analysts to upgrade these forecasts and for Coinbase to grow into its $49.8 billion valuation. The difficulty of meaningfully forecasting Coinbase’s revenue is that the bulk of it comes from transaction revenue, which is correlated to the price of cryptocurrencies and thus highly cyclical. According to a Technavio report , between 2023 and 2028 the cryptocurrency market size is projected to grow at a CAGR of 16.64%. Furthermore, Coinbase, according to research firm CoinGecko , has a 6.5% to 7% market share of worldwide Centralized exchange trading volume. This means that the company has the potential to steal market share from existing players in non-US countries. Spot Trading Volume Crypto I believe that the company can at least grow its market share by 50% to double as it expands to other countries. I believe that the company can 3x its peak 2021 revenue of $7.8 billion from international market share growth, the continued rise in Bitcoin prices, and more ""normal everyday"" people starting to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This will give Coinbase a 5-year long-term revenue forecast of $23.4 billion. Note that while this is an optimistic speculative forecast, it isn’t far from reality. In 2021, Binance was estimated to have revenues of $20 billion . Given Net Income margins of 25% and a P/E of 15x, this gives me a valuation of $87.7 billion or a price of $332.8 per share for Coinbase. My valuation target is close to the high end of Wall Street price targets for Coinbase’s stock. JMP Securities and HC Wainwright have market outperform ratings with a $320 and $300 price target respectively. It should be noted that doing long-term valuations for speculative companies like Coinbase means relying on a lot of assumptions. Truth be told, nobody knows what revenue will be like for Coinbase, as it is highly dependent on the prices of Bitcoin and by extension other cryptocurrencies. Therefore, these valuation estimates come with a lot of volatility and risks, as the low-end Wall Street analysts have a Coinbase price target closer to $200 per share. I have a “buy” rating on Coinbase stock, and I acknowledge these risks and the fact that the stock is on the expensive side. In some ways, a bet on Coinbase is a bet on the future of cryptocurrencies, on which I am bullish.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693871-coinbase-my-pick-to-take-advantage-of-the-crypto-upswing?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27918291.jpeg

42418198,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrC1,1715871902,Bitcoin Mining Cost Drops to $45K as Inefficient Miners Exit: JPMorgan,"JPMorgan estimates that the current mining cost for bitcoin miners is around $45,000.  The launch of the Runes protocol meant the hashrate didn’t immediately fall post-halving as expected, the report said.  Due to several headwinds, the bank doesn't see any upside in the bitcoin price in the near term.  The current hashrate and power consumption on the Bitcoin {{BTC}} network implies an estimated mining cost of about $45,000, down from above $50,000, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Thursday.  The bank said it had previously anticipated a significant drop in the hashrate after the halving as unprofitable miners exited the network. This is now happening but with some delay. The quadrennial halving, which slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply as miner rewards are cut by 50%, occurred last month.  Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain. The reason for the delay was likely the launch of the Runes protocol, a new form of token creation on the network, which triggered a temporary spike in transaction fees, the report said.  “This provided a temporary boost to miner revenue in the immediate aftermath of bitcoin halving,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote, adding that “bitcoin miners were able to offset the loss in issuance reward due to halving with the surge in transactions fees, keeping the block rewards for miners almost unchanged.”  “The boost from Runes proves short-lived, however, with users' activity and fees dropping dramatically over the past week or two,” the authors wrote, noting that “this highlights the ongoing challenge faced by bitcoin miners to maintain a sustainable source of revenue in particular in the post halving environment.”  Read more: Bitcoin (BTC) Fee Crash May Prompt Miner Selling, Analysts Say  As the Runes hype faded and the temporary boost for miners dissipated, power consumption on the network has fallen more than the hashrate, which shows that unprofitable miners with inefficient rigs have exited, the bank said.  There is also a feedback loop with bitcoin prices. ""The more bitcoin prices decline the higher the number of unprofitable miners that come under pressure to leave the Bitcoin network and the larger the resulting decline in the hashrate and bitcoin production [mining] cost,” the report added.  JPMorgan sees limited upside for bitcoin in the near term due to several previously identified headwinds, including a lack of positive catalysts and the disappearing retail impulse.

27917914,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608361,1715871635,Red Alert For Bitcoin: Network Hashrate Takes A 20% Dive,"The post-halving world of Bitcoin continues to throw curveballs. After a hashrate surge to celebrate the block reward reduction in April, Bitcoin’s computational power has taken a nosedive, dropping 20% in recent weeks. Related Reading: Pepe Power! Meme Coin Surges On Back Of GameStop Nostalgia This unexpected decline has ignited a debate among analysts, with some sniffing out a fire sale and others urging caution. Bitcoin: Hashrate Hiccup Or Miner Exodus? Hashrate, a measure of the combined processing power dedicated to securing the Bitcoin network, typically climbs after a halving event as miners invest in more powerful rigs to compete for the reduced rewards. However, this time around, the trend defied expectations. Experts like Maartunn, a pseudonymous analyst at CryptoQuant, believe this signals a potential “miner capitulation.” Less efficient miners are now likely throwing in the towel. The halving, which cut block rewards in half, squeezed profit margins for miners using older equipment. As these miners shut down their operations, the hashrate dips. Hash Ribbons Flash Warning Sign Supporting Maartunn’s theory is a technical indicator called Hash Ribbons. This metric tracks the difference between short-term and long-term hashrate averages. When the gap widens, it suggests a decline in mining activity, potentially due to less efficient miners dropping off. The recent hashrate plunge has triggered a spike in Hash Ribbons, historically a sign of miner capitulation that has often coincided with price lows for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Miners Selling Off? Further fueling the capitulation theory is a decrease in Bitcoin’s Miner Reserve. This metric tracks the amount of Bitcoin held in wallets associated with miners. A decline in the reserve suggests miners might be offloading their mined coins, potentially to cover operational costs or to exit the market altogether. Undervaluation Signal Or Cyclical Dip? Maartunn interprets these signs as a bullish indicator. Hash Ribbons often point to opportune moments to buy, he argues. Backing his claim is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which suggests Bitcoin might be undervalued. This metric compares the current market price to the average price at which all Bitcoins were acquired. A negative MVRV, like the one Bitcoin currently has, suggests the asset is trading below its historical cost basis, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. Related Reading: Buckle Up, XRP Fans: Analyst Eyes Price Explosion To $0.65 In Next 5 Days Not Everyone On The Capitulation Train However, not all analysts are convinced. Some argue that the hashrate decline could be temporary, perhaps due to factors like extreme weather events disrupting mining operations in certain regions. Additionally, the post-halving period is typically one of adjustment for miners, and a short-term hashrate fluctuation might not necessarily signal a mass exodus. The post-halving Bitcoin landscape is still unfolding. While the hashrate decline and other signs suggest a potential buying opportunity, particularly for long-term investors, the situation remains fluid.

42418208,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrKH,1715869247,"As a Pension Embraces Bitcoin, Hope Grows for Cryptocurrency's Long-Term Prospects Even Among Conservative Pros","Roughly 500 institutional investors revealed allocations into the spot bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter.  These included institutions of all sorts, with institutional advisers making up 60% of holders and hedge funds roughly 25%, an outcome that isn't normally the case after only a few months following the launch of a new ETF, an expert says.  One surprising investment came from the state of Wisconsin, which allocated $160 million into the funds, and could spur more interest from pension funds in the future.  Spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds debuted with a giant splash in January, quickly attracting billions of dollars of investment. But who was buying them and why have inflows stalled in recent weeks? Was it a fad that fizzled?  For those looking to get excited about bitcoin's long-term prospects among large, professional investors, a new data point this week made another big splash: The U.S. state of Wisconsin's pension fund disclosed in a quarterly filing that it had stashed about $160 million into bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Grayscale by the end of March.  Pensions are generally conservative with their investments and slow to embrace new things, and Wisconsin is not usually the land of flashy purchases. But if bitcoin is making inroads there – posting some of the investment industry's highest returns over the past decade no doubt helps – then there might be good reason to suspect the original cryptocurrency can keep expanding its investor base.  ""Wow, a state pension bought [BlackRock's bitcoin ETF] in the first quarter,"" Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in an immediate reaction on X. ""Normally you don't get these big fish institutions [investing] for a year or so (when the ETF gets more liquidity)."" He added: ""Good sign, expect more, as institutions tend to move in herds.""  Over 500 institutional investors held one or more spot bitcoin ETFs as of the end of first quarter, which is well above the average of 200 for a newly launched ETF, Balchunas pointed out. Almost all types of institutions were represented, including private equity, insurance companies, brokerage accounts, among others, according to Bloomberg data. Investment advisers made up about 60% to the total and a quarter were hedge funds. Balchunas said that seeing all types of investors represented in the first quarter is unusual and is normally not seen until years after the launch of a new ETF.  The biggest buyer turned out to be hedge fund Millennium Management, which allocated roughly 3% of its total assets into several funds, the majority into BlackRock's IBIT.  It is important to realize that 13F filings only tell part of the story, and don't give any insight into why someone made an investment. Not all of these are long-term bets or even investments hinging on bitcoin's price rising. Some are undoubtedly from trading firms' market-making businesses, positions held so they can act as the other side on someone else's trade and then likely liquidated quickly.  The filing is also backward-looking, and investments may have added to, reduced or completely reversed by the time the public sees this disclosure of positions held on March 31. Bitcoin's price has fallen since hitting a record high in March, possibly giving reason for firms to reduce their investments.  The biggest surprise might be that a pension was involved, given the industry's aversion to risk and the potential for bureaucracy to prevent embracing something new like bitcoin ETFs (though bitcoin itself is 15 years old).  In 2020, insurance giant Massachusetts Mutual bought $100 million worth of bitcoin and took a stake in crypto shop NYDIG, and the industry expected competitors to follow suit with similar moves – but that really didn't materialize in a big way.  The introduction of bitcoin ETFs makes it easier, though – even if it might take time for more pensions to copy Wisconsin. Instead of buying bitcoin directly and then sorting out how to hold it safely, an investor (large or small) can simply buy an ETF that holds it. ETFs trade just like regular stocks; administrative concerns like custody are minimal or nonexistent.  ""Pensions typically have highly rigorous due diligence processes, which means it can take time when deciding to allocate to a new investment – particularly one in an emerging asset class,"" said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store.  The allocation from Wisconsin's board of investors within only a few months of the launch of the ETFs shows that institutions of that size can quickly get comfortable with the structure and liquidity of these funds, he said.  'Wave of demand'  ""I expect to see more pensions follow suit, but it will be a slowly building wave of demand versus something that happens overnight,"" Geraci said.  Kyle DaCruz, head of digital assets at VanEck, one of the issuers of the spot bitcoin ETFs, said the recent development shows pension plans are now comfortable investing in digital assets. ""My assumptions would be that it will certainly help pensions and institutions get comfortable sooner, though I anticipate it being a relatively small number to start,"" he said.  A representative for the Wisconsin investment board declined to comment.  Pension funds are likely some of the most risk-averse investors in the industry as they are, by law, forced to ""minimize the risk of large losses."" Digital assets, some of the riskiest assets out there, are therefore not typically thought to be a great investment for retirement funds.  This is also one reason why investment giant Vanguard is not letting clients buy spot bitcoin ETFs as the company doesn't see digital assets fitting into a long-term portfolio, like a retirement fund.  News on Tuesday about the appointment of BlackRock's former head of ETFs, Samil Ramji, as Vanguard's CEO sparked chatter that the firm might change its stance on crypto, but Ramji said in an interview with Barron's on Wednesday that he has no intent of reversing Vanguard's decision to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.  ""Behind the scenes, I think a lot of investment committees at these bigger institutions are working through getting approvals for allocating funds to bitcoin. This sort of approval process doesn't happen overnight, however, meaning that it will take months and possibly years for this sort of institutional adoption of bitcoin to fully play out, but it's clearly happening,"" said Stephanie Vaughan, chief operating officer at Seven Seas Capital.  ""And, yes, it is different this time. With the stamp of approval not only from the federal government but also massive firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, the game has changed,"" she said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/05/16/as-a-pension-embraces-bitcoin-hope-grows-for-cryptocurrencys-long-term-prospects-among-even-conservative-pros,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48ec4835fdc339d8a02831f0362318f28c675584-1979x1113.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27915213,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608399,1715868028,"Why Did The Bitcoin Price Rise Above $66,000 Today?","Bitcoin recently rose above $66,000 for the first time since April. This recent price rally from the flagship crypto is believed to be due to several factors, including the recently released inflation data. Inflation Data Comes In Lower Than Expectations The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data was announced on May 15 and came in lower than expected. The CPI rose by 0.3% in April, against forecasts of 0.4%. The CPI data was also lower than those recorded in March and February, when inflation rose by 0.4%. Related Reading: How High Can The XRP Price Go? Crypto Analyst Unveils 6-Month Prediction Therefore, the latest inflation data suggests that inflation in the US might be slowing down. This development has provided some relief for investors, as the Fed is likely to maintain a dovish stance and consider rate cuts as inflation looks to decline. Lower interest rates mean investors will be more confident investing in risk assets like Bitcoin. Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s rally is recent reports showing that some notable institutions are heavily invested in the flagship crypto. Bitcoinist reported that the State of Wisconsin has invested almost $99 million in BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF. Hedge Fund Millenium Management is also reported to hold $1.94 billion across five different Spot Bitcoin ETF products. This presents a bullish outlook for Bitcoin as it suggests that institutional investors are interested in the crypto token for the long term. Meanwhile, from a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin also looked primed for this rally, with crypto analyst Rekt Capital revealing that the flagship crypto was out of the post-halving “Danger Zone.” Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also noted that Bitcoin was displaying a cup and reversal pattern on the weekly chart and added that the “breakout will be explosive and will send it to a cycle top.” What Next For Bitcoin? In a Telegram update, crypto trading firm QCP Capital stated that they expect this bullish momentum to take Bitcoin’s price to the previous highs of $74,000. They highlighted activity in the derivatives market and growing institutional demand as factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s rise to this price level. They also raised the possibility of this being the resumption of the bull market, stating that “the stars seem to be aligning on this breakout with significant sovereign and institutional adoption, abating inflation and upcoming US elections.” The trading firm added, “If this is indeed the start of the bull trend again, then this move could take us past all-time highs.” Related Reading: Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish Rekt Capital suggested that this might be the beginning of an upward trend for the flagship crypto as he revealed that the daily downtrend for Bitcoin is over.

Momentum in cryptocurrencies appears to be fading, potentially pointing to the end of the bull market. While some cryptocurrencies may have viability, I argue Bitcoin, in particular, is not a viable currency, inflation hedge, or a means of storing wealth. Cryptocurrencies are not a direct inflation hedge but a sign of rebellion against a precarious monetary system. Coinbase's valuation appears too high even if we assume strong EPS growth, giving me a long-term outlook depending on whether the current Bitcoin bull market ends. Coinbase ( COIN ) has been among the top-performing stocks over the past year, with a staggering 234% return. The company has rallied following the trend in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and others. In addition, its valuation has increased as investor sentiment surrounding the company has improved. I became bullish on COIN in January 2023, arguing that its low valuation, waning trust in fiat currencies, and Coinbase's higher security compared to its competitors (as a public company) improved its outlook. I remained bullish on COIN until December when I downgraded it to neutral on the view that Bitcoin's rally had become too mired in retail speculative exuberance. COIN rose by just over 300% over that period but has increased by an additional 49% since I became neutral. Those who've read my research know I am not one for fear of missing out. Indeed, I'd much rather miss out on gains than put my portfolio at risk. I invest based on fundamentals and macroeconomic trends and care little for what I feel to be emotion-driven speculation. Undoubtedly, most of the actively trading cryptocurrency market that Coinbase caters to is the speculative crowd looking for high short-term profits but not necessarily long-term portfolio stability and growth. This is important to point out as much of my opinions surrounding Coinbase are based on my bias toward fundamentals over technicals, though I aim to consider both. The momentum surrounding COIN, Bitcoin, and others is fading. The stock is down by about 25% from its highs. Bitcoin is down by about 12% and could either be in a consolidation pattern that may lead to new highs or has reached another cyclical peak. Undoubtedly, many speculators and investors in cryptocurrencies are lining up their bets. Based on my qualitative assessment of most vocal market participants, there is great hope and speculation that it will rise to over $100K after this consolidation. COIN's trend is closely tied to Bitcoin, so an outlook for the cryptocurrency market will be similar to COIN's. See below: Data by YCharts Even then, COIN is not performing as well as Bitcoin. Although COIN's trend matches Bitcoin's, how cryptocurrency prices impact its profitability is unclear. More importantly, Coinbase faces competitive factors that could upend its ability to keep up with the market. Similarly, Bitcoin faces competitive risks from cryptocurrencies that may prove to be more viable means of storing wealth or as a currency. With both in such a precarious position, it appears to be an excellent time to analyze the company and its drivers. An Outlook for Cryptocurrency COIN is driven primarily by cryptocurrency prices, so we cannot discuss its outlook without first assessing Bitcoin and its peers. I'll aim to do this without offending people, but the fact is that I do not believe Bitcoin is a viable currency or means of storing wealth. For one, most people think about Bitcoin in terms of how much it is worth in US fiat currency, implying many still care a great deal about its currency value then it. The same is true for gold, silver, and others, but in my view, not nearly to the same degree. Bitcoin is not very transactable, and transaction fees are usually very high and volatile. Its network processes between three and six transactions per second, compared to Visa, which claims to process over 65K per second. Adding on its lack of scalability and energy use, the argument that it is a store of wealth or an alternate currency falls short. Bitcoin is also not an anonymous or private way to move assets. Bitcoin is also not a true hedge against inflation or market risk. Its transaction costs should rise with inflation, as it depends indirectly on energy prices. Further, unlike gold, it has no strong inverse correlation to real interest rates. Real interest rates are rates paid on bonds after accounting for expected inflation. Low real rates signal a low time value of money, which should benefit inflation hedges like gold. That is likely not the case for Bitcoin. See below: Data by YCharts Of course, gold today is rising while real rates are high. Technically, based on real rates, the time value of money is so high that inflation hedges should be unattractive. However, as I've discussed, it seems the market is bracing for an inflationary rebound. Yes, that may fuel the speculation around cryptocurrencies. Still, the fact remains that none of the major cryptocurrencies have proven the same inflation hedge power as gold, which has hedged inflation since recorded human history began. El Salvador is trying to use geothermal energy to ""mine"" Bitcoin to use as legal tender. It will be fascinating to see how this experiment unfolds. However, I can't help but feel that power sources may be better used to create tangible physical items or resources for its people. To me, Bitcoin is fundamentally a digital asset with artificial scarcity. Its benefit to fiat currencies is that they cannot be printed. Still, they lack the stability that most central banks try to create and, more importantly, are terribly inefficient to transact. That said, I indeed admit that cryptocurrency may be viable if backed by physical assets like gold, thus solving gold's (or similar) translatability issues. There are some efforts to create gold-backed cryptocurrencies with provable reserves that have low transaction overhead and some privacy. In my opinion, that would be an ideal alternative to both fiat currencies and gold. Given my negative outlook for fiat currencies , based on global debt levels and social issues, I think Coinbase may eventually trade cryptocurrencies that could be viable means of wealth savings and exchange outside the traditional banking system, which I feel may be on the verge of significant pressure . Notably, Bitcoin and other significant cryptocurrencies may continue to rise in the current speculative rally. In my view, people are attracted to these digital tokens primarily as an act of rebellion against a monetary system that seems not to be working favorably for most people. As is often the case, it is easy to see the correct issues and hard to find the correct solutions. I think people buy cryptocurrencies because they correctly see the monetary issues today. However, that alone does not make the dominant cryptocurrencies today superior or viable; it only gives them temporary attractiveness that waxes and wanes with social trends. What is Coinbase Worth Today? When I became bullish on COIN in January 2023, sentiment surrounding the company and the cryptocurrency market was low. I thought people would flock to it because they saw that the monetary instability and inflation issues would not fade quickly and could grow. My view was largely correct, as 2023 saw bank failures and persistent inflation. In the future, I expect Coinbase and the other cryptocurrencies to reverse as speculators take profits and investors begin to realize that most of the dominant cryptocurrencies are not viable means of exchange for wealth preservation. Again, most people buy them and watch their USD price, implying they care about the USD more than using it as a hedge when the value proposition of cryptocurrencies is, supposedly, that they're an alternative to USD. Because enthusiasm remains strong, I would not be surprised to see Bitcoin hit $100K or more in 2024. I will not make that bet, but I would avoid betting against it or COIN as the apparent ""cryptocurrency collective consciousness"" seems quite eager to see a breakout. There is a 40% chance of short-term upside and a 60% chance of downside in the coming months, but an 80% chance of downside by a year from now. Those odds are only based on my assessment to illustrate that my position on Coinbase is based on a one-year outlook and not the short-term one, which many readers likely care more about. Still, the company's valuation is likely unreasonable at its current price. Based on two-year ahead EPS expectations, its earnings yield is 1.7%. That equates to a ""P/E"" of 58X. Based on two-year ahead expectations, its EBITDA-to-EV is 6.2%, equating to a forward ""EV/EBITDA of 16X. See below: Data by YCharts I'm using these ""yield"" figures because the charts go hyperbolic during periods of negative expectations. Ideally, even for a fast-growing firm, I'd aim to see a forward ""P/E"" of ~30X (3.3% earnings yield) (on a two-year outlook) and an EV/EBITDA analyst consensus , COIN's forward ""P/E"" today is 17X even using a 2033 EPS projection that assumes annual EPS growth over 10% over the next nine years. Under normal circumstances, a growth rate may not be feasible. It depends mainly on the company's ability to overcome competition and lower its operating overhead or raise its revenue without increasing its overhead. The company has decreased its OpEx dramatically in the past year, primarily by cutting R&D and stock-based compensation. That is the primary driver of its higher operating income. See below: Data by YCharts Its stock-based compensation is still high and could be dilutive if its market capitalization declines. Still, it is clear that the company's managers likely feel ahead of its competition enough that it can reduce R&D and improve its profitability. That is a good sign and will allow us to see how much profit the firm can create. Of course, its valuation still seems too high at its current and expected profit levels. My previous argument that Coinbase had a competitive edge was based on the then-recent failure of FTX, which I expected would encourage cryptocurrency participants to move to more secure and regulated exchanges like Coinbase. Coinbase is publicly traded while its peers are not, giving it more transparency that offers customers trust. However, that trust comes with a cost. Coinbase has higher fees than its peers, fewer options than many, and arguably worse customer service. Coinbase is often the go-to for beginners but is not necessarily the best choice for those beyond that stage. I'd also argue that others like Kraken, Gemini, and others have improved their safety and regulatory aspects over the past year following the Federal government's crackdown on the sector. No doubt, Coinbase is the dominant player, but I would not value it under the assumption that it will maintain its edge forever. If cryptocurrency takes off, traditional banks and other financial institutions will develop their own platforms. If it wants to create a competitor, Schwab ( SCHW )has far more income and market capitalization to deploy. As we've seen with stocks, competition drives fees down, potentially upending Coinbase's long-term income. The Bottom Line Now, some analysts I've seen value COIN on the assumption that cryptocurrencies will eventually replace fiat currencies, giving the company immense growth. To me, Coinbase faces the same issue as gold miners . Yes, a hyperinflation crisis would raise the value of alternate mediums of exchange (and therefore its sales), but not necessarily by more than the decline in the fiat currency. A hyperinflationary crisis would increase labor and energy costs, cutting profit growth. Quite frankly, it is impossible to value any company based on fiat currency failure because, in many cases, inflation will increase costs faster than demand and create added strain for companies trying to keep up with chaotic prices. Yes, Coinbase shares may be worth millions if the US dollars were replaced with cryptocurrency, but that is not meaningful if the US dollar is devalued by a million times. Thus, I value COIN on the assumption that fiat currencies will remain turbulent but not collapse. In my view, COIN's fair value is around $110 today. That price gives it a forward ""P/E"" of ~30X based on its two-year forward EPS expectations. I believe that valuation generously accounts for its growth potential. I am bearish on COIN and expect it will eventually trade at this price. However, I would not bet against it today as there is some potential that Bitcoin will break out to a new high under its remaining momentum. While I do not believe Bitcoin or most of the dominant cryptocurrencies are viable mediums of exchange or wealth storage, Coinbase is still valuable as it can trade alternatives that may.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693818-coinbase-cryptocurrencies-moving-from-new-paradigm-to-denial-coin-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27915259.jpeg

The undisclosed dollar amount policy was facilitated by blockchain experts from insurance broker Lockton’s Emerging Asset Protection team.  Fordefi, a cryptocurrency wallet built for decentralized finance (DeFi), is working with German insurance giant Munich Re, the companies said in a blog post on Thursday.  Facilitated by Kansas City-headquartered insurance broker Lockton, Fordefi’s wallet policy covers cyberattacks and things like internal fraud or collusion, as opposed to protection at the smart contract level.  The dollar amount of the coverage was not disclosed, but as well as the general level of cover for Fordefi’s wallet – which uses clever key sharing capabilities known as multi-party computation (MPC) – customers can top up with more cover from Munich Re on an individual basis.  DeFi’s fast-moving collection of decentralized, on-chain trading platforms has been described as a “playground for hackers,” making it a tough ask for even the most digital asset-focused insurer.  But Fordefi CEO Josh Schwartz said the new product had naturally led to deeper explorations into the DeFi arena for Munich Re, with more to come in due course. Schwartz was previously chief operating officer at Curv, the MPC shop acquired by PayPal back in 2021, which was an early crypto custody firm to work with Munich Re.  “The policy covers external cyber threats and attacks that would compromise the platform, as well as internal fraud or employee collusion,” Schwartz said in an interview. “[Munich Re] is not involved at the smart contract level, but is getting involved with the most active players in DeFi, starting with a framework that they are comfortable with, i.e. the security of the private keys and the wallet components.”  When it comes to smart contract risks, the blockchain lead at Lockton’s Emerging Asset Protection (LEAP) Sarah Downey said the insurance industry is moving in the right direction.

27911117,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608398,1715862652,"Dogecoin Successfully Breaks Out Above $0.153, What Next?","Bulls in Dogecoin (DOGE) seem to have stepped up their game as the daily price chart of the biggest meme coin in the world is trending positively, fueling speculations about an impending rally. Kevin Capital, a cryptocurrency market expert and enthusiast has offered insights on DOGE’s price action, confirming an effective break out for the crypto asset, as it surpasses the $0.153 resistance level. Dogecoin Surpasses the $0.153 Resistance It is noteworthy that the crypto analyst Kevin previously predicted that for Dogecoin to move higher it needs to break above the $0.153 level and the 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 4-hour timeframe. “When it comes to Dogecoin all DOGE needs to do to have a higher chance of playing out the potential inverse head and shoulders is a break above the 4-hour 200 SMA and the $0.153 level,” he stated. Related Reading: Unlocking The Dogecoin Code: One Factor Holds The Key To Its Next Ascent At the time, Kevin noted that DOGE has repeatedly tried to reach this moving average and has been turned down. Thus, should the crypto asset break out of and maintain this moving average, he expects an upswing to the $0.22 price level. According to the analyst, the development has successfully manifested today, as the digital asset has surpassed the $0.153 level and the 200 moving average. Given Kevin’s prognosis, Dogecoin will have to sustain this area to see a further upsurge. If DOGE manages to hold during any prospective backtest and thereafter, Kevin has placed his inverted head and shoulders target at $0.18 and $0.22, if it is within reach. The post read: Update on the Dogecoin chart. We have officially broken above the $0.153 level and the 200 SMA on the 4HR. We need to hold this area on any potential backtest and then .18 cents and the inverse head and shoulders target of $0.22 cents if right in reach. This accomplishment coincides with a spike in the meme coin market’s favorable sentiment, which indicates increased investor trust and interest in these digital assets. With breakouts and decouplings occurring all over the place over the past few days, meme coins had an eye-catching start to the week. Several Support Levels For DOGE And Their Significance Dogecoin’s recent price upswing has triggered an optimistic outlook from multiple crypto experts. Another analyst who has shared a positive prediction for the meme coin is Crypto Daily Trade Signals. Crypto Daily Trade Signals has delved into the current support levels for DOGE and the potential price trajectory following a breakout. According to the channel, the 50-day EMA at $0.1652 is serving as a resistance level at the moment. Should DOGE break past this barrier, it could trigger the start of a bull run for the coin. Related Reading: DOGE Price Prediction – Dogecoin Reaches Make-or-Breaks Levels Furthermore, the channel noted that the 100-day EMA around $0.1434 is presently offering support, indicating that DOGE has a cushion against additional drops. Meanwhile, the 200-day EMA is acting as a strong long-term support level at $0.1237. During the time of writing, Dogecoin was demonstrating an upward momentum of over 6% in the past week, trading at $0.1549. Its trading volume and market cap have both increased by over 11% and 3% respectively in the past day.

42418221,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcrUb,1715860860,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Tops $66K as Interest-Rate Cuts Loom,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin is priced at around $66,200, up about 6% in the last 24 hours, following its best day in two months. BTC rose more than 7.5% on Wednesday after U.S. inflation data raised the probability of an interest-rate cut by the Fed in coming months. Like other risk assets, BTC is sensitive to expected changes in the monetary policy of major central banks and rallies when the cost of borrowing is forecast to decline. Markets also expect the Bank of England and European Central Bank to cut rates in June. The broader digital asset market has risen over 6% in the last 24 hours, as measured by CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).  Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plans to offer spot bitcoin trading in response to demand from clients, according to the Financial Times. Already the top bitcoin futures exchange, CME is aiming to take on the likes of Binance and Coinbase, who dominate the spot market. “Crypto exchanges might lose some business with the potential debut of a bitcoin spot market on the CME, a global derivatives giant, as the present bull run is particularly driven by institutions, who prefer to trade on regulated avenues,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said. The spot trading business could be run through the EBC currency trading venue in Switzerland, the report added.  ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange associated with meme coin Shiba Inu has expanded to Ethereum layer 2 Shibarium. Users can now float new liquidity pools on Shibarium, allowing traders to swap tokens on the network and earn a cut of trading fees for providing liquidity. The developers said the increased use of the Shibarium blockchain for transactions will result in a higher burn rate for the SHIB token, reducing supply. The SHIB price has risen 8.8% in the past 24 hours, in line with the broader market jump. “The more transactions will run on Shibarium blockchain, the more the protocol will burn base gas fees which will impact the overall burn rate of $SHIB,” they said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows that on Wednesday the dollar value locked in the number of open PEPE perpetual futures contracts on Binance rose to a record $285 million. The futures are sized at 1,000 PEPE per contract.  The data shows fast money is again chasing meme cryptocurrencies as weak U.S. data has ramped up investor appetite for risky assets.

(Rating Downgrade),"Summary Driven largely by $19 million in accelerated depreciation of older machines, Bitfarms reported a $23.7 million operating loss in the first quarter of 2022. BITF has aggressive expansion plans and is guiding to triple the current level of exahash per second by the end of the year. While there is $124 million in balance sheet liquidity and no debt, unit economics of the underlying business will deteriorate in the next report. Bitfarms is looking for its 3rd CEO in two years, with the latest departure seeking $27 million in damages for claimed breach of contract and wrongful dismissal. When I last covered Bitfarms ( BITF ) (BITF:CA) for Seeking Alpha in late-October, I noted the company's mining efficiency, growth plans, and debt reduction. In the months following that note, BITF rallied roughly 200% from those late-October levels. While the company's stock is still ahead of the S&P 500 since then, BITF has lagged the sector leaders and even the sector itself, as expressed through the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ). Data by YCharts Again, BITF is still up versus late-October levels. But the stock has struggled to hold gains to the same degree as mining peers like CleanSpark ( CLSK ) or Marathon Digital ( MARA ). Each of which have given up less from recent highs than Bitfarms: Data by YCharts In this update, we'll look at the company's recently announced Q1-24 earnings, April production, and additional considerations to assess if the worst might be over from Bitfarms' stock price drawdown over the last couple months. Bitfarms Q1 2024 Earnings Report For the first three months of 2024, Bitfarms mined 943 Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). From this production, the company reported 67% year over year quarterly revenue growth from $30 million to $50.3 million. Despite the growth, this revenue came against $61 million in cost of revenues for a gross margin loss of 21%, or $10.7 million. Q1-24, $ in thousands (Bitfarms) 64% of cost of revenues came from depreciation and amortization. A significant factor in this cost of revenue number is about $19 million in accelerated depreciation as Bitfarms works toward replacing older mining machines. The company cites a gross mining profit of $29.3 million, or 59%. Getting to opex, we can see a 58% increase in SG&A from $8.4 million in the prior year to $13.2 million in the latest quarter - this was a modest sequential decrease. Q1-24, $ in thousands (Bitfarms) Total operating loss for the quarter comes in at $23.7 million. So even adjusting for the accelerated depreciation on machines, it was still an unprofitable quarter for BITF shareholders and one that has resulted in a 45% year-over-year increase in weighted average shares outstanding. To be clear, Bitfarms is far from the only mining company utilizing an ATM to grow production, but it's important to mention, nonetheless. Adding the company's $13.2 million in SG&A with the $61 million in cost of revenue and then dividing that figure by the 943 BTC mined in the quarter gives us a true breakeven cost close to $79k BTC. Stripping out the $19 million in accelerated depreciation and doing the same calculation again gives us a Q1 breakeven price of over $58k. And all of this production data pre-dates the block reward halving from April. April Production and Expansion Speaking of the halving, we don't yet have a full month of production data to assess in a post-halving world. That said, much of the impact from the halving on April 20th was nullified by a massive surge in transaction fees following the launch of the Runes protocol during the halving block. Even still, Bitfarms managed just 269 BTC mined during the month of April. Author's chart (Company filings) Zooming out over the last 22 months, April 2024 was the company's lowest month of BTC production, Bifarms starts making despite it also being the company's best month for exahash per second. To continue mining BTC at the level that it currently does, Bitfarms has to either scale EH/s faster than global hash rate or global hash rate has to come down as mining becomes less economical and weaker machines turn off. The company does not appear to be banking on the latter. Q1 earnings deck, Slide 7 (Bitfarms) Bitfarms is one of several companies that is planning to have an exahash figure that eclipses 21. Many of the other companies that are guiding for comparable production growth are starting from a larger EH/s position than that of Bitfarms. In my opinion, Bitfarms is projecting extremely fast growth as it is eyeing a tripling of EH/s per second by the end of the year. Frankly, the company has done a phenomenal job of paying down debt over the last several quarters and now has $124 million in liquidity between cash and BTC on the balance sheet. Personally, I'm of the view that scaling this quickly is probably a long shot given the growth trajectory that we've seen up to this point, but it's certainly possible if Bitfarms starts making distressed miner acquisitions. Possibly making that strategy a challenge is the situation with the company's CEO position. The Elephant in the Room Bitfarms CEO Geoffrey Morphy was terminated two days before the release of Q1-24 earnings. The company previously disclosed the planned departure of Morphy back in March in what appeared to be an amicable parting. Attributed to Morphy in the March press release: It has been the greatest privilege of my career to serve Bitfarms, our shareholders, and our employees. I am extremely proud of what we’ve accomplished as a team Things took an uncomfortable turn on March 13th when Bitfarms disclosed a two-day delay in the company's Q1 earnings release and the termination of Morphy in separate press releases. Evidently, the March parting announcement has not turned out to be as amicable as initially believed. Morphy has since sued the company and claimed breach of contract and wrongful dismissal. He seeks $27 million in damages. From Bitfarms: The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. Nicolas Bonta , Chairman and Co-Founder of the Company, has been appointed interim President and Chief Executive Officer, and will lead the Company until the executive search is completed and his successor is appointed. It is expected that the next CEO will be announced within the next several weeks. On May 15th, interim CEO and company founder Nicolas Bonta introduced the conference call and spoke very briefly. Chief Mining Officer Ben Gagnon and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Lucas handled most of the presentation and the Q&A session. So, for all intents and purposes, they appear to be the ones overseeing the day-to-day operations of the company. To this point, it isn't entirely clear why Morphy was leaving the company to begin with. He was promoted to CEO from COO in late 2022 after Emiliano Grodzki stepped down from the position. Not counting Bonta's interim presence, Bitfarms will be on its 3rd CEO in less than 2 years when Morphy's official replacement is found. I'm not of the view that this is a good sign. Closing Summary I'll reiterate something I said in my prior Bitfarms article; I really appreciate the current leadership's commitment to the core competency of Bitcoin mining. In this market, it's easy to be swooned by the allure of HPC services and generative AI. I'm not sure if that approach to AI, or lack thereof, has had any impact on why the company is looking for a new CEO. But in my personal view, I think Bitfarms has quite a bit to sort out. The company is planning what I'd call an aggressive expansion during a period of uncertainty for both Bitfarms and the unit economics of the underlying business. It's certainly possible the worst is priced in already here. But I see a company that is looking for yet another CEO, just reported another net loss, and is battling a very difficult post-halving mining fundamental environment that has yet to be reflected in a quarterly report. I think there are better options out there right now.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | SPONSORED,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693717-bitfarms-q1-2024-earnings-is-worst-over-bitf-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27909813.jpeg

BITO invests in bitcoin futures and has seen exceptional performance, slightly underperforming its benchmark index. Both BITO and BITI offer monthly dividends and can be used in a long/short strategy to hedge against bitcoin price volatility. Whatever you believe about Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), it is an investment that is here to stay. The hysteria over the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year led to a spate of Bitcoin ETF IPOs. As many as 11 new Bitcoin ETFs were introduced in January 2024 and a total of at least 35 new ETFs were launched in the first 2 weeks of January, according to Reuters. Several of those bitcoin-related ETFs were launched by ProShares, known for having one of the largest assortments of ETFs on the market. ProShares has been at the forefront of the ETF revolution since 2006, according to their website: ProShares now offers one of the largest lineups of ETFs, with over $65 billion in assets. The company is a leader in strategies such as crypto-linked, dividend growth, interest rate hedged bond and geared (leveraged and inverse) ETF investing. ProShares continues to innovate with products that provide strategic and tactical opportunities for investors to manage risk and enhance returns. ProShares currently offers 46 ETFs in various categories, four of which are ""Crypto-linked"". ProShares There are also four more that are Crypto-linked, but that are short (or ultrashort) the currency. ProShares BITO: Long Bitcoin The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) was one of the first ETFs available in brokerage accounts that seeks to correspond to the performance of Bitcoin. BITO does that by investing in bitcoin futures, rather than investing directly in bitcoin. If you are interested in taking advantage of the upside of expected Bitcoin performance without having to invest directly in the cryptocurrency, BITO is one option to consider. Furthermore, for income investors such as myself, BITO throws off some generous income in the form of monthly dividends (more on that later). According to the BITO fact sheet , the fund's inception date was 10/18/21 and as of 3/31/24 it held about $3 billion in net assets. Those assets are shown on the fund fact sheet and as of that date included the following: ProShares The performance of BITO over the last year has been exceptional, with a total return at NAV of more than 128%, largely due to the substantial outperformance in the first quarter of 2024. ProShares BITO has slightly underperformed the index that it tracks as a benchmark, the Bloomberg Galaxy Bitcoin Index. Comparing total returns for BITO against BTC using the charting tool in SA, one can see how BITO tracks the index but has slightly underperformed it over the past year. Still, if you would like to hold some bitcoin in an easily traded ETF vehicle and wish to collect some income in addition to the capital gains from the rising price of BTC, consider BITO for a long-term ""hodl"". Seeking Alpha BITO Distributions While BITO attempts to capture some upside from the price movement of bitcoin futures, it also generates a high yield income stream based on monthly dividends that are distributed to shareholders based on gains from futures contracts or swap agreements. The dividends are classified as ordinary dividends for tax purposes, as explained in the fund's FAQ : Each of the Funds gets exposure to oil, bitcoin and/or ether futures contracts or swap on an index of futures contracts, as applicable, by investing in a wholly owned subsidiary which, in turn, invests in such futures contracts or swap agreements. For tax purposes, each Fund recognizes any net income of its subsidiary, including gains on such futures contracts or swap agreements in which its subsidiary invests, as an ordinary dividend on the final day of the subsidiary's tax year. When paid to Fund shareholders, these amounts are characterized for tax purposes as dividend distributions and are not eligible for capital gains treatment. Other securities held by the Funds, such as U.S. Treasury securities, may generate interest and capital gains (or losses), which may also be distributed. For 2024 those monthly dividends paid out by BITO have been substantial as shown on the fund's website: ProShares Bitcoin Halvening Now that the bitcoin ""halving"" event has taken place, the price of BTC retreated from its most recent high of about $73,800 to around $66,000 where it trades today, May 15 after jumping 7% after the positive April CPI report . One reason why the price shot up so much higher in Q1 of this year was due to anticipation of the ""halvening "". Roughly every four years, the total number of bitcoin that miners can potentially win is halved (miners also earn transaction fees when building bitcoin blocks). This is intentional. Satoshi Nakamoto , the creator of Bitcoin, programmed the halving into Bitcoin's core code with the intention of creating scarcity over time. The explanation for the rapid rise in price is due to the expectation that there will be less bitcoin to mine, so the price will rise as a result of reduced supply and higher demand. The higher demand is already evident based on the number of new bitcoin ETFs that started up this year, fueling demand from investors who were uninterested before those ETFs became available. Inflation Correlation to Bitcoin Bitcoin prices are also expected to stay depressed if inflation remains higher for longer. Earlier this week, the price of bitcoin drifted higher as traders await an update on inflation data with hopes that the Fed will ease. Even though some feel that bitcoin could be seen as a hedge against inflation, the reality is that the price of bitcoin has shown to be highly correlated to the broader stock market and not correlated with the price of gold (as some had expected). This insight from Fidelity further goes into the expectations for the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies based on rising inflation. Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and arguably the most well known. As inflation rises, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) and other major central banks may be inclined to continue to raise interest rates or tighten monetary policies to slow the price rises. As a result, many asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, may see their prices fall. In fact, the price of bitcoin dropped below $60k at the start of May due to increasing concerns about inflation staying elevated. Therefore, it is really anyone's guess at this point whether bitcoin will soon resume its rise in price or continue to decline as interest rates remain higher for longer. In early May, JPMorgan noted that retail investors were starting to retreat from crypto, with significant profit taking in April driving down the price. Over the past year, bitcoin hasn't really acted as an inflation hedge, according to a report by Bank of America. In recent months, bitcoin returns have become more correlated with those of broad stock market indexes. This means that when markets tumble, the price of bitcoin tends to fall too. For example, after the Fed indicated that it would raise interest rates in early May, bitcoin plummeted in value alongside stocks. Bitcoin has been compared to gold, which is generally seen as an inflation hedge. However, the correlation between bitcoin and gold has been close to zero since June, meaning bitcoin's price hasn't moved together with the gold price. Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITI ) If you believe that bitcoin prices are likely to continue to decline and wish to hedge your portfolio with an ETF that offers a short trade option, you may want to consider a small position in BITI. In addition, BITI also pays a monthly dividend, although much smaller than the one paid by BITO. The BITI investment objective according to ProShares includes the following. ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to the inverse (-1x) of the daily performance of the Bloomberg Galaxy Bitcoin Index. Like BITO, BITI invests in bitcoin futures and not directly in bitcoin. If you do decide to purchase shares of BITI, there are some important considerations to take into account as explained on the website: This ProShares ETF seeks daily investment results that correspond, before fees and expenses, to -1x the daily performance of its underlying benchmark (the ""Daily Target""). While the Fund has a daily investment objective, you may hold Fund shares for longer than one day if you believe it is consistent with your goals and risk tolerance. For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target. These differences may be significant. Smaller index gains/losses and higher index volatility contribute to returns worse than the Daily Target. Larger index gains/losses and lower index volatility contribute to returns better than the Daily Target. The more extreme these factors are, the more they occur together, and the longer your holding period while these factors apply, the more your return will tend to deviate. Investors should consider periodically monitoring their geared fund investments in light of their goals and risk tolerance. Essentially, this means that BITI is not a ""buy and hold"" investment. It must be monitored frequently because the price can drop quickly depending on the price action of bitcoin. The BITI fact sheet includes additional information about the ETF. ProShares The performance of BITI has been unremarkable since inception, however, the month of April was favorable for total return performance as shown in this snippet from the website showing total return for the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year periods ending 4/30/24. ProShares The April outperformance is not surprising given the downward trend of bitcoin prices since the start of April. This outperformance over the past month can be seen graphically using the charting tool on SA, although it changed again on May 15 as the price of bitcoin reversed and shot up 7.5% after a positive CPI report. Seeking Alpha Did I mention that BITI also pays monthly dividends? So, in addition to capturing some capital gains from the falling price of bitcoin, the monthly dividends offer an additional source of income for shareholders. BITI Dividend History This snippet from the fund website shows the dividends paid out so far in 2024, smaller than the monthly dividends paid in 2023, but still offer about 3% in annual forward yield based on current prices. ProShares While the price of bitcoin is volatile and difficult to predict, the opportunity to hedge against losses in BITO by holding shares of BITI offers one strategy to benefit from the price volatility and collect some income along the way, regardless of whether bitcoin prices rise or fall. That price volatility was evident today when the price of bitcoin shot up over 7% to $66,000 after dropping to below $60k in early May. The price of BITI fell about -7.5% due to its inverse tracking of the BTC index. On a YTD basis, the price of BITI has dropped more than -40% after today's -7.5% decline. Seeking Alpha Risk Tolerant Investors May Benefit from a Long/Short Bitcoin Strategy If you are interested in taking advantage of the potential rising price of bitcoin while hedging against the potential losses from a sudden drop in price, you may want to consider a long/short strategy that uses BITO to take advantage of the long position (upward price movement) with a smaller position in BITI to capture gains from a sudden short position (downward price action). Both funds pay a monthly dividend that yields some additional income to supplement any capital gains captured by price movements in either direction. I would recommend a very small position of less than 5% of your total portfolio value due to the speculative nature of investing in bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693807-bito-and-biti-a-longshort-bitcoin-strategy-plus-income?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/27909488.jpeg

The suggestion was made to a government panel tasked with formulating policy for the Finance Ministry to consider.  India's markets regulator has recommended that oversight of cryptocurrency trading should be vested in several authorities, Reuters reported.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) suggestion was made to a ""government panel"" tasked with formulating policy for the finance ministry to consider, Reuters said, citing documents. It added that the panel could submit its report by June.  SEBI's position differs from that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which ""remains in favour of a ban on stablecoins,"" according to a person with direct knowledge of the panel's discussions cited by the report. The RBI has repeatedly said it views cryptocurrencies as an existential threat to policy sovereignty.  According to the report, SEBI said it could monitor cryptocurrencies that take the form of securities as well as initial coin offerings (ICO); the RBI could regulate assets backed by fiat currencies such as stablecoins; and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) could oversee insurance and pension related virtual assets with the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).  Investor grievances in cryptocurrencies should be resolved under India's Consumer Protection Act, the report said.  India is in the middle of national elections, with results scheduled for June 4. Jayant Sinha, chair of the parliament's Standing Committee on Finance told CoinDesk in December that the country is unlikely to bring a crypto or Web3-specific legislative bill anytime soon, possibly not before mid-2025.  India's crypto policy has largely been in the hands of the Finance Ministry, which has refused to say whether crypto is legal or illegal in the nation, while imposing stiff taxes on the industry.  However, signals of credibility change for crypto have been emerging.  Last year, the Finance Ministry led India's push as G20 president to frame global consensus around crypto. An official later said India would analyse and decide its own position on crypto in the coming months. Last week, a different ministry official said the registration of more than 46 crypto-related firms with the nation's financial intelligence unit signals a credibility shift, even if legitimacy falls under the purview of policy makers.  SEBI, RBI, India's Finance Ministry, IRDAI and PFRDA did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.

27906567,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608348,1715856623,Solana On The Brink? Price Stalemate At Crucial $140 Support,"Solana (SOL), the high-speed blockchain network, is facing a balancing act. While experiencing a short-term price bump, analysts warn of a potential plunge if a key technical level crumbles. Related Reading: Floki Inu Moment Of Glory: Analysts Forecast Explosive 200% Rally Bullish Flicker Amidst Bearish Gloom SOL’s price has seen a recent uptick of 3.60%, currently hovering around $162. However, this seemingly positive movement comes against the backdrop of a broader downward trend. Analysts attribute this shift to a change in market sentiment. Meanwhile, the altcoin’s RSI is 48, which denotes a neutral position. As a result, SOL has room to move in either direction because it is neither overbought nor oversold. A drop in trading activity has been observed, which is typical of periods of consolidation. A spike in trade volume following a breakout should confirm the trajectory of the trade. Lifeline Or Looming Abyss? Crypto analyst Alan Santana emphasizes the significance of the Exponential Moving Average 100 (EMA 100) as a critical support level for SOL.

In September and October 2023, price breakouts above the EMA 100 signaled positive market sentiment. However, the recent trend reversal has cast a shadow over this once reliable indicator. A Potential Price Plunge Santana warns that a drop below the current EMA 100, sitting at roughly $140, could trigger a significant downturn for SOL. This breach could instill fear among investors, potentially leading to a sell-off and pushing the price even lower. The analyst cautions of a possible plunge below $100 if such a scenario unfolds. Solana: Beyond The Technical While the technical analysis paints a concerning picture, it’s crucial to remember the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Short-term predictions based on technical indicators may not always hold true. Other factors, such as industry news, regulations, and broader market trends, can also play a significant role in price movements. Related Reading: Buckle Up, XRP Fans: Analyst Eyes Price Explosion To $0.65 In Next 5 Days For instance, a positive regulatory stance towards cryptocurrencies could boost investor confidence and lead to a price increase, even if technical indicators suggest a downtrend. Conversely, negative news surrounding a blockchain hack or security vulnerabilities could trigger a sell-off, defying bullish technical signals. The Road Ahead Solana’s future trajectory remains uncertain. Will the $140 price point become a launchpad for a recovery, or will it crumble, sending SOL tumbling down deeper?

42408208,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBTuO,1715856484,Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Slides to Lowest Since April 2021. Here's Why,"The ether-bitcoin ratio slides to a three-year low, extending year-to-date losses to nearly 16%.  Several factors, such as uncertainty about the launch of spot ETH ETF in the U.S. and the growth of Ethereum-killers like Solana, are responsible for ether’s underperformance.  The ratio between ether {{ETH}} and bitcoin’s {{BTC}} dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago.  ETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value.  The slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether.  According to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week.  Several factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor.  “The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the 'go-to' network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Coinbase Institutional’s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday.  Solana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum's market share.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors.  Approval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum’s native token, although it’s unclear when the SEC will approve it.  Traders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck’s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock’s application is June 23.  According to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security.  Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a ""lightning rod"" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots.  “Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB…) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented,"" Solot said in an email.  Solot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a ""perfect vehicle"" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Lastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/16/ether-bitcoin-ratio-slides-to-lowest-since-april-2021-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23345ae03c37a65ad25114a2297157859665febc-2710x1214.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Large asset managers like Millennium and Schonfeld have invested in bitcoin spot ETFs, indicating growing institutional interest.  Selling pressure from short-term is easing, some on-chain analysts said in a Thursday report.  Bullish sentiment for riskier assets following soft inflation figures could propel bitcoin {{BTC}} prices toward the $74,000 mark in the coming days as institutional demand continues to grow, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a note early Thursday.  The softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggering a breakout for BTC. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.  Such a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700.  “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.”  “Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added.  Multiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios.  Meanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data.  “Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.”  The firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements.  A breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said.  Higher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging.  Gill's online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/16/bitcoin-traders-expect-prices-to-hit-74k-highs-as-selling-pressure-eases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/680ae348a9eb3c484bac4bad48907c4d3fa18ee8-1438x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While some analysts predict a significant price jump this weekend, others remain cautious due to the coin’s recent struggles and the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Related Reading: Pepe Power! Meme Coin Surges On Back Of GameStop Nostalgia Stalled At The Starting Line: XRP’s Recent Performance XRP has been stuck in low gear, failing to break past the $0.54 resistance level for weeks. This sluggishness extends to the broader timeframes, with the coin experiencing a decline in the past month, week, and even the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5185, down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, but managed a measly 0.4% uptick in the last week, data from Coingecko shows. Weekend Surge On The Horizon? Coincodex, a prominent crypto prediction platform, stands out from the crowd with a bullish forecast. They predict a substantial price increase for XRP, with the coin potentially reaching $0.648 by Tuesday, May 21st. This would represent a jump of over 32% from its current price. However, even Coincodex acknowledges the potential for a different scenario. The report mentions the possibility of consolidation around $0.4952 or even a price drop if profit-taking intensifies. Legal Clouds Dampen Enthusiasm Many experts believe the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC is a significant factor behind XRP’s underperformance. The SEC alleges that XRP is a security, while Ripple argues it’s a currency. This legal battle has cast a shadow over the cryptocurrency, leading to investor hesitation. There is a glimmer of hope, however. The article reports that the lawsuit is nearing its conclusion, with a final judgment expected from Judge Analisa Torres this year. A definitive resolution, especially if it favors Ripple, could pave the way for a significant price increase in the future. Some analysts, as the report mentions, even predict XRP could surge to $47 during the next bull run. Weighing The Bullish And Bearish Signs The future of XRP remains uncertain. Coincodex’s prediction offers a ray of optimism for a near-term price jump. However, the recent price slump, ongoing legal battle, and cautious investor sentiment paint a more complex picture. Related Reading: Floki Inu Moment Of Glory: Analysts Forecast Explosive 200% Rally Looking Ahead: A Post-Lawsuit Future For XRP? The resolution of the SEC lawsuit could be a turning point for XRP. If Ripple prevails, it could remove a major obstacle to wider adoption and institutional investment.

27897934,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608315,1715845206,"Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon?","In a recent analysis, James Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, signaled a potential bullish turn in Bitcoin’s near future, attributing the forecasted change to shifts in global liquidity measures, specifically the Global Money Supply (M2) index which is widely seen as most important price catalyst. Coutts detailed this anticipation in a thread on X, where he examined the relationship between major economic indicators and Bitcoin’s price cycles. Global Money Supply And Its Correlation With Bitcoin Coutts’ analysis begins with the M2 money aggregates, which consist of cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money. He tracks these aggregates across the 12 largest economies, all adjusted to USD. This measure, he suggests, is central to understanding liquidity flows within the global fiat, credit-based financial system. According to Coutts, “The money stock often moves in one direction, with significant drops like those seen in 2022 being rare and typically brief.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Soaring Toward $84,000: Insights From Glassnode Co-Founders Currently, the Global M2 is neutral, but Coutts predicts imminent changes: “There is a sea of red across my macro & liquidity dashboard, but signs are emerging that this is about to change. Global M2 holds the key for the next leg of the cycle due to its high correlation with $BTC bull cycles.” The rate of change in M2 money supply is more critical than its nominal value. Coutts noted, “The chart confirms what our MSI performance table suggests: Bitcoin usually moves with shifts in M2 momentum.” He explained that despite the global money supply MSI indicator being in an uptrend, the momentum remains sluggish, maintaining a Neutral MSI. For a shift to a bullish MSI signal, an increase in momentum is necessary, requiring a combination of dollar depreciation, credit expansion, and increased government debt issuance. Coutts pointed out the crucial role of credit conditions, as evidenced by corporate bond spreads (BBB/Baa) compared to the US 10-year Treasury yield, which have historically aligned with significant inflections in Bitcoin’s cycle. “These spreads are currently narrowing, indicating that corporations are managing to issue and roll over debt despite the high interest rates resulting from the record hikes in 2022 and 2023,” he observed. Related Reading: $291 Billion Asset Manager Founder Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $420,000 Using the chameleon trend indicator on the corporate spread index, Coutts suggests a strategy: “Long Bitcoin when the index shows a bearish trend (red) and stay alert for potential trend reversals (turning green).” The Role Of the Dollar And Future Outlook A key to this cycle, according to Coutts, is the behavior of the DXY (Dollar Index), which measures the US dollar against a basket of foreign currencies. “The Dollar is range-bound. A break below 101 would be rocket fuel for Bitcoin,” he asserted, emphasizing that market sentiment on liquidity is often reflected in real-time by DXY movements. Coutts also touched upon the US debt situation, suggesting that without a conservative shift in Congress advocating for fiscal responsibility, more deficit spending is likely on the horizon, which could further influence liquidity conditions favorable to Bitcoin. Coutts concluded with a note of caution mixed with optimism: “While my framework needs 2/3 MSI indicators to turn Bullish for macro headwinds to turn into tailwinds, Bitcoin price action will probably sniff out this inflection in the macro before most indicators react.” His analysis suggests that if Bitcoin breaks above its all-time highs, it would be unwise to bet against it, anticipating potential climbs towards $150,000 in this cycle. “The DXY holds the key to the Bitcoin cycle as it prices in mkt expectations on liquidity in real time. And liquidity is coming. Watch the 101/102 level on DXY If that breaks, then we should see ~$150k btc this cycle,” he remarked. At press time, BTC traded at $66,090.

Increased transactions on the Shibarium blockchain will lead to a higher burn rate for the SHIB token, reducing its circulating supply.  ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange (DEX) associated with the Shiba Inu {{SHIB}} cryptocurrency, said Thursday it was live on the Shibarium blockchain, an Ethereum layer 2 built by the SHIB token team.  The developers said the increased use of the Shibarium blockchain for transactions will result in a higher burn rate for the SHIB token, reducing supply. The SHIB price has risen 8.8% in the past 24 hours, in line with a broader market jump. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the wider crypto market, has rallied almost 7%.  Users can now float new liquidity pools (LPs) on Shibarium, allowing traders to swap tokens on the network and earn a cut of trading fees for providing liquidity. ShibaSwap held over $25 million in locked tokens as of Thursday, data shows, with $1.7 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours.  “The more transactions will run on Shibarium blockchain, the more the protocol will burn base gas fees which will impact the overall burn rate of $SHIB,” they said.  Burns refer to the permanent removal of tokens from circulating supply by sending them to an address that no one controls.  Every swap and stake on ShibaSwap contributes to the ecosystem's growth as increased trading volumes bring higher fees for stakers and LP providers, developers said in an X post.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/16/shib-to-get-more-scarce-as-key-exchange-expands-to-shibarium,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34c55c659d9bf91784aaae54b465650cf8f37dd9-5616x3159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CME is one of the top bitcoin futures exchanges by open interest.  Futures powerhouse Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plans to offer spot bitcoin trading to clients as demand for the product mounts among market participants, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.  CME is already the top bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while offshore, non-regulated Binance dominates the spot market.  The exchange has held discussions with traders who want to trade bitcoin on a regulated marketplace, the FT reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the talks.  CME's spot trading business could be run through the EBS currency trading venue in Switzerland, the report added.  The exchange did not want to comment on the report.

42408199,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBTXF,1715842162,Coinbase to Target Australia's Self-Managed Pension Funds: Bloomberg,"Coinbase is planning to provide a service to target Australia’s self-managed pensions sector.  The exchange’s Asia-Pacific Managing Director John O’Loghlen told Bloomberg, ""We don’t see this as cannibalizing the ETF players.""  Coinbase is developing a service that will specifically target Australia's self-managed pensions sector, the exchange’s Asia-Pacific Managing Director John O’Loghlen told Bloomberg.  Crypto’s relationship with the pensions sector and retirees isn't exactly new. Self-managed funds in Australia have increasingly held crypto since March 2019. According to the latest data from the Australian Taxation Office, nearly A$1 billion ($664 million) is allocated to crypto. That’s a steep increase from only A$197 million in December 2019. Thousands of Australians who used self-managed pension funds to bet on cryptocurrencies have even lost millions of dollars, Reuters reported in March 2023.  “Self-managed super funds might just make a single allocation, set it and forget it,” O’Loghlen told Bloomberg. We are working on an offering to service those clients really well on a one-off basis—to have them trade with us and stay with us.”  Coinbase did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Crypto interest in the self-managed pensions sector may be driven by the recent momentum the crypto sector has gained after spot-ETF approvals in the U.S. and the likelihood that Australia, too, could see similar approvals this year.  “We don’t see this as cannibalizing the ETF players, but more a rising tide and a big enough interest for someone to come in through their own self-managed portal,” said O’Loghlen.

Weak U.S. data strengthened the case of a Fed rate cut in September.  The BOE and ECB are likely to cut rates in June.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} posted its biggest single-day gain in nearly two months on Wednesday as weak U.S. economic data raised the probability that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will join its advanced nation peers in easing monetary policy with rate cuts over the summer months.  According to data sources TradingView and CoinDesk, the leading cryptocurrency by market value rose over 7.5% to $66,250, the largest percentage rise since March 20. Like other risk assets, BTC is sensitive to expected changes in the monetary policy stance of major central banks and rallies when the cost of borrowing fiat money is forecast to decline.  Data released by the U.S. Labor Department Wednesday showed the consumer price index (CPI) increased less than consensus estimates in April, signaling a renewed downward shift in the cost of living in the world’s largest economy. The headline CPI rose 0.3% last month after advancing 0.4% in March and February. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3% in April after advancing 0.4% in March.  Other data showed that headline retail sales growth stalled in April, with the sales in the “control group” category, which feeds into the GDP calculation, declining 0.3% month-on-month.  As such, rate-cut expectations shifted significantly. Fed funds futures show traders expect the Fed to deliver the first 25 basis point rate cut in September. (This year’s summer is set to start on June 20 and end on September 22). The Fed recently signaled that it will reduce the pace of quantitative tightening, also a liquidity tightening tool, from June.  It’s not just the Fed. Markets expect the Bank of England (BOE) and the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut rates in June. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) and Sweden’s Riksbank have already reduced their benchmark borrowing costs.  Central banks worldwide are pivoting toward renewed monetary or liquidity easing, which is a positive sign for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, as evident from the chart below from the data tracking website MacroMicro.  The percentage of global central banks whose last move was a rate hike is falling fast, while the percentage of banks with rate cuts as the last move is rising.  In other words, the net percentage of central bank cutting rates is rising.  “The higher the proportion goes, the more central banks are cutting rates, which could help improve market liquidity. The lower the proportion, the less liquidity there is in the market,” MacroMicro said in the explainer.  Prospects for liquidity easing over Summer should support equities, giving investors adequate confidence ""to remain further out on the risk curve,"" according to broking firm Pepperstone.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/16/bitcoin-has-best-day-in-2-months-as-markets-anticipate-a-summer-of-easing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e0c63cfaf32c09f1513d135ba4f492bdedd627f-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There was a break above a short-term declining channel with resistance at $0.5025 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if there is a close above the $0.520 resistance. XRP Price Eyes Breakout Yesterday, we saw how XRP price started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price was able to settle above the $0.4950 and $0.50 resistance levels. There was a break above a short-term declining channel with resistance at $0.5025 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even cleared the $0.5150 resistance level and settled above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It traded as high as $0.5195 and is currently consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4980 swing low to the $0.5195 high. The price is also trading above $0.5120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Immediate resistance is near the $0.5185 level. The first key resistance is near $0.5200. A close above the $0.5200 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5220. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.5220 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.5350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.550 resistance. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.520 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5145 level. The next major support is at $0.5120. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5120 level, the price might accelerate lower.

According to Coinbase’s director, these numbers doubled the tokens created in Ethereum between 2015 and 2023. Related Reading: ‘The Dog Days Are Over’: Cat Memecoins Soar 16.1% After Roaring Kitty’s Return Over 22,000 New Crypto Tokens Created Daily Coinbase’s director Connor Grogan shared on X that 1 million tokens have been launched since April 1, 2024. The tokens created in the Ethereum Network account for 36% of the total number, with 372,642 tokens launched in the past month and a half. According to Dune Analytics, 327,553 tokens, around 88% of the total, were launched on the Layer-2 blockchain Base. The surge was seemingly propelled by the memecoin frenzy that has taken over this cycle. Additionally, Ethereum and Arbitrum saw a significantly smaller number of new crypto tokens launched, with 21,474 and 19,284 new tokens, respectively. However, Solana took the crown after seeing the creation of 643,227 tokens since April 1. Out of those, 464,563 are memecoins, per Dune Analytics. Moreover, Grogan highlighted that Solana registers an average of 20,000 new tokens daily. As reported by Solana Floor, on Monday, the blockchain reached a new all-time high (ATH) in newly created tokens, with 23,000. This could be attributed to the market pump propelled by the return of renowned crypto trader Roaring Kitty. Since his comeback to social media, several new memecoins have been created, and the top ones have surged. 🚨 BREAKING: Over 23K New SPL Tokens created on @solana in the last 24 hours, a new all-time high. pic.twitter.com/cn4ARy0KwC — SolanaFloor | Powered by Step Finance (@SolanaFloor) May 14, 2024 The crypto community reacted to the astonishing numbers, with many expressing concerns. One user pointed out that most of these tokens are “just spam to farm sniper bots.” He alleged that some people launch tokens “just to rug pull bots that auto-bought.” Another user playfully added, “The moral of the story is don’t buy projects created after February 2024.” This year, investors have seen many project launches promising big returns. Instead, investors have suffered rug-pull and other scams. Overabundance Of Altcoins? At the end of April, DeFi researcher and Web3 investor Thor Hartvigsen pointed out that while only four months into the year, the market had seen a massive increase in the supply of altcoins. As a result, this increase accounted for $8.6 billion in additional liquid supply injected into the market. Hartvigsen added that crypto projects will unlock $70.5 billion over the years, with many tokens launched in 2023 “also unlocking this year with many cliffs ending.” Moreover, the market observer highlighted that the average float in market capitalization and fully diluted valuation (FDV) for the tokens launched in Q1 2024 was just 13.6%. To him, this is only “the tip of the iceberg,” as the crypto market will continue to be flooded with new supplies and tokens. He offered a list of categories he believes will see the greatest number of new tokes this year. His list included Modular Infrastructure protocols, Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), Bridges and Cross-Chain Messaging solutions, and Perpetual Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes).

Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Is Still Near Historical Top Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the recent trend in the NVT Golden Cross for BTC and its implications for the price. The NVT ratio is an indicator that tells us about how the Bitcoin market cap compares against its transaction volume. The metric is generally used to judge whether the asset’s price is fair or not right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Form Capitulation Signal: What It Means When the indicator’s value is high, it suggests the network’s value (that is, the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (the volume). Such a trend implies that the asset may be overpriced currently. On the other hand, the low metric means the cryptocurrency’s price may be undervalued due to a rebound as the market cap is low compared to the volume. In the context of the current topic, the NVT ratio itself isn’t of interest; rather, it is a modified form called the NVT Golden Cross. This metric compares the short-term trend (the 10-day moving average) with the long-term trend (30-day MA) of the NVT ratio to identify tops and bottoms. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the past couple of years: In the graph, the quant has highlighted the two relevant zones for the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross. It would appear that when this metric is above 2.2, a top can be probable for the cryptocurrency as its price is overvalued in this zone. Similarly, the NVT Golden Cross being under -1.6 can lead to a bottom formation for the asset. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has ventured into the red territory for the last couple of months. Each time it has seen a decline out of the zone, it has followed up with another rise into the zone. As such, it hasn’t been able to visit the bullish region yet. At present, the metric has just made another exit out of the top zone, but its value is still quite near it. Thus, while a top may not be especially probable now, a lasting uptrend is also unlikely to happen. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Linked To Binance Vs Coinbase Battle, Quant Reveals It’s possible that Bitcoin won’t be completely out of danger of observing more price drawdowns until the NVT Golden Cross can see a decrease in the green zone. It now remains to be seen how the indicator develops in the near future and whether its changes will affect the BTC price. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $64,900 mark, up more than 4% over the past week.

27880006,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608285,1715821244,"Bitcoin Soaring Toward $84,000: Insights From Glassnode Co-Founders","In a remarkable turn of events, Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out of its recent trading range, recording a 7% surge in the past 24 hours alone. The cryptocurrency tests the $66,000 resistance level, setting the stage for a potential move toward higher targets. The latest momentum shift in Bitcoin’s price action has caught the attention of industry experts, particularly the co-founders of on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. According to their analysis, the trigger for a larger market structure release has been in the works since the March highs. Bitcoin Breaks Out The co-founders of Glassnode believe this breakout has been coming for a long time. They state that they have been waiting for the trigger to unleash a major bullish structure since the March highs when Bitcoin reached its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,700, and it looks like the market has finally done so. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu to Soar 50% Amidst Meme Coin Market Rise They believe the trigger was the recent lower-than-expected US inflation figures and weaker retail sales data, which could prompt a more “dovish stance” from the Federal Reserve. According to the Glassnode co-founders, this opens the door to a more dovish stance from the Fed. They explain that Bitcoin and the market liked this, and now they expect the price to reach $66,000 before $69,000 and then up towards $84,000. They also believe the altcoins will follow this move strongly. However, not all analysts are as bullish in the immediate term. Crypto trader and analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin needs to hold the $65,000 level as new support, cautioning that the $68,000 and $73,000 price levels could act as resistance and liquidity pockets. He warns that if Bitcoin loses the $65,000 support, it’s back to the “chopfest” – further consolidation and volatility. Andrew Tate Considers Dumping Fiat For BTC In a surprising move, popular internet personality and self-proclaimed “Top G” Andrew Tate has announced his intention to abandon fiat currency and invest over $100 million into Bitcoin. In a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Tate declared, “I’m about to leave fiat completely and ape over 100M into BTC.” Tate, who has faced numerous legal issues and has been banned from several social media platforms, cited his frustrations with the traditional banking system and fiat currency as the driving force behind this potential decision. “I’m done with the banks. I’m done with their money. Done with the scams,” he wrote in the post. Related Reading: Ethereum Bull Flag Breakout: ATH On The Horizon As Major Metrics Turn Bullish In a follow-up post, Tate acknowledged that he has not finalized this decision, as he currently holds more cryptocurrency than fiat currency in his portfolio. However, he hinted that he might “leave fiat completely,” suggesting that his preference for Bitcoin and other digital assets is growing. As of press time, Bitcoin is testing the $65,900 mark, having regained its bullish momentum. It remains to be seen how far the current rally can extend and whether the bullish momentum can survive potential selling pressure at higher price levels.

Analysts have been closely monitoring various technical indicators, and one such analyst, Ali, has highlighted a key signal that points to an impending price surge. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Anticipates Upside Break To Shift Sentiment Towards Bullish TD Sequential Signals Buy As Ethereum Eyes Recovery According to Ali’s social media platform X analysis, the TD Sequential indicator on Ethereum’s daily chart has issued a strong buy signal, hinting at a possible upward movement lasting one to four candlesticks.

However, Ethereum remains below the critical $3,000 mark. Despite the optimistic technical signals, external factors such as regulatory challenges could influence Ethereum’s trajectory. Specifically, the potential decline of the spot Ethereum ETF application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a concern, as analysts like Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg suggest that the SEC’s view of ETH as a security could significantly lower the chances of ETF approval. TLDR: the SEC asked commenters re the Eth spot ETFs whether these filers have properly filed their ETF listing proposals as commodities.

The options market, in particular, shows a clear preference for calls over puts, indicating that traders are betting on Ethereum’s price increase. Data from Deribit, a leading crypto options exchange, reveals that the most popular strike price among these bullish bets is an ambitious $6,500. This concentration of call options, especially those above the $3,600 mark, suggests that a significant portion of the market expects Ethereum to reach higher levels by the end of June. In contrast, According to a recent NBTC analysis, Ethereum’s failure to breach the $2,925 resistance level could trigger another price decline. Initial support is located near the $2,880 level, followed by major support at the $2,860 zone.
