42427074,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJysrh,1472835023,The Fight for On-Blockchain Bitcoin Scaling Soldiers On,"A web conference this week found a notable selection of industry thought leaders exploring lesser-publicized challenges and solutions for bitcoin scaling.  Following a longer conference in June, Tuesday's ""encore edition"" of OnChain Scaling saw presentations from Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik; Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer; and Berger Singerman counsel Andrew Hinkes. A byproduct of the long-running block size debate, the event has emerged as a way to highlight proposed technical changes designed to be made to the bitcoin blockchain directly, rather than through a top-layer solution.  Though a topic of controversy, the latter path to expanding the network has proved the preferred choice for Bitcoin Core, the network’s largely volunteer developer group. To date, these members of the development community have largely promoted and prioritized efforts such as sidechains and the Lightning Network, which would move transactions off of the main blockchain to achieve greater transaction capacity.  In this light, it was perhaps Garzik who criticized Bitcoin Core's approach most strongly, arguing it goes so far as to be undemocratic. By not proposing changes to network participants in a way that allows them to select from two versions of the blockchain, he asserted that Bitcoin Core has become a central authority for decision-making.  Garzik told the audience:  ""A tiny few choosing bitcoin economics is anti bitcoin's ethos.""  Garzik's statements give voice to some in the bitcoin community who argue that the in-progress top-level networks might not work as well as planned, and that on-chain solutions, while more difficult to engineer, are equally worthy of exploration.  While on-chain scaling advocates are perhaps best-known for advocating for an increase to the block size, the three talks offered diverse views on bitcoin’s challenges, touching on alternative bitcoin protocols and the legality of ethereum's recent hard fork.  Soft fork skepticism  Overall, Garzik's presentation cautioned that the community should not grow too comfortable with the current favored way of making changes to the bitcoin network.  Whether to help scale or make some other upgrade to the network, there are two ways that developers can change bitcoin’s rules: hard forks and soft forks. Garzik argued that soft forks are not necessarily a superior alternative to hard forks, as many developers have argued.  To make his point, Garzik pointed to Segregated Witness, a popular scaling solution that's currently being rolled out in bitcoin. He agreed that SegWit is a useful change, but argued that it’s perhaps overly complex, and that it should be added in a way that bitcoin users have a way to voice their opinion.  As an example, he noted that SegWit would introduce a more complex fee structure than currently in place, a development that wallet developers like BitGo's Jameson Lopp acknowledged in the talk's question-and-answer session.  Garzik went as far as to argue a goal of the community should be to completely remove developers from the decision-making process to deal with this issue.  ""Decisions made by humans should be replaced by algorithms as soon as possible,"" he said.  'Scientific; approach  In another segment, Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer outlined his project Bitcoin-NG, an alternative version bitcoin protocol he proposed in 2015, and many of Sirer’s comments were directed towards the aforementioned block size debate.  Sirer called Bitcoin-NG the ""third way"" and ""a path out of the morass"" in the debate, which has split the community between those who want to see an increase in the block size and those who want to scale transactions via other means.  He further offered advice on how he believes developers could best to determine whether to incorporate a change to bitcoin, scaling-related or otherwise. (How best to decide whether a change is good or bad has been in question the block size debate).  Sirer argued that an emphasis on science was missing from community discussions, and pointed to Cornell's cryptocurrency research arm's effort to test alternative protocols on a copy of the bitcoin network that’s low-cost to maintain.  ""We cannot rely on gut feelings and vague concerns,"" he said.  The noted academic suggested that Cornell's testbed platform, 'Miniature World', could come to advance discussions, as it uses 1,000 nodes to test theoretical advancements.  Sirer said:  ""Ultimately, the goal is for every bitcoin node that anybody runs out there, we’d like to have a virtual copy of it in the basement of the Cornell computer science department.""  Sirer argued that this way of testing code changes is more efficient, realistic and easier, as it removes costs associated with mining, uses copies of real-world data and doesn't require potentially damaging test features to be implemented on an active blockchain.

42427071,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJysjh,1472833615,California Pension Fund Considers Blockchain Opportunities,"Board members of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) recently took part in a discussion on blockchain technology as part of a broader conversation about future investment opportunities.  The meeting  is notable given the size of CalPERS, which manages just over $300bn in assets, making it the largest public pension fund of its kind in the US.  As previously reported by journalist Brian Cohen, the meeting (which took place in late July) featured a presentation by Jesse McWaters of the World Economic Forum. McWaters provided an expansive look at the current pace of development around the blockchain and FinTech, followed by a question-and-answer session from attendees.  Interestingly, CalPERS itself already has some exposure to the bitcoin and blockchain industry, albeit indirectly.  In 2009, the pension fund invested $200m in Kholsa Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital fund, and gave an additional $60m to a seed stage-focused fund run by Kholsa. Just over two years ago, Kholsa led a funding round for blockchain startup Chain, and the fund has also invested in Blockstream, 21 Inc and BlockScore.  Other public pension funds outside of the US have explored investments in the space. Earlier this year, the venture arm of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) took part in a funding round for VC firm Digital Currency Group.  Whether CalPERS moves to more directly invest in the industry remains to be seen. However, recent reporting suggests that the pension fund hasn't had the best luck with its venture capital efforts. Struggling performance overall may dampen its appetite for riskier investments amid poor economic conditions.

42427070,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyslh,1472826904,China Merchants Bank Joins R3 Blockchain Consortium,"China Merchants Bank has become the latest Asia-based bank to join the R3 blockchain consortium.  The commercial bank, founded in the late 1980s, is the second financial firm in China to join the initiative. In June, insurance giant Ping An announced its membership, signaling the group's growing interest in Asia.  The bank, which claims to hold more than ¥2.6tn (roughly $390bn) in assets, has offices in both China and abroad, including one in New York where R3 is headquartered.  In statements, Tianhong Zhou, IT general manager for China Merchants Bank, expressed his enthusiasm for the project, stating that he believes blockchain holds ""great potential"" for the financial industry.  He added:  ""We look forward to working together with R3 to deliver the innovation required to improve a range of financial services and processes.""

42427075,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJysth,1472821299,Bitfinex Reimburses First Bitcoin Exchange Hack Victims,"Bitfinex has reimbursed its first wave of customers.  Announced 1st September, the Hong Kong bitcoin exchange revealed it had purchased more than 1% of the blockchain debt tokens it issued to users in August as a way to pay them back for losses it incurred in a debilitating hack.  While a small step to recovery, analysts were largely positive about the move due in large part to the exchange's decision to purchase the tokens at an above-market value of $1 each, roughly double the market value when the redemption took place.  Since the company's issuance, the value of the tokens has fluctuated, but it has never approached the $1 mark promised by the exchange, sparking prominent concerns it would seek to buy back its own liabilities at a discounted market rate.  However, many still harbor doubts about the exchange, which lost roughly 120,000 BTC ($70m) in a security breach, and how it will navigate its complicated financial situation going forward.  While analysts said Bitfinex's efforts thus far are ""respectable"", others argue the markets will need to wait and see whether the exchange is committed to ""a full recovery of lost coins"".  Response reviewed  To rewind, the buyback is perhaps the most significant of a series of small steps made by Bitfinex since it temporarily halted trading and withdrawals last month and ultimately issued its own debt tokens on a blockchain.  The exchange first announced plans to generalize the financial loss it suffered in the hack across all customer accounts nearly a month ago. In exchange for the 36% haircut, Bitfinex provided accountholders with blockchain assets called BFX tokens.  At the time, the exchange stated BFX tokens could either be redeemed by Bitfinex or converted to equity in its parent company, iFinex, though many doubted the claim and its legality.  Yet, Bitfinex's decision this week ""instills more trust and allows them to simultaneously develop the BFX marketplace"", said Rik Willard, founder of and managing director of Agentic Group LLC.  Willard is not the only analyst who noted the redemption’s impact on the appeal of BFX tokens. Elsewhere, cryptocurrency investment fund manager Jacob Eliosoff emphasized that the market ""is liking"" the redemption.  He pointed to the token’s climb in value during yesterday's trading from $0.50 to $0.57 as a sign this assertion is correct.  Concerns linger  However, Eliosoff emphasized that he is more troubled about what he sees as a lack of transparency by the exchange in the wake of the hack. As reported last week, the exchange is reportedly still investigating the incident, though no loss report has yet been issued.  Other information has been scarce, as noted by Eliosoff.  ""If their plan is to buy back the BFX in dribs and drabs like this, why not announce it? How did these funds suddenly become available?"" he told CoinDesk.  He noted that Bitfinex has more time to plan and communicate than it did immediately following the hack, and therefore the exchange should take advantage of this opportunity.  Arthur Hayes, CEO of BitMEX, voiced similar concerns, telling CoinDesk:  ""Many in the community would like to hear Bitfinex management layout a concrete plan for future redemptions.""  More specifically, Hayes and Eliosoff would be interested in learning the financial performance the company requires to trigger future redemptions and ""what portion of revenue is being dedicated toward extinguishing this liability"".  Promise kept  While Eliosoff expressed his doubts about Bitfinex’s transparency, Petar Zivkovkski, director of operations for full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, took a slightly darker slant on the the exchange’s response to the security breach.  ""I hold the view point that Bitfinex is trying to financially engineer their way out of this mess while transferring risk and debt onto their customers through their issuance of BFX debt tokens,"" he said.  More than one legal expert has asserted that Bitfinex has placed itself on shaky ground by distributing these tokens, as doing so opens up the possibility of both lawsuits and fines from government agencies.  Zivkovski’s portrayal of the situation may not seem particularly optimistic, yet Eliosoff noted that Bitfinex, at the very least, has shown it can keep its word.  Instead of buying BFX tokens for $1 each, the exchange could have just as easily taken the funds used and bought twice as many of these digital assets.  Eliosoff concluded:  ""But I respect that they're sticking to what they said.""
