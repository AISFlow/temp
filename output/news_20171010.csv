15990242,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/blockchain-technology-preventing-voting-fraud,1507665906,How Blockchain Technology Is Preventing Voting Fraud,"Despite the fact that voting should be one of the most secure and confidential things ever, sadly, the fear of voting fraud is rapidly increasing. Experts are saying that Blockchain technology could completely eliminate this however; by securing a digital ballot box or voting system, which will prevent voter fraud during elections. Using this technology will mean that once votes have been cast, they will be completely unalterable and available for everyone to see. Using a blockchain technology system to vote could completely change the way in which we have always seen voting being done. Instead of visiting a registered polling station, voters will instead cast their votes from their mobile phones or personal computers. These will then be logged into an immutable blockchain and utilised to reliably verify the results of the election. Jamie Skella is a co-founder of Horizon State; one of the companies that is building said system, has stated; “Democracy is the opportunity to share in the decision-making processes that relates to the shared matters which affect us. Democracy is about reaching consensus on how to best use our shared resources to achieve the best outcomes for our partners, children, colleagues, staff and fellow citizens. Where there are shared resources in any cooperative environment, there remains no question: we need better shared decision-making tools and processes.” What does this mean for the 21st Century? Blockchain technology has completely revolutionised the global political landscape towards direct democracy, which is where voters can decide the course of government policy. Having a completely digital ballot box will represent a smart and cost-effective solution to the existing way in which votes are cast. There are so many benefits to introducing a blockchain inspired voting system, namely that they will completely eliminate such issues such as manipulation, recording errors, and tampering, as well as encouraging voters’ participation. The trouble with a blockchain based voting system is the reluctance of change. The governments of the respective countries, have to have the ability to engage and manage a constituency that is vital to the future of their society. They should be promoting a blockchain technology to become a key part of this voting process. It is, understandably a slow process, but one that is becoming more well-known and accepted across some societies. This acceptance has led to various governments around the globe to be investigating the idea of using blockchain for national ID systems, to avoid identity frauds, which are commonly used to manipulate the existing and more traditional voting processes. Could Blockchain be the future of voting? This blockchain technology really is paving the way for a direct democracy. Although the current systems will have to be changed, it is ideal for many because it is so diverse. Although, like we said using blockchain technology as a voting system is still being developed it has the chance to mature alongside the young voters, so it become the norm and part of our collective future, changing the way in which we vote forever.

42427859,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4SBh,1507664701,Vladimir Putin: Cryptocurrency Poses 'Serious Risks',"Russian president Vladimir Putin said in a meeting today that cryptocurrencies pose significant risks related fraud and money laundering.  Quoted by Russian state news service TASS, Putin was speaking during a meeting that was focused on the subject of cryptocurrencies and financial tech more broadly. In the meeting, he formally voiced his support for new rules around cryptocurrency trading, stating that Russia should look to international examples as a guide when developing those regulations.  Indeed, the meeting represents some of Putin's most comprehensive comments on the subject to date. He first spoke about cryptocurrencies in the summer of 2015, remarking at the time that there were ""serious, really fundamental issues related to its wider usage."" In his new statements, Putin highlighted the rising profile of the technology, while also echoing those 2015 comments.  Putin was quoted as saying:  ""Virtual [currencies] or cryptocurrencies are becoming and have already become more popular. They have already become or are turning into a full-fledged payment instrument and an investment asset in certain countries. At the same time, use of cryptocurrencies also carries serious risks.""  On the subject of the rules themselves, Putin threw his support behind regulations that would protect consumers and facilitate the development of new financial products.  ""We should develop such a regulatory system on the basis of international experience that will make possible to make relations in this sphere systemic, definitely protect interests of citizens, business and the government, and provide legal guarantees for work with innovative financial instruments,"" he said.  His comments come after a senior official for Russia's central bank stated publicly that his institution will support efforts to block access to external websites that offer cryptocurrency brokering services in the country. Representatives from the Bank of Russia were also present at the Putin meeting, according to sources.

The government of Malta, as previously reported, is also looking to track changes in academic records by using the tech.  According to a statement from university officials, the trial forms part of a wider effort to bridge new technologies with the higher learning institution's existing services. By storing credential data on a blockchain – within which that information is tied to a certain transaction at a particular point in time – the university is hoping to mitigate the risk of credential fraud.  ""While we are entirely committed to the existing degrees and awards that the University offers, we are also interested in exploring how we can build a more diverse credentialing ecosystem,"" said University Pro Vice-Chancellor Gregor Kennedy. ""Issuing credentials on the blockchain is a key component of this investigation.""  The news marks the latest intersection of higher education and blockchain more generally. A growing number of institutions (and the researchers who work for them) are looking to launch courses related to the tech, and a few have even begun accepting cryptocurrency as payment.

Abu Dhabi Global Market's Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) said that it would apply existing anti-money laundering and know-your-customer (KYC) rules to token sales, classifying some as securities (depending on their makeup and underlying structure) and others as commodities. Like a growing number of regulators worldwide, the agency said that it would weigh the sale and release of blockchain-based tokens on a case-by-case basis.  The nine-page circular published yesterday includes instances in which a token sale would fall under or outside the definition of a security under Abu Dhabi law. Because the circumstances of such a determination may vary from project to project, the agency urged organizers within the region to ""engage with us as early as possible in the fundraising process.""  Richard Teng, the chief executive director of the FSRA, later said in a statement:  ""Participants exploring the issuance of ICOs that offer real value to the market and wish to operate within our regulatory framework are encouraged to engage us early to gain insights into the applicable regulatory regime.""  Tokens which are not treated as securities will be treated as commodities, along with cryptocurrencies more generally. As a result, their trades will not be regulated by the FSRA, according to the circular. That specific determination notably brings the FSRA in line with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which revealed that it would regulate the US-based market in late 2015.

Ether's ongoing love affair with the psychological level of $300 continues amid low trading volume. At press time, ETH is trading in a sideways manner around the $304 level. Week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is up 4.12 percent, while on a monthly basis, the market has seen a 2 percent loss overall.  Despite trading in and around that range, the market has seen some more notable fluctuations in recent weeks. China and South Korea's respective crackdowns on the ICO funding model had an impact, with prices tumbling to a low of $198 on September 15. Markets regained their position somewhat in the days that followed.  Still, the cryptocurrency's price lags behind that of bitcoin, which is only 4.8 percent short of the market's record high. Meanwhile, ether is still down at least 30 percent from the record high of $400 set in early September.  That said, speculation is rife that fears around additional ICO restrictions from other regulators are keeping ether bulls at bay. This theory may be evident from the low volumes seen in ETH trading pairs.  Still, all is not lost as the price action analysis points to a bullish continuation pattern.  Daily chart  The chart above shows:  An ascending triangle pattern  A bullish 14-day relative strength index (RSI)  Weak trading volumes  Strong price resistance at $315  The ascending triangle is similar to the symmetrical triangle, except that only one side is sloping. It is characterized by a usually flat level of resistance ($315 on the ETH chart) at the top, with the lower side sloping upwards as the price reaches higher lows.  View  An end-of-the-day close above $315 (bullish break of the ascending triangle pattern) would open up an upside toward the $350 levels.  A more bearish scenario: another rejection at $315 takes place, followed by a break below $280 (the September 29 low) that could lead to a quick fire sell-off to $213 (the 200-day moving average).  It's worth noting that ascending triangles (which are characterized by higher lows) usually result in an upside break. Thus, the odds of a bullish move are high. The only concern is low volumes, although a potential upside break of the ascending triangle could entice bulls – thus leading to higher volumes in the near future.

The news indicates a possible shift in tactics by torrent websites, after a number of popular services have been found to have installed hidden cryptocurrency mining code that harnesses visitors' computer processing power without seeking permission.  Some, such as The Pirate Bay, have notably failed to inform site visitors that their CPU was being used by the miner, a strategy that led domain supplier Cloudflare to classify the undisclosed process as ""malware"" and remove the domains of torrent site ProxyBunker for also hosting mining code.  TorrentFreak added  that the unnamed ""private tracker,"" an invite-only torrent site, has not only made this feature optional, but it also incentivizes members to let their CPUs be used for cryptocurrency mining by offering ""upload credit"" in return.  A resource that members require in order to download content, upload credit must usually either be purchased or generated from – as the name suggests – uploading new content.

42427858,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4S9h,1507640402,No More Nuclear: Japan's Biggest Utility Turns to Blockchain in Power Pivot,"The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) is no stranger to the risks of over-centralized energy sources.  Perhaps best known for the nuclear meltdown of its Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011, the largest energy utility in Japan is now looking to blockchain in an effort to prevent another catastrophe.  However, from distributed wind generation using tiny windmills to smart batteries that store power purchased when it's cheap to buy, alternative energy initiatives have historically been individual philanthropic pursuits.  Jeffrey Char, director of TEPCO's venture capital arm, though, believes blockchain can help provide a business model for these innovative ideas and, in the process, lessen Japan's reliance on centralized nuclear power.  Char told CoinDesk:  ""I was out looking for different technologies that would allow us to scale up operations in a distributed environment, and blockchain technology seemed to be a good fit.""  Since creating the venture capital arm in 2015, Char has publicly backed four companies: United Wind in Brooklyn, Via Science in Boston, Moixa in London and, most recently, German-based Conjoule – a joint venture with Innogy and TEPCO aimed at building decentralized energy solutions using blockchains.  And while he's also brought TEPCO into the Energy Web Foundation (designed to explore blockchain for the energy industry), he said the ""holy grail"" of all these projects is to have individuals create, consume and trade their own energy.  As such, his latest work – a signed memorandum of understanding between TEPCO and Grid+ – is aimed at exploring how blockchains could power peer-to-peer transactions for alternative energy sources.  ""What we hope working with Grid+ would enable is that it will give us some early insight into how to deal within those limitations,"" Char said.  On the Grid+  Char's interest in Grid+ began more than six months ago when he offered the startup an investment opportunity. While Grid+ declined the money, it invited Char to join as an adviser, and that's where he learned how beneficial collaboration with the startup could be.  Founded in 2015 as a ""spoke"" of the ConsenSys production company for ethereum startups, Grid+ is currently working on a piece of hardware it calls an ""agent,"" designed to let individuals pre-pay for energy using either ether, ethereum's native token, or fiat currencies.  By plugging ethereum-enabled devices into other smart machinery – such as the Tesla charging wall or the Nest thermostat – the company believes it can write algorithms based on customer energy usage that will allow them to buy energy when it is cheap.  Now a standalone C Corporation out of Delaware, Grid+ is preparing to raise more than $50 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) of ""grid"" tokens. According to Char, the goal of TEPCO's agreement with the startup is to learn about the potential benefits of ethereum for decentralizing the exchange of energy.  But it's not a one-sided agreement. Grid+ co-founder Mark D'Agostino said his startup expects to learn how to refine its algorithms for cheaper, more decentralized energy from TEPCO.  D'Agostino told CoinDesk:  ""We'd like to work closely with TEPCO to partake in the optimization algorithms, wherein, if our agent device is going to make purchasing decisions better than current utilities, it's because we have granular insight into what the consumer consumption profiles are in a given home.""  Window of opportunity  While it might seem strange for an executive at TEPCO to be looking for ways to cut Japan's reliance on nuclear energy, Char made clear his investment strategy.  ""I’m not a politician, so I don't lobby. I'm an entrepreneur, so I build businesses where I see problems, in order to solve those problems,"" he said.  The particular problem of converting nuclear to a more decentralized alternative has a window of opportunity only a few years long, according to Char, which explains his increasing interest in finding the right partners and solutions. Since the Fukushima Daiichi power plant meltdown, Japan's nuclear consumption has droppedhttps://www.iea.org/media/countries/Japan.pdf from about 30 percent to 2 percent, with remaining demands largely offset by the burning of fossil fuels.  ""We're burning a ton of gas and oil and coal,"" said Char.  However, to maintain its obligation to climate control under the Paris climate accord, the Japanese government says it needs to return its consumption of nuclear energy to 22 percent by 2030, according to a Forbes report.  Between now and then, Char hopes his company's investments can help prevent a full return to nuclear without a continued reliance on fossil fuels.  That the Japanese government is largely deregulating the energy sector has already helped, opening up the field to competition that TEPCO itself has been blamed for helping stifle.  Now, Char said, all that remains between the old nuclear paradigm and the future of decentralized energy are a few technical hurdles and regulations that prevent the spread of community-generated energy.  From there, he says it's up to consumers to adopt the technology:  ""If we are able to scale up the deployment of distributed energy resources like solar, like wind, and deploy a bunch of batteries, the economics around that type of power generation and power delivery keeps decreasing.""

Speaking at a conference on Tuesday, Reuters reports that Shvetsov cited the ""unreasonably high risks"" involved in cryptocurrency investment as a reason for the proposed measure, adding: ""We cannot give direct and easy access to such dubious instruments for retail (investors).""  As such, the Bank of Russia will be working alongside the judiciary to ensure the closure of websites offering these services – a crackdown that he indicated will extend to ""all cryptocurrency derivatives.""  Russian news agency TASS quotes Shvetsov as stating:  ""We consider all cryptocurrency derivatives to be a negative development on the Russian market and do not consider it possible to support it, and will even assume measures to restrict potential operations with such instruments made by the regulated part of the Russian market. Meanwhile, we assume efforts aimed at closing external websites that allow Russian citizens to acquire such assets together with the General Prosecutor's Office.""  Shvetsov further added that, with bitcoin being an asset that can generate high returns very quickly, it shows signs of being a pyramid scheme.  The move to block access to cryptocurrency trading websites follows a number of warnings from Russian authorities in the past few months.  Alexey Moiseev, the country's deputy finance minister, said in September that he expects upcoming legislation to feature a flat-out ban on payments made in cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin Falls Back After Hitting 5-Week High","Supported by strong volumes, bitcoin prices sprinted to a five-week high of $4,875 last night before the move ran out of steam.  The bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate spent 12 hours working hard to retake $4,800. However, at press time, bitcoin's price had dropped to $4,770 – still up 12 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, the price is up 10 percent, while on a monthly basis, the cryptocurrency has seen 12 percent gains.  Indeed, despite the Chinese ban on ICOs as well as hints Russia may take new restrictive actions, bitcoin has been able to regain poise in a relatively short period of time. Less than a month ago, BTC had dropped to $2,980. As of now, bitcoin is only 4.8 percent short of its all-time high of $5,000 set in early September.  The stellar recovery could be attributed to an increased trading activity in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong in the aftermath of Chinese crackdown. Speculation is also doing the rounds that fears of increasing ICO restrictions across the globe may have triggered a rotation of money out of ether and ethereum-based tokens and into bitcoin.  Currently, bitcoin looks set to revisit record highs.  Caution is advised, though, as the price action analysis indicates that the world's largest cryptocurrency may see a minor wobble before achieving new heights once again.  1-hour chart  The 1-hour chart shows:  A bearish symmetrical triangle breakdown  A drop in the volumes over the last few hours  Rising trend line support at $4,700.  A ""symmetrical triangle"" is a chart pattern characterized by converging top and bottom, and is formed when there is indecision in the marketplace. It may be both a reversal or a continuation chart pattern.  A downside break, as seen on the chart above, shows potential for a pullback.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows:  Volumes rose above the 30-day average on Monday, adding credence to the rally.  The 14-day RSI is rising and well short of the overbought territory (which would be above 70.00).  Both 5-day moving average and 10-day moving average are sloping upwards, indicating pullbacks are likely to be short-lived.  View  A pullback to $4,550-$4,500 appears likely, as indicated by the bearish symmetrical triangle breakdown and overbought RSI on the 1-hour and 4-hour time frame.  Dips are likely to be short-lived, as suggested by the rising lows pattern, upward sloping 5-day moving average and 10-day moving average. The pullback from $4,875 is accompanied by a drop in volumes, which indicates the retreat is due to profit-taking.  Still, the broader outlook remains constructive.

The project, part of a sweeping plan to secure all government documents on a blockchain by 2020, was announced this week by Dubai Land Department, the government agency tasked with overseeing land purchases and approving real estate trades.  In statements, the agency framed blockchain technology as a way to gain the confidence of global real estate investors, and as a convenience for tenants, whose leases would be recorded by the system.  Sultan Butti bin Mejren, the land department's director general, said in a statement:  ""Our aim is to unite all real estate and department services on a single platform. We hope to complete our project in the year 2019–2020.""  In a press release issued Saturday, the agency said, ""The technology will allow investors residing in Dubai and around the world to verify property data that is backed by timestamp signatures, enhancing the accuracy of data, the credibility of investment transactions and the transparency and clarity of the market.""  On the leasing side, the department said, the platform will connect renters not only to landlords, but also to other property-related billers, such as electrical, water and telecommunications utilities.  The latter will allow tenants ""to make payments electronically without the need to write cheques or print any paper … within a few minutes at any time and from anywhere in the world.""  Partnering with the Dubai Land Department on the initiative are Asset Management Group, one of the largest real estate developers in Dubai; Emirates NBD, one of the region's largest banks; the furniture chain IKEA; and the Emirates Identity Authority.  Dubai has also explored the technology for airport security, trade finance and immigration controls, working with IBM and rolling out the red carpet for startups in a notable effort to become a blockchain innovation hub.

42427857,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4S7h,1507629633,No Fraud: Ex-JPMorgan Trader Masters Thinks Bitcoin Breakout Just Beginning,"Of the many people to make the jump from Wall Street to cryptocurrency, few if any were as successful in their careers as Daniel Masters.  After working at legendary investment bank Salomon Brothers as an energy and derivatives trader, Masters took on an even bigger job, running global commodities trading at JPMorgan Chase. He then made a transition most people in the financial markets only dream of – moving from the sell side in banking to the buy side in hedge funds.  Masters opened his first hedge fund in 1999, but in the mid-2010s – as commodities and other traditional asset prices became less volatile and in turn less profitable – he discovered and ultimately became engrossed in the rollercoaster world of cryptocurrency.  Yet wild price swings weren't the only aspect of the market that interested the former trader. In a new interview, Masters told CoinDesk he was also captivated by the promise of borderless, frictionless, digital money.  From there, Masters began developing a strong intuition that bitcoin could, potentially, challenge fiat money and gold, and that it might play an important role in capital formation, the money-raising function that has traditionally been accomplished by stocks and bonds.  Masters said:  ""I think, at the core of this, is the development of new tools that are challenging the role that fiat money and gold have historically played. And that challenge is being brought forth by bitcoin.""  And while he still keeps an ear to the ground about his old shop – especially when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon opines about cryptocurrency – those disruptive functions have become the foundation on which Masters bases his bullish investment thesis for Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, GABI for short.  The notorious price  While the legacy financial system sits on its haunches, failing to adapt to the opportunities cryptocurrencies present, as Masters sees it, the technology now exists to digitize and tokenize large swaths of traditional asset classes – such as money, precious metals, commodities, stocks and bonds.  Moreover, once those assets have been tokenized on a blockchain, they will be able to perform far more intelligent functions, because the assets themselves will be programmable, just like any other instance of computer code.  There are serious benefits, something that he points to for the rise of the cryptocurrency market, which is currently valued at over $150 billion.  In his mind, cryptocurrency has found a way to reach that scale in almost total isolation from the legacy financial system. Now becoming self-sustaining and reaching a kind of ""escape velocity,"" cryptocurrency is finally gaining enough momentum to challenge the old ways of doing business in financial services, he said.  Still, institutions and investors are hesitant, seeing the market's intense volatility as a sign for concern.  But that doesn't phase Masters. He believes the price of commodities is ""notoriously fractal,"" meaning that prices swing wildly in both directions, adding the big picture takeaway:  ""Don't get hung up on price.""  Past precedent  To highlight his theory, Masters cited his work trading natural gas in the late '90s.  At the time, there was a five-year period during which the commodity was trading between $0.50 and $0.85, making it difficult for many people to foresee natural gas trading above $15, as it later did. He also pointed to his years trading in the oil market, when the price of a barrel of oil hovered between $5 and $20, figures that made the $145 it traded at in 2008 seem exaggerated.  In a similar fashion, if you were obsessing about the price of ethereum's ether token when it hit $1, you would never have bought it at $20 – and, as Masters said, ""Look where it is now."" Notably, ether is currently trading at just below $300, according to CoinMarketCap  Masters sees the relatively low valuation of cryptocurrencies when compared to other asset classes as a major opportunity.  When you look at all digital assets currently trading, the combined market capitalization isn't as high as a single one of world's 100 largest stocks, a statistic Masters believes means there's room for growth. Further, as bitcoin is only the 65th largest currency in the world, and some of the larger currencies are highly problematic for political and economic reasons, he believes it's not unthinkable to believe the cryptocurrency could provide a real alternative.  A blockchain bear  One of the key drivers of Masters' thesis is that an investment in cryptocurrency is a fundamental investment in the forward movement of technology.  In essence, he believes, an investment in cryptocurrency is tantamount to an investment in fintech, medtech and the Internet of Things. In this way, the view provides an elegant counterargument to the cryptocurrency skeptics who believe blockchain technology may change the world, but that cryptocurrencies are a passing fad.  To Masters, cryptocurrencies will be the true market force.  He said:  ""The vital thing to understand is that the momentum and the scale that you have in some of these public blockchains essentially means that it's going to be near impossible to build any of this big technology on any other kind of platform.""  Masters adds that the cost savings derived from using cryptocurrencies to access a global, open-source financial platform will make it impossible for even large tech companies to bootstrap their own proprietary technology to effectively compete.  And when you begin to see cryptocurrencies in that context, you get a sense for just how large the potential of its digital economy may be.  Differences with Dimon  Bearing in mind Masters' bullish view of the cryptocurrency space, one could expect him to disagree with Jamie Dimon's comments on bitcoin (most recently calling bitcoin a ""fraud"").  Indeed, despite their common background at JPMorgan, the two former colleagues have gone opposite ways when it comes to cryptocurrency.  While Masters believes Dimon has proven smart and hardworking in his role running the financial behemoth, Dimon doesn't have adequate time to understand the complex issues at stake in the cryptocurrency space, he said, calling the comments on bitcoin ""short-sighted.""  ""I don't think Jamie Dimon has an open enough mind, all the time, to properly accept the contribution that digital assets can make,"" he said.  He points out that other senior financial executives – at such renowned institutions as Chicago Mercantile Exchange & Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago Board Options Exchange, and NASDAQ, where Masters' shop lists its bitcoin trackers – feel very differently.  Masters also points out that JPMorgan does, in fact, trade in bitcoin, and that JPMorgan Securities was buying bitcoin for its clients at the same time Jamie Dimon was criticizing cryptocurrencies.  He concluded:  ""They either need to get with the program and support their clients who want to buy bitcoin, or they need to stop talking about it like a fool. Because those things are not consistent with an organization of that character.""

42427861,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4SFh,1507626005,Ex-IMF Economist Kenneth Rogoff Joins 'Bitcoin Will Collapse' Chorus,"Another prominent member of the financial establishment has predicted that bitcoin will crater, while still professing admiration for the technology behind it.  ""My best guess is that in the long run, the technology will thrive, but that the price of bitcoin will collapse,"" Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, wrote in an op-ed published Monday in The Guardian.  Like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Rogoff based his bearish take on the assumption that the world's governments would not allow a borderless, pseudonymous system of value transfer to grow significantly.  Calling it ""folly"" to assume that bitcoin would be allowed to replace money issued by central banks, he said:  ""It is one thing for governments to allow small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies; indeed, this would be desirable. But it is an entirely different matter for governments to allow large-scale anonymous payments, which would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes.""  Rogoff famously advocated for phasing out large-denomination bills as a way to combat tax evasion and aid central banks in implementing monetary policies in his book ""The Curse of Cash,"" published this year, and struck similar notes in his op-ed.  For example, he went on to suggest cryptocurrency is even more suited to illicit purposes than the proverbial briefcases full of banknotes.  ""Cash at least has bulk, unlike virtual currency,"" he wrote.  Rogoff also offered his disapproval for Japan's recognition of bitcoin as a legal method of payment.  While the government in the East Asian country has told cryptocurrency exchanges to identify customers and monitor transactions for suspicious activity, he argued that ""global tax evaders"" would likely attempt to acquire bitcoin anonymously and then launder it in Japan.  Perhaps unsurprisingly given this take, he concluded by expressing his hope that other countries won't follow Japan's lead.  ""Carrying paper currency in and out of a country is a major cost for tax evaders and criminals; by embracing virtual currencies, Japan risks becoming a Switzerland-like tax haven – with the bank secrecy laws baked into the technology,"" he wrote.

Lufthansa Strikes Deal With Blockchain ICO Startup,"One of Europe's largest airlines is partnering with a blockchain travel platform as part of a bid to explore possible applications of the technology.  Announced today, Lufthansa Group has entered into a deal with Swiss startup Winding Tree, a decentralized business-to-business marketplace built on the ethereum blockchain.  As a result of the deal, Maksim Izmaylov, CEO of Winding Tree, said the startup will assist Lufthansa in building and testing decentralized, blockchain-based travel apps that meet the requirements of airlines, while Lufthansa will integrate its APIs with the Winding Tree platform.  Reinhard Lanegger, senior venture development manager at the Lufthansa Innovation Hub, told CoinDesk, that, specifically, Lufthansa is interested in exploring use cases that would put booking, rebooking and traveler itinerary information on a blockchain.  In short, he said both Lufthansa and Winding Tree see the partnership as a win-win – one that allows Lufthansa exposure to new technology experts, and Winding Tree access to experts in the field.  Lanegger said:  ""We want to provide [Winding Tree] expertise.""  Token investment  The new partnership goes a step further, though, bringing Lufthansa into the trendy world of initial coin offerings (ICOs), the term denoting how startups are now leveraging custom cryptocurrencies as a way to fund early-stage startup development.  Notably, as part of the partnership, Lufthansa will also be investing in Winding Tree as part of its forthcoming sale of a token called LIF. Although the airline did not disclose how much it will be investing, the token will initially be used to fund the development of Winding Tree's platform.  Eventually, however, LIF will be the mechanism with which users can book travel.  ""LIF is used for settlement and data transfer,"" said Pedro Anderson, co-founder of Winding Tree. ""Anyone owning LIF tokens will be able to book hotels, flights and cruises ... directly on the blockchain.""  Still, Lufthansa is not new to the technology, having signaled interest in the blockchain space as early as 2014 when it partnered with bitcoin payment processor Bitnet. And, while Lufthansa is the only airline currently public with its interest in utilizing the platform, Lanegger said it may seek to include other partners in trials.

42427863,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4SHh,1507613402,Indian State Partners With Blockchain Startup for Land Registry Pilot,"The Indian state of Andhra Pradesh is working with startup ChromaWay on a land registry pilot that uses blockchain to track the ownership of property.  The state government has been exploring a number of uses for blockchain in recent months, and in September it inked a separate partnership with startup WISekey related to identity solutions. Andhra Pradesh is one of several regional governments in India to look into applications of the tech, and land registries – systems used to keep track of who owns what property – have been highlighted by other governments worldwide as one area in which the technology could lead to improved services.  The test platform being built with Sweden-based ChromaWay is part of the Fintech Valley Vizag initiative launched by the southeast Indian state.  According to the parties involved, it utilizes a distributed ledger on the back-end and a straightforward web-app front end, which provides ""radically transparent access to data,"" according to ChromaWay.  J. A. Chowdary, special chief secretary and IT advisor to the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, said in a statement:  ""Blockchain is the technology of the future. It will not only change the way we perceive processes but it also has the potential to transform the economy. Of course, we all are yet to fully discover this technology and hence the Government of Andhra Pradesh has engaged with startups from across the globe such as Chromaway to run proofs of concept within its own departments.""  The project represents the latest public sector partnership for ChromaWay. Sweden's land registry authority, the Lantmäteriet, revealed in April that it is working with the startup on a land registry initiative. Other participants in that effort include banks SBAB and Landshypotek, as well as the consultancy Kairos Future.
