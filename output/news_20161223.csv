42379112,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mz1B,1482534885,Bitcoin Prices Rally Nearly 18% As 2016 Draws to a Close,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 17th through 23rd December.  Bitcoin prices surged more than 17% during the week through 23rd December.  The digital currency surpassed $900 after opening the week at $780.85, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal. At press time, bitcoin prices had climbed as much as $918.95 during the session – a 17.7% gain since the start of the week.  Markets are currently trading at an average of $916.19.  Bitcoin experienced these gains amid several contributing factors, including strong market sentiment and significant trade volume on Chinese exchanges. In sum, the price gains signify a strong rally after markets pushed through key resistance at $800.  Aside from that, market observers have pointed to several developments – India’s push to remove certain notes from circulation and sociopolitical turmoil in Europe in particular – as potential drivers of further activity in bitcoin markets.  Market momentum  Market observers struck a bullish tone about the price movements taking place over the last few days.  “Sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish,” said Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. Whaleclub data indicates that the market was 94% long on average in the seven days through 23rd December, after being 90% long on average during the week prior.  According to Zivkovski, traders have kept these positions open for shorter periods on average. These factors indicate that traders are “after a quick profit since the trend is so bullish,” he said.  While bitcoin prices did see significant gains during the week, they lingered below $800 for the better part of the seven-day period, breaking through this key level on Tuesday, 20th December, BPI figures reveal.  Bitcoin markets did see some resistance at $800, a development noted by market analyst Jacob Eliosoff. After the price broke through this level, it rose far more quickly.  “It sure looked like steady buying took several days to grind through all the sell orders around $800, and, once it got past them, moved much more quickly through thinner offers above $800,” said Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund trader.  Bitcoin prices rose quickly, climbing to as much as $874.10 on 22nd December. The digital currency saw another sharp price gain the following day, surpassing $900.  Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund EAM, argued that bitcoin could easily push higher, saying that it has broken free of rangebound trading.  “We’ve broken out of a two-year trading range, so we’re going to move much higher, I think,"" he said. ""We may hit my $1,200 much earlier than I thought.”  China’s impact  While Enneking and Zivkovski both emphasized the important role that market dynamics played in driving bitcoin prices this week, Eliosoff cited something else entirely – China.  Market observers often point to China as playing a crucial role in bitcoin’s price movements, and this week was no exception. Trading activity on the nation’s exchanges was a major driver of this week’s rally in bitcoin prices, said Eliosoff, who runs a cryptocurrency fund. He noted that these transactions could have been caused by a number of factors.  “The question is always how much of the Chinese buying is a) capital control evasion, b) just reducing [yuan] exposure, but not necessarily moving wealth outside China or c) sheer speculation/gambling,"" he said.  Eliosoff emphasized that while nobody knows for certain, his guess would be that the biggest causal factor driving this week’s bitcoin price gains was traders reducing their exposure to the yuan.  “The yuan has continued its slow depreciation, though not noticeably in the last 24 hours,"" he added.  Regardless of which factors are driving bitcoin’s price movements in the near-term, these fluctuations ultimately come down to supply and demand, Enneking noted.  “There are fewer [bitcoins] being created and interest is growing,"" he said. ""The price can only go one way.”  This article is not intended to provide, and should not be taken as, investment advice.

42379130,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mzNp,1482527847,Classic and the DAO: What Drove Ether Prices in 2016,"The past 12 months marked a dynamic period for the price of ether (ETH), the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network.  Ether markets experienced sharp price fluctuations over the course of 2016. The digital currency surged more than 2,000% within the first six months, rising from an opening price of $0.93 to roughly $21.50 by mid-June before losing much of these gains during the latter part of the year.  At press time, ETH was trading at $7.27, a figure which itself represents a more than 700% year-to-date (YTD) increase from January.  The digital currency experienced these notable gains and losses as ethereum – a blockchain-based platform for the development of decentralized applications and smart contracts – encountered numerous twists and turns on the development front. Major moments included the release of ethereum's ""Homestead"" client, the collapse of the The DAO and the birth of ethereum classic.  The largest price fluctuations took place surrounding the rise and fall of The DAO, as ETH rose to an all-time high in mid-June and then proceeded to tank, falling more than 50% within 48 hours.  Homestead  Ethereum released Homestead, the first production version of its software, on 14th March. This version followed Frontier, which, as its name plies, was more of a beta program that the developers used to explore the limits of the then-nascent network and uncover bugs.  While this update helped drive development progress, Homestead’s release did not have a positive impact on price. ETH rose to as much as $15.22 on 13th March, but had declined to as little as $8.52 on 18th March, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.  Homestead constituted a major release in the eyes of the market, according to Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.  “Homestead was probably the most anticipated update for ethereum as it provided both stability and legitimacy to the project,"" he told CoinDesk. ""It opened the doors to more mainstream developers making it easy for them to develop decentralized ‘unstoppable’ applications on the ETH blockchain.”  The DAO attack  For 2016 at least, nothing drew attention to ethereum more than the attack on The DAO.  The DAO, which is short for ""Distributed Autonomous Organization"", aimed to develop an ethereum-based vehicle through which other projects in the ecosystem could be funded by community consensus. The idea was that participants could purchase tokens and use them to vote for the projects they wanted to fund the most.  While this project generated significant visibility and collected more than $150m in ether, the situation deteriorated significantly when The DAO was attacked on 17th June. The incident resulted in 3.6m ethers (roughly $60m at then-current prices) being siphoned into a “child DAO” due to an unforeseen exploit in the smart contract underlying the project.  ETH prices reacted violently, falling from an all-time high of $21.52 on 17th June to $9.96 the following day, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.  The ethereum community quickly began debating whether to implement a hard fork, and some members took a more proactive approach by leveraging a white hat attack to remove some of the remaining funds from The DAO and protect them from the continued action of hackers.  Unfortunately, this approach proved insufficient, and the ethereum community implemented a hard fork on July 20th, returning the stolen ether from an account owned by an unknown attacker to a new address by essentially rolling back the network's transaction history.  ETH prices, on the other hand, didn't seem to suffer any headwinds because of this event, rising approximately 2% from $12.21 at roughly 14:30 UTC on 20th July (the time the hard fork took place) to $12.45 at 23:59 UTC, CoinMarketCap figures reveal. Transaction activity also rose between these two times, with 24-hour trading volume rising from roughly $51.5m to $60.2m.  The digital currency's price pushed higher over the next few days, rising to as much as $14.89 on 23rd July. At that point, 24-hour trading volume surpassed $78m.  Ethereum Classic  Perhaps just as unpredictable was the emergence of another ethereum.  While the hard fork averted the dilemma of investors losing millions as a result of taking a chance on The DAO, the move came with some unintended consequences. Some who opposed the move continued using the pre-hard fork network, under the moniker of ""ethereum classic"".  This separate blockchain, with its corresponding cryptocurrency ether classic (ETC), quickly drew significant attention. Its tokens started trading at roughly 13:44 UTC for a price of $0.75 on 24th July, and ultimately surged close to 300% within the first 72 hours, reaching $2.85 on 26th July.  ETH experienced modest volatility during ETC's early trading days, falling from $13.19 at 13:44 UTC on 24th July (when ETC began trading) to $12.32 at 17:44 UTC. The digital currency quickly recovered to $13.10 by 20:14 that day, and rose to as much as $13.68 at 07:09 UTC on 25th July.  Supporters of the effort say it enshrines the original ideals of the ethereum project prior to the efforts to wind back the DAO collapse, while critics have said the network serves as little more than a vehicle for speculation. Cryptocurrency fund trader Jacob Eliosoff argued that ETC is at risk of becoming a historical curiosity in the absence of deeper development.  Eliosoff went on to acknowledge that “the DAO hack and the ensuing ETH/ETC schism undoubtedly damaged both the project and the price,” but emphasized that he sees a clear path forward for ethereum.  Hard forks  It was a year of hard forks for ethereum.  The network underwent several major changes that required users to upgrade their software this year in an effort to address repeated attacks. Ethereum also experienced a completely accidental fork on Thanksgiving, in which Geth and Parity implemented the logic of a hard fork executed November 22 differently, producing a consensus error.  This ""Thanksgiving fork"" was quickly flagged, and the event itself seemingly provided little in the way of headwinds for ETH prices, which rose from an opening price of $9.23 to a daily high of $9.66.  Some observers noted that the number of hard forks that ethereum has undergone over the last year can be interpreted in more than one way. For example, the simple fact that the network enacted all these changes can be interpreted as a signal of its ability to maneuver and therefore produce specific results.  “ETH underwent several hard forks [in 2016]. While this does show flexibility, it also shows a certain lack of stability since a hard fork is essentially an entirely separate system in itself that has to be deployed and updated across all network nodes,"" Zivkovkski argued. ""It'll have trouble establishing itself as a long-term currency and autonomous application blockchain if a hard fork is going to come into effect every few months.”  Images via CoinMarketCap, Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Charles Lloyd Bovaird II,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/12/23/classic-and-the-dao-what-drove-ether-prices-in-2016,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf93445e2384fe670cd42e611011f6168eccba7a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42379118,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mz8j,1482502520,Dubai Appeals to Startup Ecosystem for Blockchain Immigration Solution,"Dubai's immigration agency is seeking a blockchain startup to develop a system that will cut illegal residency in the country.  As part of the second round of The Dubai Future Accelerator, the largest government-supported accelerator, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreign Affairs has put out a call for blockchain companies to apply to take the effort forward.  The agency is hoping to reduce illegal resident entry by 50% using an “international blockchain”, according to a 22nd December press release.  Other government agencies in Dubai are also looking for technology startups as part of the accelerator program. Some of the calls seem ripe for blockchain’s publicized use cases.  For instance, the Department of Economic Development wants to use automated systems to cut governmental red tape by 20% – more specifically reducing the processing time for receiving, renewing and modifying trade licenses.  And the Dubai Health Authority is looking to improve patient self-management of health data, a use case for blockchain that was talked about during the Distributed Health conference recently.  'Better future'  The Dubai Future Accelerator takes no equity from companies that participate, plus provides flights, accommodation and office space for the nine-week program where startups get to test prototypes with large Dubai enterprises and government entities. The second round starts 12th February.  “By bringing innovative global startups together with government entities in Dubai, the program offers them the potential to materialize their ideas and projects in a forward-thinking city, and play their part in building a better future today,” said Saif Al-Aleeli, CEO of the Dubai Future Foundation in the press release.  Blockchain isn’t the only high-tech application the agencies are hoping to take advantage of. Companies specializing in artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing and drones are also being asked to participate.

42379128,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mzMZ,1482497313,Why 2017 Will Take Blockchain to New Heights,"Ryan Uhr is CEO and founder of Coinplug, a South Korea-based bitcoin services company.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Uhr looks at how blockchain technology has fared in the East Asian country over the last 12 months and makes some predictions for 2017.  It's often outside the major US and European markets that blockchain companies produce the most interesting innovations, thanks to differences in both the regulatory and business environments in places like East Asia.  It's also why bitcoin and blockchain companies in places like South Korea and Japan often surprise people. They move in new directions, raise investment from unexpected sources and find new user bases. It's proof that this technology is truly a worldwide phenomenon, and those interested should watch all regions for inspiration.  As 2016 comes to a close, I'd like to highlight what I consider the year's three most significant blockchain-related events in the South Korean market – and make three more predictions for 2017.  First, here's the good news from the last year:  1. South Korean Financial Regulator Releases FinTech Roadmap  South Korea's Financial Services Committee (FSC) announced its two-step FinTech Development Roadmap in October 2016.  The roadmap comprises two steps: eliminating irrational regulation and improving FinTech industry systems. Notably, the roadmap includes the creation of the Bank Joint Blockchain Consortium and the institutionalization of digital currencies such as bitcoin, as well as establishing a finance test bed for new FinTech services.  With its roadmap, the government is trying to remove hurdles that may obstruct the 'Fourth Industrial Revolution' in South Korea, as well as nurture an environment for FinTech companies to develop their business more freely.  2. South Korean Central Bank's Research Project Focuses on Blockchain  The Bank of Korea conducted a joint research project specifically focusing on blockchain technology.  This initiative looked at several aspects of blockchain technology, including current industry issues, technical and political challenges for blockchain adoption in the financial system.  Blockchain applications in the Bank of Korea’s payment and settlement system were a major focus and, of course, blockchain-based digital currency was also explored.  3. Major Financial Institutions Work to Implement Blockchain Solutions  A number of financial institutions have realized blockchain technology's potential and have developed several use cases, as well as announcing a plan called the ‘Starting point of the Blockchain Movement’ within the last year.  As examples of those projects, KB Kookmin Card and KB Savings Bank launched a private blockchain-based identity authentication platform, and KB Kookmin bank developed an overseas remittance platform.  Further, the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation (KOMSCO) has started working to develop a blockchain-based digital asset platform. Coinplug played a role in developing many of these use cases and platforms.  Furthermore, Korea’s five largest banks – KEB Hana, Shinhan, Kookmin, Woori, IBK – also joined the R3 consortium, while three Korean institutions – Coinplug, Samsung SDS, and Korea Securities Depository – became members of the Hyperledger project.  Such moves reflect just how seriously financial institutions in Korea are taking this new technology.  Looking ahead  And now, my predictions for 2017:  1. Hurdles Will Be Lowered for Blockchain Adoption  The FSC roadmap focuses on deregulating the financial industry and supporting FinTech companies.  Since the biggest hurdle for the FinTech industry is constrictive regulation, the roadmap's focus on deregulation should encourage financial institutions to adopt blockchain technology and develop even more use cases.  2. Korean Financial Institutions Will Form Local Blockchain Consortia  In 2017, I predict that financial institutions will go beyond joining global consortia, and start to create their own combined blockchain inititives in Korea.  A fundamental aspect of the FSC roadmap is the creation of the Bank Joint Blockchain Consortium, which is expected to be finalised by the end of this year and commence activities in January.  Additionally, there have been discussions regarding another blockchain consortium for capital markets, with an effort to launch next year. The capital market consortium will seek to develop blockchain use cases such as authentication services, document storage, OTC market exchange platforms, and clearing and settlement systems.  Each consortium will test blockchain in its own market, develop business use cases and, ultimately, produce a joint blockchain platform.  3. And Finally, a Blockchain Adoption Triggering Point  Financial institutions in Korea regularly update their IT infrastructure, and 2017 happens to be a major update planning year for designing next-generation platforms.  Many of these institutions are now considering blockchain as one of their options. Furthermore, financial institutions are anticipating the time when smart contracts are fully commercialized and combined with private blockchains. This technology has the potential to create an enormous synergy effect with almost limitless use cases.  I believe 2017 will be the year Korea's financial institutions actively adopt private blockchains for their main services and systems, and investigate what else the tech can do. Estimates say that about 70-80% of major banks in Korea will use blockchain in some form, with many of them undertaking smart contract pilot schemes.  Investors and developers in other countries would do well to observe over the coming 12 months, and consider how they could put Korea's outcomes to good use elsewhere.  The future for blockchain technology is very bright.  Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for 2017? Email editors@coindesk.com to learn how you can contribute to our series.
