42398922,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgP4,1457884201,What's the Big Idea Behind Ethereum's World Computer?,"Travis Patron is a digital money researcher and instructor of the Ethereum Technology Course. Here he explains why he believes the smart contracting innovation enabled by Ethereum could unlock a new frontier in Internet innovation.  Since the beginning of 2016, those with a pulse on the digital currency industry have eagerly watched the development of next-generation cryptocurrency platform Ethereum.  As a relatively new development utilizing bitcoin technology, Ethereum aims to implement a globally decentralized, un-ownable, digital computer for executing peer-to-peer contracts. Put more simply, Ethereum is a world computer you can't shut down.  This combination of cryptographic architecture and Turing completeness could enable entirely new industries to spawn. In turn, traditional business models, occupying the role of middleman, could increasingly feel the pressure to innovate or face irrelevance.  Such an innovation, proponents say, could eliminate censorship, fraud, and the role of the third party in online collaboration.  The Ethereum virtual machine  The Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) refers to part of the protocol that handles internal state and computation. It is often referred to as the project's defining innovation over other blockchain-based systems.  By taking the cryptographic payment structure of bitcoin and adding a Turing complete scripting language, Ethereum is attempting to create the most viable tool for executing smart contracts using blockchain technology.  The term ""Turing complete"" here means a system capable of performing any logical step of the computational function.  A technology in wide use today which employs Turing completeness is JavaScript, the programming language which powers the World Wide Web. Smart contract technology would describe a computer protocol which obviates the need for a contractual clause and, instead, is self-executing and self-enforcing.  What differentiates Ethereum from bitcoin is that it doesn't stand first to be a payment system, but rather a computing platform.  The cryptocurrency that runs Ethereum's blockchain, ether, acts as a sort of fuel to power the engine of this computing platform. Ether is consumed by miners for accessing resources of the network.  The more ether a user holds, the more ""gas"" they can pump into the computational engine of the Ethereum virtual machine.  Autonomous corporations  One of the defining features of the 21st century corporation is populating the role of the employee with machines rather than humans.  Bitcoin is one of the first models of such a corporation. The miners of the bitcoin network can be seen as employees rather than as humans were in the traditional corporate model.  Ethereum takes this development one step further. Interestingly, the role of the customer (which is currently populated by humans) stands to be overtaken by machine functionality as smart contracting systems enable end-to-end payments without requiring a human initiator.  What Ethereum will help facilitate is an economy of interconnected devices where machines can transmit money and data in a manner dwarfing the efficiency of human input. Businesses which overlook this trend will pay dearly due to new supply channels which disintermediate the old world’s third party infrastructure.  In a business landscape where corporations run autonomously, analog money will continue to be dumped in favor of digitized money.  The consumer of today has come to expect instantaneous, global, and friction-free payments. Nearly half of millennials are anticipating tech startups to disrupt the legacy banking sector, and although there remains much progress to be made, advances in cryptocurrency (and smart contracting) will enable a velocity of money which moves toward the esteemed ideal of conducting business at the speed of thought.  Ethereum today is where bitcoin was in 2010 – raw infrastructure, lack of developers, and plenty of skeptics. Competitors, such as Rootstock, add legitimacy to the use case Ethereum is attempting to bring to market.  From trustless crowdsales to democratic organizations, smart contracting platforms could unlock a new frontier in Internet-enabled innovation.

42398924,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgR2,1457881225,Bitcoin and Public Blockchains Will Power the Smart Contracts Revolution,"Bitcoin evangelist, public speaker and community director of the Counterparty Foundation, Chris DeRose is also a journalist and software developer.  In this feature, DeRose examines both the promise and problems related to smart contracts, the autonomous financial products that some market observers see as a key application for blockchain technology.  As the study of 'smart contracts' went from strange academic curiosity to the cutting-edge of FinTech, most market observers are still wondering just how this revolution in value transfer works.  Smart contracts, for those who still don't know, are small bits of code attached to an asset, which determines where and how the underlying asset will perform based on events in the network. The promise of financial instruments that are routed through the economy autonomously, and without need for intervention by a custodian, is immense.  But exactly how does such a technology work? And what makes a smart contract different from similar solutions for financial logic that have been commonplace for decades in our modern banking system?  The creation of the bitcoin blockchain was the principal breakthrough that has enabled this innovation, and which is chiefly responsible for renewed excitement. Before the blockchain, the notion of programmable money was a feeble promise.  After all, any programmable money was ultimately overridden by the custody holder of the funds involved, and this meant that incumbent routing restrictions would override all network functions. Incumbent systems are necessarily designed so that the holder of the funds is the agency through which any programmatic logic would be applied.  This escrow restriction leaves little room for the development of features that have removed middlemen or enabled regulatory arbitrage.  With a blockchain, only the two parties involved in a 'contract' have access to their funds, and when a contract is deployed, these funds are determined by the blockchain to be 'allocated' to the contract, and are unspendable by either party until the terms of the contract have expired.  With the removal of an escrow agent, none of the involved parties, or a counterparty, can control or moderate the asset during or after the contract's terms have come to pass.  Target market  But who needs this service? Why would someone seek an environment where such un-alterable settlement would offer any efficiency? Well, like all things blockchain, these features will find their efficiency through any agency that stands to gain from the regulatory benefits of not having custody of funds.  Or, better still, these features would offer efficiencies in the world of the underserviced, where custodians for these funds are either unavailable – or worse still, to be found amongst the company of problematic institutions without insurance or verified holdings.  At the moment, two distinct classes of 'blockchains' are tackling this market: public blockchains such as bitcoin, and distributed ledgers (sometimes labelled ""private blockchains"").  However, both systems have shortcomings in their current forms that are impacting their ability to find widespread adoption.  Private blockchains miss the efficiencies of smart contracts in a number of obvious ways.  Chiefly, bearer assets are not supported, and thus value of any kind is not escrowed. This means that despite the outcomes in which a ""distributed ledger"" or ""private blockchain"" determines how funds should be routed, moderation and regulatory hurdles will nonetheless be present at the time funds are delivered through an incumbent network.  This begs the question as to why the custodian of the funds doesn't just execute a user's code on their own servers, perhaps with a cryptographically verifiable receipt. Thus far, users haven't needed such features on registered assets, and the jury's out as to whether there will be any efficiency here going forward.  If you believe that the 'blockchain' was the invention of digital bearer assets by Satoshi Nakamoto, then public blockchains are necessarily where all smart contract efficiencies will manifest. However, these systems are also encumbered with non-trivial technical hurdles.  Primarily, the notion of ""fungibility"" is still the source of a large part of the burden for these systems, as it would be assumed that securities for which a bearer could be reversibly determined will still enable regulators and moderators to exercise roadblocks in a smart contract's execution.  Thus far, only the bitcoin blockchain is tackling this hurdle, with promising developments in the form of ""confidential transactions"" and even ""coin joining"".  Another hurdle that still remains the source of much debate in the public blockchain space is that of the ""Hash Strength"" of a public blockchain. Put simply, this strength represents the amount of energy burned to secure a blockchain.  As the financial gains for those executing contracts in a public blockchain increases, so too does the incentive for an attacker to disrupt that blockchain. In the case of bitcoin, the cost to disrupt the blockchain is approximately $1m US dollars per day, which is formidable, though still a bit too small for the aspirations of many large institutions.  And for comparison, the next largest public smart contract platform, Ethereum, is trivially dismissable at a current ""hashrate"" of about $25,000 usd per day.  More progress needed  While the potential for automation and efficiency is immense in this burgeoning field, there are still a number of significant drawbacks to both fields of the technology that is rarely discussed, and present in all forms of our current implementations.  One such drawback in the current state of blockchain design is that the code inside of a smart contract needs to be disclosed to all parties on the network.  For many types of financial trades, this onerous restriction means that after the funds have been committed, uninvolved parties on the network would be able to actively trade on outcomes that would have been previously unknowable and which could prove detrimental to the parties which are engaged in this arrangement.  This means that uninvolved parties in a blockchain's smart contract may be able to hoard or sell an asset with the previously inaccessible knowledge that one party is going to end up on the losing side of trade. Further, smart contracts by virtue of their network-wide broadcasting, are necessarily slow. And though many in the private distributed ledger world like to tout their comparatively fast times by blockchain standards, in the world of incumbent systems for trading registered assets, these times are nonetheless glacial.  Smart contracts will likely find their initial niche in much the same communities as did bitcoin - amongst the underserved, and the amateur hobbyists.  Though banks will try to head toward this technology with the same enthusiasm as they have toward blockchains, they will come to find that traditional message-passing systems are both more conducive to the information secrecy required for settlement strategies to work, as well as favorable given the requirements of high throughput and reliable transmission.  Smart contracts have the potential to offer one the most disruptive changes in the financial services business that we've seen since the advent of computerized data processing. However, there are still many large hurdles to be cleared before these efficiencies are delivered.  Fortunately, this technology has finally left the halls of academia with the breakthrough of the blockchain, and thousands of the world’s most talented minds in FinTech are dedicated to scaling this amazing innovation to the needs of modern finance institutions.
