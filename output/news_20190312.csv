42381677,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oEQB,1552421736,Ethereum's ProgPoW Mining Change to Be Considered for Istanbul Upgrade,"The code designed to enact ethereum’s next system-wide upgrade, Istanbul, may feature the inclusion of a controversial mining algorithm said to allow for broader participation in its network.  Discussed Tuesday during a meeting of project managers working on the world's second-largest blockchain, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1057, also known as Programmatic Proof-of-Work (ProgPoW), has been long debated. On one side are those who believe it will limit large miners from dominating the $655 million annual market for new ether issuance, on the other are those who believe it does not go far enough in leveling access.  Now, with a recent hard fork successfully activated in late February, discussions on ProgPoW appear to be back in full swing. As suggested by Tim Beiko in Tuesday's call, ProgPoW will be raised as a formal agenda item for discussion among core developers in a call this Friday.  Those assembled on Tuesday's call said they plan to push for EIP 10557 to be included, should two third-party audits find no technical reasons for a delay.  Beiko said:  ""In the worst case, if the audit comes with a huge red flag in it, we can pull that EIP out before Istanbul but assuming that everything goes well, we’ve already done the work … and the audit is just validation afterwards.”  Encouraging this suggestion to be raised to ethereum's core developers, developer Lane Rettig estimated that the final EIP approval deadline for all Istanbul code changes would be sometime in mid-May.  “That’s something that would have to be brought up in the next all core devs call,” said Rettig.  Two-part audit  However, as the call shows, the results of the audit, aimed at solidifying the measurable benefits of a mining algorithm change, remain to be seen.  As community relations manager of the Ethereum Foundation Hudson Jameson wrote in a developer chatroom, “As far as the audit goes there are two components: benchmarking and examination of how long/efficient a ProgPoW ASIC would be.”  Jameson explained the audits would serve to “make sure it is even worth it to implement ProgPoW or if ASICs can be made super quickly (like less than nine months) and with more speed increase.”  Such comments acknowledge criticisms shared by investors including Dovey Wan and Martina Long who argue the growing number of ASICs on the ethereum blockchain “is largely a non-issue for ethereum,” especially given the planned switch to a new consensus protocol known as proof-of-stake (PoS).  Other community members see the continued scrutiny of ProgPoW as feet-dragging that is holding back an issue that has already achieved consensus.  Writing on an Ethereum Magicians forum on the ProgPoW audit, user “Anlan” warns:  “The whole point of ProgPoW on [ethereum] is to slow down incoming wave of ASICs and to prepare a more leveled field for any mining device. All [these] delays only give room to ASIC manufacturers to organized a counter-offensive move and prepare for a contentious [hard fork.]”      Correction (May 15, 2020, 18:53 UTC): ProgPoW stands for programmatic proof-of-work, not progressive proof-of-work, as was previously listed in this article.

42430280,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqJdh,1552408213,IBM Quietly Enters Crypto Custody Market With Tech Designed for Banks,"IBM is coming to the crypto custody space.  Later this month, Shuttle Holdings, a New York investment firm, will launch the beta version of a custody solution for digital assets built on IBM's private cloud and encryption technologies. The companies won’t be storing cryptocurrencies and tokens themselves, but offering tools for others to do so.  Potential users include banks, brokers, custodians, funds, family offices and high net worth investors who want to do self-custody, as well as exchanges, Brad Chun, Shuttle's chief investment officer, told CoinDesk.  ""We have a list of selected clients that we are launching limited service with this month,"" Chun said. The service is ""not open to the public yet and there is a wait list to get into our beta.""  IBM showcased the solution at its “Think 2019” conference last month in San Francisco, where Nataraj Nagaratnam, the tech giant's CTO and director of cloud security, called storage of crypto a prime use case for Big Blue's cloud.  “What better example than taking a financial technology that is changing the world. Look at digital assets; how do you secure the data? ... [This is] top of mind for a lot of people in the financial industry,” Nagaratnam said, before welcoming Chun onstage.  When contacted by CoinDesk, IBM referred most questions to Chun. But Rohit Badlaney, director of IBM's ""Z As a Service"" cloud solution, talked up IBM's involvement in the forthcoming Digital Asset Custody Service (DACS).  ""For DACS, the on-premise pervasive encryption capabilities offered by IBM LinuxONE was a key differentiator in choosing IBM as the most secure platform for their offering,"" Bedlaney told CoinDesk through a spokeswoman.  The move suggests IBM is wading deeper into the digital asset space, after developing the Hyperledger Fabric private blockchain for enterprises and more recently getting involved with cryptocurrency through its work with the Stellar Foundation.  While crypto custody was once the preserve of wallet providers and crypto exchanges, the promise of institutional investment entering the digital assets space has prompted a race to come up with safe, industrial-grade solutions that are also familiar in terms of usage to these large players.  Not cold storage  The custody service that Shuttle and IBM are offering differs greatly from the cold storage solutions used by most crypto custodians, where the private keys are held in a device not connected to a network.  While these air-gapped arrangements have traditionally been thought of as the best way to reduce attack vectors, “from a technology standpoint, it sounds a little oxymoronic,” Chun in his presentation.  Enterprises, he noted, want to be able to connect to their customers and to have data and assets held in a readily available, yet secure setting. (Getting assets out of cold storage can be something of a headache.)  Instead, Chun said IBM Cloud has created some interesting features that enabled Shuttle to build a system that is ""just as secure, if not more secure"" than a simplistic cold storage wallet solution.  As such, the solution is built on a hardware security module (HSM), a kind of lockbox that safeguards and manages digital keys in a tamper-proof environment.  He later elaborated to CoinDesk:  ""There are always trade-offs between security and efficiency, but we do not utilize a traditional cold storage system. Instead, we keep keys at rest encrypted in multiple layers as data blobs so that an organization can store these backups using their pre-existing disaster recovery and backup processes and media.""  During his presentation, Chun said this combination of availability and security means the IBM Cloud solution is better equipped for a digital asset-laden future.  “Once we have this critical layer that’s highly available and secure, then all businesses can start custodying digital assets – not just cryptocurrencies; we mentioned real estate, we mentioned identity,” he said.  As far as what flavor of HSM Shuttle uses, Chun told CoinDesk the solution was HSM-agnostic.  “We focus on the entire solution, not just the HSM. If the HSM offering from Gemalto is better than what we are using, I would be happy to talk to them and incorporate them into our plans. IBM has an HSM we are using but we can easily switch it based on customer needs and demands,” he said.  Cold storage vs. HSMs  Stepping back, opinions differ over HSMs versus traditional cold storage and the putative trade-offs between security and efficiency, in relation to managing crypto assets.  With cold storage solutions, a human has to be involved to access the assets, which can take anywhere from an hour or two to as long as 48 hours. HSMs, by contrast, rely on a purely electronic process and are therefore much faster.  IBM would not be alone in providing HSM solutions for digital assets. Last week, Switzerland’s Crypto Storage AG announced its customized HSM-solution would be rolled out to online bank Swissquote.  Other high-profile HSM initiatives include the Komainu project involving hardware wallet provider Ledger, Gemalto, Global Advisors Holdings and Japanese bank Nomura, slated for launch in early Q2. Demetrios Skalkotos, global head of Ledger Vault, pointed out that Komainu uniquely has been granted access to integrate its software directly into the Gemalto HSM blueprint.  “Only banks and governments have that to my knowledge,” he said.  Trustology, backed by ethereum design studio Consensys, is also making strides with an HSM crypto custody solution. Alex Batlin, the CEO of Trustology, said people like the sound of cold storage because it’s offline, but it’s really just replacing a network with a human, who can still be influenced to behave in nefarious ways.  “All cold storage does is give you a false sense of security and also very high latency for instruction execution,” Batlin said.  However, Mike Belshe, CEO of crypto custody pioneer BitGo, has argued that the latency and human involvement are a small price to pay for the security afforded by cold storage. He told CoinDesk last year:  “If you put the keys online, or if you put the keys so close to being online that you can move money within 15 minutes, that means you don't have very tight control on it. The customers we talk to appreciate this point of view.”  IBM image from Construct 2017 via CoinDesk archives.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/03/12/ibm-quietly-enters-crypto-custody-market-with-tech-designed-for-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/277940047f15bf51c7ef5900dd41150e6acf7785-1500x1002.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Trust Wallet users can now, therefore, purchase XRP, bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH) with ""major"" credit and debit cards. The announcement did not specify which cards are supported or other details such as fees.  “We want to increase access to crypto and decentralized applications for all users,” said Viktor Radchenko, founder of Trust Wallet.

42430266,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqJFh,1552401156,SEC Chair Clayton Affirms Agency's Stance Ether Is No Longer a Security,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's chairman has seconded a colleague's analysis that found the world's second-largest cryptocurrency likely does not qualify as a security.  Last year, SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman said during a speech that ethereum, the No. 2 coin by market cap, did not exhibit the properties of a security. At the time, he explained that he did not see a central group as being responsible for the cryptocurrency.  Congressman Ted Budd – with industry advocacy group Coin Center – asked for clarification on whether SEC Chairman Jay Clayton agreed with Hinman's remarks. The regulator has now responded by saying he agrees ""that the analysis of whether a digital asset is offered or sold as a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the instrument.""  A cryptocurrency may be sold as a security when it is first launched if it meets the definition of an investment contract, but the digital asset may later be sold or offered to consumers without being investments, Clayton wrote in a letter dated March 7, adding:  ""I agree with Director Hinman's explanation of how a digital asset transaction may no longer represent an investment contract if, for example, purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts. Under those circumstances, the digital asset may not represent an investment contract under the Howey framework.""  The letter did not mention ethereum by name, however.  Past statements  Clayton's letter echoes comments he made at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest last year, where he likened digital assets to tickets for a new play. At the time, Clayton suggested that a group of investors might be promised ""a suite of tickets"" in return for funding the play, which would qualify these tickets as securities.  However, if at a later date, tickets are only sold to give each theatergoer a chance to see the play, ""that's decentralized,"" he added.  This aspect of decentralization is important, according to Clayton. He'd earlier touched on the point while discussing bitcoin, noting that ""generally an asset like bitcoin, where [it's] decentralized,"" does not fit within a securities designation.  ""No one is creating it for their own ... control of bitcoin, it's designed to be a payment system replacement for sovereign currencies,"" he said. ""We've determined that that doesn't have the attributes of a security ... as far as I'm concerned, that's designed to be akin to the dollar, the yen, the euro ... and it operates that way. People who purchase it are expecting it to operate that way.""

42430276,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqJVh,1552393849,EU Report: Blockchain Adoption Will Be Led by Permissioned Platforms,"The “first wave” of blockchain adoption will be led by permissioned platforms focused on specific use cases or user bases, according to a new EU report.  The EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum published the ""thematic report"" last week, produced on its behalf by ConsenSys AG and titled “Scalability, Interoperability and Sustainability of Blockchains.”  The document argues that blockchains focused on meeting the specific needs of users provide “a great deal of flexibility” compared to public blockchains. Builders of private platforms also have more freedom to design for performance and security, the authors say.  The EU organization therefore concludes that a small number of global blockchain networks will emerge as “the backbone of a Web of Value.”  However, it continues, three key challenges remain: scalability, that is, the ability to make large volumes of transactions at high speed; interoperability, being able to exchange data across blockchains; and sustainability, ""environmentally responsible"" platforms with long-term viability.  The group states:  ""It seems clear to us that a multiverse of independent blockchains that cannot interoperate would be severely limited. Users of blockchain platforms will find it beneficial to be able to exchange data and make transactions between chains too: a healthcare chain connecting to an insurance chain, a real-estate chain connecting to a construction materials or manufacturing chain, and so on.""  If blockchain platforms are to be successful, they should be able to scale to meet the needs of their target audience, it added.  The EU forum also expects blockchain technology to “become less energy-intensive over time.”  As for what will create successful large-scale blockchain projects, the report said teams will need “a clear vision” of what they want to achieve, “a clear reason” for using blockchain over traditional technologies, “strong governance structures” and “sharing of effort and expertise among diverse stakeholders.”  While Europe has been “very supportive” in the blockchain space, the authors said, there is “much still to be discovered and developed.” Therefore, the organization believes that “a light-touch approach, allowing for experimentation,” is the best way forward at present.  The authors write:  “Both the US and China have expressed strong support for blockchain research, with the former even going so far as to include it as part of its USD 700 billion defence budget. We therefore recommend that the EU continue its strong support, targeting both basic research as well as supporting implementation of infrastructure-related projects in particular, as well as research into non-technical topics such as governance of blockchain projects.”  The EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum was launched by the European Commission early last year with the aim of identifying key initiatives, monitoring developments and promoting common action in the area of blockchain technology.  The group expects to publish another blockchain report focused on issues of privacy and confidentiality in the second half of 2019.

42430318,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqJhh,1552388419,Bitcoin Will Soon See 'Bull Cross' in First Since August 2018,"View  Bitcoin's 50-day moving price average could soon move above the 100-day moving average, confirming its first bullish crossover in seven months.  While the bullish crossover is a lagging indicator, the current slope of the MAs is signaling bearish exhaustion. So, bitcoin could rise toward $4,236 (Dec. 24 high) in the near future, as suggested by other longer duration indicators and the bullish candle created on Feb. 27.  The bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance below $3,658 (Feb. 27 low).  A widely-followed bitcoin (BTC) price indicator is about to turn bullish for the first time in seven months.  Bitcoin's 50-day moving average (MA) – currently located at $3,669, according to Bitstamp data – could soon move above the 100-day MA at $3,670. The event would confirm the average's first bullish crossover since the end of August 2018.  However, the bull cross is a lagging indicator, being based on past data, and in this instance is likely more a product of bitcoin’s recovery rally from lows near $3,100 seen in December.  That said, with several key indicators, like the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the money flow index flashing early signs of bullish reversal, the probability of the cross trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market seems low.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,860, having clocked a low of $3,791 earlier today.  Daily chart  As seen above, the 50-day MA is taking an upward turn and is about to cross the 100-day MA from below.  Further, BTC's repeated defense of the 100-day MA over the last 12 days has strengthened the bullish case put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27.  As a result, BTC could soon rise toward the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance, currently located just below the bearish lower high of $4,236 printed on Dec. 24.  A UTC close higher would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change and could yield a rally to $5,000.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs produced a bullish crossover two weeks ago. BTC also defended the 10-candle MA in the previous two weeks, reinforcing the bullish reversal signaled by the MA studies.  In the near-term, BTC looks likely to challenge the recent high of $4,190.

42430274,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqJPh,1552386036,Korean Actor Invests in Blockchain Seafood Trade Startup,"Popular South Korean actor and businessman Bae Yong-joon has invested an undisclosed sum in blockchain-based seafood trade startup Seamon.  Revealing the news exclusively to CoinDesk Korea, Seamon head Lee Jung-hoon said that, while he cannot disclose the amount of Bae's investment, it is “a meaningful amount” worth “more than tens of millions"" of South Korean won. One hundred million won is worth around $88,510 at press time.  Lee further said that Bae has long been interested in the food businesses, including marine products. So, when Lee asked Bae to be an advisor to the Seamon project, he instead “signed an investment contract last month.”  Seamon is developing a blockchain-based seafood transaction and smart contract system, according to information from its white paper. The project aims to make global seafood transactions “as transparent as possible, reduce unnecessary expenses, and achieve the faster and safer international transactions.”  The team is also creating a cryptocurrency called Seamon coin, which will be used in payments and as a store of value. It is also planning to launch an exchange called SeamonX for seafood trading market in Q3 or Q4 of this year, the white paper indicates.  The project aims to address common problems with the international trade in marine products such as defaulting on payments, or late payments. With marine products, this is a particularly vital issue to solve, as their freshness quickly expires, the report says.  Importers will be able to purchase Seamon coins from SeamonX and exchange them for products, making payments in real time. Exporters will be able to exchange the tokens for fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, or the stablecoin tether (USDT), Lee said.  Seamon coin is already listed on the BCEX exchange with the ticker symbol SMEX, according to CoinDesk Korea. The exchange will also carry out a free distribution, or ""airdrop,"" of about 5 billion won ($4.42 million) in tokens from March 25.  CoinDesk Korea also adds that the news marks Bae's first known investment in a blockchain startup. His net worth is estimated at around $135 million.

Announcing the news on Monday, Overstock said Bankorus’ blockchain platform allows individuals and institutions to “securely” buy, sell, store and lend digital assets.  “The addition of Bankorus to Medici Ventures’ portfolio of companies will further our work in building the foundation of a blockchain-based technology stack for society,” said Jonathan Johnson, president of Medici Ventures.  Johnson said:  “Bankorus has built a revolutionary blockchain banking platform that dovetails nicely with Medici Ventures’ goals of eliminating middlemen, democratizing capital, and rehumanizing commerce by helping individuals access and control their own digital assets.”  Founded in 2013, Beijing-based Bankorus has adopted the mission to unlock more than $60 trillion in traditional assets held by high-net-worth individuals and redirect it into cryptocurrencies. The firm aims to turn traditional and illiquid assets such as real estate, art, hedge funds and bonds into liquid digital assets through its security token marketplace.  With the new acquisition, Medici Ventures’ global portfolio of companies now stands at a total of 20.  In December, Medici also purchased a 29.6 percent stake in digital securities firm Chainstone Labs for about $3.6 million.  Medici’s own security token marketplace, tZERO, went live in January with its own tZERO Preferred (TZROP) token as the sole listed asset initially. Trading volume was light, however, and the token's price dropped sharply soon after the launch.  Last month, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne told CoinDesk he expected volumes to soar after the year-long lock-up period for the token ends in August and the platform opens up to retail investors. Currently, tZERO is restricted to accredited investors only.

Securities Times, a Chinese financial news publication, reported Monday that the company, known for its Avalon line of mining devices, has raised ""several hundred million U.S. dollars,"" valuing the firm at over $1 billion. When contacted by CoinDesk, the firm declined to comment. However, two sources close to the company confirmed the raise without disclosing further details.  The news comes months after Canaan's application for an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange failed to advance to a listing hearing and subsequently became invalid. It was reported in January that the firm might be planning another IPO application in New York.  The funding effort also comes amid the decline in the overall cryptocurrency market, especially over the second half of 2018, which has had an impact on crypto mining equipment makers in terms of product sales.  For instance, Canaan's two major rivals, Bitmain and Ebang, both filed for IPOs in September and June 2018 respectively.  However, in a renewed filing at the end of December, Ebang disclosed that it experienced ""significant decreases in revenue and gross profit"" for Q3 2018. Similarly, Bitmain also posted about $500 million loss in an updated financial record filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as part of its IPO application.  If Bitmain does not graduate to a listing hearing by March 26, six months after the initial filing, its IPO application too will lapse.

42430265,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqJ9h,1552359910,The SEC's Crypto Czar Is Hitting the Road – And She Wants to Meet You,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is going on tour in hopes of meeting with crypto entrepreneurs who otherwise might not engage with the regulator.  FinHub, the SEC's branch dedicated to interacting with tech startups, posted a notice last week that it would be visiting major U.S. cities, allowing individuals or teams to set up face-to-face meetings with agency staffers to ask questions or provide feedback about issuing tokens or other issues under the regulator's purview.  The road trip begins in San Francisco on March 26, at the SEC's local office, with the next visit planned for Denver.  While FinHub staffers at the meetings are able to answer questions about startups' projects, they will not be able to provide legal advice, said Valerie Szczepanik, the SEC's senior advisor for digital assets and innovation and associate director of the Division of Corporation Finance.  ""We can’t give legal advice to any individual or member of the public, but we often give guidance to folks as they talk us through their proposed projects,"" Szczepanik, who will attend the San Franciso event, told CoinDesk.  Some of the SEC's past enforcement actions have come about after crypto startups self-reported possible securities law violations to the regulator. Gladius Network LLC, one such project, settled charges of running an unregistered securities offering without admitting to (or denying) the charges, and the SEC did not fine the startup because the company reported itself to the agency.  Another startup, CoinAlpha, did receive a $50,000 fine after the SEC reached out about its unregistered securities offering, but the company settled the charges and did not admit to or deny the allegations.  As such, the penalties imposed on these firms that cooperated are relatively light.  SEC goes 'P2P'  The purpose of these face-to-face meetings – dubbed ""Local P2P"" on the FinHub website – is to help crypto startups ""put a human face on the regulator,"" Szczepanik explained:  ""We really do want to engage with folks that are seeking to innovate in this area and they should know that it’s typically a positive experience. I’m hoping to keep this going at the local level too, recognizing that not everyone can travel to D.C. or New York.""  The number of startups that have reached out to FinHub to ask for a review of its token offering process or more general advice since its launch last October is not public, and it is unclear how many startups have scheduled meetings for March 26.  However, only a few startups have provided feedback to the branch so far. As noted by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce last week during the DC Blockchain Summit, only ""five or six letters"" have been submitted to the group's request for feedback on a letter issued by Dalia Blass, director of the Division of Investment Management.  The letter effectively bars firms from launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which derive value using cryptocurrencies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (most bitcoin ETFs filed to date have been filed under the Securities Act of 1933).  ""We really need people to be writing in,"" Peirce said.  On Monday, Szczepanik said the SEC was seeing positive interest with FinHub.  ""We’re pleased with the kind of engagement that we’ve gotten through FinHub,"" Szczepanik said. ""It helps when people tell us about friction points so we know what those points are and what we might need to address as we think through the gamut of appropriate regulatory responses.""
