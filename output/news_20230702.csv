The implementation aims to improve performance, scalability, and cost efficiency for users managing their ENS domains. The decentralized domain name system is set to implement off-chain resolvers, leveraging an ENS off-chain registrar contract and the services of Coinbase’ cb.id, Lens Protocol, and OptiNames on the Optimism network. This step comes as the L2 ecosystem continues to witness an influx of projects and protocols. According to L2Beat data, the total value of assets locked on L2 service providers has surged by over 190% in the past year, standing at $9.78 billion at the time of writing. Arbitrum leads the market with a 60% share and a total value locked (TVL) of $5.87 billion. ENS domain name registrations experienced robust growth in Q2 2021. Dune Analytics data shows monthly ENS domain name registrations totalling 79,463 last quarter. June, marked by a significant drop in gas fees on the Ethereum Network, recorded the highest number of registrations during the quarter with 35,932 ENS name registrations. While .eth name registrations ended Q2 with a surge, primary ENS name registrations saw a notable decline. A primary ENS name is a unique domain name registered and associated with an Ethereum address on the ENS platform. Moreover, ENS registered a cumulative profit of $4.8 million between April 1 and June 30, despite a 21% dip in revenue during this period. ENS’ annualized revenue has fallen by 5.11%, as per Token Terminal. The daily price performance chart of ENS showed an increase in ENS token accumulation since mid-June, along with a corresponding 22% value growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators were on an upward trajectory, indicating a bullish run. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the user-friendliness of the Ethereum network by replacing complex blockchain addresses with easy-to-remember names. With the latest move of introducing Layer 2 interoperability, ENS Labs takes a significant stride towards improving the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of managing ENS domains. This development arrives amidst a growing trend of Layer 2 adoption across the blockchain sphere, an effort to counteract the scalability and performance bottlenecks often associated with the Ethereum mainnet. By enabling Layer 2 solutions, ENS is not only keeping pace with industry trends but also reaffirming its commitment to user experience and network efficiency.

14423249,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/four-layer-architecture-proposed-for-polygon-2-0,1688299200,Four-Layer Architecture Proposed For Polygon 2.0 $MATIC,"Crypto infrastructure developer Polygon Labs has proposed a new, four-layered architectural design for its upcoming ""Polygon 2.0"" project. The announcement, made on June 29, offers a detailed look at the planned infrastructure, which comprises four unique ""layers"" working in tandem to secure and scale networks built on the protocol. With a bridge aggregator set to make transactions “near-instant and atomic,” Polygon 2.0 is poised to dramatically reshape the crypto industry. Polygon 2.0: A Four-Layered Approach The new proposal outlines the foundation of the project, the “staking layer,” which is currently in existence. This layer comprises a ""validator manager"" contract on Ethereum, along with an additional ""chain manager"" contract for each Polygon chain. Future Polygon chains will be able to form by launching new chain manager contracts on Ethereum. Built on top of this staking layer will be an ""interoperability layer,"" providing bridges to connect each Polygon chain via Ethereum. This layer will also feature an aggregator that combines individual zero-knowledge proofs from each bridge into one proof before sending it to Ethereum, enabling “seamless” bridge transactions and “dramatically reducing Ethereum gas consumption for proof verification,” according to the team. Polygon Labs elaborates in its announcement: ""We believe this proposal can and should direct all Polygon protocol development efforts moving forward, serving both as the conceptual North Star and the formal development framework."" The two remaining layers of Polygon 2.0 will include the current execution layer, which relies upon the Erigon Ethereum client, and a ""proving layer"" that will standardize the zero-knowledge-proof process across all Polygon chains. A Future-Proof Infrastructure Polygon isn't the only network attempting to transform into a multi-chain ecosystem. Other developers like zkSync Era and Optimism are working on similar strategies, but Polygon 2.0's unique four-layered approach sets it apart. In a statement, the team promises more information on each layer in the future, stating: ""Polygon 2.0 consists of four protocol layers, each enabling an important process within the network: Staking Layer, Interop Layer, Execution Layer, Proving Layer."" With the proposal now public, the network’s validators will need to approve it. Polygon 2.0's vision, as expressed by the development team, is to establish “the value layer” of the internet, promising a more secure and scalable network. Just as the internet is an elastically scalable, unified environment for accessing information, Polygon 2.0 seeks to serve as an elastically scalable, unified environment for accessing value. Parallels With Early Internet Innovations With a vision of enabling an ""Internet of Blockchains"", Polygon 2.0's strategic design could revolutionize the scalability and interoperability of blockchain technology. Polygon Labs’ commitment to enhancing the tech stack and protocol layers supports the global shift towards decentralized systems, heralding a new era in digital innovation and resource management. The suggested architecture of Polygon 2.0 is reminiscent of the Internet protocol suite, a modular, flexible, and efficient framework that has become the backbone of our global digital ecosystem. Each layer in the proposed Polygon 2.0 is designed to facilitate a specific sub-process, streamlining the protocol implementation, updates, and potentially transforming the way we interact with the blockchain. In the broader context of the blockchain space, this development reflects the industry's collective pursuit of scalability, efficiency, and interoperability. As an increasing number of organizations turn to blockchain solutions for various applications, the necessity for adaptable, scalable, and unified frameworks becomes even more apparent. In providing such an architecture, Polygon 2.0 could significantly contribute to the blockchain ecosystem's growth and the wider acceptance of decentralized solutions.

14418917,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540742,1688289110,Compound (COMP) Grows 33% In 7 Days As Whale Activities Soar,"Compound (COMP), the governance token of the Compound protocol, has experienced a remarkable surge in value over the past week, positioning itself as one of the top gainers in the cryptocurrency market. The token’s price has risen by an impressive 33% within a span of just seven days. Whale Activity Behind Price Increase The recent surge in COMP’s price can be attributed to several factors. One significant catalyst is the presence of whale activity and potential institutional investors. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain shed some light on this phenomenon, revealing that a notable wallet identified as ‘0x0D5’ has been involved in substantial transactions involving COMP. Related reading: ENS Rises 10% As Ethereum Name Service Considers Expanding To Layer-2 The wallet transferred 3 million USDT to Binance and extracted 50,000 COMP, equivalent to around $2.26 million, just two days ago. Shortly after, the same entity withdrew an additional 120,000 COMP, valued at approximately $5.53 million, from Binance. This also followed the activities of other whales who moved significant volumes of COMP during this period. These significant transfers often indicate bullish behavior and can have an impact on the token’s supply and demand dynamics, thus influencing its price. COMP Current Price And Future Prospects The recent price surge and increased trading activity indicate growing investor interest in COMP. The token has surpassed multiple resistance levels and is currently trading above $54.68, boasting a market capitalization of $424 million. Moreover, COMP has added over $200 million to its market cap in recent weeks, surging from less than $200 million to its current valuation. The token’s daily trading volume has also witnessed a significant surge, indicating heightened market participation. Over the past two weeks, COMP has exhibited a substantial growth pattern, recording a 70% gain. Starting last month at a low of $25 per token, COMP now commands a price of $55.01. Related Reading: Ethereum Co-Founder Thinks The Over $40 Billion Staked ETH Can Be Stolen As Compound continues to attract attention and recognition in the cryptocurrency market, the token’s future prospects appear promising. The presence of whale activity, increased market capitalization, and trading volume suggest that COMP may continue its upward trajectory. However, it is crucial to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate rapidly. Monitoring market conditions and staying informed about the latest developments is essential for making informed investment choices regarding COMP or any other digital asset. Despite a slight decline of 1.40% in the last 24 hours, COMP saw a growth of 0.26% in the past hour. Currently trading at $53.06 per COMP, the token is still 94.00% below its all-time high of $911.20. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

Bridges allow users to swap tokens between different blockchains using a smart contract by locking value on one network, and releasing it on another.  PolyNetwork attackers were likely able to manipulate the way the bridge works and trick it into issuing tokens on one network which, in reality, did not exist.  Attackers minted 24 billion binance usd (BUSD) and bnb (BNB) on the Metis blockchain, 999 trillion shiba inu (SHIB) on the Heco blockchain, and millions of other tokens on various other networks, such as Avalanche and Polygon. This meant the attackers’ wallet held over $42 billion worth of tokens (on paper) immediately following the attack.  But an abject lack of liquidity prevented the attackers from monetizing the gigantic token stash. Metis developers confirmed there was no “sell liquidity available” for the BNB and BUSD, while the illicitly-issued METIS tokens were locked on the PolyNetwork bridge by developers.  However, the attacker found liquidity for other illicitly-minted tokens and was able to exchange 94 billion SHIB tokens for 360 ether (ETH), 495 million COOK for 16 ether and 15 million RFuel for 27 ether, analytics firm Lookonchain said.  “We noticed that hackers are transferring assets and 1 $ETH to new wallets, most likely for sale,” Lookonchain added.  Sunday’s attack was the second time PolyNetwork had been targeted by attackers. The protocol was exploited for $600 million in August 2021 – a then record hack – after the alleged leak of a private key that was used to sign a cross-chain message. As such, bridges remain a key, yet vulnerable, part of the crypto ecosystem: They are important for enabling the transfer of billions of dollars worth of tokens between various networks but have been the topmost target for attacks and hacks in the industry’s history.",NEGATIVE,ETH | SHIB | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SHIB | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/02/polynetwork-attacker-issues-worthless-billions-in-shib-bnb-busd-in-latest-crypto-hack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6706b9b5e2d90eda477c46d9b58442435abbd8a-3348x1883.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14415833,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540721,1688281709,ENS Rises 10% As Ethereum Name Service Considers Expanding To Layer-2,"In a recent community call, the team behind the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) revealed plans to adopt a Layer-2 platform in light of increasing gas fees on the mainnet. In response to this planned move, ENS prices climbed roughly 10%, floating higher with increasing trading volumes, evident in the daily chart. The Ethereum Name Service ENS is a decentralized naming system on Ethereum. It provides an easy-to-use and human-readable naming system that allows users to rename mainnet addresses, smart contracts, and other resources. This system permits users to create and employ memorable domain names instead of complicated addresses. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Takes Investors By Surprise With 23% Rally The team behind the ENS believes their solution makes it easier for everyone to interact with the pioneer smart contracting platform, and is handy, especially in sending and receiving transactions. In this arrangement, the platform maps a user’s domain, the human-readable address, with their original address or deployed smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet. However, since ENS maps all addresses on the Ethereum mainnet, transaction fees apply, a concern considering the fluctuating gas fees on Ethereum. In Ethereum, all transactions, including transfers or smart contract deployment, must be paid for. The amount paid depends on the level of demand in the network, and the value tends to be volatile. Over the past few weeks, Ethereum gas fees have been rising. Fluctuating Gas Fees According to YCharts data on June 30, the average gas fee for sending a transaction stood at $34.62, down from $42.77 recorded on June 5. As of May 12, it stood at $77.88. The only time gas fees on Ethereum fell was on June 25, when it was at $16.58. At this level, the gas fee is relatively high compared to other networks. For example, the average transaction fee in Bitcoin was $2.383 on June 30, down from $9.018 on May 12. Meanwhile, in layer-2 platforms, transaction fees and smart contract deployment costs are relatively lower, according to trackers. As an illustration, gas fees on Optimism, a popular Ethereum layer-2, is $0.03 as of July 2. Related Reading: Polygon 2.0 Upgrade – Potential Bullish Implications For MATIC Price? Considering the high gas fees on Ethereum, ENS, via two improvement proposals, ENSIP-10 and EIP-3668, will further expand to a Layer-2 platform as a relief for users sensitive to high gas fees on Ethereum as part enhancing interoperability. During the call, the team said this would scale the platform and open the service to more people. In response, ENS prices are up 10% on the last trading day, changing hands at $9.42 at the back of increasing trading volumes. Still, it remains to be seen whether prices will continue edging higher once the platform migrates to a Layer-2 platform. For now, ENS has registered over 2.73 million names owned by more than 697,000 entities.

14414440,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540716,1688278380,Ethereum Co-Founder Thinks The Over $40 Billion Staked ETH Can Be Stolen,"It appears that the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, doesn’t trust the security of infrastructure allowing ETH staking. Consequently, in a recent interview, Buterin stated that he would only stake a limited amount of coins to ensure the network is distributed and remain robust against malicious agents who might try to take over the platform, reversing transactions. Vitalik Buterin Has Doubts On Ethereum Staking Buterin has raised concerns about the potential risks of ETH staking through third-party infrastructure, specifically regarding the exposure of private keys and the danger it poses to his entire stake. He believes that implementing a multi-signature system could provide better protection. However, the current process is more difficult to set up, leading to his increased caution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Up 55% Following BlackRock’s ETF Application, EDX Markets Launch In a multi-sig system, users have their private key to sign transactions. A specific number of signatures must be provided to approve a transaction, which varies based on the Ethereum wallet’s configuration. This setup boosts security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to funds. During the Bankless Podcast, the co-founder explains: Probably the biggest reason why I personally am not just staking all of my ETH, that I’m instead staking a fairly small portion, is because if you stake your ETH, it has to be all out, like the keys that access it have to be public on some system that’s online, and for safety, it has to be a multi-sig, and multi-sigs for staking are still fairly difficult to set up, and it gets complicated in a bunch of ways. ETH Prices Stable Below $2,000 His remarks have generated a lot of discussion. Most critics are concerned about the entire security framework of Ethereum. After shifting from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system, Ethereum relies on a network of validators who have to stake at least 32 ETH for a chance to approve a block of transactions and earn block rewards and transaction fees. These validators are also needed to secure the network; without them, the blockchain will be susceptible to attacks. Related Reading: Binance CEO Goes Bullish On Bitcoin – What’s The Inside Scoop? According to on-chain data, there are over 643,000 validators spread across the globe who have staked over 20.5 million ETH. On average, each validator has staked 32.17 ETH. Notably, the validator count has steadily risen over the years, and the number of ETH staked has sharply increased despite the recent upgrade permitting stakers to unlock their coins. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and one of the original co-founders of Ethereum, said he was “lost for words,” clarifying that all their ADA is staked as expected in a “properly designed proof-of-stake system.” At the time of writing, ETH prices remain firm and weren’t affected by Buterin’s comments. However, the coin is yet to breach $2,000 and trends below April 2023 highs in early July 2023.
