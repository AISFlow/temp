13220899,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=484343,1645574392,"Stablecoin Supply Near $200 Billion, Faster Growth Than Rest of Crypto","Stablecoin supply shows significant growth during the year. The market cap of the top stablecoins is roughly $181 billion, over 11% of the total crypto market, which is now at $1,6 trillion after shedding over $140 billion in the past two days over geopolitical concerns. Consequently, data shows that stablecoins are growing at a much faster pace than the crypto market this year. Faster Than The Crypto Market Having significantly accelerated their pace since 2020, data from Arcane research shows that stablecoins like USDT, USDC, BUSD, UST, and DAI are growing faster than the crypto market. Tether (USTD) still takes the lead of all stablecoins with a 44% market share and a $79 billion market cap at the time of writing. USD Coin (USDC) follows reporting a market share of 29% and a capitalization of over $57 billion. Binance USD (BUSD) takes third place with a 20% share and $18 billion market cap. The following chart shows the total circulating supply near $200 billion. However, the stablecoin USDT has not reported a very active growth since the summer of 2021, growing merely 1% in 2022. On the other hand, USDC has been growing extremely fast since last year, reporting a 20% growth in 2022 alone. By the end of 2021, Arcane Research had projected the fast growth of USDC to outshine USDT and eventually take its crown. Given the previous numbers, they are now projecting for USDC to become the largest stablecoin by market cap at the e...",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,MARKET | USDT | RESEARCH | BNB | USDC,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/stablecoin-supply-near-200-billion-faster-growth-than-rest-of-crypto/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42395973,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0JVB,1645573206,"First Mover Asia: GameFi's Shaky Prospects; Bitcoin, Ether Inch Higher","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Markets and prices: Bitcoin and ether rose slightly. Major indexes and gold were in the red.  Insights: GameFi faces a shaky future in the Asia-Pacific region partly because of strict regulations.  Technician's take: BTC is 43% off its all-time high near $69K, and upside appears limited.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $38,133 +2.5%  Ether (ETH): $2,635 +1.8%  Top Gainers  ` Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC +3.6% Smart Contract Platform EOS EOS +2.2% Smart Contract Platform Polygon MATIC +2.0% Smart Contract Platform`  Top Losers  ` Asset Ticker Returns Sector XRP XRP −0.1% Currency Internet Computer ICP −0.1% Computing Filecoin FIL 0.0% Computing`  Bitcoin was up slightly on Tuesday but was still trading near its January lows when the largest crypto by market cap shed about 50% of its value. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at about $38,100, about 2.5% higher than its price 24 hours ago.  Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was trading just over $2,600, up nearly 2% for the same period. Most other major cryptos were in the green. Investors continued to monitor the escalating tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border. OANDA Senior Market Analyst, The Americas Edward Moya, wrote in an email that bitcoin's price could fluctuate significantly for the near future.  ""Cryptos remain the ultimate risky asset and the escalation Russia-Ukraine will likely keep the volatility elevated with swings to 20% in either direction,"" Moya said, although he added that ""geopolitical tensions"" and a more hawkish monetary position by the U.S. central bank are getting close to being priced in.""  ""This Crypto winter has been brutal but it might end once we get past that first Fed rate hike,"" Moya said.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,304 -1%  DJIA: 33,596 -1.4%  Nasdaq: 13,381 -1.2%  Gold: $1,898 -.04%  Insights  In Asia, GameFi Might Not Grow Like Investors Are Hoping  Billions of dollars have been deployed to the GameFi industry. But did anyone check with regulators in Asia, the most dynamic and important market for gaming and crypto?  If they did, they’d see that many regulators are hostile to GameFi. This isn’t reflected in laws made recently to address decentralized finance (DeFi), but rather from those already in existence.  As CoinDesk reported earlier this month, countries like South Korea and China have had laws about converting in-game tokens into fiat currency for nearly 15 years. The popularity of a game called Sea Talk, which had a liquid exchange market for tokens to won, made the government write laws that specifically addressed the issue.  Article 28 of Korea’s Gaming Industry Promotion Act — gaming is a serious industry in Korea and has its own regulatory code — strictly prohibits speculative acts, gambling and free gifts while Article 32 prohibits converting game tokens into cash.  In China, there are similar laws on the books. The mid-2000s popularity of Tencent’s QQ coins, tokens that were freely convertible to Chinese yuan, made the People’s Bank of China come down hard on the industry. Then, in 2017, the PBoC banned crypto trading entirely.  Finally, in Japan, legal experts are convinced that GameFi as a whole should be considered gambling.  One would think that investors pumping in billions of dollars to the sector would do a bit of due diligence first. You don’t need industry consultants to tell you that Asia is the world’s most important gaming market with its nearly one billion gamers.  After all, billions are invested to capture billions of players, right?  Not really. GameFi isn’t about the gamers – yet. It's about the yield.  Axie Infinity, with its long runway of VC cash, has 106,000 daily active users, mostly from developing countries like the Philippines. In contrast, according to data from Steam, some of the most popular games on the platform like Counter-Strike have active users in the 500,000 range, peaking weekly at around one million active users.  Do a quick sanity check and think about how many of your gaming friends are playing a blockchain game at the moment. Not talking about it, but playing it.  Just how many of these Axie Infinity users are actually gamers? Probably very few; the game isn’t known for its stunning gameplay – reviewers say that all it consists of is mindless clicking. Other blockchain games are said to not be much better.  Unless these games get good and start attracting players, this is all going to come crashing down soon.  Already Axie’s players are earning less than Jollibee’s employees as the in-game economy suffers from crippling inflation. With nobody actually wanting to play the game and everyone just wanting the yield, Axie’s ‘‘central bankers‘’ are having a tough time. Good thing there are no midterms.  It’s a tough sell for VCs eyeing demand in the Asia-Pacific region. These games can’t go mainstream in Asia’s major markets because authorities would crack down using laws they already have on the books. Yet, even if VCs don’t seem inclined to slow down with their GameFi deal-flow anytime soon, there’s going to be a point when they start getting nervous.  Too bad we can’t return to the simpler days of World of Warcraft’s gold farming, when China churned out digital gold for players in the West by “grinding” through monotonous tasks in-game (did you know that Steve Bannon once operated a World of Warcraft gold forex desk?). Everything old is new again, but World of Warcraft didn’t have fancy crypto tokens that are the apple in every VC’s eye.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Downtrend Persists; Support at $30K  Bitcoin (BTC) sellers were active over the weekend, which contributed to negative momentum. The cryptocurrency appears to be oversold on intraday charts, although a price bounce could be limited toward $40,000 resistance. Lower support is seen around $30,000, which could stabilize the sell-off.  BTC is down roughly 15% over the past week.  The downtrend since November 2021 remains intact, albeit within a long-term uptrend. That means price action has a tendency to rise exponentially following cycle lows. For now, indicators do not suggest BTC is at a cycle low.  Previous drawdowns suggest selling pressure could continue over the short-term.  Currently, BTC is 43% off its all-time high near $69,000 reached in November 2021, compared with a 50% drop during the first half of 2021, and a 70% decline during the March 2020 crash. The most extreme peak-to-trough decline was roughly 80% during the 2018 bear market.  In this cycle, buyers will need to maintain support around the $27,000-$30,000 support zone to maintain the broader trend.

42395962,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0JNJ,1645569188,Bitcoin Ticks Up as Biden Announces New Russia Sanctions,"Bitcoin (BTC) ticked up slightly after U.S. President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against Russia.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at $38,009 at press time. Bitcoin had remained flat throughout most of the day Tuesday after opening at just below $37,000.  Biden said, for the first time, during a press conference Tuesday that he views Russia’s latest move into two separatist regions of Ukraine as an “invasion.” He announced sanctions on Russia that would effectively “cut off western finance,” Bloomberg reported.  Biden's remarks Tuesday came a day after he announced smaller sanctions against Russia after the Kremlin said it was moving ""peace-keeping"" troops into Donetsk and Luhansk, which Russia has claimed as its own for years before the current escalation.  Biden also said the United States would provide additional supplies and troops to the nations in the Baltic region and Poland, according to Bloomberg.  Bitcoin investors have been monitoring the growing tensions over Ukraine as Russia reportedly ponders a full-scale invasion, though analysts are split over the long- and short-term implications.  Last week, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dipped below $40,000 for the first time since Jan. 21 causing traders to ponder how Russia’s growing military presence in Ukraine will shake up the crypto market.  ""For people like me who are very long-term focused and quietly accumulating bitcoin on a daily basis, it's the asset that will supply the most security and value overall,"" said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics. ""For traders and speculators, it's a simple trade equation designed to generate fiat. For them, it's an exciting and volatile risk-on trade. The question is, whose narrative will be stronger?""  So far, bitcoin hasn’t been the inflation hedge many had hoped.  “Bitcoin is approaching a retest of the intermediate round level of $35,000, near where buyers became more active at the end of last month,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior financial analyst at FxPro. “Given the changed macroeconomic conditions, will the crypto remain as interesting at these same levels?”  He still believes fundamentals will drive the long growth for bitcoin is stronger as overarching tensions in Europe subside.  Don Kaufman, an analyst at TheoTrade, told CoinDesk TV last week that the prospect of large-scale sanctions against Russia could be a potential bull run for bitcoin as Russia looks to the crypto market to navigate potential global punishment for its Ukraine moves.  “Bitcoin could have one last major plunge before longer-term investors feel more confident coming back in,” said Edward Moya, analyst at Oanda.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Brian Evans,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/22/bitcoin-ticks-up-as-biden-announces-new-russia-sanctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b124772b007730b4a0d46509c85f5414abc134a5-1704x1386.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395956,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0JHP,1645568398,Foundation Focused on UST Stablecoin Raises $1B in LUNA Sale,"Singapore-based Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a nonprofit organization supporting the growth of the Terra ecosystem, has raised $1 billion through the sale of LUNA, the native token of the Terra blockchain.  The funding will go toward building a bitcoin-denominated foreign-exchange reserve for UST, an algorithmic-based stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem, according to a statement.  The funding round, which ranks among the largest in crypto history, was led by Jump Crypto and Three Arrows Capital, with participation from DeFiance Capital, Republic Capital, GSR Ventures and Tribe Capital, among others.  According to Luna Foundation Guard, the UST Forex Reserve aims to strengthen and protect the peg of the UST stablecoin, which is algorithmic-based, meaning that it relies on market incentives as opposed to being backed by collateral to maintain its price, like Tether and Circle are.  “Although the widespread adoption of UST as a consistently stable asset through market volatility should already refute this, a decentralized Reserve can provide an additional avenue to maintain the peg in contractionary cycles that reduces the reflexivity of the system,” Terra wrote in a tweet.  Terra has set tongues wagging recently. Earlier this month, the Terra network spent $40 million on a sponsorship for the Washington Nationals baseball team.

42395972,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0JUC,1645564564,Market Wrap: Cryptocurrencies Fall as Sentiment Turns Bearish,"Cryptocurrencies and equities continued to suffer Tuesday amid increasing geopolitical tensions.  Western nations prepared to launch sanctions against Russian financial interests after efforts to de-escalate the conflict between Russia and Ukraine soured over the past few days. On Tuesday, U.S. officials declared Russia's movement of troops into the eastern, separatist region of Ukraine as ""the beginning of an invasion.""  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were roughly flat over the past 24 hours, compared with a 7% drop in XRP and a 5% loss in SHIB. Most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) underperformed BTC on Tuesday, suggesting a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders.  Some analysts expect choppy price action to persist over the short term, although market panic could eventually fade.  Typically, S&P 500 stock index sell-offs because of geopolitical events have been short-lived, according to a report by Deutsche Bank. The firm's research shows the median sell-off was -5.7%, lasting around three weeks, before reaching a trough, and then another three weeks to recovery from prior levels.  Given the rising correlation between BTC and the S&P 500, some traders are patiently waiting for the decline across speculative assets to settle.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $38032, −0.73%    ●Ether (ETH): $2613, −1.73%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4305, −1.02%    ●Gold: $1903 per troy ounce, +0.22%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.95%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technicals show short-term support for BTC at $37,000, although stronger support is around $30,000. For now, upside appears to be limited toward the $40,000-$45,000 resistance zone.  But the path forward for bitcoin could be volatile.  ""We've been seeing aggressive volatility selling with every BTC spike,"" QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm wrote in a Telegram announcement.  The firm expects BTC to grind lower with the possibility of a short squeeze on positive headlines. However, ""these spikes in spot price would probably be met with aggressive spot selling, capping the topside,"" QCP wrote.  Bearish sentiment  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index entered ""extreme fear"" territory last week. Similar to equities, crypto markets are experiencing an uptick in bearish sentiment, driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns.  In the bitcoin futures market, sentiment remains bearish, but not extreme. ""Liquidations still remain idle, once again suggesting that traders are careful with leverage,"" Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report.  And blockchain data show low network activity among bitcoin users.  ""This week, the degree of on-chain activity is languishing at the lower-bound of the bear market channel, which can hardly be interpreted as a signal of increased interest and demand for the asset,"" Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  Altcoin roundup  SAND token joins broader crypto market in gloomy outlook: SAND, the native token of the Ethereum-based virtual-reality platform The Sandbox, dipped below the widely tracked 200-day moving average (MA) on Tuesday, joining peers from other crypto sub-sectors in signaling a gloomy market mood, according to CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.

42421674,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXovRl,1645562729,So What If Part of Bitcoin's Code Was State-Funded?,"Last Saturday, renowned historian Adam Tooze published a blog that asked, indirectly, whether there is a back door to Bitcoin. Though primarily built and maintained by private developers, the first cryptocurrency network is essentially a public good. It’s open source, open access, open for you and me – the front door is wide open and there sits a Welcome mat. But what if there is a side door, too, through which a privileged group can gain more control and/or more information about Bitcoin?  Tooze, British-born and now at Columbia University, never asks that precise question. Like other public intellectuals, Tooze is lately in a situation of having to form opinions about an industry he has by and large ignored. Many former critics have recently done about-faces, others are forming new intellectual problems while many regurgitate the most common criticisms of crypto. As in his other works, like the monumental post-2008 crisis compendium “Crashed,” Tooze starts from first principles.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On what foundation does Bitcoin, sometimes called “digital real estate,” stand? “Commonly described as being anarcho-capitalist,” Tooze finds it ironic that some of Bitcoin’s key attributes were developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and other state organizations. Specifically, Bitcoin uses a hash function called SHA-256, a strong cryptographic proof that allows users to hide and compress information through a mathematical “hashing” operation. It’s actually part of a family of ciphers developed by the NSA in the back half of the 20th century, some of which are known to be compromised.  See also: Tor Network Compromised by Single Hacker  “One of the core pieces of software in [B]itcoin, a system of currency supposedly designed to minimize reliance on government[,] was created by America’s digital spymasters-in-chief, the NSA,” Tooze writes. For Tooze, two questions follow. Shouldn’t this fact “upend” crypto's “narrative?” And, has anyone thought about this? On the latter point, there’s a general rule in crypto that states any problem you think you’ve found with Bitcoin was likely discussed a decade ago on Bitcoin Talk, a forum for newbies and fanatics (it’s the source of much of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto’s public commentary, for instance) to discuss the cryptocurrency.  But digging into the question Tooze didn’t ask: It’s honestly unknown whether there are “trap doors” in Bitcoin as a whole. Current understanding is the SHA-256 algorithm is secure, and the way it’s deployed in Bitcoin draws so much power just to create a hash that reversing it through brute force – an even more computationally intensive process – is wholly uneconomical until “quantum computers” arrive. (Tooze recommends reading Eswar Prasad on the technical details, so here’s a quick recap.)  It’s not unheard of for cryptographic systems to have unobvious ways to hack the code, but the information is public and breaking the near-trillion-dollar asset bitcoin is a hell of a “bug bounty.” This gets us to Tooze’s actual questions. Are the “politics” of Bitcoin “self-deluding?” Bitcoin is about minimizing trust in finance, but its operation requires that you trust algorithms designed by potentially nefarious actors. Ultimately, however, the issue stems from trying to force Bitcoin into predefined political scripts. Bitcoin is not “apolitical,” as many proponents argue, but it is a system that stands against the preceding decades of financial and political dealings. And that’s part of why Bitcoin is for more than just white, male libertarians.  Take the financial crisis from which Bitcoin was born. In some sense, the banking industry’s problem became everyone’s problem after a set of trusted institutions attempted to hide financial risk. The “alphabet soup” of economic bombs (CDOs, SPVs, CDSs) Tooze knows well, shielded systemic risk of compounding credit machines up until the point that banks’ hidden and toxic balance sheets started to unwind – and they had to unwind. Bitcoin may not be a perfect solution, but it is an alternative that sells itself on comparative transparency. If its arrival was a financial seachange, and it is, it's not because bitcoin provides certain economical assurances or transaction finality through math, but because anyone can audit the system, continually.  See also: The Privacy Boom Is Going to Change Everything  Bitcoin is a private currency with the desire of becoming public infrastructure – the “native currency of the internet.” Its cryptography shields certain aspects of the network (private keys) – but the network as a whole remains radically open. Cypherpunks, as the saying goes, “code.” They use the resources available at hand to build systems that preserve privacy or foster open systems. Whether this is “instrumentalization” – a coinage from economist Mariana Mazzucato referring to those who deny the state until they come to rely on it – is sort of besides the point.  There’s a theory I’d love to hear Tooze’s opinion on, that Bitcoin itself was built by the state. Perhaps it escaped from a CIA lab, just another tool the intelligence agency could have used to fund radicals or topple democracies. Satoshi Nakamoto’s nom du plume apparently translates to “central observer,” perhaps a little revealing detail with which ciphers love to sign their work. But even then, saying this “apolitical” system is foundationally, morally bankrupt because it uses state-developed code is just guilt by association.  As my colleague David Z. Morris noted, the internet itself – once spoken about as a libertarian realm – is littered with tools built or funded by the state, to say nothing of the NSA’s role in building privacy layers like Tor or SHA-256. “Most world-transforming innovations rely on a similar level of collective support, because basic or speculative research is usually not profitable fast enough for the private sector to invest in,” Morris wrote. You might need a creative mind to uncover new mathematical proofs, but they’re not created so much as discovered. The history of science is the discovery of natural laws.  Bitcoin adds to this chain of mutual discovery by saying that money, like knowledge, wants to be free.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/22/so-what-if-part-of-bitcoins-code-was-state-funded,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef339aa2f8745cd7ba779f8acca74558eccbd2f7-2400x1886.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395966,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0JOI,1645562673,Brazilian Senate Committee Approves Bill Regulating Crypto Transactions,"This article is adapted from CoinDesk Brasil, a partnership between CoinDesk and InfoMoney, one of Brazil's leading financial news publications. Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  The Brazilian Senate's economic affairs committee approved a bill Tuesday regulating crypto transactions.  The bill, introduced by Senator Flávio Arns, has to be voted on by the Senate plenary and, if approved, then by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. The executive branch then has the power to veto the bill.  After approving Arns' bill, the Brazilian Senate shelved two other crypto bills presented by senators Styvenson Valentim and Soraya Thronicke.  The bill presented by Arns creates the label ""virtual service providers"" for crypto companies, which will be subject to criminal liability for violations against the Brazilian financial system.  Arns’ bill keeps the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission from supervising the Brazilian crypto ecosystem – except for initial coin offerings (ICO) ≠ and allows the Brazilian executive branch to choose a supervisor.  In the bill, Arns also proposes joint overview of crypto between the Brazilian Central Bank and the tax collection agency, Receita Federal.  If the bill is approved, the executive branch will provide crypto companies with authorization to operate. In addition, crypto firms will have to notify the Brazilian Financial Activities Control Council of transactions suspected of money laundering.  The bill also specifies a new crime carried out with virtual assets, punishable by a penalty of between four and eight years in prison and a cash fine.

42410914,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtGRf,1645561594,"'Frozen' Bitcoin Tied to Canadian Protests Lands at Coinbase, Crypto.Com","Cryptocurrency tied to the Canadian truckers protesting COVID-19 restrictions has been on the move, in defiance of the authorities’ orders to freeze funds, blockchain analysis shows.  Nearly all of the roughly 20 BTC (about $788,000 U.S. at current exchange rates) sent to the Tallycoin fundraiser is gone from that address, with only 0.11 BTC left, according to Blockchain.com data.  Most of the 30 bitcoin wallets identified by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) as being attached to the fundraising have been largely drained as well, with only 6 BTC combined between them, on-chain data shows.  Whether the recipients will be able to use the funds to buy goods or services remains to be seen, however.  A CoinDesk review of the public ledger shows that four small portions of the roughly 20 bitcoin raised – about 0.14 BTC each – ended up at two centralized exchanges, Coinbase and Crypto.com. It is not clear whether the funds were cashed out for fiat or frozen at those platforms.  The situation highlights the limitations of a government’s ability to thwart transactions through decentralized, censorship-resistant systems – but also the limitations of those systems to circumvent such sanctions.  While the authorities cannot veto transactions on Bitcoin and similar networks, they have leverage over regulated companies that serve as the on- and off-ramps to those networks.  Honk honk  Backing up, in recent weeks, thousands of Canadians took to the streets in major cities to protest vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 restrictions. Dozens of trucks blocked the roads of Ontario as well as various border crossings to the U.S., filling the air with honking and bringing economic disruption.  The nation’s capital, Ottawa, found itself practically under siege. In order to disperse the trucks and protesters and bring an end to the weeks-long disruptions, on Feb. 14 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time since it was enacted in 1988. Part of the Act gives the government and banks the authority to freeze financial assets and accounts linked to protestors without a court order or judicial review process.  It also enabled police forces from across the country to coordinate and combine resources as they dismantled the convoy in Ottawa and elsewhere: As of Feb. 22, 191 people have been arrested and 107 people have been charged with obstructing police, disobeying a court order, assault, mischief, possessing a weapon and assaulting a police officer, CNN reported.  Unlike bank wires, transactions on decentralized blockchains typically cannot be stopped or frozen. An exception is when the smart contract for a non-native asset, such as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, allows the issuer to freeze certain addresses and prevent any further transactions, as Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, has done several times.  In contrast, bitcoin is not controlled by any central entity, so in case of a criminal investigation authorities can only blacklist certain addresses and order regulated crypto services to freeze any funds coming from them and not let the money out of their custodial wallets.  Following the money  On Feb. 16, Canadian police ordered that all regulated financial firms stop facilitating transactions for 34 wallets associated with the protestors (30 were bitcoin wallets and the rest held other cryptocurrencies). The police sent a letter to a number of banks and crypto exchanges, Canada’s The Globe and Mail reported, but didn’t specify which ones received the warning.  That night, at least some of the funds were distributed among unidentified parties and later sent to centralized exchanges Coinbase and Crypto.com, blockchain data shows. An address connected to the Tallycoin fundraising address, which the truckers had used to accumulate funds, sent 14.28 BTC to 101 addresses in even fractions of 0.14 BTC each.  On Feb. 17, in a separate legal fight brought by locals affected by the protest, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ordered that nine crypto platforms freeze accounts associated with 120 cryptocurrency addresses belonging to the movement. This means that if those platforms received funds from the listed addresses they should prevent any further movement of them. The list of addresses was provided via a Mareva injunction – a form of court-provided asset freezing.  The sending address for the Feb. 16 transaction was mentioned in the Mareva injunction, but not in the earlier list from the Canadian police.  On Feb. 17 and 18, four of the addresses on the Mareva injunction list sent 0.14 each BTC to Coinbase (1, 2) and Crypto.com (1, 2), either directly or via several intermediary addresses, according to data from the Crystal Blockchain analytics system. (Crystal confirmed CoinDesk’s findings.). It’s unclear whether users managed to sell the funds for fiat at these platforms.  Coinbase’s director of global policy communications, Ian Plunkett, said the firm has “nothing to share on specific transactions and accounts for obvious reasons,” and referred CoinDesk to a blog post by the exchange’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, on its rules for removing user accounts.  Crypto.com also declined to comment.  Do exchanges have to comply?  Centralized exchanges’ approaches to wallets sanctioned or blacklisted by authorities can vary, Crystal Blockchain’s head of data intelligence, Nicholas Smart, told CoinDesk.  “First off, does the exchange have to apply the sanctions? They may not if they are not facing the sanctioning market and don't do business there,” Smart said.  Coinbase and Crypto.com both do business in Canada (although they are not listed among financial institutions ordered to freeze funds by the Mareva injunction in the private lawsuit).  “Second, did they know about the listing, and at what point did they find out?” Smart went on. “This will change if they will stop a transfer and report it or if they simply will report the activity. That detection is also dependent on how good their transaction monitoring system is.”  Regulated financial institutions are also subject to “strict rules on tipping off criminals or others who are suspected of money laundering, so in that case they may process a transaction and report it,” Smart noted. “It's a sealed box though; we don't know if they are or are not reporting.”  ‘Eight grand in there’  The global bitcoin community has been closely watching the Freedom Convoy-related wallets, and the distribution of funds was immediately spotted by blockchain watchers.  The Twitter account of the privacy-focused Samourai wallet warned: “It is absolutely essential that any truckers who received bitcoin yesterday from @HonkHonkHodl do not attempt to cash out using a centralized exchange. These funds are subject to a Mareva injunction and violation of that order is a criminal act.”  On Feb. 16, Tim Pastoor, a digital identity researcher in the Netherlands, tweeted a video of a person coming up to a truck and handing a large paper envelope to the driver, saying it contained “some sats” – slang for “satoshis,” small fractions of bitcoin. “Eight grand of bitcoin in there,” says the donor, who then explains the envelope contains the recovery phrase for a software wallet containing bitcoin along with a set of instructions.  On Feb. 17, Twitter user NobodyCaribou wrote that fundraisers for the Freedom Convoy, as the protesting truck drivers are calling themselves, distributed 14.6 BTC among 90 protestors.  “Epic P2P bitcoin wallet airdrop. Team of two, distributed to 90 (ish) truckers over 24 hours. 14.6 btc,” he tweeted, adding: “This was the most satisfying thing I’ve ever done and also the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”  CoinDesk asked NobodyCaribou via Twitter direct message whether people had any problems cashing out the bitcoin on centralized exchanges, but the account’s owner hasn’t responded so far. Tallycoin also hasn’t responded to a request for comment.  This is a developing story. Check back for updates.  UPDATE (Feb. 22,21:35 UTC): Corrects figure in fourth paragraph.

The cryptocurrency appears to be oversold on intraday charts, although a price bounce could be limited toward $40,000 resistance. Lower support is seen around $30,000, which could stabilize the sell-off.  BTC was trading at $37,700 at press time and is down 15% over the past week.  The downtrend since November 2021 remains intact, albeit within a long-term uptrend. That means price action has a tendency to rise exponentially following cycle lows. For now, indicators do not suggest BTC is at a cycle low.  Previous drawdowns suggest selling pressure could continue over the short-term.  Currently, BTC is 43% off its all-time high near $69,000 reached in November 2021, compared with a 50% drop during the first half of 2021, and a 70% decline during the March 2020 crash. The most extreme peak-to-trough decline was roughly 80% during the 2018 bear market.

Less Than 70% Of Bitcoin Entities Are Now In Profit As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the percentage of BTC entities in profit has severely dropped recently as the value now oscillates between 76% and 65%. The &apos;percent of entities in profit&apos; is an indicator that measures the percentage of Bitcoin investors that are currently in profit. The metric works by looking at each coin on the chain and checking its history to see the price it last moved at. If this price is less than the current one, then the coin has accumulated some profit. On the other hand, it being bought at a higher price would imply that it&apos;s in loss at the moment. An &apos;entity&apos; here refers to a collection of addresses that are controlled by the same investor(s). So based on whether the coins held by these entities are in profit or loss, it&apos;s possible to talk about the profit status of the entity as a whole.

Sellers continue to liquidate their positions as the price falls below the 200 EMA and 50 EMA critical levels. Finally, at $1.40, the downside finds some solid support. On the other hand, if the price breaks through the numerous support, the immediate downside objective is $1.03. The last time the levels were seen was in September.

Timothy McKimmy, the previous owner of Bored Ape #3475, is seeking ""the return of the Bored Ape … and/or damages over $1 million,” according to the lawsuit filed on Feb. 18.  McKimmy says his ape was “stolen” on Feb. 7 through a bug that allowed attackers to purchase non-fungible tokens (NFT) for previously listed prices, often significantly below market value.  Read more: OpenSea Bug Allows Attackers to Get Massive Discount on Popular NFTs  McKimmy claims his NFT was worth upwards of $1.3 million, based on the ape’s 14th percentile rarity score and the $1.3 million sale of an ape touting a much lower rarity that was reportedly purchased by Justin Bieber.  McKimmy’s former ape is currently on sale on OpenSea for 225 ETH, or roughly $592,000, at the time of writing.  The lawsuit is the first relating to this specific kind of exploit, but may be less legitimate than it appears. As pointed out by Twitter user @exlawyernft, some of the lawsuit’s key information is incorrect.  McKimmy, for example, listed the defendant of the case as “OpenSea,” but the marketplace’s legal identity is Ozone Networks.  Ozone Networks is also incorporated in Delaware, which the plaintiff fails to list in the suit. And the address of the company’s New York office is also listed incorrectly.  The meat of the lawsuit is centered around the plaintiff’s claim that “OpenSea’s vulnerabilities allowed others to enter through its code and force the listing of an NFT.”  This is the claim McKimmy will have to prove to win the case if it does, in fact, make it to court. While winning may be a long shot, legal experts like @exlawyernft believe it’s possible.  ""I honestly think (assuming Plaintiff's lawyers aren't stupid) that the negligence cause is a pretty good argument,” @exlawernft wrote in his Twitter thread. “As for breach of duties and contract/implied contract, I see that as a much harder road to walk.""  In addition to seeking “attorneys’ fees, costs, expenses, pre- and post-judgment interest,” McKimmy is also asking OpenSea to “pause and/or stop any listing or sale of the Bored Ape in question,” according to the lawsuit.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/22/a-former-bored-ape-owner-is-suing-opensea-for-1m-but-his-lawsuit-is-riddled-with-errors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98fb949103c69f8f471673fb111feaa28f2ffef2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Web2 and its social platform offered a fresh start to these innovators as they had a platform to directly reach an audience larger than ever before. However, there is still a major hurdle to conquer: getting their inventions and innovations funded for further development. Of course, fundraiser websites such as KickStarter, Patreon, and Crowd.Science for scientists and inventors offer them a means to raise funds. Nevertheless, there is a myriad of downsides plaguing these platforms, starting with poor media exposure and discoverability of innovations, a lack of a loyal community, high commission fees, and proposal success rates at an all-time low dropping from 30.5% in 1997 to 18.3% in 2016 and continuing to plunge.

And, so far, it looks as if the world&apos;s first digital currency issued by the central bank of a major economy is set to take the top spot on the podium. On the opening day of the 2022 Winter Olympics, significantly more transactions were reportedly made with China&apos;s central bank digital currency (CBDC) than through Visa, which has traditionally been the champion at such events, according to CoinTelegraph. Indeed, Visa had had a stranglehold on electronic payments at the Games since 1986. Other than cash, it was the only way to pay for tickets and concessions at official Olympic venues and, if you wanted to buy tickets for events online, you had to have a Visa card. The main reason for the yuan&apos;s stunning performance was probably summed up by 42-year-old media professional Cai Qianyi, who used his smartphone to buy roast chicken and broccoli at the Main Media Centre before the start of the games. &apos;This is very convenient compared to carrying cash, this way I avoid touching currency notes,&apos; Cai said, according to Bloomberg.

The exchange allows users to control their private keys, so they are responsible for their assets.

It uses the Alonzo Hard Fork to support this functionality as it allows smart contracts to deposit assets and earn interest in line with some pre-established rules. Users on the Ravendex exchange who desire to trade or swap native tokens on a credible platform are free to make their dreams come true on the platform.

The largest stablecoin issuer by total supply cut its assets held in commercial paper from $30.5 billion in the period ending in September to $24.2 billion in December. Tether also drastically reduced its cash assets, from $7.2 billion to $4.2 billion.  Instead, the company allocated most of its reserves to Treasury bills, almost doubling assets in short-term government securities from $19.4 billion to $34.5 billion.  The attestation categorizes all $24.2 billion commercial paper assets as “Cash & Cash Equivalents & Other Short-Term Deposits & Commercial Paper,” though only $13.4 billion of that amount matures within 90 days. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) define “cash equivalents” as investments with maturities of three months or less.  The recent attestation is the first one authorized by accounting firm MHA Cayman, which announced it would take over Tether as a client earlier this year. MHA Cayman is a subsidiary of U.K.-based mid-tier firm MHA MacIntyre Hudson, which has recently been on the U.K. Financial Reporting Council’s radar for audits the company issued in 2018 and 2019.  As part of its settlement with the New York Attorney General in February 2021, Tether is required to release quarterly attestations of its assets and liabilities as a way of being more transparent when it comes to what exactly backs its tether (USDT) stablecoin. The NYAG had alleged Tether and sister company Bitfinex had attempted to cover up the loss of approximately $850 million in customer funds.  In June 2021, CoinDesk filed a Freedom of Information Law request, asking the NYAG to release Tether’s reserve breakdowns during the agency’s inquiry into the stablecoin issuer. Tether has challenged CoinDesk’s request on claims that releasing this information would result in its proprietary commercial processes being publicized.  Tether released its first attestation report in March 2021, revealing the amount of its assets and liabilities. Back then, about 50% of its reserves were held in commercial paper, compared to 30.1%, according to its latest report.  The stablecoin issuer has a total of $78.6 billion in assets as of December 2021, up from $41 billion on March 31, 2021.

42421847,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSPV,1645547412,POAPs: What Is a Proof of Attendance Protocol?,"Whether used as digital artwork, avatar or an in-game asset, the applications of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have grown exponentially over the past few years. However, one of the more pragmatic use cases that were introduced during ETHDenver in 2019 is called a Proof of Attendance Protocol – or “POAP” for short.  A Proof of Attendance Protocol (pronounced poh-ap) is a unique NFT given to people to commemorate and prove they attended an event (virtual or physical). Often referred to as ""an ecosystem for the preservation of memories,"" over time people can accrue a collection of POAPs to document their physical life experiences and activity through cyberspace.  Attendees to Crypto State by CoinDesk, our virtual event that visits Southeast Asia on Feb. 24, will receive a POAP as a memento. Register here.  How POAPs work  In essence, POAPs can almost be thought of as an upgrade to “checking in” or tagging a location/person on social media, as users don’t reveal any sensitive personal data by doing so.  A few examples of events that gave out POAPs include EthGlobal, Dappcon and the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris. The metaverse ecosystem Decentraland also regularly sends POAPs to its users to help commemorate in-game events like the 10 million user party hosted by MetaMask in 2021.  Given the number of scams and knockoffs in cryptocurrency markets, for something to be vetted as a POAP, it must be minted (created) through the official POAP smart contract, contain metadata related to a specific time and date and also have an image associated with the event or community.  To help prevent the high price of gas (transaction fees) on the Ethereum mainnet, POAPs moved to the significantly cheaper and faster Ethereum sidechain called Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai) in October 2020. Due to the low fees on Gnosis, POAPs are usually distributed for free and displayed on the official app. As the underlying dynamics of Gnosis are compatible with Ethereum, collectors can still convert their POAPs to the Ethereum mainnet if they pay the required gas fees.  Why you’d want a POAP  Although growing a collection of POAP badges can help people show off their decentralized identities, holders can also benefit from added financial and community perks.  Some brands or DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) use POAPs to reward and build closer, long-term relationships with their most dedicated members. Bankless DAO, for example, airdropped tokens to the wallets of subscribers who had previously claimed Bankless POAPs. The added bonus, in this case, was that if a subscriber had collected more than one Bankless POAP, they could receive a larger portion of the airdrop (more tokens).  While more niche-specific, a POAP collection can also be viewed as a blockchain-style resume. As the underlying technology reflects immutable data, some employers may find POAPs a more credible, transparent way to view and track the support of potential applicants in a community.  Other benefits include aspects such as:  More privacy: Given the constant violation of user data by centralized tech giants like Meta and Google, privacy is becoming increasingly valued around the world. In contrast to the public nature of social media, the underlying cryptography and decentralized network of POAP allows for people to collect and store life moments without giving up their civil liberties. Despite the fact that some entities can still reverse-engineer IP addresses that are connected to public wallets, at the very least a POAP badge doesn’t divulge any sensitive personal information on its own.  No more cumbersome mailing lists: For event organizers, POAPs can be a better way to manage subscriptions. As users store POAPs for future value and wide-reaching potential, an organizer can feel confident knowing they have a direct line with their audience and attendees rather than wasting time on emails with low engagement rates.  Ownership of limited edition assets: Similar to how physical memorabilia like tickets to the first-ever Beatles concert have become highly prized collector's items, so too can POAPs gain value through being tied to the legacy of historical events and cultural milestones. In the context of the metaverse, POAPs related to foundational technologies like Ethereum and its early in-person events could be in high demand due to the nostalgia and meaning shared between core contributors.  How do you claim a POAP and show it off?  Claiming a POAP is fairly simple. As per the POAP FAQ, there are several options available depending on the type of event:  Batch delivery of badges: If people entered their Ethereum wallet address when signing up, the organizer will airdrop (automatically send) the badge to them.  Manual sending: An organizer can scan your wallet QR code for physical events and instantly send you the POAP badge.  Self-service claim: Another method is to have attendees claim their POAP via an intranet-only decentralized application (dapp) or secure Wi-Fi network. They will then be prompted with instructions on how to complete the process.  Generally, people can either scan a QR code or click a link on the webpage that has created the POAP. They will then need to enter an Ethereum wallet address to receive it.  Once received, badges can be viewed on POAP scan or any interface that supports Etherscan or OpenSea by typing the Ethereum wallet address or directly linking MetaMask, WalletConnect or Portis. For mobile devices, collections can be viewed on the POAP App on iOS or Android. Once a wallet is connected, people can then share their POAPs on a range of supported social platforms, including Twitter, Reddit or Telegram.  An official guide has also been created for directly viewing POAPs on MetaMask rather than through POAP scan.  Do POAPs have value?  Ever since the POAP project launched on Gnosis Chain (xDai) in October 2020, its value has grown significantly across several ecosystems. Platforms like SushiSwap distribute badges to engage with members who attend weekly community meetings, participate in ask me anything (AMA) sessions or vote on governance proposals (a method that helps a group of people determine the direction of a decentralized network or organization). With that said, POAPs also have wider growth potential with suggested applications like social graphs and helping to better reflect online identities.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has alluded to POAP playing a more prominent role in the future with the mainnet.     How to set up a POAP for events  A detailed step-by-step guide on how to set up POAPs for events can be found on the official website. We’ve also provided a summarized version below:  To start, you will need a graphic file in PNG or APNG format that doesn't exceed 200 kilobytes (KB) in size. The suggested dimensions are 500 x 500 pixels. The shape of the file should be round.  Follow the POAP BackOffice link and click on the ""Create new POAP"" button.  The button will direct you to a page to fill out the descriptions of your event and POAP, like what it's commemorating, related websites, how long it should go for, how many ""mint links"" you need, etc. The mint links should be equal to however many people attending or will be eligible to claim the POAP.  After filling out all the required details, you will receive an email with your POAP edit code and claim codes. Your edit code is needed to make changes or updates to your POAP and event.  Further support:  If you run out of codes, go back to the events page, enter your POAP name into the search column and click on ""Request more codes"" on your page.  Enter the number of requested codes (the number of additional codes you need). To receive the new codes, you will need your edit code, which was emailed to you after creating the new POAP.

42390171,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bWMJo7,1645544006,5 Things to Remember When Paying Your NFT Taxes,"Last year, 2021, was the year non-fungible tokens (NFT) became mainstream as trading volume skyrocketed to $24.9 billion, up from just $94.9 million in 2020. Hundreds of thousands of crypto aficionados joined in on the hype, some of whom became multimillionaires in a matter of months.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week  While platforms and wallets such as Opensea, Metamask and Phantom make NFT trading quite simple and accessible, they’re severely jeopardizing their customers by not providing any clarification on taxes at the time of transaction.  I can guarantee that 95% of NFT traders don’t know how much they owe.  We’ve heard countless stories of NFT traders asking for help across social media because they are desperately looking for tax guidance. To support the community, we’ve been putting together a crypto tax guide, which you can see here.  In this piece, we’re going to talk about how NFTs are taxed and various scenarios that will create taxable moments for you!  How are NFTs taxed?  Investing in NFTs may have up to three taxable events.  → 1st event: Paying with ETH  If an NFT is purchased using crypto such as ether (ETH), this transaction would trigger a capital gain/loss taxable event. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service views this transaction as you selling your ETH for fiat and then using the fiat to buy the NFT, thus creating a taxable event for you. You will be taxed on the price appreciation from when you first bought your ETH to when you ""sold"" it to buy the NFT.  → Sold for ETH  If an NFT is sold for crypto such as ETH, or swapped for another NFT, this would trigger a new capital gain/loss taxable event. Similar to the first event, the IRS views this as you selling your NFT for fiat and then rebuying ETH or another NFT with fiat. You will be taxed on the price appreciation of ETH from when you first bought the NFT to when you sold it. So there’s a chance that you sold your NFT for less ETH but still owe taxes because the price of ETH went up from the time you bought the NFT.  → Back to Fiat  Converting your ETH proceeds from NFT sales back to fiat, you will be taxed on the price appreciation from when you received your ETH proceeds to the current market price at time of fiat conversion.  Creators of NFTs are taxed in a different way from NFT investors. While creating the NFT does not trigger a taxable event, selling an NFT in exchange for crypto or other compensation would. For example, if NFT creators sell a digital collectible for ETH on OpenSea, the creator would be taxed as ordinary income on the compensation received. In this example, if creators do not convert the ETH to U.S. dollars (USD) immediately, a new capital gains holding period begins for the ETH the creators received in the sale.  Taxes on NFT Airdrops  What happens if I’m airdropped a token or another NFT because I held the original, like how Bored Ape Yacht Club holders received a Mutant Ape?  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  This is a scenario with little guidance from the IRS. Based on precedent, airdrops like this will be taxed as ordinary income (i.e., short-term capital gains rates), generally, when the assets are recorded on ledger and/or enter your wallet. So if you don’t claim, you won’t have control of the asset and shouldn’t get taxed. When you sell the airdrop, it’ll be subject to capital gains tax rates.  Note: This isn’t definitive guidance but merely how I and other folks construe the law. For a counterpoint, §1.451-2(a) says, ""Income although not actually reduced to a taxpayer's possession is constructively received by him in the taxable year during which it is credited to his account, set apart for him, or otherwise made available so that he may draw upon it at any time, or so that he could have drawn upon it during the taxable year if notice of intention to withdraw had been given.”  With this doctrine, you could be taxed on the value when you could have claimed it, not when you do. However, many airdrops have no liquidity or fair market value, which complicates this even further.  Read more: The Top 5 Tax Tips for NFT Investors  What should I do with worthless NFTs if I was rugged?  Rug pulls aren’t technically considered thefts or scams by the IRS, so there’s no direct rule that helps NFT owners.  So your best bet is to try selling them for 0 ETH on OpenSea or Harvest.art. This way you can at least record a loss that offsets your other capital gains.  Keep in mind, selling NFTs to your friends at a loss in order to tax-loss harvest is potentially tax fraud!  What happens to all the gas fees I paid when buying and selling NFTs?  Just like with commission fees when buying and selling stocks, your crypto gas fees get added to the cost of your transaction (e.g., trade, swap, etc.).  Example:  You bought an NFT for 1 ETH and paid .05 in gas fees. Your transaction cost, or cost basis, is now 1.05.  When you sell the NFT, you would consider the purchase price of it to be 1.05 ETH instead of 1.  Note: While the IRS hasn’t explicitly mentioned how crypto gas fees are taxed, we can assume they’ll be included in the cost basis per Publication 551.  Will I pay taxes on NFTs that I’m gifted?  Most likely not! Receiving a gift is not a taxable event. However, the donor will likely owe a “gift tax” if the value is above $16,000 and file IRS Form 709.  However, keep in mind that when you sell your gifted crypto, you’ll owe capital gains tax (if sold at a profit) and your cost basis will be the price at which the original buyer bought it at.  While the crypto tax space currently feels like the Wild West, we – and along with everyone in the NFT market – look forward to clearer guidance from the IRS and other tax authorities.

13220914,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=484275,1645543624,Huobi Co-Founder Says Next Bitcoin Bull Run Could Be 3 Years Away,"According to Huobi co-founder Jun Du, Bitcoin is unlikely to experience a strong bull run until 2025. His analysis is based on certain crypto specialists&apos; assumption that the coin&apos;s current run is coming to an end. Surprisingly, Du has always aligned with Bitcoin&apos;s bull run history. The asset&apos;s value reached as high as $69,000 during the 2020 bull run, which ended months before the mining reward was reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. Bitcoin Bull Run: 2025 However, Bitcoin has lost more than 40% from its previous peak. To put this in context, Bitcoin&apos;s last bull run in 2018 saw the coin register a high of $20,000 before plummeting by more than 80%. Du said a bull market happened between 2017 and 2021, and the next one is expected to come roughly a year after the 2024 halving. The theory is that by halving the supply, the price will rise. Why Is Halving Important To Bitcoin? A crucial part of bitcoin is halving, which refers to half the amount of money that so-called miners get as compensation for confirming transactions. According to crypto specialists, the past two halvings occurred in 2016 and 2020, with the next one scheduled in 2024. Given that both cryptocurrencies and tech stocks were lifted by central bank stimulus over the prior two years, the Federal Reserve&apos;s intentions to hike interest rates sharply in 2022 have impacted both asset classes hard.

42390168,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bWMJtF,1645542051,How to Avoid Getting Rekt by Crypto Taxes,"Getting rekt is bad. Getting tax-rekt adds insult to injury.  Cryptocurrency investing is challenging enough on its own. The degen objective is to avoid suffering losses from hacks and rug pulls in the process of reaping oversized decentralized finance (DeFi) returns. There's no greater thrill than stuffing your bags from the numerous ways you can monetize in crypto such as airdrops, staking rewards and yield farming.  Kirk Phillips is a CPA, entrepreneur and founder of Global Crypto Advisors and Crypto Blocko, a business, accounting and tax resource site. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week series.  However, the tax impacts of the good, the bad and the ugly events are often overlooked, for three main reasons:  Modular ”lego” money results in new types of transactions and events in crypto with no legacy comparison so there tends to be a regulatory lag before the guidance catches up. More crypto tax guidance is needed in the U.S. and around the world. For example, the treatment of non-fungible tokens (NFT), airdrops, wrapped tokens, staking, casualty losses, liquidity positions and impermanent loss are still question marks to varying degrees. Tax brain-teasers are not just about whether an event is taxable but, rather, the character and timing of the income coupled with readily identifying fair market value.  Crypto tax software providers are also playing catch-up, trying to roll out features fast enough to keep pace with all the innovation. Just consider the sheer number of blockchains getting traction multiplied by all the decentralized exchanges (DEX), NFT marketplaces, bridges, layer 2 networks and so on. Crypto is no longer a game of calculating capital gains and losses from a static portfolio. Even though crypto tax software has made huge strides in the past eight years, including enterprise-grade versions, there are plenty of taxpayer use cases from individuals to businesses, with no one-stop solutions. This means degens who are on every chain and every DeFi platform are left with no software options. How are you supposed to manage taxes when you have no tools to do it?  Finally, taxpayers lead themselves down a false path from the crypto tax ""telephone game"" where small misconceptions about crypto tax get magnified. In addition, many people fail to understand tax basics and ask the right questions, or choose to deal with it later. Twitter, crypto conferences and news outlets can spread information like wildfires. The recent Internal Revenue Service staking refund offer in the Jarrett case garnered headlines like ""huge win"" and ""staking is now tax-free,"" as if there will never be a tax. There are multiple definitions and types of staking, and that kind of chatter could lead people to believe all staking is tax free. It’s not.  The combination of a lack of guidance, the crypto tax software lag and misconceptions about crypto taxation explains how degens and noobs alike get tax-rekt. These are the ingredients for a surprise tax liability. The insult to injury is having to sell crypto assets in a bear market to pay the tax bill.  What does getting tax-rekt look like for crypto holders?  Let's start with a nice airdrop example where Bob HODLs and stakes 120,000 AAA coins. He finds a Twitter post announcing an airdrop of BBB coins to AAA token holders. Bob loves airdrops so he claims 80,000 BBB after completing a few tasks including an on-chain voting proposal. Bob exercised dominion and control of BBB when its value was $1.25 so he has ordinary income of $100,000. The BBB project is offering 110% staking rewards for the first year with reduced percentages thereafter. Of course, Bob jumps on those delicious returns and stakes his entire 80,000 BBB to fatten his bags.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week  For simplicity’s sake, let’s assume Bob is in the 37% federal tax bracket and a state with 3% tax for a 40% total tax. His potential liability from the airdrop is $40,000, but he did not set aside a tax reserve because he has dollar signs in his eyes and wasn't thinking about it. The BBB token price trended up for the next five months until the market fell into a heavy bear slide over the next two weeks.  Meanwhile, the BBB token price got smashed, dropping 65% when some token holders got their unvested tokens and took profits. Bob's $100,000 airdrop is now worth $35,000 and he owes tax of $40,000.  He finally consulted with a certified public accountant (CPA), realized he's getting tax-rekt and decided to cut his losses, unstake and sell. Bob freaks out when he goes to unstake on Dec. 9, 2021, and discovers a 30-day unbonding period. (What, did you think this would be as easy as withdrawing cash from an ATM?)  By the time Jan. 8, 2022, rolls around and Bob's stash gets unlocked his BBB is now worth $22,000 or $0.22 per token. He painfully sells the BBB for $22,000 right away and takes a tax loss of $78,000 ($22,000 proceeds minus the original basis of $100,000 from the airdrop). It's possible the tax loss could have helped offset the $100,000 of airdrop income, but the big tax loss took place in 2022 and it can't be used for his 2021 return.  So Bob has to sell another of his precious cryptos to come up with the $18,000 shortfall ($40,000 estimated tax liability minus $22,000 in proceeds) This cascades into another crypto tax conundrum continuing the downward spiral as Bob continues to get tax-rekt.  Thus far only the original airdrop has been considered so it ain't over yet. Remember, Bob was staking, claiming and restaking BBB rewards at 110% for six months (five months plus the 30-day unbonding period). Bob's uncompounded rewards would have been 44,000 BBB but based on his compounding frequency he actually claimed 72,000 BBB. While BBB was trending up for five months the average price was $2.80, resulting in another round of ordinary income of $210,600 (yikes). The actual calculation for total ordinary income from taking rewards would be the sum of each token claim times the fair market value at the time of the claim. Bob's 72,000 BBB staking rewards are now worth $15,840 using the same $0.22 token price above. He sells this tranche of BBB as part of the same transaction and timing as above, resulting in another huge tax loss of $194,760 ending up in 2022 rather than being available to offset income from 2021.  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  This is the definition of rubbing salt in a wound: getting more tax-rekt from the staking part of the scenario that the original airdrop and selling crypto incurring even more gains to pay for more tax.  How not to be like Bob  The most prudent approach to avoid Bob's situation is to use the highest marginal rate for federal and state taxes for individuals, including individuals with pass-through entity income.  This estimate would be 40% to 50% (and for C corporations, 21% plus the state tax rate).  Suppose Alice got the same BBB airdrop as Bob. To avoid his fate, she would have sold 50% of her airdrop for a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar at the time of receipt. For each subsequent staking rewards claim, she would do the same thing and sell 50% for a USD stablecoin, then compound and restake the 60% of BBB. Alice hedges her tax liability to avoid getting tax-rekt and confines her risk to getting rekt on the remaining portion of BBB she keeps in play. She will suffer injury if BBB goes down the toilet but not the insult because she reserved assets for taxes.  This example is the most cautious approach. However, depending on your risk appetite, there is a range of strategies between Alice’s ultraconservative one and the devil-may-care approach that caused Bob’s troubles.  Stablecoins can be redeployed into lucrative liquidity provider (LP) pairs, thus maximizing crypto asset returns while simultaneously hedging tax liability. For example, a DEX may offer a BBB/USDC LP pair for 92% returns. The strategy can be as simple as claiming BBB, selling 50% for USDC then re-staking both assets in a BBB/USDC pair for those nice returns. Since most LP pools are 50/50 pools, the 50% BBB and 50% USDC for the tax hedge is a perfect match.  Takeaways  Keep up with crypto tax guidance and developments, because you have to consider a tax position even without guidance.  Track your crypto using crypto tax software and document in parallel to capture those use cases without a tooling solution.  Don't get sucked in the crypto ""telephone game"" chatter as the basis for your own tax treatment.  Use all the tools and tricks in your DeFi toolbox to your advantage and map out a better tax strategy based on your experience in order to stuff your bags and avoid getting tax-rekt.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | AIRDROP,Kirk Phillips,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/22/how-to-avoid-getting-rekt-by-crypto-taxes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c53a12cebe49fd54d974d6134f1afa99ac94682c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390169,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bWMJyN,1645541992,The Automatic Tax Man Cometh,"I've never been a tax activist. I've always taken the ""give to Caesar what is Caesar's"" approach to my tax burden.  I'm not very religious either, but I always loved that line from the Bible. Jesus used it to deftly deflect some antagonists who were trying to trip him up and trap him. They hoped he'd tell people not to pay taxes so they could paint him as a revolutionary and insurrectionist and get him arrested. But he wasn't biting. His reply was simple, just pay your dues in the material world too.  This essay is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  But there are a lot of tax activists in crypto. You can spot them in any Reddit, Twitter, Telegram or Discord thread where they angrily swear the government will need to pry money from their cold dead hands. What's a tax activist? That's someone who thinks taxes are unconstitutional or wrong and refuses to pay. To many tax activists, crypto is the great white hope, that will bring the dawn of a bright new day of self-sovereignty, where people seize back control of their money from the state and nobody can force them to pay a single sat (a unit of bitcoin) that they don't want to pay.  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  There's just one problem.  Crypto will make paying taxes a whole lot easier in the future.  To understand why, you just have to understand a little bit about how technology changes over time as it gets more widely adopted.  Taxes and crypto: diverging from Satoshi's vision  To see where crypto is going, you have to know where it started, and it started as a decidedly libertarian movement.  A quick read through Satoshi Nakamoto's writing from his forum posts and the original Bitcoin whitepaper gives you a lens into Satoshi's mind, and that mind favored hard money and privacy. It's all right there in Satoshi's posts to Bitcoin forum:  ""Privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.""  Above all, Satoshi wanted us to return to self-sovereignty. It's baked into the design of the system. Instead of storing crypto in a bank or with a centralized power, and ""[having] to trust [banks] with our privacy,"" crypto gets stored in our wallets, governed by our private keys. Control your keys and you control your destiny. If you've got your keys nobody can force you to give up your money or seize it without a lot of effort.  But while crypto may have started as a libertarian movement, it won't end there. Both crypto and how we pay taxes will change radically over the next 20 years, as digital money becomes the dominant standard for money across the world.  Read More: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  If you're a Bitcoin maximalist or a hard-money adherent, you probably think it's inevitable that Satoshi's vision will win in the long run. We'll have a powerful, limited money supply that can't be debased and where privacy reigns supreme.  Whenever people look at technology they tend to see what they want to see, and what they want to see is their own beliefs reflected back to them and confirmed. We think because crypto was started by libertarians and, because we're libertarians, then crypto will continue to evolve along libertarian lines.  Unfortunately, that's just not the way a complex system evolves over time. When you're peering into the misty haze of the future and trying to see where it's all going, you're better off thinking of technology as bright blue paint continually flowing into a river. Imagine that brilliant blue spreading out and rippling, going wildly in every direction as it interacts with the stream of water and time.  The biggest thing that changes technologies is other ideologies getting their hands on it. While other groups may originally fear a new idea that came from a rival ideology, humans are an incredibly adaptive bunch. They absorb and change every technology they come into contact with, warping and changing it to fit their perspective.  Centralized powerhouses will look to force the decentralized nodes back through centralized choke points. It's already happening with the rise of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) with every major government on earth hard at work on one right now. Governments will look to get it under control with laws and force. Tax agencies want to track and tax it, so no revenue escapes. Authoritarians will look to turn it into a panopticon that they can use to watch and trace people through, a one way mirror that lets them watch you without you knowing when they're watching.  We've never had a system where the original vision matched how a technology evolved over time. Look at something like the internet, which was built for researchers in universities and for militaries to keep messages alive with routing if the nodes got destroyed by nuclear weapons. Now we use it to watch people dancing on TikTok, scream at each other on social media, watch porn, trade recipes, stream movies and play games.  Think of public key cryptography itself. It started as research in the U.K. and U.S. military as a way to control secrets, but once it got released publicly, it powered everything from private messengers to cryptocurrency, something no military ever imagined.  Once tech starts to interact with complex systems, it changes in complex ways.  Satoshi probably never imagined central bank digital currencies, but they're coming like a lightning strike now. It's no longer theoretical: Governments are hiring people, studying how to make it reality and testing the technology. China is already racing to deliver a fully digital money system so they can kill off cash. Killing cash will give them total visibility into everything people spend their money on at all times. When you think of how often you spend money every day, that's a lot of insights into your behavior and who you are as a person.  And just like that we've gone from an original vision of privacy and anonymity to a panopticon with the exact same technology.  What that means for taxes isn't all that hard to see.  Over the next 20 years taxes will be nothing but a script.  Automatic taxes  Whenever you buy anything or get paid in CBDCs, you'll get taxed immediately. In 25 or 30 years, taxes will get whisked out with every transaction. You'll buy a lamp at the store or call a self-driving taxi to pick you up, and sales tax will go right to the tax man. The taxi company won't file their income later and send the money on a delay. It will happen instantly and automatically.  That's because it won't take long for governments to figure out that the key super power of digital currencies is their programmability. Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies that followed ushered in the era of programmable money. Programmability is the killer feature of digital money. That's why it's inevitable that it kill off dumb, analog money. You can't program a dollar bill to do anything at all. You can fold it and carry it with you and give it to someone else, but you can't do much else with it. A digital dollar will have all manner of scripts and functions and possibilities baked right into it. You won't need an escrow company when you buy a house, your eUSD or eEURO will just self-escrow.  By the time you go to report your taxes, most of them will already be paid. You'll get a report that tells you what you paid and whether you want to dispute it. If you're a regular worker with a fixed paycheck, that's not all that different from today. Taxes already come out of your salary. But if you're a business owner, a proud owner of a side hustle, a consultant, an artist or a trader, it will mean profound change. You won't put your tax money in a separate account and pay it later or quarterly. You'll pay right now.  Read More: Your Staking Rewards Are Still Taxable  That will have massive implications for the state, which will only keep getting bigger. It will also directly impact your bottom line. You'll no longer be able to earn any interest on that money in a bank or in investments while you wait to pay at the designated time. Instead you'll hand it over, and if you're charged incorrectly, it means you have to wait to get it back through whatever the dispute process of the future looks like, and that means you just gave an interest free loan to the government.  Maybe you're imagining that private cryptos will save you from automatic tax collection? Don't bet on it.  Open, private crypto will likely evolve as a parallel economic operating system of the world, existing alongside central bank digital currencies over the next few decades. But even if you've got control of your own personal keys, it won't be hard to subvert that with laws.  It won't take much planning for tax agencies and lawmakers to realize they can just mandate automatic tax collection on any business that has employees above a certain level or on any retail sales. They'll force companies to have a public, auditable wallet, linked to an identity, that they can study with chain analysis. The power to do this is built into every single crypto that exists today. It's nothing but a simple smart contract. When X gets purchased, Y goes to this address in addition to the business address Z.  No matter how you cut it, we're looking at a tax future that's almost all automatic.  That's not the worst thing in the world. Taxes are a complex mess, and if you've got passive income, investments, a business and a side hustle or all of the above, they're virtually impossible to do without a smart and savvy accountant. If you're a big business, you need to employ a small army of accountants and tax lawyers to get it all set up and keep it running smoothly. Scriptable, automatic taxes will likely streamline a lot of that regulatory and compliance burden and keep filing taxes simpler.  But if you're an original crypto libertarian and a tax activist, it might all come as a big shock. If you imagined bitcoin, monero, zcash and other cryptos ushering in a bold new era of tax havens, anonymous money and sovereignty, you're probably going to wake up in a tomorrow you never expected and didn't want.  Utopia lost  Technology is an unpredictable animal. If you're an engineer or a programmer, you may have wonderful dreams of tomorrow's technology and where it's all going and how it will change the world.  Technology does change the world, just not always the way we expect.  The people who started the early internet companies were often free-thinking dreamers who unleashed an ""information wants to be free"" revolution. They imagined open dialogue would break down authoritarian regimes and unleash a brave new world of openness and freedom.  Unfortunately, authoritarian regimes are doing just fine. They've figured out how to build national firewalls with man-in-the-middle attacks and how to employ armies of censors to attack free speech with a vengeance.  We did end up with vast open dialogues, but much of that dialogue turned poisonous because the original dreamers of the internet didn't account for how many angry and ignorant people there were in the world, and those people get to use that open forum to drown us all out. Of course, information did break free and now you can read or learn anything you want on the web, and that's a small miracle. Higher education is available at the click of a button, and the most motivated among us can get smart on anything they want to study.  But while information may want to be free, storing all that info costs a lot of money, people, energy, bandwidth, servers and software, and someone's got to pay for it. We pay for it with a surveillance economy that tracks whatever we say and do so it can sell us more ads.  Cryptocurrency will change the world too. It's already doing it. The crypto world is valued at trillions of dollars, and people are building all kinds of future technologies on top of it, like decentralized messengers and identity systems, along Web 3 and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces that will bring real value to people across the planet over the next decade. Self-escrowing, programmable money will streamline everything from buying houses and cars to creating self-executing wills that pay out automatically over time after a person dies.  But if you're an original crypto enthusiast who comes from the early Wild West days when crypto was too complex for governments, central banks and corporate behemoths to understand, then you probably won't recognize what crypto becomes over the next few decades. When all your taxes are collected automatically, physical cash is illegal, and everyone is using fiat digital central bank coins in one way or another (even if they are also using decentralized, private coins, too) will it still be what you wanted?  If you're a coin designer, you should be thinking about all the ways other ideologies can change and warp your philosophy. How can they exploit and change it? How can you prevent it? Can you prevent it at all? How? Can you build those protections in right now?  Only time will tell if there's some kid out there with a whiteboard who's figured out how to pull in some barely known branch of cryptography, the way zk-SNARKS got pulled into Zcash, to change the course of the future. Maybe someone out there will find some obscure mathematical theory, applied in a way nobody imagined, to deliver the crypto utopia of privacy and self-sovereignty that makes it impossible for big business and intervention zealous governments to warp it into something unrecognizable. But for now, it's not looking like it.  The biggest lesson the future of tax collection will have for all early crypto pioneers is likely to be a simple one:  Be careful what you wish for.

42417119,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS6fXh,1645541933,Taxes Are a Wild Card for Public Companies Holding Crypto,"Some very big, and very vocal, publicly traded companies are investing and transacting in digital assets, but the longer-term tax impact of that strategy remains to be seen.  PwC’s 2020 “Global Crypto Tax Report” highlighted that it took five years after bitcoin launched in 2009 before tax authorities issued any substantive guidance. Multinationals face significant tax uncertainty when investing in digital assets, transacting with crypto, facilitating crypto purchases and sales and using crypto to pay interest.  Francine McKenna is an adjunct professor at American University's Kogod School of Business, a former auditor and writer of The Dig, a newsletter about accounting and corporate governance.  Regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. about whether digital assets are securities and thus must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also makes it difficult for multinationals to synchronize tax strategies with business models, and financial reporting.  U.S. tax guidance regarding crypto assets is limited. Available U.S. rulings treat virtual currencies as property, not as currency that generates a foreign currency gain or loss for tax purposes, even if it is a “convertible virtual currency” like bitcoin. Some non-U.S. tax regulators have issued guidance involving direct and indirect tax, too.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week series.  The accounting standards for business transactions that use digital assets are not clear, either. The U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board only recently agreed to address the topic of crypto assets, but the effort could take years. Current non-binding guidance – whether under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Accounting Standards (IFRS) – suggests crypto investments should be accounted for as intangible assets, such as copyrights or trademarks. In the event of a price decline, the original cost is adjusted, also known as an impairment, but upward adjustments don’t happen until an asset is sold.  It's important to view digital asset investing and transactions through a tax lens because the analysis is different from that used for financial reporting. Investors will be challenged to anticipate or understand the full impact of these crypto activities.  MicroStrategy and Tesla have made investing in bitcoin a key part of their strategies. When the price of digital assets such as bitcoin is volatile, accounting guidance for recording and valuing crypto-assets can take a bite out of earnings and make it hard to determine the value assigned to crypto-assets for financial reporting. Positive swings are not reflected in their carrying value until the crypto-assets are sold.  When crypto is spent or accepted like cash, it gets more complicated. For example, the crypto’s value may change significantly before the transaction is settled. Bitcoin may be sold to make a payment in fiat or accepted as payment for something priced in fiat. Companies must record a gain or loss by comparing the fair market value of goods or services received to the crypto’s original cost. The fair market value is determined by identifying the equivalent U.S. dollar or other convertible currency value for the crypto based on the rate on an established exchange. In the U.S. and U.K., gains are taxed at top tax rates that are now the same as top corporate income tax rates. That may not be true everywhere. Capital gains tax rates will increase from 19% to 25% in the U.K. in 2023.  MicroStrategy  MicroStrategy started accumulating bitcoin in September 2020, riding a bucking bronco of bitcoin prices. The company has 124,391 bitcoins and is also an adamant ""HODLer."" However, its aggressive strategy has created cumulative digital asset impairment losses of $901.3 million that have weighed on overall results in every quarter since then.  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  It’s not over yet. In its annual report with the SEC filed on Feb. 16, MicroStrategy says at least $163.3 million more in bitcoin losses are coming in the first quarter.  MicroStrategy’s 10-K filing says the company “may not be able to regain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.” Deferred income tax assets reflect temporary differences between the carrying value of assets for financial reporting and the values used to calculate taxes. MicroStrategy’s bitcoin losses caused deferred tax assets attributable to digital asset losses to increase from $19.8 million in 2020 to $258 million at year-end 2021.  MicroStrategy can’t use the deferred tax assets to reduce its tax liability now because it doesn’t have any federal tax due. At year-end 2021, the valuation allowance (a kind of loss reserve that offsets the deferred tax asset) was $1 million, less than a year earlier. If the market value of bitcoin declines or MicroStrategy is unable to return to profitability, the company says in its annual report, it may be required to increase the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, resulting in a charge that would “materially adversely affect net income,” which is already in the red.  Andrew Schmidt is an associate professor of accounting at North Carolina State University, whose recent research focuses on corporate use of deferred tax assets. He told me that even if MicroStrategy discloses that its bitcoin strategy may continue to generate near-term losses, that does not mean the company should record an allowance against its deferred tax asset at this point in time.  “The fair market value of MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings as of the [Dec. 31, 2021] balance sheet date is approximately $5.7 billion,” Schmidt said “The sale of this bitcoin would likely generate enough capital gain to offset the capital loss created by the $0.8 billion bitcoin impairment in 2021. If prices remain high, the company can sell bitcoin at any time to generate enough taxable income to use its existing deferred tax assets. That may be why MicroStrategy is not taking a hit for a bigger valuation allowance just yet.”  MicroStrategy purchased bitcoin using proceeds from three debt issues, the sale of Class A common stock, and the proceeds from liquidations of short-term investments. MicroStrategy even collateralized its secured notes, due to mature in 2028, with 13,449 of MicroStrategy’s bitcoins acquired on or after June 14, 2021.  If bitcoin goes lower or starts to crash, not only does an increase in the valuation allowance become inevitable, but the value of the bitcoin set aside as collateral for the secured notes will also decline. MicroStrategy would then need to pledge additional bitcoin as collateral to secure that debt. A sustained price decline could also cause MicroStrategy to sell its bitcoin at a loss, which would create even more potentially unusable deferred tax assets.  Tesla  Tesla bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin at the beginning of 2021 and then sold some in the same first quarter. Tesla accepted bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles outside the U.S. for a short time. The crypto payments it received were thrown in its bitcoin investment pot as intangible assets, not cash, subjecting it to the same accounting treatment that only recognizes value declines. Tesla recorded impairment losses of $101 million in reducing the value of its bitcoin and a gain of $128 million when it sold some. The net taxable income impact was a negligible – for Tesla – $27 million.  Read More: How to Avoid Getting Rekt by Crypto Taxes  Tesla has been pessimistic about its ability to ever utilize its enormous deferred tax asset balance because of its history of net losses. It has an 80% valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset because it doubts it will ever use it. Operating results have improved lately but that has very little to do, so far, with bitcoin investments.  Block  Block Inc., formerly known as Square, made modest bitcoin investments totaling $220 million during 2020 and 2021. Since then it has recorded impairment losses of $77 million, leaving a carrying value of $148 million. That’s not a big bitcoin investment commitment compared with MicroStrategy. However, fee revenue for facilitating crypto purchases and sales represents 59% of Block’s gross revenue as of Sept. 30, 2021. Gross margins on the crypto transactions were only 2%, and represent only 5% of total gross margin, but revenue from this business now dwarfs its traditional transaction fees.  The company began lending out its bitcoin in 2021, but as of Sept. 30, 2021, total bitcoin loaned is only $6.0 million. The bitcoin must be returned so it stays on Block’s books. Only the loan “interest” is taxable.  Coinbase  When Coinbase went public through a direct listing in 2021, the SEC asked it how its proof-of-stake service (for example, for customers who hold assets on the Ethereum 2.0 and Tezos blockchains) complied with securities laws and how Coinbase recognized staking revenue. Coinbase takes a 25% commission on earned rewards it distributes.  JPMorgan was right when its analysts predicted, as reported in Forbes, that Coinbase’s staking revenue would grow to $200 million in 2022. Revenue from “blockchain rewards,” primarily staking revenue, was already $131.1 million through Sept. 30, 2021, compared to $7.72 million for all of 2020. Coinbase says its treatment of crypto asset transactions is consistent with Internal Revenue Service guidance and tax principles, but the landscape is changing every day and getting more complex, so the IRS may disagree.  None of the four companies discussed in this article responded to requests for comment.

There is not enough tax guidance to address every scenario presented by an increasing volume of transactions in a complex digital world, Deloitte wrote in a recent “Tax Lens” report on digital assets. Companies and active investors should seek professional advice when trying to match their situation to the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury regulations and case law.

42417122,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS6hI5,1645541641,The 7 Types of Crypto Tax Nightmares,"Thabo Abbate, a CPA who does accounting for cryptocurrencies, has seen plenty of tax nightmares. But this one still gets him.  His client was a yoga instructor. She lived in New York and made less than $50,000 per year, and in 2016, she started trading crypto. On Twitter, she found some “crypto trading influencers” and used their advice to make trades. At first she only invested a little bit of money. But the trades worked. “It was 2016, and if you just threw a dart at a coin you’d make money back then,” Abbate says now.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week  The yoga instructor, emboldened, decided to place bigger bets. Why not make some real money? So she started to trade on margin. She mostly copied the trades of some crypto trading influencers, and, once again, they started to work. She took around $1,000 of capital and turned it into $100,000. She had done it.  “Then the tax bill comes due,” said Abbate. The yoga instructor would have been fine if she sold her $100,000 portfolio and tucked a portion away for taxes. But of course she didn’t do that – many crypto traders don’t. Instead, she kept trading on margin. And eventually she lost all of her crypto.  Now she had to pay taxes on this $100,000 capital gain … but with nothing left in the bank. “The tax bill was basically more than she could earn in a year,” said Abbate.  Welcome to the horror stories of Crypto Tax Nightmares. They usually look something like this: You mess around with crypto, you make some money, you don’t think about taxes, then the market drops and BOOM suddenly you’re underwater.  Crypto Reddit is littered with these kinds of sad stories, such as the office assistant with a salary of $47,000 who racked up a $50,000 tax bill – that he couldn’t pay – concluding that “I feel like I might have accidentally ruined my life.”  Or the crypto trader who realized, in horror, “My country will get marginally richer because I f**ked up my tax planning,” and that “after they'll take everything I have, I'll still be in debt for the rest of my life.”  From conversations with tax experts, these nightmares come in seven forms:  1. The 'Buy in a Bull Market, Sell in a Bear Market' Nightmare  The biggie. They usually look like this: “I found Bitcoin in 2017. It was so exciting. I started trading the altcoins trying to make more bitcoin,” said Brady Swenson, the vice president of education and marketing at Swan Bitcoin, a service that offers automated bitcoin buying plans. “I made hundreds, maybe thousands, of trades,” he noted.  Swenson had never traded stocks before. He had never traded forex. He had never traded anything, and he had no idea there were tax implications. He never set anything aside. And in the meantime, the price of bitcoin cratered. So when tax season rolled around, “I had to sell over half my bitcoin just to pay the bill.”  Swenson is in fine company. “That’s definitely the biggest ‘Oh S**t Moment,” said David Kemmerer, CEO of CryptoTrader.Tax, a tax software startup. He saw this dynamic in both 2018 and now in 2022. “We’ve had it twice now,” said Kemmerer. “A huge bull market leading up to the end of the year,” and then a bear market when people need to liquidate to cover their taxes.  Or take the plight of a 31-year-old real estate agent in Chicago: “I dabbled in trading altcoins back in 2017,” he said. This “dabbling” made him around $650,000 in profits. Like Swenson, he had no idea he had to pay taxes on these trades, and when the tax man came, his crypto holdings plunged by 50%. “I was seriously screwed.” He owed $120,000 in taxes, and to pony up the money he had to liquidate his bitcoin … at the very bottom of the market. “Not only did it hurt me financially, but it also was a pain in the ass getting all my trading information and manually recording the trades one by one.”  Yet another example of this sad story: “Kevin Cage,” who worked in cybersecurity, thought he had a good 2017 trading crypto. His once-modest account soon swelled to several hundred thousand dollars (even though it was mostly “just pure luck and gambling”) … and you can see where this is headed. The market crashed, the tax bill arrived, and he had to liquidate his holdings to pay the $100,000 tab. “It made me sick to my stomach,” said Cage.  He lost sleep. He cut back on restaurants and scrapped plans for vacations. “It’s the worst feeling in the world,” he said. “People think you made a lot of money in crypto, and you talked about the wins, but at the end of the year you wished you took profits.” (This one has a happier ending. Cage bounced back, is a crypto millionaire living in Puerto Rico, and 130,000 people subscribe to his trading videos.)  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  2. The 'Magic Crypto Money!' Nightmare  Many people think that once you’ve swapped your fiat for bitcoin or Ethereum, at that point, it’s in the realm of “Magic Crypto Money” and then, for days or weeks or even years, nothing is taxed until it’s converted back to fiat. Nope.  “I wish it worked that way,” said Kemmerer, but he sees clients regularly get hosed because they misunderstood how it works. “This one guy had acquired over 100 ethereum early on, in 2015, back when it was still cheap,” he said. Then, in 2021, he sold some of his Ethereum to buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs), thinking it was all in Magic Crypto Money Land. “He racked up over a $100,000 tax bill. It was a shock.”  3. The 'Transaction Hell' Nightmare  Another common nightmare: Making a flurry of trades across a range of platforms – Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Kucoin, Huobi and on and on – and not keeping records of your transactions. Each trade is a taxable event.  In 2017, Michelle O'Connor used a bot algorithm to automatically make trades while at Uphold (a trading platform). Not 10 trades or 100 trades. “I had like 20,000 or 30,000 trades,” she said, laughing now. Oops!  (O'Connor solved the nightmare by becoming TaxBit’s first customer; she was so impressed with the tax software startup that she later joined the team as the vice president of marketing.)  Read More: You May Owe Crypto Taxes on These Surprising Things in 2022  4. The 'Fleeting Wealth' Nightmare  In 2017, Shehan Chandrasekera, the head of tax at Coin Tracker, once worked with a limo driver who traded crypto as a side hustle. The driver made $150,000 in profit. Not too shabby. Maybe he could go from driving a limo to owning a Lambo?  Concerned, Chandrasekera asked the limo driver, “Hey, do you have the cash to pay your taxes?”  The driver was stunned. He hadn’t thought about taxes. And by the time his tax bill was due – in an all-too familiar story – the price had fallen and he sold at a loss. “He had never seen those kinds of gains in his life,” said Chandrasekera, and the driver had to set up a payment plan with the IRS. “There are so many stories like this,” said Chandrasekera. “Whenever the market goes up, that’s when all the people rush into the market. People got into bitcoin around $69,000, and now they’re underwater.”  5. The 'Passive Income' Nightmare  In 2017, all holders of bitcoin were air-dropped sums of bitcoin cash. One of Kemmerer’s clients owned a ton of bitcoin – a whale – and he was air-dropped $2 million worth of bitcoin cash. “He didn’t realize that the IRS treats a hard fork as a taxable event,” said Kemmerer, and he was later slapped with a surprise tax bill. (That said, it’s hard to shed too many tears for someone who receives $2 million literally out of thin air.)  But a more relatable nightmare: “Let’s say you’re generating yield, or providing liquidity,” said Kemmerer, such as receiving interest from the Compound token. “Every time you’re getting those rewards, that’s taxable income.”  Read More: Your Staking Rewards Are Still Taxable  6. The 'Oh S**t, You Pay Taxes QUARTERLY?!' Nightmare  “A lot of people think you only pay taxes at the end of the year. That’s not the case,” said Chandrasekera. As every freelancer knows, you’re expected to pay quarterly taxes if they’re not being withheld from your paycheck. But that’s also true if you’re buying and selling NFTs, said Chandrasekera. “If you’re just selling NFTs on OpenSea you have to do that, or you’re going to get penalized.”  7. The Future Nightmare  Finally, the most important nightmare is the one that you don’t know about yet. Many of the horror stories that TaxBit’s O'Connor heard from the 2017 tax year weren’t felt by her clients until 2019 or even 2020. “What people don’t realize is that the IRS is on a two-to-three year lag,” she said. “Just because you didn’t hear something doesn’t mean you’re not going to.”  So if you have a sinking feeling in your stomach that you flubbed your crypto taxes but maybe it’s OK, because the IRS didn’t notice?  You can breathe easy … in a decade.

""I expect asset management to be a bigger business than exchange, which echoes the traditional finance market as well,” co-founder Du Jun said in a translated interview published Tuesday by CNBC. Having an exchange is not a ""necessary element"" to enter the U.S., he said.  Huobi lost about a third of its revenue from September to December 2021, when it expelled China-based accounts to comply with a Sept. 24 ban on crypto-related transactions in the country, Du said in a November interview with the Financial Times.  Earlier in the year, after an initial crackdown from Chinese authorities in May, Huobi had scrambled to move its China staff overseas.  Huobi Group, of which the Huobi Global exchange is part, entered the U.S. in 2018 and exited in December 2019 citing regulatory concerns. ""We didn’t have a strong commitment to the market at that time, and we didn’t have a good management team in the U.S.,"" Du said, according to CNBC.  In 2020, Huobi Tech acquired a trust license in Nevada through a wholly owned local subsidiary. Huobi Tech is a Hong Kong-listed entity that is separate from Huobi Group. The two share a common founder, Leon Li.  Huobi Group officially announced it set up an Asia-Pacific region headquarters in Singapore in November. The company is also looking for a base in Europe.

42395975,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0JX9,1645538414,First Mover Americas: Declining 'Buy the Dip' Mentions Signal Fading 'Hopium' in Bitcoin Market,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin, equities signal risk reset as West sanctions Russia for invading Ukraine.  Featured stories: Declining ""Buy The Dip"" mentions on social media suggest fading ""hopium.""  And check out the CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover,"" hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today's show will feature guests: Michael Sonnenshein, CEO, Grayscale Investments; Ben Schiller, managing editor, features, opinion and research at CoinDesk and Laura Shin, author of ""The Cryptopians."" Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin and the U.S. stock futures trimmed early losses as the White House, European Union and the U.K. signaled economic sanctions on Russia in response to President Putin's decision to send troops into eastern Ukraine and formally recognized two rebel-held regions in the country.  According to theFinancial Times, Boris Johnson, U.K. prime minister, said the ""first barrage of economic sanctions"" would be announced on Tuesday, warning that Putin was bent on a ""full-scale invasion of Ukraine.""  While it is challenging to pin down the exact cause of the recovery in bitcoin and stock futures, the West's decision to steer clear of military engagement and inflict economic damage via sanctions may have calmed fears of a full-scale war and put a floor under asset prices.  ""This is a strategic defeat for Putin and a full-scale war is even less likely after today than before,"" macro fund manager Igor Schatz tweeted.  The going action in the currency markets hints at a continued risk reset in crypto and stock markets during the American trading hours. The growth-sensitive Aussie dollar and Kiwi dollar were trading 0.5% and 0.64% higher against the safe-haven greenback as of writing and the AUD/JPY was up 0.74%.  Bitcoin was trading near $37,700 at press time, representing a 1.8% gain on the day, and the futures tied to the S&P 500 were down 0.3%. The cryptocurrency fell to a 20-day low of $36,250, and stock futures were down 1% during Asian trading hours on fears that a war would be impossible to avoid.

Pullbacks typically end with crowd sentiment leaning cautious or bearish, as is the case now.  ""The pattern that we have recognized is a 3 wave of Buy the Dip mentions during the downtrend each lower than the previous one and after 3 waves the bottom occurs before the market recovers,"" Santiment's market insights blog noted late Monday.  Market moves could be violent as liquidity measured by average hourly bid-ask spreads is thinner than two months ago.  ""Over the past two months, the bid-ask spread for Bitcoin and Ethereum USDT-denominated trading pairs on the biggest exchanges has widened and become more volatile than the previous few months,"" Kaiko Research's weekly newsletter said.  However, liquidity is much better than what it was during the January price slide.  Kaiko takes into account data from eight major exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, to keep a tab on how liquidity is behaving market-wide.  The price recovery may receive a fillip from the derivatives market activity.  Data provided by Santiment show bitcoin's perpetual futures market was aligned bearish early today, with funding rates, or cost of holding long positions, dipping into the negative territory.  So, a continued price recovery may force shorts to unwind their trades, leading to an exaggerated move to the higher side.  SHIB's Death Cross  By Omkar Godbole  Meme token SHIB's 50-day moving average (MA) crossed below its 200-day MA, confirming the first death cross, a technical pattern indicating potential for a major sell-off.

42395953,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0JES,1645537364,Kazakh Authorities Bust 202MW of Illegal Crypto Mines,"Authorities in Kazakhstan shut down 13 illegal crypto mines – overwhelmingly bitcoin – that together had electricity capacity of 202 megawatts, and promised a continued crackdown on the industry.  Facing severe electricity shortages over the past few months, Kazakhstan has been trying to track down improperly licensed mines in order to reduce the load on the national grid. Legally operating mines were initially under power rationing starting last September and eventually had their power cut off by national grid operator Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Co. (KEGOC) in January.  Employees of the Committee for Nuclear and Energy Supervision and the Ministry of Energy, along with police and other state body representatives, had conducted inspections in the past five days, according to a statement Monday from the energy ministry.  Energy minister Magzum Myrzagaliev said in November that illegal mines consume an estimated 340MW of electricity, compared with 600MW that then went to legal operations. Miners had flocked to Kazakhstan starting last May, when Chinese authorities announced a crackdown on the sector. By August, Kazakhstan accounted for 18% of computing power on the Bitcoin network, second only to the U.S., according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.  Among the biggest busts in last week's operation were 31.3MW in the Karaganda province, 22MW in Pavlodar, 3.28MW in Turkistan, 1.03MW in Akmola, and 1.03MW in the Kostanay region. The government's work to identify illegal mines will continue, according to the statement.  In addition to the outright shutdowns, Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev proposed that taxes on crypto mining increase fivefold on Feb. 8. BitFuFu and BIT Mining are among the notable companies as miners big and small look to move operations overseas.

42395961,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0JLL,1645536600,Tokenized Asset Firm Securitize Acquires Stock Transfer Company,"Blockchain-based securities firm Securitize has acquired Pacific Stock Transfer, a company that manages the account balances of investors and certificates of security ownership. The financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.  This latest acquisition by Securitize, which raised $48 million in a funding round last June, makes the firm a top 10 U.S. stock transfer agent, serving 1.2 million investor accounts and 3,000 clients, according to a press release.  Securitize has had a long relationship with Pacific Stock Transfer, which will continue to operate under its current brand. The services Pacific Stock Transfer now offers will continue to be provided by the same team, the companies said.  The Securitize deal is another step in equities markets moving away from a paper-based past to a blockchain-based future. In this case, it’s about digitizing the whole legally complicated and manual process of proving share ownership, paying dividends and compiling tax reporting documents.  New approach  The role of the transfer agent is a not-so-well-known part of capital markets, because most companies aren’t exposed to them until they go public. It also means most people don’t know just how inefficient these firms are, said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo.  “I think that has created a situation where these traditional transfer agents have built monopolistic situations,” Domingo said in an interview with CoinDesk. “These traditional transfer agents are not incentivized to change because the way they make money is by inefficiencies. The issuers are not the ones suffering the problem, but the investors.”  Domingo cited the recent BuzzFeed debacle, where investors found themselves unable to sell their shares after the company’s initial public offering, as an example of transfer agent iniquity.  Read more: Securitize Goes License Shopping With Acquisition of SEC-Registered Broker-Dealer  Another example is where the paying of dividends inefficiently makes money for some very large transfer agents, since $5 billion in Apple dividends, for instance, earns the agent interest in a bank account where it sits for a couple weeks.  “The foundation is digitizing the securities,” Domingo said. “Because once the securities are represented on the blockchain, using wallets and tokens and managed by smart contracts, then everything else, like paying dividends very efficiently or providing liquidity, comes on top of that.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/22/tokenized-asset-firm-securitize-acquires-stock-transfer-company,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/216b0d87e35b1db3ca8b0a0978623be5e0479023-1472x805.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

An interesting fact is that the trading volumes have become smaller, and the result of pressure from sellers on the price is better. This proves the importance of the $0.4623 mark and the willingness to keep the DUSK price while the $0.4623 mark was under the control of buyers. https://www.tradingview.com/x/4BYm6kMW/ Locally the situation is under the control of sellers. To change the initiative in the DUSK market, buyers need to keep the price near $0.22. The range of $0.22 is the local level, which restrained the growth of DUSK price during September-October 2021. In addition, this range is a global trend line of the growth channel, which buyers are confident from March 2020. So far the price is above this trend line the chance of forming at least a local growth wave with the first target of $0.75 is quite high.

Of course, the big difference between the MANA cryptocurrency and other coins is its historical high update in November 2021. Few cryptocurrencies were able to repeat for MANA such a feat. Such great interest is noticeable in the current correction. Despite the high volatility of MANA in the weekly timeframe, sellers are unable to organize a powerful fall wave without deep rebounds. However, while the $3.57 mark is under control, it is impossible to talk about a change of initiative in the market. https://www.tradingview.com/x/zg0WMQyM/ Starting from June 2021, the MANA price was supported by buyers through a trend line. The maintenance of this trend line at the end of October 2021 gave new impulse to the MANA price by 660%. Therefore, in the event of a prolonged and strong Bitcoin decline and the cryptocurrency market - the critical point of MANA is at $1.37. The liquidity zone of $1.5 increases the probability of the current fall wave of falling. In the weekly timeframe, we see that only when approaching this range in mid-January, the price jumped sharply by 60%. After this rebound, the new local fall wave looks quite weak. In 3 weeks, sellers managed to absorb only one week of growth. Of course, all this is happening at low volumes relative to growth in November.

42395974,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0JWA,1645525805,"SAND Token, Below 200-Day MA, Joins Broader Crypto Market in Gloomy Outlook","SAND, the native token of the Ethereum-based virtual-reality platform The Sandbox, has caught up with the rest of the crypto market after weeks of resisting the downward pull.  The cryptocurrency dipped below the widely tracked 200-day moving average (MA) early Tuesday, joining peers from other crypto sub-sectors in signaling a gloomy market mood. The coin slipped under the critical $2.93 level during the Asian trading hours, dropping to its lowest price since Jan. 25, according to Binance data tracked by charting platform TradingView. It last traded under its 200-day MA in July.  The Sandbox introduced a staking mechanism on scaling tool Polygon earlier this month, allowing users to stake SAND without having to worry about gas fees (transaction costs). The move, however, failed to arrest the decline toward the 200-day MA. Staking refers to the process of locking up coins in a blockchain for a specific period of time to contribute to the security of a network in return for rewards.  The 200-day MA, which represents the average UTC closing price for the last 200 days, is a technical indicator used to identify long-term trends. In traditional finance, a general rule is that if a stock is trading below its 200-DMA, the trend is essentially downward.  SAND, which surged over 750% in the final three months of 2021, is perhaps last of the major coins to enter the so-called bearish territory under the 200-day MA.  Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, dropped under the average in late December. A week later, ether, the second largest, and play-to-earn game Axie Infinity's AXS coin followed suit. Heavyweights from other sub-sectors like UNI, LINK, XMR, AAVE, PERP and YFI also fell below their 200-day MAs early this year.  The total market cap of cryptocurrencies, excluding bitcoin – the altcoin market cap – stood at $936 billion at press time, well under the 200-day MA at $1.29 trillion. That level was breached in mid-January.  ""Majorly professional traders track the high-level indices like total alternative cryptocurrencies' market capitalization and total crypto market value,"" said Jeetesh Tipe, founder and chief investment officer of Mumbai-based crypto asset management firm MintingM. ""Both metrics are now trading under the 200-day MA, hinting at prolonged consolidation.  ""Historically, crypto markets' dip under the 200-day MA has been followed by a couple of quarters of consolidation and a renewed move higher. Holding BTC in such situations has proved to be good to protect the downside and reduce the volatility on the overall portfolio,"" Tipe added.  Independent market strategist and crypto enthusiast Ravi Jain suggests otherwise. ""Major coins trading below 200-day MA perhaps signals more pain ahead for the market,"" Jain told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. ""We got a perfect bull market top signal three months ago when bitcoin did not sustain its all-time high on Fed rate hike fears. Since then, bitcoin has cratered with other coins following suit.  ""Alternative cryptocurrencies might bleed more as the bitcoin market is showing no signs of panic selling or capitulation by long-term holders and bottom may be far away,"" Jain added.  Should the SAND bears establish a foothold under the average, more losses may follow. The chart below shows the broader market ran into more substantial selling pressure following the total altcoin market cap's move under the 200-day MA in mid-January.  Still, the 200-day MA is not always reliable as a standalone indicator.  ""I use the long moving averages quite a lot ... as do many others. However, please note that it is a lagging indicator. Consequently, it should be used in conjunction with others, never on its own,"" said Eddie Tofpik, head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at London-based ADM Investor Services International.  Macro factors appear have aligned bearishly. ""Tensions in Europe could be an essential factor in the short term,"" said Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin. ""In a tense situation, investors will prioritize commodities such as gold and crude oil rather than riskier stocks and cryptos.""  Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops to invade Eastern Ukraine early today, sending gold higher and stock markets lower. So far bitcoin has remained largely directionless.  ""If bitcoin and ether cannot recover, most investors will not pay more attention to other altcoins,"" Ardern said, adding there is no particular reason to push crypto higher at the moment and the decline will probably continue with the Federal Reserve likely to announce a rate hike in March.",NEGATIVE,BTC | SAND,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SAND | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/22/sand-token-below-200-day-ma-joins-broader-crypto-market-in-gloomy-outlook,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d26a40d1a43e267eb61ab5ccb5c0e3f4090c9eb6-1920x1281.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395968,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0JRF,1645524879,"Intel Reveals First-Gen Mining Chip, Second Gen Still Under Wraps","Intel revealed the specs of the first generation of its highly anticipated mining chips at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference on Sunday, but didn't reveal details about the second generation, which will be supplied to Griid Infrastructure, a bitcoin mining company, later this year.  The chip giant's entrance into the market for crypto mining application-specific integrated circuits was expected to change the playing field, where two companies reign supreme, but the performance revealed for Intel's first-gen ""Bonanza Mine"" is below current top-of-the-line machines.  The details were first revealed by Tom's Hardware. An Intel spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk that the hardware site had direct access to the conference presentation. The spokesperson described the chip revealed at ISSCC as a ""first-generation product exploration from 2018,"" whereas the supply agreement with Griid refer to its second-gen ASIC, code named BZM2.  Intel has packed 75 ASICs, each one measuring 7 x 7.5 millimeters, onto each hash board. The first-gen Bonanza Mine system has four hash boards, which yield a maximum hashrate of 40 terahash/second (TH/s) at 3,600 watts of power consumption. That is far below Bitmain's Antminer S19j XP, which delivers 140 TH/s at 3,010W, or MicroBT's Whatsminer M30s++ that brings 112 TH/s at 3,472W.  The ASICs themselves pack 258 SHA-256 double hash engines, which operate at the ""ultra-low"" voltage of 355mV. Each one runs at 1.35 to 1.6 gigahertz at 75° Celsius, burning on average 7.5W apiece to reach up to 137 GH/s.  That brings its power efficiency to 55 joules/terahash/second (J/TH/s)at 355mV. The Antminer can be as efficient as 21.5 J/TH/s at 140 TH/s. Intel's system can operate at different power and thermal profiles, from a high performance at 47.7 TH/s and 59.72 J/TH/s, to power saving at 34.5 TH/s and 54 J/TH/s.  Jack Dorsey's Block and Argo Blockchain will also be getting Intel's new mining chips later this year, but neither has confirmed whether they will be getting first- or second-gen ASICs. Griid's supply agreement with Intel, much of which is redacted, notes that Intel will be licensing the reference design materials for the BMZ2, which implies that customers could design their own systems using Intel-supplied silicon.

Trustology, which won full registration from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in October, specializes in decentralized finance (DeFi) and will be rebranded to “Bitpanda Custody.”  Custody refers to the holding and safekeeping of digital assets, and the firms specializing in those technologies have been a target in crypto mergers and acquisitions. PayPal bought Curv last March and Galaxy Digital bought BitGo last May. Meanwhile, standalone custody firms like Fireblocks are reaching sky-high valuations.  Bitpanda became Austria’s first tech unicorn after it closed a Series B funding round at $170 million last March, followed by a $263 million Series C round in August at a $4.1 billion valuation. Trustology is the firm’s first acquisition.

The crypto exchange recently announced plans to ramp up the number of digital assets made available to its roughly 3 million users.

The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) sent the tweets to the police because it believed that the crypto executives were offering advice on how to evade the sanctions on funds, according to the report.  Late last week, the Ontario Provincial Police and Royal Canadian Mounted Police ordered all regulated financial institutions, including crypto exchanges, to cease trading and freeze the assets of “designated persons” involved in the trucker protests as well as 34 associated crypto wallets.  Shortly after Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland announced the measure, both Powell and Armstrong tweeted in support of self-custody wallets.  Self-custody means that the owner of the digital asset holds the private key for the wallet and thus has exclusive access. An appropriate metaphor would be keeping an asset in a safe with only the owner having the combination to the safe, instead of placing it in a bank.  In crypto’s earliest days, this was the preferred way to store digital assets. As digital assets became more mainstream, many investors preferred to hold their crypto on exchanges or with other custodians – many of which are regulated entities with licenses and insurance.  Representatives for Kraken and Coinbase have said that the exchanges intend to comply with the law. Both companies, however, have taken a public stance that they believe money shouldn't be censored and users should have protection from “unjust” seizure of assets.

But, with the advent of blockchains like Cardano, Ethereum, crypto enthusiasts can earn passive income by staking their holdings or coins. But, what does this staking mean? In simple terms, staking is a way of validating the transactions (instead of mining in PoW blockchains). Those who validate the transactions in PoS blockchains are called validators. Staking cryptocurrencies is a technique for investors to build their cryptocurrency holdings without buying more. Investors that participate in staking get higher interest than they would in a traditional bank account; earning maximum passive income is a legal approach to increase the yields on one&apos;s current crypto assets. Staking cryptocurrency can be done in a variety of ways. To begin, you have the option of validating transactions on your own computer. You can even &apos;assign&apos; your crypto to someone you know and ask them to verify your identity. Sounds Interesting? Let&apos;s understand how to pick coins for staking in this article. Guidelines for picking coins to stake Before you pick coins for staking, follow the tips below. But again, as the crypto industry is volatile, you shouldn&apos;t invest more money than you can lose.

Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin and most major cryptos sank amid escalating tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border. A speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin drew the world closer to war.  Insights: Taiwan and Singapore are not stablecoin fans.  Technician's take: Due to the U.S. Presidents' Day holiday, Technician's Take is on hiatus.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $37,507 -3.1%  Ether (ETH): $2,606 -1.6%  Top Gainers  ""There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.""  Top Losers  ` Asset Ticker Returns Sector Solana SOL −8.8% Smart Contract Platform XRP XRP −8.2% Currency Cosmos ATOM −8.1% Smart Contract Platform`     Markets  S&P 500: 4,348 -0.7%  DJIA: 34,079 -0.6%  Nasdaq: 13,548 -1.3%  Gold: $1,904 +0.2%  Market moves  Most major cryptocurrencies fell on Monday as a Russian invasion of the Ukraine loomed closer. In a televised address to his country, Russia President Vladimir Putin said he would recognize two pro-Russia breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine and made a case for invading Ukraine, saying that the country's pro-Western government was a threat to Russia.  Earlier in the day, a Kremlin spokesperson said there were no ""concrete plans"" for a summit between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden as some 150,000 Russian troops have reportedly inched nearer to the Ukraine border. In recent weeks, worried investors have been adopting more risk-averse strategies in anticipation of rising energy prices and sanctions by the U.S. and its European allies on Russia, and Russian retaliation that will likely affect a global economy already hammered by inflation and supply chain delays.  Following Putin's speech, the Biden administration announced penalties against the breakaway Ukraine republics. The per barrel price of brent crude oil jumped past $97, a nearly 4% spike.  At the time of publication, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading trading at about $37,500, down over 3% for the previous 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was off about 1.6% over the same period. Other major cryptos were in negative numbers.  U.S. equity markets were closed for the national Presidents' Day holiday, but leading European stock exchanges, including the FTSE 100, the DAX in Frankfurt and CAC 40 in Paris, finished in the red. Most major Asian indexes also lost ground on Monday, including the Japanese Nikkei 225, the Hong Kong Hang Seng and the Asia Dow.  ‘’Such is the sensitivity on the financial markets right now, temporary confidence can evaporate rapidly and that’s what we’ve seen today after what appears to be another deterioration in relations between Russia and Western powers,"" wrote Susannah Streeter, senior Investment and markets analyst for U.K.-based financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, in an email.  Insights  Not Every Currency Can be a Stablecoin  Stablecoins have been the best thing ever for the hegemony of the U.S. dollar as the digitization of fiat currency into tokens overwhelmingly favors the greenback.  But as crypto is naturally home to dollar skeptics, certainly there must be a move to create stablecoins with alternative denominations. There’s a version of tether denominated in euros, and there are stablecoin projects denominated in Singapore’s dollar and Indonesia’s rupiah, but these are three of the hundreds of currencies out there. Certainly there’s a demand for more, right?  The problem is many smaller economies aren’t huge fans of the internationalization of their currency and ceding control. There aren't the right ingredients for a locally denominated stablecoin to take off in those countries.  Consider Taiwan. Over the weekend Leo Seewald, the former head of BlackRock Taiwan, and now a director at Taipei-based exchange MaiCoin, discussed its new Taiwan-dollar (TWD) stablecoin. The project’s webpage cites “reducing the capital cost of local and cross-border transactions without intermediary” as a benefit of the project.  But that goes against a pillar of Taiwan’s central bank’s monetary policy.  Taiwan has strict capital controls on its currency – exporting Taiwan dollars is strictly forbidden, with few exceptions. The central bank doesn’t want the Taiwan dollar to be used offshore as the democratically run island's arch-rival, China, could use an offshore TWD as a weapon by market-making an unofficial exchange rate through buying and dumping the currency at a disadvantageous price.  The central bank is also not a big fan of the Taiwan dollar being used to settle transactions that don’t have a direct nexus to Taiwan, something a stablecoin is specifically designed to do. Last year the bank handed down significant fines against Deutsche Bank, ING and ANZ for letting commodity traders price grain contracts between Brazil, India, and other third countries in TWD despite the deal having no nexus to Taiwan. In theory, this won’t work because the currency can’t be exported off-island, but the banks used a synthetic proxy for the TWD – a forex instrument called a non-deliverable forward – to get around this.  And then there’s the export market. As an economy heavily reliant on exports it would really sting if the local currency began to appreciate. Given the importance of Taiwan’s semiconductors, and the government’s usually balanced budgets, one would think the TWD would be headed towards the stratosphere. Not so, because of regular interventions in the FX market by the central bank to control the appreciation of the TWD. Very slow and steady wins the race, the bank believes.  The mother of all ironies is that Taiwan is deemed to be more of a currency manipulator than China because of lack of transparency on the issue; everyone knows the RMB is pegged and only trades within a specific band.  Just don’t call Taiwan a currency manipulator. Or say it has capital controls. That gets central bankers and the diplomatic corps mad. In 2011, the governor of Taiwan’s central bank scolded reporters when addressed with the question. Foreign investors can buy equities and move all the foreign currency they want through Taiwan, he said. Just don’t touch our precious TWD.  Stablecoins can throw a wrench into all of this.  A carefully managed currency from an export-driven economy with a geopolitical foe next door isn’t the best candidate to be deployed to the free-for-all that is the crypto market.  Pricing crypto contracts in TWD, or having it be used as a medium of settlement via digital asset on-ramps or off-ramps is going to blow away all the tenants of the Central Bank’s decades of policies and punishments.  The international grain market has nothing on crypto for volatility.  Singapore isn’t a huge fan of the internationalization of its currency either. As Singapore is a largely importing nation, given its lack of natural resources, it strives for exchange rate stability and doesn’t want international deals with no nexus to the country priced in its currency. Denominate that in U.S. dollars, please.  But for stablecoins to get on the radar of these respective banks, they need to be bigger first. A lot bigger. Currently, the TWDC has minted 7.8 million Taiwan dollars of its tokens, or around $283,000; Singapore’s xSGD is further along, with a market cap of $185 million. Far from enough to complement the currency (the kind that Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone argues tether is to the dollar), but also far from enough to be the threat to the economy that the White House claims stablecoins are.
