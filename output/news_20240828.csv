32948234,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638321,1724887840,"Monero Not Spared, Drops 11% Despite Plans For This Gamechanging Privacy Feature","Monero, one of the world’s most valuable privacy-focused networks, is under immense selling pressure. XMR, its native currency, is down 11% from this week’s highs, extending losses from June 2024. Overall, XMR remains in a bullish formation, shaking off weakness from Q1 2024, when the coin fell due to compliance reasons. Several exchanges, including Binance, chose to delist Monero and other privacy coins, citing the need to adhere to laid-out laws, mainly in the United States. Boosting Privacy Features On Monero Through FCMP++ Despite the recent sell-off, the Monero community remains upbeat. On August 20, Monero developers said a pull request was made to integrate Full-Chain Membership Proofs (FCMP++). The feature further enhances Monero’s privacy, making it attractive for users who wish to conceal their on-chain transactions. Related Reading: New Memecoin Popcat Claws Its Way Up, Dominates Top 100 Cryptos With 62% Rally Before this update, Monero relied on Ring signatures to hide the sender’s identity. To do this, Monero obfuscates each transaction so that it appears to be sent from a group of potential senders. Unlike Bitcoin, where a sender can easily be picked out through Ring signatures, this makes it rough for third parties to determine the actual sender. The integration of FCMP++ on the mainnet takes this a level higher, enhancing transaction privacy. Technical data shows that through this integration, proving the output spent in a transaction, and thus, the sender, will be even more challenging. If anything, developers claim FCMP++ boosts the current anonymity set from 16 to 100 million. Therefore, third parties, including analytics platforms like Chainalysis, would find it hard to trace XMR transactions, translating to a higher level of confidentiality for users who treasure privacy. XMR Remains Resilient Despite Challenges Even so, the FCMP++ integration is a work in progress. With the pull request, the relevant code must undergo a rigorous review and further improvement. The goal is to ensure there are no code flaws. However, once it is finalized, the feature will set a new standard for privacy, further cementing Monero as a leader in the scene. The exact timeframe for a complete merger on-chain remains to be seen. However, what’s evident is that XMR bulls are resilient despite the drop in liquidity following the delisting. That Monero developers didn’t yield to exchanges’ pressure to comply means the mission remains. As such, enthusiasts will continue using the network.

According to figures by CoinGecko, the token rose by 44% since last week making FET one of the market’s top gainers. This bullishness can be attributed to the recent developments that occurred on-chain. Related Reading: New Memecoin Popcat Claws Its Way Up, Dominates Top 100 Cryptos With 62% Rally FET has launched the Innovations Lab which will assist the organization in furthering its goals of supporting startups that are artificial intelligence-focused. Once the program matures, we might see its effects on FET. Innovation Lab To Allocate $10 Million To Support AI Startups According to the official blog post, the newly launched San Francisco-based Innovation Lab will be used as a “catalyst for developing AI agent solutions that deliver tangible value to businesses and consumers worldwide.” To achieve this goal, the Lab will allocate over $10 million annually to fund projects focused on AI. The Innovation Lab will have three pillars that will help achieve its goals: the Startup Accelerator, the Ambassador Innovator Club, and the Internship Incubator Program. For now, the organization seems to be focused on gaining members of the Ambassador Innovator Club for the Lab. Fetch.ai recently shared some info about the Innovation Lab. It said the upcoming members of the club will have exclusive access to resources and support for their projects and many other benefits. As of writing, Fetch is still looking for members with no official announcement yet. After the launch of the https://t.co/kJ9URVpOul #Innovation Lab, we thought we’d break down what it’s all about.👇 The lab is focused on 3 pillars.

(1/8) pic.twitter.com/1Ub7RejRCw — Fetch.ai (@Fetch_ai) August 26, 2024 FET Trading At Narrow Range Facing Possible Pain Short-Term As of press time, FET continues to trade at a narrow trading range between $1.2 and $1.3 which was made possible by the general market bearishness that bled into FET’s market. This will deter any attempt by the bulls to recover any ground above $1.3 in the short term. With the token’s rejection on $1.3 and the subsequent rejection of the bears on $1.2, FET will continue this price movement in the coming weeks as the market might continue to be bearish within the coming days. Any bullish change within the market’s environment will offset the bear’s momentum, potentially opening the door towards $1.5. However, investors and traders should be cautious of FET’s relative strength index which shows the bulls are exhausted in the short term. This means investors and traders should expect slight pain within the short and medium term, with FET dropping $1.1. Related Reading: Floki Bullish Breakout Ignites: Could A 96% Surge Be Next?

Network operators now have a two-week window to implement the Nakamoto upgrade, after which there will be hard fork that completes the process.  Stacks, a layer-2 blockchain that augments the Bitcoin network, has begun its Nakamoto upgrade with the aim of making transactions even faster.  The Nakamoto upgrade, which is named after Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, will decouple the block production schedule on Stacks from Bitcoin's.  Network operators now have a two-week window to implement the Nakamoto upgrade, after which there will be hard fork that completes the process. Nakamoto introduces a new way of producing Stacks blocks, using a proof-of-transfer consensus algorithm. Users burn bitcoin {{BTC}} to mine Stacks blocks and receive rewards. This process began its implementation in April, with block ""signers"" coming online to validate ""tenures"" of transactions.  Tenures are periods of time that miners are assigned to produce multiple blocks that are ultimately settled on Bitcoin.  Stacks' aim is to introduce greater utility such as smart contracts and other decentralized finance-related functions using Bitcoin as a base layer. To this end, Stacks is also rolling out sBTC, a bridging asset that allows users to bridge their BTC to the Stacks economy.  STX, the token used as fuel for the network and as the reward for miners, has fallen over 8% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market has also slumped, with the CoinDesk 20 Index down nearly 4%.

Here’s what could be behind it, according to on-chain data. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Spiked Just Before The Crash In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno discussed the latest trend in Bitcoin Exchange Inflow. Exchange Inflow is an on-chain metric that tracks the total amount of assets being transferred into the wallets of centralized exchanges. Investors deposit many coins on these platforms when this indicator’s value is high. One of the main reasons holders may transfer to exchanges is for selling-related purposes so this trend can have bearish consequences for BTC’s value. Related Reading: Litecoin Sees Sudden Exodus Of Retail Investors: Why This Can Be Bullish On the other hand, the low metric implies holders aren’t moving that many coins from self-custody into exchanges, which, depending on whether outflows are also occurring, can potentially be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow over the past few days: As displayed in the graph at the top, the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow saw some notable spikes in the lead-up to the latest price plunge. The version of the indicator in the chart is specifically for the spot platforms, so selling was likely the goal of the investors making these deposits. The CryptoQuant head has also attached the data for another metric: the Spent Output Value Bands version of the Exchange Inflow, under the chart for the Exchange Inflow. This indicator shows how the Exchange Inflow breaks down according to the transactions’ size. In the graph, Moreno has specifically highlighted the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC value band, corresponding to addresses carrying between 1,000 and 10,000 tokens in their balance. Investors of this scale are popularly known as the whales and are considered among the market’s most influential entities. As the chart shows, the Exchange Inflow for these large Bitcoin holders also spiked alongside the spikes in the general metric, implying that the whales contributed to some of the deposits.

As such, the indicator could be worth monitoring shortly, as more large deposits could suggest that the Bitcoin sellers aren’t done yet.

32942186,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638269,1724871618,"The Real Price Impact For XRP: Expert Shares Timeline For Expected Surge, Here’s When","Due to regulatory hurdles, XRP failed to initiate a significant rally alongside other notable cryptocurrency assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum in the 2021 bull cycle. There has been much speculation about when the altcoin will surge again. However, a market expert has recently shared insights into when the actual price impact for XRP will develop, indicating a positive future for the crypto asset. Real Price Impact For XRP On The Horizon SMQKE, an observer and researcher of Current Tech Shift, has disclosed the period for the much-anticipated rally for XRP to come to light, emphasizing the key developments that may influence the value of the digital asset in the future. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 42,263% Breakout For XRP Price To $280, Here’s The Roadmap The expert bases his prediction on the recent developments around the Ripple-Russia Presentation, which implies that major confirmation was provided that all of the big banks that have teamed up with Ripple, including leading banks that are crucial to the system, such as Standard Chartered, Santander, and Bank of America, are currently running in test mode. “If these major banks are still in the testing phase, it means they have not yet fully integrated Ripple’s technology into their daily operations,” he added. Because of this, SMQKE believes that XRP has been unable to move significantly despite its potential utility. XRP may be struggling to undergo a major price upswing, but SMQKE asserts that this development is encouraging for XRP’s future because systemically important banks are participating in the ongoing testing. As a result, the researcher is confident that after the tests are over and the big banks have transitioned to full-scale adoption of Ripple’s technology, the real price effect for XRP will take place. This is because once these tests are successfully concluded, there will be a greater need for XRP as a utility asset in financial transactions, potentially resulting in a sharp increase in the altcoin price. Current State Of The Market In A “Wait And See” Phase According to the expert, the market could be in a “wait and see” phase. This is because investors might be delaying pushing up XRP’s price until they see definite evidence of widespread acceptance and regulatory certainty around the asset. Related Reading: XRP Set To Explode? Top Analyst Predicts $33 Rally The legal litigation between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a major roadblock for the potential of XRP. SMQKE’s insights suggest that investors await the lawsuit’s conclusion before pouring massive capital into the crypto asset market. If the lawsuit ends and Ripple’s technology integration tests with big banks go live, there is a good chance that the value of XRP will witness a notable price rally, possibly to new all-time highs.

32940794,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638440,1724868052,Dogecoin Price Dips: Market Correction or Long-Term Trend? Investors Choose Mpeppe To Secure Big Profits,"Dogecoin (DOGE), once celebrated for its meteoric rise and community-driven success, is currently experiencing a significant price dip. This downturn has led to intense speculation about whether it signifies a mere market correction or hints at a deeper, long-term trend. Market corrections are common in the volatile crypto landscape, often driven by shifting investor sentiment or external economic factors. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors assessing the future of Dogecoin (DOGE). Mpeppe (MPEPE): Why It’s Gaining Traction In the midst of Dogecoin (DOGE)’s fluctuations, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a noteworthy alternative. This new cryptocurrency is capturing attention due to its innovative approach and strong community engagement. Mpeppe (MPEPE) harnesses the power of internet memes and popular culture, much like Dogecoin (DOGE) did during its rise. However, it distinguishes itself by combining humor with a professional edge, appealing to both seasoned investors and younger audiences. How Mpeppe (MPEPE) Sets Itself Apart from Dogecoin (DOGE) What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out in a crowded market? Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), which has largely relied on meme culture alone, Mpeppe (MPEPE) integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) features into its ecosystem. This includes yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance, which add substantial value and functionality to the cryptocurrency. These advanced features not only enhance Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal but also position it as a forward-thinking asset in the crypto space. The Strategic Move: Why Investors Are Shifting to Mpeppe (MPEPE) With Dogecoin (DOGE) experiencing volatility, investors are increasingly diversifying their portfolios to include emerging cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE). This shift is driven by Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential for high returns and its alignment with current meme culture trends. The ability to leverage both viral trends and advanced financial mechanisms makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) an attractive option for those seeking to maximize their investment potential. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE)? As Dogecoin (DOGE) faces price adjustments, the crypto community is closely watching the developments surrounding Mpeppe (MPEPE). Investors should keep an eye on both assets to make informed decisions. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s integration of DeFi elements and meme culture offers a promising alternative, while Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a significant player with potential for recovery. Staying updated on market trends and technological advancements will be key for navigating this dynamic landscape. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Cryptocurrency Investment The current market conditions highlight the importance of diversification and strategic investment. While Dogecoin (DOGE) grapples with price challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a compelling opportunity for those looking to capitalize on emerging trends and innovative technologies. As the cryptocurrency world continues to evolve, both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer unique prospects for investors aiming to secure substantial returns.

42390524,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2UTN,1724868022,The Protocol: The Impact of Telegram CEO's Arrest on TON Blockchain,"In this week's issue of CoinDesk's weekly newsletter on blockchain technology: Fresh SEC charges hit the OpenSea NFT-trading platform, the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov impacts the TON blockchain, and crypto twitter erupts over Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin's antipathy toward DeFi.  ALSO:  Binance once again hunts for a home.  Cardano heads toward biggest upgrade in two years.  Babylon launch sends Bitcoin fees soaring.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Tonkeeper, Sony, Startale, Optimism, Bluwhale, Starknet, SwapKit, BitPay, THORChain.  $60M+ of blockchain project fundraisings.  Network News  JUST IN: OpenSea Gets 'Wells Notice' From SEC, Calling NFTs Sold on Platform Securities  TON OF TROUBLE. With Telegram CEO Pavel Durov set to appear in a French court on Wednesday, blockchain analysts are weighing the possible impact on the closely affiliated TON blockchain, officially called The Open Network. Alex Thorn, Galaxy Digital's head of research, reminded investors in a report that the value of the TON blockchain and its native token, toncoin (TON), are ""substantially dependent"" on the project's integration with Telegram. The TON price tumbled after the news that Durov was arrested on Saturday – detained as part of an investigation into crimes allegedly planned or broadcasted on Telegram. The TON blockchain has more than 350 validators globally, but it is unclear how many of these Telegram operates, if any, according to the Galaxy report. (A source told The Protocol that Telegram doesn't operate any of them, although our attempts to reach the supporting TON Foundation for comment were unsuccessful.) It's not clear ""how resilient TON can be in the case that France or any other major governments attempt to attack it or to take it down as part of Durov's arrest,"" Thorn wrote. The TON Society, describing itself as a community organization affiliated with TON, circulated an open letter condemning Durov's arrest and calling upon France to release him. In a very crypto-style interlude to the saga, the TON blockchain suffered a near-six-hour outage on Wednesday, caused by a surge in network traffic – and possibly linked to the recent airdrop of a TON-based memecoin called DOGS. In a post on X, the TON blockchain team explained that ""Several validators are unable to clean the database of old transactions, which has led to losing the consensus,"" assuring that ""no cryptocurrency assets will be lost due to the issue.""  Kain Warwick, founder of the DeFi projects Infinex and Synthetix, appeared on the Steady Lads podcast (Steady Lads/YouTube)  VITALIK VS. DEFI? In a series of trending posts on X, advocates of decentralized finance (DeFi) questioned whether Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was a fellow fan or a critic. It's a fair question, given there's some $50 billion of DeFi collateral locked into protocols on Ethereum, more than five times runner-up Tron's – making DeFi one of the biggest success stories on Ethereum. And the stakes are high, with a research report last week projecting that a key DeFi metric could surpass the 2021 peak by next year.  The chatter dates back to a post several weeks ago, when Kain Warwick (pictured above), founder of the very-much-DeFi projects Infinex and Synthetix, wrote that, ""If the only thing propping up your chain for the last five years is DeFi, and the best you can muster is begrudgingly tolerating it, you are anti-DeFi."" He didn't mention the Ethereum co-founder by name, but a few days ago, Warwick appeared on the Steady Lads podcast to clarify that he is not a ""Vitalik maxi,"" asserting that the ""importance of DeFi"" is ""one of the most critical things"" that Buterin has gotten wrong over the last five years. ""He keeps trying to meme non-DeFi things into existence,"" Warwick added. On Saturday, the conversation spilled over to X after user @llamaonthebrink wrote that, ""I can't read Vitalik's mind so I don't know what he really thinks. I just find it hard to believe that his views of defi are really that pitiful.""  Buterin himself responded – not disagreeing with the premise, per se, but listing categories of use cases he enjoys: decentralized exchanges, decentralized stablecoins, the Polymarket predictions-betting site, even the centralized stablecoin USDC. Buterin went on, however, to note that he has ""no excitement toward the 2021-era liquidity farming craze"" and acknowledged he is often skeptical when he hears claims that users can ""get good yield by parking your coins here."" He added that there are ""sooooo many centralization points"" in today's technology – from political attacks on encrypted messaging to social-media censorship, to name a couple – that just decentralizing finance ""isn't enough.""  Split Capital's Zaheer Ebitkar wrote that ""Vitalik's poor judgement [sic] on DeFi"" could be taken as a source of ""optimism,"" since it meant that the ""asset isn't so dependent on its founders."" The user @DeFiSurfer808 chimed in, ""DeFi is the whole point of eth lmao."" Stani Kulechov, founder of Aave, the biggest DeFi lending protocol, might have dropped the mic when he wrote, ""Establishing resilient finance can solve many other challenges where resilience is required to empower people, and we are very far from wide adoption.""  ELSEWHERE:  Binance CEO Richard Teng, a former financial regulator in his native Singapore as well as the United Arab Emirates, said in an interview with CoinDesk that Binance is looking for a headquarters but that the question is ""very complex."" The crypto exchange's Chinese-Canadian founder, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, was famously evasive about the question, perhaps because the company was so nomadic – reportedly founded in Shanghai and later based in Japan, Malta and unspecified, but with European operations based in France and Middle Eastern headquarters in Dubai.  Nigeria's money laundering case against crypto exchange Binance, detained executive Tigran Gambaryan and fugitive Nadeem Anjarwalla will resume on Sept. 2, a month earlier than planned, after defense lawyers asked for the trial to be brought forward, Gambaryan's family said.  Michelle Bond, who once ran a Washington-based crypto advocacy group and had served as a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer, was indicted in federal court for taking illegal campaign contributions during her 2022 run for Congress, and court documents detail how a river of cash came through her former FTX executive boyfriend, Ryan Salame.  Cardano Blockchain Heads for 'Chang Hard Fork,' Biggest Upgrade in Two Years  Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson speaks last week on a video posted to X. (@IOHK_Charles/X)  Cardano, launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, is pushing toward its biggest upgrade in two years, with major changes to the structure of its main network, introducing mechanisms for users to participate in on-chain governance.  The upgrade, known as the ""Chang hard fork,"" is a major milestone inCardano’s roadmap, punctuated by the much-awaited addition of smart contract functionality in 2021. The Chang hard fork was initially set togo through this week, but Hoskinson announced on Friday that it had been pushed back to Sept. 1 so some exchanges, including Binance, couldprepare their systems.  ""The magic of deadlines is that people who aren't taking upgrades seriously suddenly say damn we got to get moving,"" Hoskinsonwrote on X.  The main feature of the latest upgrade is to give Cardano the ability to introduce on-chain governance features. Those thathold ADA, Cardano’s native token, will be able to elect representatives (called Delegate Representatives, or dReps) and vote on improvement proposals as well as future technical changes to the blockchain.

(Mempool.space)  The Bitcoin-focused staking project Babylon went live last week, and a rush by users and projects to get in caused so much congestion on the blockchain that it briefly sent transaction fees spiking to their highest levels since June.  The project had established a 1,000 BTC cap for the first phase, so there was limited space. And it took just 74 minutes for the allotment to fill up, with participants motivated by the prospect of bragging and marketing rights, not to mention the ostensible motivation to qualify for eventual rewards. Fees for an individual block shot as high as 15.5 BTC (nearly $1 million), versus the more typical level of 0.1 BTC or less, according to the data site Mempool.space. One project, Lombard Finance, managed to squeeze in as a ""Day 1 Babylon staker"" but dialed back from the 250 BTC it had lined up because leaders ""just couldn't justify paying miners nearly 3/4th of a $million,"" according to a tweet.  Babylon is somewhat similar in concept to the Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer, but for Bitcoin; users ""stake"" deposits on the platform, and that essentially serves as the security collateral to safeguard additional protocols and networks. For bitcoin holders, the project offers a chance to earn extra return beyond price appreciation on a $1.3 trillion asset with no native yield. The planned ""shared security"" marketplace allowing stakers to earn rewards won't come until a subsequent launch phase. ""If successful, Babylon can potentially unlock massive value in BTC,"" Presto Research wrote in a report.  Calendar  Aug. 28-29: WebX, Tokyo.  Sept. 1-7: Korea Blockchain Week, Seoul.

32940792,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638424,1724868022,"PlayDoge: Race To 100X Gains, MPEPE & PlayDoge Added To Top Investment Watchlists","In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, finding projects with the potential for exponential gains is akin to striking gold. Among the tokens capturing investor attention are PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), both of which are being closely watched for their potential to deliver 100X returns. Let’s explore what makes these two tokens the latest additions to top investment watchlists and why they might be the next big opportunities in the crypto space. PlayDoge: Combining Play with Earnings PlayDoge (PLAY) has quickly become a sensation, particularly in the play-to-earn (P2E) sector, which has seen a significant rise in popularity. Inspired by the beloved Tamagotchi, PlayDoge (PLAY) allows players to manage virtual Doge pets, engaging in activities such as feeding and training them. These activities not only provide entertainment but also reward players with $PLAY tokens, creating a unique blend of gaming and earning. Hosted on the Binance Smart Chain, PlayDoge (PLAY) offers an efficient and cost-effective platform for transactions, making it accessible to a wide audience. The token’s staking rewards, which can go as high as 75% APY, add another layer of appeal for investors looking to maximize their returns. With plans for a broad release on both iOS and Android platforms, PlayDoge (PLAY) is positioned to capture a significant share of the P2E market in 2024. The anticipation surrounding PlayDoge (PLAY) is further fueled by its innovative approach to integrating gaming with cryptocurrency. As the P2E market continues to grow, PlayDoge (PLAY)’s nostalgic appeal, combined with its strong earning potential, makes it a top candidate for significant gains in the coming year. MPEPE: A Meme Coin with Real Utility While PlayDoge (PLAY) focuses on the gaming sector, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves in the meme coin arena with a twist—real utility. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on community hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is built with a strong foundation in the DeFi space. This gives it a unique advantage, as it not only attracts meme coin enthusiasts but also appeals to investors looking for tangible value. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s integration with the broader DeFi ecosystem allows it to offer staking, yield farming, and even its own decentralized exchange (DEX). These features provide Mpeppe (MPEPE) holders with multiple streams of income, making it more than just a speculative asset. As the DeFi space continues to expand, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s versatility and utility position it as a token with massive growth potential. Moreover, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has garnered significant community support, which is crucial for the success of any meme coin.

The Race to 100X Gains Both PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are in the spotlight for their potential to deliver extraordinary returns. However, their paths to these gains are different, catering to distinct investor interests. PlayDoge (PLAY) taps into the booming P2E market, leveraging the power of nostalgia and gaming to attract a broad audience. Its staking rewards and upcoming mobile app releases make it a compelling choice for investors looking for a project with immediate earning potential. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its blend of meme culture and DeFi utility. Its ability to generate income through multiple DeFi applications, combined with its strong community support, makes it a versatile investment with the potential for long-term growth. Why Investors Are Watching The addition of PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) to top investment watchlists is not surprising, given the current trends in the crypto market. Investors are increasingly looking for projects that offer more than just hype—they want tokens with real potential to deliver substantial returns. PlayDoge (PLAY), with its engaging gameplay and high staking rewards, offers immediate opportunities for profit. Its integration with the P2E sector, which is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years, makes it a solid choice for those looking to capitalize on this trend. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique combination of meme appeal and DeFi utility positions it as a token with significant upside potential. As more investors recognize the value of projects that offer both entertainment and real-world applications, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is likely to see increased demand, driving its value higher. Conclusion: Two Tokens, One Goal—Massive Gains As the crypto market continues to evolve, tokens like PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are emerging as top contenders for substantial returns. Whether it’s through the engaging world of P2E gaming or the innovative blend of meme culture and DeFi, both tokens offer unique opportunities for investors. With 2024 on the horizon, PlayDoge and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are poised to be among the top-performing tokens, potentially delivering 100X gains to those who get in early.

32940788,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638426,1724868015,$3.5M Internet Computer Investor Purchases Solana (SOL) & MPEPE,"Strategic investments by major crypto players can signal significant market movements and opportunities for savvy traders. Recently, a notable Internet Computer (ICP) investor made headlines with a substantial $3.5 million investment in Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), highlighting these two assets as key contenders in the crypto space. This move underscores the growing interest in Solana (SOL) as it rebounds from recent market challenges and the rising potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new player in the meme coin arena. Solana’s Path to Recovery: A Strategic Investment Solana (SOL) has been one of the most watched cryptocurrencies, especially after its recent price fluctuations. The crypto community closely monitors Solana (SOL)’s price movements, particularly following a sharp downturn earlier this month. On August 5, Solana (SOL) experienced a significant sell-off, pushing its price below the critical 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). However, the token quickly regained its footing, bouncing back from a low of $109 to reclaim the 200-day EMA as support. As of late August, Solana (SOL)’s price hovers around $147.41, reflecting a 5.67% drop over the past 24 hours. Despite this, Solana (SOL)’s recovery trajectory looks promising, with key resistance levels identified at $162.45 and $169.82. These levels are critical as they represent areas of high trading volume, making them significant milestones for Solana (SOL)’s potential upward movement. Indicators on the 4-hour chart, however, suggest a possible short-term pullback. Solana (SOL) has formed a small ascending triangle just below the $161.44 resistance, with the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) showing a negative histogram, indicating bearish momentum. Additionally, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 65, suggesting the asset is nearing overbought conditions. While a short-term correction might be on the horizon, the 50-, 200-, and 800-EMAs on the 4-hour chart are positioned to provide strong support, ensuring Solana (SOL) remains on a stable path to recovery. The Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Rising Star in the Meme Coin Space While Solana (SOL) remains a top choice for institutional investors, the inclusion of Mpeppe (MPEPE) in this $3.5 million investment portfolio is particularly noteworthy. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a new meme coin that has been gaining traction rapidly, thanks to its unique approach and strong community backing. Priced at just $0.00177, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an enticing entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the next big meme coin wave. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s presale has been a resounding success, with over 80% of its tokens already sold, raising substantial capital and demonstrating strong investor confidence. The token’s appeal lies not just in its low price but in its potential for exponential growth. As meme coins continue to capture the imagination of the crypto community, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out for its robust marketing strategies and the promise of high returns, making it a logical addition to any diversified crypto portfolio. Why This Investment Matters The decision by a major Internet Computer investor to allocate significant funds to both Solana (SOL) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) signals a strategic move to balance stability with high-reward potential. Solana (SOL)’s strong fundamentals and recovery prospects make it a relatively safe bet in the volatile crypto market, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the opportunity for explosive gains, typical of successful meme coins. This dual investment strategy reflects a broader trend among institutional and high-net-worth investors who are increasingly looking to hedge their bets by diversifying across established and emerging cryptocurrencies. By combining a solid performer like Solana (SOL) with a high-growth potential asset like Mpeppe (MPEPE), investors can position themselves to benefit from both short-term gains and long-term stability. The Road Ahead for Solana and Mpeppe (MPEPE) For Solana (SOL), the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether it can break through key resistance levels and sustain its recovery. The potential for Solana (SOL) to reach $162.45 and $169.82 will depend on broader market conditions, including the performance of Bitcoin and the outcome of ongoing regulatory discussions surrounding cryptocurrency ETFs. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s journey is just beginning. As the token moves closer to its full launch, the buzz surrounding it is expected to grow, potentially driving its price up significantly. For early investors, this could translate into substantial returns, particularly if Mpeppe (MPEPE) follows in the footsteps of other successful meme coins.

42390511,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2TOh,1724866819,"Solving Fragmentation Is Next Blockchain Race as Layer 2s Multiply, ZKsync Developer Says","Starting with just a handful of pioneers a few years ago led by Arbitrum and Optimism, there's been a rapid multiplication of layer-2 networks atop Ethereum, designed to provide an alternate venue for executing transactions, usually cheaper and faster. The tracking website L2Beat now lists 73 active layer-2 projects, 20 layer-3 projects, 81 upcoming projects and 12 already archived.  That's the backdrop for why Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs, the main developer firm behind the ZKsync layer-2 protocol, sees fragmentation as the next big challenge the blockchain space needs to tackle.  “Right now the race is to solve the fragmentation,” Gluchowski said Wednesday in an interview with CoinDesk in New York.  Superchain, Elastic Chain  Many of these layer-2 chains have issues communicating with each other. Interoperability solutions have been developed in hopes of solving this problem, including Matter Labs releasing its Elastic Chain in June.  Other layer-2 competitors like Polygon and Optimism have come out with their own versions of solving this, including Polygon’s AggLayer and Optimism’s Interoperability solution. They hope to solve fragmentation by having different chains in their ecosystem plug into their own interoperability layers.  But just as the race between layer-2s using zero-knowledge proofs heated up, the next will be between projects offering their interoperability solutions.  “More specifically, Optimism’s Superchain and Matter Labs’ Elastic Chain, because those are the only two live constellations in blockchains that actually implement the interoperability,” Gluchowski said. Gluchowski said he’s doubtful Optimism’s interoperability plans will be easy to pull off without upgrading its systems to incorporate zero-knowledge proofs. “Those are complex technologies.”  Part of the reason why so many chains have popped up over the last few years is because these companies have made it so easy for developers to clone their technology and build their own networks based on their tech.  Developer stacks like OP Stack and Matter Labs ZK stack let users build their own customizable layer-2 blockchains using Optimism and Matter Labs’ technology.  Some high-profile chains that have come out OP Stack for instance are Coinbase’s “Base” and Worldcoin’s “World Chain.” Layer-1 Cronos has also created their own layer-2 chain based off of ZKsync technology, called Cronos zkEVM.  Now, the goal is for all these chains to be more interconnected, so instead of feeling like users are transacting across many chains, it feels like one singular chain.  Gluchowski says the abundance of layer-2 chains need to be reframed and looked at as useful for specific use-cases. “The real question is, do we have L2s that matter? And I think that we will not need too many general purpose layer-2s, but we do need some application specific L2s or community specific L2s,” Gluchowski said.  “This could be regional, like one LatAm, Southeast Asia or Japan, because they have specific cultures, and they kind of have a separate approach there. Or it's really application specific, like we have projects launching on the Elastic Chain that are just gaming chains, which does not really need to be sharing infrastructure block space with DeFi or financial applications,” Gluchowski said.

32940108,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638268,1724866247,Expert Warns Ethereum Faces A ‘Slow And Painful Death’: Here’s Why,"Joe Consorti, an analyst at The Bitcoin Layer and advisor to self-custody app Theya, released an incisive critique on the future of Ethereum in comparison to Bitcoin, shedding light on why he believes Ethereum is facing a “slow and painful death.” Published on X, his analysis titled “The Slow & Painful Death of Ethereum” compares the two leading cryptocurrencies, emphasizing significant underperformance and declining market interest in Ethereum. Why Ethereum Is ‘Dying’ Consorti begins his analysis by highlighting the stark contrast in performance metrics between Ethereum and Bitcoin over the past year. Ethereum, according to Consorti, has suffered a 10.6% drop in value since January, whereas Bitcoin has recorded a substantial 42% increase. This divergence is underscored by the ETH/BTC ratio which has recently broken below the 0.05 level, a critical threshold for the two assets historically. This ratio, Consorti argues, is more than just a number; it represents the shifting balance of power in the crypto market. Related Reading: Solana, Ethereum Attract Traders Amid Bitcoin Open Interest Plunge “The more important gauge of the staying power of Ethereum, and all of “crypto” by extension, is ETH/BTC. By removing dollars from the denominator, we can clearly see that from a market dominance perspective, all of “crypto” is on life support. ETH/BTC has cratered through the key 0.05 level, an arbitrary threshold but crucial to the trading behavior of the two assets over the years,” Consorti writes. Talking about the reasons, Consorti points to the differing narratives that have driven investor interest in both cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s narrative has largely been built around its technological advancements and potential applications, from smart contracts to decentralized finance. However, Consorti suggests that this narrative is no longer resonating with investors as it once did, leading to diminished hype. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to attract investors with its clear value proposition of being a decentralized, finite digital asset, which Consorti refers to as “absolute scarcity.” The analyst points to the performance of the US spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). He notes that US-based Ethereum ETFs have experienced consistent net outflows, totaling over $110 million during an 8-day streak, indicating waning investor confidence. In stark contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have not only launched successfully but have continued to attract significant capital, accumulating approximately $750 million in net inflows. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Eyes $3,000: Data Suggests Imminent Breakout Another pivotal aspect of Consorti’s argument centers around the monetary policies of Ethereum and Bitcoin. Ethereum’s shift to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in 2022 initially led to a deflationary supply mechanism. However, this was short-lived, as highlighted by a subsequent upgrade that increased Ethereum’s supply by 200,000 ETH over five months. “The ‘ultrasound money’ narrative has also died on the vine,” Consorti adds. He criticizes the frequent changes of monetary policies, contrasting it with Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, which he argues offers investors a reliable hedge against inflation and monetary debasement. This makes BTC appealing to everyone. “Bitcoin’s fixed monetary policy and absolutely scarce supply schedule are a breath of fresh air for investors who are keen on hedging themselves from unfettered monetary debasement. While ETH ETFs are off to an abysmal start, Bitcoin ETFs have managed to grab the number 3 and 9 spot in YTD net inflows amongst all US-based ETF products,” Consorti notes. The broader financialization of Bitcoin is also a key theme in Consorti’s analysis. He discusses recent developments such as Nasdaq’s filing to allow Bitcoin options trading, which reflects Bitcoin’s growing integration into mainstream financial markets. This, Consorti implies, not only enhances Bitcoin’s legitimacy but also its attractiveness as an investment vehicle relative to Ethereum, which has seen its ecosystem deteriorate in parallel with the price decline of its native token. At press time, ETH traded at $2,522.

But simply “accepting” crypto might not be enough to stay relevant. Banks need to fully engage with the right partners to help develop next-generation financial infrastructure, otherwise the fintech and blockchain sectors will move on without them.  While some believe that DeFi models are destined to supplant the traditional ones, it’s an unlikely scenario. Current market infrastructures and regulatory safeguards are there for handling institutional liquidity and customer protection.  Instead, we believe that the real opportunity is where the two worlds will enhance each other.

What can banks do?  Many banks are realizing that crypto is more than just a new asset class. For them, it’s an opportunity to retain and attract clients who are drawn to crypto’s higher returns and diversification opportunities. Here’s a few things to consider:  Diversify product offerings: Banks can defend their current assets under management, diversify their offerings and win new business by attracting the next generation of crypto-native clients.  Staking-as-a-service: Banks can leverage their trusted infrastructure to offer customers new revenue streams. By working with the right technology partner, staking can be offered to both institutional and retail clients.  Tokenization: Tokenized products backed by real-world assets can offer new revenue streams and unlock markets that were otherwise limited.  Blockchain-powered settlement: Blockchain-powered, multi-asset settlement networks can help banks meet and exceed the T+1 settlement standard that many major players struggle with.  Trust - a bank’s most valuable asset  In a crypto market where many services lack the much-needed stability and security that traditional investors seek, banks can use this to their advantage.  When FTX crashed in 2022, we saw many investors flocking to regulated entities in desperate need for a safe haven, including our own. It was a powerful reminder how trust trumps everything in times of turmoil.  As crypto regulations take further shape, we’re likely to see many more investors continue to move their funds into entities they can trust. Naturally, they want to feel safe and get all the upside, even if these entities are pricier.  CeDeFi – a likely scenario  For now, DeFi products will continue to compete with traditional products, but it is likely that the two will blend at some point. By leveraging DeFi’s technical components and CeFi’s KYC and AML requirements, we are looking at “CeDeFi”-based models becoming the most appropriate form that will be the underlying infrastructure of future finance.  Banks should take advantage of DeFi’s features, offering flexibility, more efficient systems and innovative financial products that can offer customers new opportunities for yield.  At the same time, TradFi or CeFi, brings hundreds of years of experience in financial systems governance and customer servicing, providing the necessary protection and guardrails needed to bring institutional clients and a new wave of customers onboard.  That said, we think that financial institutions – like banks – able to bridge both worlds, and are prepared to do so, will find many exciting opportunities in the evolving future finance landscape – but they must act sooner rather than later.

42390541,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2etd,1724862849,Advocates at Stand With Crypto Seek to Turn Crypto Enthusiasts Into Swing-State Voters,"Crypto political advocacy group Stand With Crypto is starting up its tour across several key states in the November general election, beginning next week in Arizona.  The organization has gathered more than a million online signups from people interested in digital assets and says it hopes to get them into the voting booths later this year.  Stand With Crypto is the political cheerleading arm of the crypto industry's increasingly high-powered effort to insert itself into the 2024 election, and it's starting a multi-state tour on Sept. 4 with the hope of translating its 1.3 million online signups into pro-cryptocurrency votes.  Its first stop in Arizona will feature U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) and a top Republican state legislator, Arizona House Speaker Pro Tempore Travis Grantham, along with crypto businesspeople, according to the organization. After that event in Phoenix, Stand With Crypto will hit several other potential tossup states in the election, hosting similar events in Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.  ""There's a large group of people who are into crypto,"" said Logan Dobson, the group's executive director, said in an interview. ""It's our job to use sort of campaign-style tactics to motivate them to vote.""  ""Crypto voters are already, I think, decently fired-up about this election,"" Dobson added.  Stand With Crypto has amassed almost 27,000 signups of Arizona crypto supporters to its website, it says, and the group's studies of those individuals indicates more than 80% may be registered voters. Fewer than 11,000 votes separated former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden when Biden won that state in 2020.  Arizona has already represented a crypto political battleground. One of the industry's favored candidates, Yassamin Ansari, won her congressional primary with 39 votes over a candidate who railed against her support from crypto interests and had been endorsed by crypto critic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)  In presidential election polling, Arizona so far has Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump running neck-and-neck, with most of the recent polls suggesting they're within a percentage point of each other. Between them, only Trump has made pro-crypto pronouncements, though Harris' camp has reportedly been open to a friendlier digital assets stance than Biden's administration.  The digital assets industry's top political action committee (PAC), Fairshake, has said it's committing $3 million each to advocate for U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) in the Arizona Senate race and Rep. Elisa Slotkin (D-Mich.) in her Senate race in Michigan. The announcement drew frustration from crypto's Republican supporters, even as Fairshake and its affiliate PACs attracted similar heat from Democrats when it committed $12 million to get Republican crypto fan Bernie Moreno, the opponent of powerful Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), elected in Ohio.  Stand With Crypto, which doesn't have a direct affiliation with Fairshake despite Coinbase being a prominent backer of both, is also working on Ohio plans, Dobson said. The state is ""definitely a priority"" for the organization, he said.

42390545,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2fE9,1724861881,Narrow Boom: The Mismatch of Token Supply and Demand in the Current Cycle,"The consensus used to be that a rising BTC price resulted in a trickle-down wealth effect for ETH, and eventually would spillover into the long tail of “altcoins” — an endearing term commonly used to describe all the other crypto assets outside the Big Two “majors.” We saw this dynamic play out last cycle. When BTC and ETH were up, so was everything else.  Right now, the majors feel more disconnected than ever from the rest of the market, especially BTC. Despite its ~130% rise over the last 12 months, we haven’t seen the “Everything Rally” many were anticipating by now.  We’ve seen small pockets of outperformance — Solana, AI, memecoins — but a majority of the crypto market has largely underperformed.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Dispersion has been the tale of the tape this cycle — and it may very well continue.  For context, during the 2017 cycle, the total crypto market cap grew from around $40 billion to nearly $740 billion (~18x). The market cap of “altcoins” went from essentially zero to over $400 billion — with 90% of that growth occurring in 2H 2017 alone.  In the 2020-2021 cycle, the total market grew from a base of ~$280 billion to nearly $2.8 trillion (~10x), while the market cap of “altcoins” surged from ~$70 billion to $1 trillion (~15x).  But this cycle, the total crypto market has barely grown 2x — and the market cap of “altcoins” has grown even less. Even at the market’s March 2024 peak, total altcoin market cap was still ~$200 billion short of its November 2021 prior high.  All markets are simply a function of supply and demand. Crypto markets have grown considerably over the last several years, but so too has the aggregate supply of new tokens, and the crypto market is currently suffering from a substantial supply-side imbalance.  Today, the supply of new tokens is growing at the fastest pace this market has ever seen. The rise of DIY token launchpads (like pump.fun) has sparked a surge in new tokens being launched, most of them memecoins.  At the same time, we’ve seen a growing number of token unlocks from large protocols and dApps start to flood the market, as vesting dates come due from thewave of VC investments a couple years ago. Private investment comes with the expectation of a return, and in crypto, that exit liquidity often comes in the form of selling tokens.  Meanwhile, we’ve seen a50% year-over-year increase in the number of $1 billion market cap coins. More tokens at higher valuations means more capital is required to support their prices.  But so far and so far demand has not kept pace. For example, trading volumes on major exchanges have yet to recover back to last cycle’s prior highs.  Another major difference compared to last cycle is the lackluster growth in crypto credit and lending, which helped fuel the buying frenzy we saw in 2021. Crypto lending markets peaked in 2021-2022 amidst a backdrop of low interest rates and insatiable risk appetite. For context,Genesis’ loan book peaked in Q1 2022 at ~$15B after surging 62% year-over-year (total loan originations peaked at $50B the quarter before).  However, the collapse of many key institutional lenders (e.g. BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager, Genesis) hampered the speculative demand these same lenders helped fuel. Though we’ve started to see signs of a recovery, with new entrants likeCoinbase’s institutional financing business, this area remains tepid compared to just a few years ago. In addition, today’s higher rate environment offers less incentive to move money on-chain into a choppy market, especially when the alternative is getting paid 5% on your cash or stablecoin holdings to wait and see.  As the almighty Fed starts to cut rates — the market unanimously expects — we’d expect to see risk sentiment and credit conditions improve as the risk-reward of bringing capital on-chain turns more favorable. Lower rates can also reignite growth in total stablecoin market cap, which is a decent proxy for rising demand as on-chain activity picks up.  This could light a fire under demand that the crypto market desperately needs right now. Whether or not this will be the spark that ignites the “Everything Rally” many are hoping for though remains to be seen.

32938117,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638384,1724861759,Tron vs BNB: 3 Reason MPEPE Will Profit More Than TRX & BNB In 2024,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big opportunity that could yield massive returns. Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) have long been considered strong contenders in the crypto space, but a new memecoin, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is quickly gaining traction and could outshine both Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) in 2024. Here are three compelling reasons why MPEPE is poised to outperform Tron and Binance Coin in the coming year. 1. MPEPE’s Explosive Growth Potential Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a new entrant in the memecoin market, but it has already captured the attention of investors with its explosive growth potential. Unlike Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB), which have already established themselves in the market, MPEPE is still in its early stages, offering investors a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Tron (TRX), with its recent innovations such as the Sun.Pump platform, has seen a significant price increase, but its growth may be limited by its already large market capitalization and the challenges of sustaining long-term momentum. Similarly, Binance Coin has been a dominant force, particularly due to its role as the native token of the Binance exchange. However, Binance Coin (BNB) faces significant resistance and market saturation, which could hinder its ability to generate the same level of returns as MPEPE. In contrast, MPEPE’s entry price of just $0.00177 offers a low barrier to entry for investors and the potential for exponential returns. With the memecoin market known for its rapid and sometimes unpredictable growth, MPEPE could easily outpace Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB), especially as more investors flock to this new opportunity. 2. Community-Driven Growth and Market Sentiment One of the key drivers of success in the cryptocurrency market is the strength and enthusiasm of the community behind a token. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly building a passionate community that is committed to driving the token’s success. This grassroots support is reminiscent of the early days of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, both of which saw astronomical gains due to their strong communities. While Tron has a loyal user base and has recently seen a surge in activity due to its delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) model and the Sun.Pump platform, it still faces challenges in maintaining long-term interest, particularly as the hype around memecoins on its platform begins to cool down. Binance Coin, on the other hand, has a more institutional user base, which, while stable, lacks the viral community-driven growth that has propelled memecoins like MPEPE to success. The community-driven nature of MPEPE makes it a more dynamic and potentially more profitable investment compared to the more established but slower-growing Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB). As more investors rally around MPEPE, the token’s value is likely to see significant upward momentum. 3. Market Position and Future Prospects While Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) are both well-positioned in the market, they face significant challenges moving forward. Tron’s reliance on the success of its DeFi and memecoin platforms, such as Sun.Pump, means that it must continue to innovate to stay relevant. Any slowdown in development or user adoption could negatively impact its price. Binance Coin, despite its dominance, faces regulatory pressures and market saturation, which could limit its future growth. Mpeppe (MPEPE), however, is just beginning its journey. With its low entry price, strong community backing, and the inherent volatility of the memecoin market, MPEPE has the potential to outperform both Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) significantly. As new developments and partnerships are announced, and as the memecoin market continues to capture investor interest, MPEPE is well-positioned to see substantial gains in 2024. Conclusion While Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin have proven themselves as strong players in the cryptocurrency market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique opportunity for investors looking for higher returns. With its explosive growth potential, strong community support, and favorable market position, MPEPE is set to outshine Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) in 2024. Investors looking to capitalize on the next big memecoin should consider adding MPEPE to their portfolios before it’s too late.

32939503,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638412,1724861560,Top 3 Platforms Other Than Binance for Crypto Traders,"One of the biggest names when it comes to Crypto platforms is Binance. Popular amongst traders all around the world, Binance has a lot to offer. However, with the constant growth in the Crypto market, there are now a large number of competing platforms with attractive offerings for traders to choose from. Having more options is always good for traders, especially when many offer such competitive conditions. This allows them to identify the features that are important to them, whether that be low fees, fast execution, or expert tools, and choose the right platform for their needs. This article will cover 3 alternatives to Binance including PrimeXBT, Kraken, and Coinbase, discussing their pros and cons, to help traders make the most informed decisions possible. PrimeXBT: An All-in-one Platform for All Experience Levels Founded in 2018, PrimeXBT has become one of the main market leaders when it comes to Crypto and online trading in general. Its modern platform features a user-friendly interface suitable for traders of all experience levels, while the suite of professional tools on offer – including TradingView integration – will please even the most expert of traders. One of the main benefits of PrimeXBT’s platform is its all-in-one nature. Traders can purchase BTC, ETH, and USDC outright, buy and sell CFDs on popular coins, and trade Crypto Futures, all in one. Trading conditions are highly competitive, with fees as low as 0.05% on Crypto CFDs, and 0.01% for Crypto Futures, and flexible leverage of up to x200. The broker also offers Copy Trading, allowing traders to follow expert strategies. Finally, there is a wealth of non-Crypto options available, with traders also able to diversify across markets like Forex, Indices, and Commodities. PrimeXBT takes the safety of client data and funds seriously. Its extensive cyber security framework includes strict measures to protect clients against any eventuality. The broker is also committed to transparency and regulatory compliance, allowing clients to trade with confidence. Finally, it offers 24/7 support in a range of languages, ensuring traders can get the help they need, whenever they need it. Kraken: Flexible Platform & Professional Tools Kraken is another highly popular platform in the Crypto space. It offers a large range of 200+ Cryptocurrencies to invest in, as well as an impressive 600+ pairs to trade. Margin trading is available, as are Futures contracts, both allowing for the use of leverage – although only to a max of 50x – and for transactions of larger volumes, Kraken even provides OTC services. The platform offers high liquidity and fast execution to its traders, with minimal slippage. This means trades are generally executed at the price quoted on the platform. Via Kraken’s flexible API integration, traders can also benefit from automated trading through the use of trading bots, while advanced charting and order types help cater to those with more market experience. Overall, Kraken is another good option for those looking for an alternative Crypto platform to Binance. Its flexible platform and wide range of trading instruments are beneficial for traders, however, its standard fees are higher than a number of other options. For example, spot Crypto fees start at 0.25%, while Futures fees start at 0.02%. The platform does offer lower fees for much larger volumes, however, these won’t necessarily apply to most traders. Coinbase: Reliable & Easy to Use Coinbase has been around for over a decade, making it one of the most well-known in the Cryptocurrency market. Its user-friendly platform allows users to buy and sell a range of popular Cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, and many more. Over the years, Coinbase has built a reputation for reliability, offering traders a secure environment backed by strict security measures. The interface of the platform itself makes Coinbase very welcoming for newcomers, while also providing enough depth and powerful tools for more experienced traders. It also offers a range of other services, including the ability to create and collect NFTs, as well as earn interest on Cryptocurrency a trader owns. Additional services are also provided for larger institutional investors. Its years in the market make Coinbase a solid choice for traders looking to get into Crypto. However, there are some cons when compared with other options available. For retail investors in particular, the fees can be quite high, reaching up to 4%. Those trading larger volumes receive lower fees, however, these can still be higher than those of competitors. Lastly, despite its overall reliability, Coinbase has had regulatory issues in the past, which some may view as concerning. Conclusion: Competition is Good for Traders Competition in any industry is always good for the end user. It drives innovation and gives people options, as is the case with Cryptocurrency trading. This article has discussed 3 leading Crypto platforms, all of which stand as great alternatives to Binance, and there are many more out there.

32938114,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638386,1724860845,Render Investors Secure Mpeppe Tokens Before It Enters Stage 4 Of Presale,"Two tokens that have caught the attention of the crypto community are Render (RENDER) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Render (RENDER), known for its integration of AI and blockchain, has already established itself as a key player in the market. Meanwhile, Mpeppe is quickly gaining momentum as it approaches the final stages of its presale, offering a unique opportunity for early investors. The Rise of Render (RENDER) in the AI and Blockchain Space Render (RENDER) has been at the forefront of the intersection between artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. The token has seen significant gains recently, driven by increased interest in AI-focused blockchain solutions. With a 40% surge in value, RNDR is currently trading at around $6.45, reflecting the growing confidence in its potential as a long-term investment. Render (RENDER)’s success is closely tied to the broader trend of AI integration within the blockchain ecosystem. As companies increasingly rely on AI to drive innovation, the demand for decentralized, scalable computing solutions has skyrocketed. Render (RENDER) has positioned itself as a key provider of these solutions, leveraging its platform to offer distributed GPU rendering power to a wide range of industries, including entertainment, architecture, and scientific research. The upcoming Nvidia earnings report, expected to highlight the continued strength of the AI market, is likely to further boost interest in AI-related tokens like Render (RENDER). Investors are keenly watching this space, anticipating that the convergence of AI and blockchain will continue to drive significant value appreciation. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Memecoin with Massive Potential While Render (RENDER) offers a strong foundation in the rapidly growing AI sector, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capturing the speculative excitement that memecoins are known for. Mpeppe (MPEPE), currently in its third presale stage, has already sold over 82% of its tokens, raising more than $1.34 million. With its price set at just $0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a golden opportunity for investors looking to get in on the ground floor of a project with the potential for massive returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which adds a layer of credibility and security to its ecosystem. The token is positioned as a rising star in the memecoin space, combining the viral appeal of memecoins with the robust infrastructure of Ethereum. This strategic alignment is a key factor driving its presale success, as investors recognize the potential for significant growth as the project progresses. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) approaches Stage 4 of its presale, the anticipation among investors is palpable. Those who secure their tokens now stand to benefit from the price appreciation that typically accompanies the transition to later presale stages and eventual listing on major exchanges. Why Render Investors Are Moving into Mpeppe The decision by Render (RENDER) investors to diversify into Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a strategic one. By securing Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens before the presale moves into Stage 4, these investors are positioning themselves to capitalize on the explosive growth potential that memecoins can offer during bullish market conditions. The combination of Render (RENDER)’s stability and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s speculative upside creates a balanced investment strategy that can yield both long-term gains and short-term profits. Moreover, the current market dynamics favor such a diversified approach. With the increasing integration of AI into various sectors and the enduring appeal of memecoins, both Render (RENDER) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are poised to perform exceptionally well in the coming months. Final Thoughts As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, opportunities like Render (RENDER) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer a unique blend of stability and growth potential. Render (RENDER)’s established presence in the AI and blockchain space provides a strong foundation for any portfolio, while Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s position as a rising memecoin star offers the kind of speculative gains that can drive significant returns. For investors looking to diversify and maximize their gains, securing Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens before the presale enters Stage 4 could be a game-changing move. With Render (RENDER) providing long-term stability and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offering short-term explosive growth, this combination is set to be a winning strategy in the next bull run.

Fetch.ai (FET), a prominent player in the AI blockchain space, has been making headlines with its impressive market performance. However, a new AI token, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is rapidly gaining traction, attracting investors from the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, including those who have significantly increased their holdings in FET. The Rise of Fetch.ai (FET) and Its Impact on the AI Crypto Market Fetch.ai (FET) has been a standout in the AI blockchain sector, especially ahead of NVIDIA’s highly anticipated Q2 earnings report. Historically, NVIDIA’s earnings have had a substantial impact on AI-themed cryptocurrencies like Fetch.ai (FET). For instance, after NVIDIA’s earnings announcement on May 22, Fetch.ai (FET) saw a rapid surge from $1.90 to $2.50, a clear indicator of the market’s response to positive developments in AI technology. Recently, Fetch.ai (FET) experienced a 54% price surge, breaking out of a descending channel—a pattern typically seen as bearish. This breakout is a strong bullish signal, indicating that Fetch.ai (FET) could rise even further, potentially reaching $1.93 if the momentum continues. This surge has drawn the attention of large-scale investors, or “whales,” who are now seeking to diversify their portfolios by adding other promising AI tokens. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New AI Token Attracting Fetch.ai (FET) Investors Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new entrant in the AI cryptocurrency space, has quickly garnered attention for its innovative approach to integrating AI with blockchain technology. Positioned as a rival to established AI tokens like Fetch.ai (FET), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another memecoin—it’s a project designed to leverage AI for practical applications within the crypto ecosystem. Investors from the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, who have seen significant returns with Fetch.ai (FET), are now eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a potential 100X opportunity. The token’s presale has already attracted considerable interest, particularly from those who have been following the AI trend closely. With AI being a major focus in both technology and finance, Mpeppe’s entry into the market comes at a time when demand for AI-driven solutions is at an all-time high. Why FET Investors Are Turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) Diversification of AI Investments: While Fetch.ai (FET) has proven itself as a strong player in the AI crypto space, investors understand the importance of diversification. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a new avenue for AI investment, providing a fresh opportunity to capitalize on the growth of AI technologies within the blockchain industry. Potential for Exponential Growth: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is being touted as a 100X token, especially as it is still in its early stages. Early investors, particularly those who have seen substantial returns with Fetch.ai (FET), are looking to replicate their success by getting in on the ground floor of this new AI token. Strategic Partnerships and Market Positioning: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just about hype; it is backed by strategic partnerships and a clear roadmap that positions it as a serious contender in the AI space. The token’s focus on real-world applications of AI in blockchain sets it apart from other memecoins and adds to its appeal among serious investors. The Future of AI Tokens: FET and Mpeppe Leading the Charge As AI continues to revolutionize various industries, the intersection of AI and blockchain is becoming increasingly important. Fetch.ai has already shown the potential of AI in the crypto space, and now Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to build on that foundation, offering new opportunities for growth and innovation. For investors, particularly those who have benefited from Fetch.ai (FET)’s recent surge, Mpeppe represents a new frontier. The token’s presale is not just an opportunity to invest in another memecoin; it’s a chance to be part of a project that could shape the future of AI in the blockchain world. In conclusion, while Fetch.ai (FET) remains a strong player in the AI blockchain sector, Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) entry into the market offers a compelling opportunity for diversification and growth.

The anticipation surrounding PlayDoge (PLAY) has led to a surge in interest, with many investors positioning themselves early to maximize potential gains. However, while PlayDoge (PLAY) continues to build momentum, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has entered the scene with a force that cannot be ignored. This new entrant is rapidly gaining traction, and even PlayDoge (PLAY) holders are starting to take notice of its 100X potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Rising Star with 100X Potential Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly emerged as one of the most promising tokens in the market, drawing significant attention due to its explosive growth and innovative approach. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe offers a robust ecosystem that combines the best elements of decentralized finance (DeFi) with the viral appeal of meme culture. In the last few weeks, Mpeppe has surged by 322%, a growth trajectory that has caught the eye of even the most seasoned investors. The token’s rapid ascent can be attributed to its strong fundamentals, including staking, yield farming, and liquidity mining features that incentivize long-term holding. These features have not only attracted a large community of supporters but have also positioned Mpeppe as a serious contender in the crowded crypto space. What sets Mpeppe apart is its ability to blend the fun and excitement of meme tokens with real-world utility. The token’s DeFi capabilities provide investors with opportunities to earn passive income while participating in the Mpeppe ecosystem. This combination of entertainment and financial rewards has made Mpeppe a must-watch token for those looking to make significant gains in the coming months. PlayDoge Holders Eye Mpeppe as the Next Big Thing As Mpeppe continues to gain momentum, PlayDoge (PLAY) holders are starting to diversify their portfolios by adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their watchlists. The allure of Mpeppe’s 100X potential is hard to ignore, especially for those who have already benefited from the early success of PlayDoge (PLAY). By entering a position in Mpeppe, these investors are positioning themselves to capitalize on what could be one of the most significant gains in the crypto market this year. The strategic move to include Mpeppe in their investment portfolios reflects a broader trend among crypto investors who are seeking to balance their exposure to both established and emerging projects. While PlayDoge (PLAY) continues to build its user base and expand its P2E offering, Mpeppe is rapidly climbing the ranks, offering a unique opportunity for those willing to take a calculated risk. The Future of PlayDoge and Mpeppe As both PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) continue to grow, it’s clear that they represent two of the most exciting opportunities in the crypto space today. PlayDoge (PLAY)’s innovative approach to P2E gaming and its nostalgic appeal make it a strong contender in the gaming sector, while Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s explosive growth and DeFi capabilities position it as a potential 100X token. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios and maximize their returns, both PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer compelling reasons to get involved. Whether you’re drawn to the fun and engagement of PlayDoge (PLAY) or the massive growth potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE), now is the time to take a closer look at these rising stars in the crypto world. As the market continues to evolve, those who act quickly and strategically could find themselves reaping significant rewards from these two promising projects.

32938107,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638249,1724860806,"XRP Poised For Over 5,000% ‘Explosive Charge’, Analyst Says","XRP once more takes the center stage in crypto as momentum for the altcoin’s price builds up. Over the weekend, XRP jumped 8% to a high of $0.63 before it settled slightly lower at $0.6131. Although it witnessed this minor pullback, analysts are sharing their predictions on the token. Specifically, two popular personas in the crypto analysis world, Bobby A. and GoldE33, predict that XRP is ready for a key breakout. Related Reading: Floki Bullish Breakout Ignites: Could A 96% Surge Be Next? Bobby A. thinks that XRP is poised for an “explosive charge”, while GoldE33 highlights a key technical indicator that could support this bullish outlook. The analysts shared their thoughts on X, formerly known as Twitter, thinking the same – that it may push the altcoin up past its current resistance levels. Bobby A.’s charts reveal a very promising breakout pattern on the monthly timeframe, while GoldE33 identifies the shrinking Bollinger Bands as a sign of an imminent price explosion. An explosive charge ready to go high order. #XRP ⚒️ pic.twitter.com/93zeWYKgSh — Bobby A (@Bobby_1111888) August 24, 2024 Resistance And Possible Breakout Bobby A. is quite straightforward with his predictions. He’s set the first target at $0.87 — a 45% increase from its current price of $0.60 for XRP. Were XRP to reach that level, it would be considered major as it heaves the token well above its long-term descending trendline. This could mean the change in market sentiment from bearish to bullish, providing an uptick in investors that might drive the price even higher. And the road back to higher prices is filled with obstacles. Thus, Bobby A. has identified a number of resistance levels, which the XRP price would have to break through as it edges closer to its previous all-time high of over $3. A breakout above this level would be monumental indeed, possibly opening the floodgates for XRP in uncharted territory. But the analyst remains hopeful; he says when XRP clears the $3 mark, a smooth sail toward $5.31 could be highly expected. The Role Of Bollinger Bands While Bobby A. used resistance and potential price targets in his analysis, GoldE33, on the other hand, makes use of Bollinger Bands, a tool used for the measurement of volatility and price action. #XRP – Bollinger Bands – When BB get thinner, it means a BIG move is coming! BB got thinner last two cycles that led to a 10x-650x in a year! I called bottom, I’ll call TOP next! Posting HUGE 5 chart update on Patreon/Discord next week w/targets! 400 Retweets for update on X!… pic.twitter.com/IlkI0BmwqK — JD 🇵🇭 (@jaydee_757) August 26, 2024 According to GoldE33, contraction on the XRP chart in the Bollinger Bands is usually a sure sign of an approaching increase in price. To give a bit more credibility to his statement, GoldE33 refers to two other events in the history of the XRP chart when the Bollinger Bands contracted. Both times, strong upward movements happened. In one instance, XRP’s price jumped 10-fold, while the other saw the price jump an incredible 650 times. And that historical context gives credence to the argument that XRP might be very close to making a big move. Related Reading: Helium: Development Proposals Ignite 15% HNT Price Rally – Details Profit-Taking Zones And Long-Term Prospects First, Bobby A. has pointed out that $5.31 is his main profit-taking zone for the short-term gain taker. If XRP managed to get to this level, investors who have bought at the current price would register unprecedented returns. For longer-term positions, the potential rewards might be higher. His most ambitious forecast looks for XRP to reach as high as $33, which is a colossal 5,387% increase from today’s price. If XRP were to reach this level, most definitely it would join those cryptos that have given awesome returns. Given the recent price action of the XRP and the technical signs that analysts such as Bobby A. and GoldE33 identified, this token is setting up for a big move. Considering the difficulties lying ahead of it, it would be seen whether it can pierce through these or reach these lofty targets set by these analysts. For now, the market watches closely, with optimism building around the potential of XRP for a historic rally.

Now at $58,800 bitcoin is lower by 4.5% over the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index is down a similar amount.  Ether {{ETH}} outperformed by a hair, falling 4% over the past day, but longer-term, the second-largest crypto has seen its price relative to bitcoin plunge 21% this year to its lowest level since April 2021. At $2,490 at press time, ether's 2024 year-to-date advance has narrowed to just 9% versus bitcoin's 39% rally.  Behind the divergence, it's been a tale of two starkly different spot ETF launches this year, with the bitcoin funds pulling in more than $10 billion in net inflows while the ether vehicles on a net basis have bled assets since their introductions.  Read more: Ether Spot ETF Flows Have Underwhelmed Versus Bitcoin: JPMorgan  Macro outlook becomes a bit less inviting  Adding to pressure on crypto were declines in the major U.S. stock averages, led by 1.3% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Helping to push the Nasdaq lower was a 3% fall in Nvidia (NVDA) ahead of its quarterly earnings results due after the bell on Wednesday. Though still a bit off from an all-time high set earlier this summer, Nvidia remains up 159% year-to-date, leaving plenty of room below should the company disappoint on either its quarter or its outlook.  Also prompting some nervousness is the idea that investors may have read too much into Fed Chair Powell's dovish remarks at the central bank's Jackson Hole conference late last week. Traders Friday quickly moved to price in nearly a 50% chance of the Fed cutting its benchmark fed funds rate by 50 basis points (instead of the previously presumed 25) at the upcoming September meeting.  There's still plenty of data to come in between now and that September meeting, however, including the government's employment and inflation reports for August. Those numbers are likely to have to come in pretty soft for the Fed to make such a large cut in rates so quickly. At the current time, the odds of a 50 basis point move have drifted down to 36%, according to CME FedWatch.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/28/bitcoin-bounce-fizzles-as-nvidias-slide-ahead-of-earnings-adds-to-risk-off-mood,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b62e45afe6bd43e34f1350de8ca42a2d2231d664-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exchange complies with anti-money laundering legislation, like all financial institutions, he said.  A letter in the original post shows a rejected appeal by a wallet holder against a seizure order from November, but it doesn't identify the recipient.  Binance CEO Richard Teng dismissed claims the crypto exchange froze all assets belonging to all Palestinians at the request of the Israeli armed forces, an allegation publicized on social media platform X by Ray Youssef, the founder and CEO of peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform NoOnes.  ""FUD,"" Teng wrote in a post on X, using the acronym for fear, uncertainty, and doubt. ""Only a limited number of user accounts, linked to illicit funds, were blocked from transacting. There have been some incorrect statements about this. As a global crypto exchange, we comply with internationally accepted anti-money laundering legislation, just like any other financial institution.""  In his post, Youssef included a letter in Hebrew from Paul Landes, head of Israel's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing, together with a translation. The letter rejects an appeal against a seizure order dating from Nov. 1, 2023, and says funds were transferred from the Dubai Exchange Company in the Gaza Strip to cryptographic wallets ""yours among them."" The letter doesn't identify the recipient. The Dubai Exchange Company was designated a terror organization in 2022, it says.  While terror groups are said to use cryptocurrency to fund their operations, figures are hard to discern given the difficulty of identifying the owner or any specific wallet. In July, Singapore's government noted an increasing use of cryptocurrencies in terror financing while saying cash and other informal value transfer systems remain the predominant means for financial transactions.  Israel has seized 190 Binance accounts it said were tied to terrorists since 2021, Reuters reported in May last year. That was before the Oct. 7 invasion that murdered 1,200 Israelis and took another 250 hostage, prompting Israel to enter the territory. More accounts on the exchange, linked to Hamas, were frozen on Oct. 10 at the request of Israeli police. Later that month, the U.S. issued a list of sanctions that included a business providing money transfers and digital assets exchange services in Gaza to squeeze Hamas, listed as a terror organization in the U.S., U.K. and other regions.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Sheldon Reback,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/28/binance-ceo-teng-rejects-allegations-the-exchange-froze-all-palestinians-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7296811f996191b8fc4de093c77e92a2244ee3a4-1123x632.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390534,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2eJj,1724859453,Bloomberg and Better Markets Are Wrong About Crypto,"In recent op-eds, Bloomberg and Better Markets both weigh in against the crypto industry giving support to candidates for office they believe would support efforts on behalf of digital assets. Leaving aside their First Amendment rights to do so, as a former Democratic Commissioner at the CFTC and now involved in regulatory compliance issues, I feel that both the Bloomberg and Better Markets statements are unfair to the fledgling crypto companies as well as to the millions of Americans who invest in these products.  Certainly with regard to the Vice President, she has taken no actions that could be considered “pandering” or “caving.” Her team has rather been listening, engaging and learning about a new financial product. To do otherwise would simply be irresponsible.  It seems fairly obvious to fair-minded observers that after over a decade of the cryptocurrency currency trading makes it unlikely it’s going away anytime soon, as much as some may want that. Given that, you would think the reasonable person would say, “let’s properly regulate these products.” It is not true that crypto doesn’t face a myriad of state and federal regulations. What is true is that, as long as an enforcement-only regulatory approach is taken, the U.S. will see jobs move overseas, innovation will be hampered and crucial decisions will be left to the courts.  CFTC Chairman Rostin Benham has been proactive in working to encourage Congress to pass sensible and protective legislation. For Better Markets to say that the CFTC is not capable of this and is susceptible to regulatory capture, is slanderous.  In 2023, the CFTC had a record number of enforcement actions in the crypto space representing nearly half of all enforcement actions. It is important, though, to consider that crypto-related fraud is only 1% of the annual $3.2 trillion in illegal activity occurring in the dollar and other traditional fiat currencies. So, contrary to the Bloomberg and Better Markets opinion pieces, crypto is not the financial product of choice among financial predators. It’s actually the U.S. dollar.  Read more: Benjamin Schiller - OK, Bloomer!  Yes, crypto has some of the speculation and abuses we have all heard about but, as a Californian, I can tell you these things happened during the Gold Rush of 1849. Ironically, today gold is considered the “safety” investment.  Finally, I would note that the SEC has done the most to give Americans the opportunity to invest in bitcoin and ether through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). In fact, the SEC just approved an ETF that allows retail investors to buy an ETF that allows a leveraged bet that is 1.75 times the daily move in a single company’s security. Now that seems a risky bet even to me.

Recently, a significant development in the crypto space caught the attention of many: a PlayDoge (PLAY) whale investor has added Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their investment portfolio. This move has raised eyebrows and piqued the interest of both PlayDoge and Mpeppe (MPEPE) communities. But what drove this whale to diversify into Mpeppe (MPEPE)? Let’s dive into the reasons behind this strategic investment decision. The Success of PlayDoge (PLAY) Before delving into the specifics of Mpeppe (MPEPE), it’s essential to understand the context surrounding PlayDoge (PLAY). PlayDoge (PLAY) has been one of the most anticipated tokens of the summer, with its initial coin offering (ICO) generating over $6 million in funding. The appeal of PlayDoge (PLAY) lies in its engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which combines the nostalgic charm of Tamagotchi-style gameplay with the modern-day craze for meme coins. The ICO for PlayDoge (PLAY) concluded on August 26th, leaving investors eager for its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) launch. Analysts and industry experts predict that PLAY could see gains of up to 100x, making it one of the most promising investments in the GamiFi sector. The strong community support, combined with innovative gameplay and the buzz around Web3 gaming, has positioned PlayDoge (PLAY) as a potential leader in the P2E space. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE)? Given the success and potential of PlayDoge (PLAY), why would a whale investor decide to add Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolio? The answer lies in the complementary strengths of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and the broader market trends. AI-Driven Innovation: Unlike traditional meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just about riding the wave of viral content. Mpeppe (MPEPE) integrates advanced AI technology into its platform, aiming to create a more engaging and profitable user experience. This AI-driven approach allows Mpeppe (MPEPE) to stand out in a crowded market, offering investors exposure to both meme coin culture and cutting-edge technology. Diversification and Risk Management: For any savvy investor, diversification is key to managing risk. By adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolio, the PlayDoge (PLAY) whale is spreading their investment across multiple sectors within the crypto space. While PlayDoge (PLAY) focuses on gaming and entertainment, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s AI focus offers exposure to a different growth area, potentially balancing the portfolio and reducing overall risk. Strong Community Support: Just like PlayDoge (PLAY), Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly garnered a loyal following. The community-driven nature of both projects means that they benefit from grassroots support, which is crucial for long-term success in the crypto world. The whale’s investment in Mpeppe (MPEPE) reflects confidence in the strength and growth potential of this community. The Future of PlayDoge and Mpeppe (MPEPE) As PlayDoge (PLAY) prepares for its DEX launch, the excitement within the community is palpable. The token’s success in the ICO stage, coupled with its innovative gameplay, suggests that it could capture a significant share of the P2E market. However, the addition of Mpeppe (MPEPE) to the whale’s portfolio indicates a broader strategy at play. Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) integration of AI technology makes it a unique asset in the meme coin space. As AI continues to influence various sectors, including finance, MPEPE is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The combination of meme culture with advanced AI could see MPEPE gaining traction rapidly, much like PlayDoge (PLAY) has in the gaming sector. Conclusion: A Strategic Investment for the Future The PlayDoge (PLAY) whale’s decision to add MPEPE to their portfolio is a testament to the potential of both projects. While PlayDoge (PLAY)’s success in the P2E sector is nearly certain, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a different kind of opportunity one rooted in the intersection of meme culture and AI innovation. For investors looking to maximize returns, the combination of PlayDoge (PLAY) and MPEPE presents a powerful duo. With the ICO of PlayDoge (PLAY) wrapping up and the token set to go live soon, early investors could see significant gains. Meanwhile, MPEPE’s growing community and AI-driven platform offer long-term growth potential in an increasingly tech-driven market. As both tokens prepare for their next phases, the strategic diversification into MPEPE by a PlayDoge (PLAY) whale could be a move that others in the market might soon emulate. For those looking to invest in the future of cryptocurrency, keeping an eye on both PlayDoge (PLAY) and MPEPE could prove to be a wise decision.

With the recent surge of interest in play-to-earn (P2E) games and meme tokens, two new players have caught the attention of the crypto community: PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both of these tokens are rapidly gaining momentum, with PlayDoge nearing the end of its highly successful presale, and Mpeppe making headlines with a staggering 322% surge. As PlayDoge investors start to take notice of Mpeppe, it’s becoming clear that these two tokens are setting the stage for significant gains in the near future. The Rise of PlayDoge (PLAY) PlayDoge (PLAY) is an innovative P2E game that combines the beloved Tamagotchi experience with the excitement of cryptocurrency. Players take on the role of caring for a virtual Doge pet, engaging in various activities such as feeding, training, and playing with their pet. As they progress through the game, players earn $PLAY tokens, which can be used to unlock special features, participate in the game’s economy, or be traded on the open market. The PlayDoge (PLAY) presale has been a resounding success, with over $6 million raised and just days left before the DEX launch. Early investors are eagerly awaiting the token’s listing on exchanges, anticipating a significant price surge post-launch. The tokenomics of PlayDoge (PLAY) are designed to reward early adopters, with 50% of the total supply allocated to the presale and a substantial portion set aside for community rewards and staking. As the presale draws to a close, PlayDoge (PLAY) is poised to make a big splash in the P2E and meme coin sectors. The game’s nostalgic appeal, combined with its modern P2E mechanics, makes it a strong contender for significant gains in 2024. However, while PlayDoge (PLAY) continues to attract attention, another token is rapidly emerging as a formidable rival—Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE): A New Contender with 100X Potential Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become one of the hottest tokens in the market, thanks to its unique blend of meme culture and DeFi utility. Unlike many other meme coins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a robust ecosystem that includes staking, yield farming, and liquidity mining. These features not only enhance the token’s utility but also encourage long-term holding, which has helped fuel its recent 322% surge. The rapid rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) has not gone unnoticed by the crypto community, particularly among PlayDoge (PLAY) investors who are always on the lookout for promising new opportunities. With its strong fundamentals and explosive growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming a must-watch token for anyone looking to capitalize on the next big wave in crypto.

This broad appeal has helped Mpeppe build a strong and engaged community, which is essential for long-term success in the crypto space. PlayDoge and Mpeppe: A Tale of Two Tokens While PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are both gaining traction in the market, they offer different value propositions that appeal to different types of investors. PlayDoge (PLAY) is perfect for those looking to combine fun and earnings through its P2E game, which brings the iconic Doge meme to life as a virtual pet. With staking rewards of up to 75% APY and a mobile app release on the horizon, PlayDoge (PLAY) is positioned for substantial growth in the P2E sector. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) appeals to investors who are looking for a more serious investment with the potential for massive returns. Its 322% surge is a testament to its strong fundamentals and growing community support. As more investors become aware of Mpeppe’s potential, it’s likely that we’ll see even more growth in the coming months.

32936691,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638310,1724857207,FET vs MPEPE: Top Analyst Compare 100X Potential With Artificial Superintelligence Alliance,"New tokens and projects are constantly emerging that push the boundaries of technology and investment potential. Among these, Fetch.AI (FET) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have gained significant attention, especially as investors seek the next big opportunity in the market. This article delves into a detailed comparison of FET and MPEPE, exploring their growth potential and why top analysts believe MPEPE could be the next 100X token. The Rise of Fetch.AI (FET) in the AI Sector Fetch.AI (FET) has made waves in the AI and blockchain sectors, particularly after its merger with Internet Computer (ICP) and Near Protocol (NEAR). This strategic move has propelled Fetch.AI (FET) to new heights, with a 67% price surge over the past week alone. The token now dominates the AI and Big Data categories in the crypto space, positioning itself as a leader among AI-driven projects. The success of Fetch.AI (FET) can be attributed to its innovative approach to integrating AI with decentralized networks. By enabling autonomous “agents” to perform complex tasks across a decentralized platform, Fetch.AI has captured the imagination of investors and developers alike. The recent merger with other AI-focused projects has only strengthened its position, leading to predictions that Fetch.AI (FET) could reach as high as $2.2 in the near future. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A New Contender with 100X Potential While Fetch.AI (FET) continues to shine in the AI sector, a new player has entered the arena with promises of even greater returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is an AI-driven token that has caught the attention of top analysts, who believe it could deliver 100X returns for early investors. Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out due to its unique focus on combining AI with the gambling industry, offering a platform that leverages AI to enhance user experience and optimize gaming strategies. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential lies in its innovative use of AI to create a more engaging and profitable gambling environment. The platform uses AI algorithms to analyze player behavior, predict outcomes, and offer personalized gaming experiences. This approach not only sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from traditional gambling platforms but also positions it as a leader in the emerging AI gambling market. Analyst Comparisons: FET vs MPEPE Top analysts have begun comparing the potential of Fetch.ai (FET) and MPEPE, particularly in terms of their ability to deliver massive returns. While Fetch.AI (FET) has already demonstrated significant growth and stability, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is seen as a high-risk, high-reward opportunity that could offer exponential returns if it gains traction. Market Position and Innovation Fetch.AI (FET)’s position as a leader in the AI and blockchain sectors is well-established, thanks to its innovative use of decentralized autonomous agents and recent strategic mergers. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, is a newcomer with a fresh approach to integrating AI with gambling. Analysts believe that while Fetch.AI (FET) offers steady growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative platform could capture a niche market, leading to rapid adoption and significant price appreciation. Growth Potential Fetch.ai (FET) has already seen a 67% increase in price, with further gains expected as the market for AI tokens continues to expand. However, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is being touted as a potential 100X token due to its unique positioning and the growing interest in AI-driven gambling solutions. The combination of cutting-edge technology and a rapidly growing market could make Mpeppe (MPEPE) one of the most profitable investments in the crypto space. Risk vs. Reward Investing in Fetch.AI (FET) offers a relatively safer bet with proven growth and a strong foundation in the AI sector. Mpeppe (MPEPE), however, represents the potential for much greater rewards. For investors Mpeppe (MPEPE) could offer unparalleled returns, especially if it manages to capture a significant share of the AI gambling market. Conclusion: A Tale of Two Tokens In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, both Fetch.AI (FET) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer compelling investment opportunities. Fetch.AI (FET) provides a stable and innovative platform with a strong track record in the AI sector, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an exciting new opportunity with the potential for massive returns. For investors, the choice between Fetch.AI (FET) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) may come down to their risk tolerance and investment goals. Those looking for steady growth and a proven track record may find FET to be the better option. However, for those willing to embrace the pursuit of extraordinary gains, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be the token that delivers 100X returns. As the market continues to develop, it will be interesting to see how these two tokens perform and whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) can live up to its potential as the next big thing in AI-driven cryptocurrency.

32936688,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638307,1724857206,FET Whale Investors Adds New 100X Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Rival To Holdings,"Fetch.ai (FET) has recently made headlines with its impressive market performance, particularly among whale investors. Over the past week, Fetch.ai saw a remarkable 75% increase in its seven-day chart, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. However, it’s not just the gains that are making waves; it’s also the strategic moves by these whale investors that highlight the growing interest in AI-centric tokens and their potential rivals, including the rising star, Mpeppe (MPEPE). Fetch.ai’s Meteoric Rise and Whale Activity Fetch.ai (FET) is no stranger to market volatility, but its recent performance has been nothing short of spectacular. The decentralized, open-source blockchain platform, which focuses on developing and deploying decentralized autonomous agents (DAAs), has become a focal point for investors looking to capitalize on the growing trend of artificial intelligence in blockchain technology. One of the most significant developments in the Fetch.ai ecosystem was a notable whale transaction. A large investor initially sold 2.33 million Fetch.ai (FET) tokens worth approximately $2.385 million at a price of $1.02 per token between August 11 and August 23. However, the market’s bullish momentum drew the whale back in, leading to a buyback of 1.79 million Fetch.ai (FET) coins at a higher price of $1.33 per token, amounting to a total of $2.385 million. This move, while costly, underscores the growing confidence in Fetch.ai’s potential and signals that the whale investors are doubling down on their bets, anticipating further price increases in the near future. The Emergence of New Rivals: Mpeppe (MPEPE) and an AI-Centric Cryptocurrency While Fetch.ai has been basking in the spotlight, two new tokens are quietly making their entrance into the AI-centric and blockchain spaces, positioning themselves as formidable rivals to established players like the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and Fetch.ai (FET). The first, a new AI-focused cryptocurrency, promises to deliver cutting-edge AI capabilities within the blockchain ecosystem. The second, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is quickly gaining traction as a potential 100X investment opportunity. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been particularly interesting for whale investors who see its potential to become the next big meme token in the blockchain space. With its strong community backing and innovative approach to tokenomics, MPEPE is making waves, attracting investors looking to diversify and maximize their returns in the booming crypto market. Why Whale Investors Are Adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) and the New AI Token to Their Holdings Potential for Massive Gains: Both Mpeppe (MPEPE) and the new AI token are being touted as potential 100X investments, especially as they are still in their early stages. For whale investors who have already seen substantial returns with Fetch.ai (FET), these new tokens represent opportunities to multiply their gains by getting in on the ground floor of what could be the next big things in AI and blockchain. Strategic Diversification: Even with Fetch.ai’s strong performance, diversification remains a key strategy for large investors. By adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) and the new AI-focused token to their portfolios, whale investors are hedging their bets, ensuring they are well-positioned to profit from multiple avenues within the AI and cryptocurrency sectors. Growing Market Demand for AI and Meme Solutions: The rapid advancements in AI and the increasing demand for AI-driven solutions across industries make the new AI token an attractive investment. Meanwhile, the meme culture around Mpeppe (MPEPE) is proving to be a strong driver of market interest, as communities rally behind the token. As businesses and individuals seek out more intelligent, autonomous solutions, and fun, engaging investments, these tokens are likely to see significant growth. The Road Ahead for FET, Mpeppe (MPEPE), and Their Rivals As Fetch.ai continues to ride the wave of its recent successes, the introduction of new tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) and the emerging AI cryptocurrency into the market adds interesting dynamics. With whale investors keenly watching and participating in all three projects, the competition among Fetch.ai, MPEPE, and their rivals is likely to drive innovation and adoption in both the AI blockchain and meme token spaces. For investors, particularly those already holding Fetch.ai (FET), Mpeppe (MPEPE) and the new AI token offer chances to further diversify and potentially reap even greater rewards. As the market for AI-centric cryptocurrencies and meme tokens expands, Fetch.ai, MPEPE, and their new rivals are well-positioned to lead the charge, offering groundbreaking solutions that could reshape the future of decentralized technology. Conclusion: Strategic Diversification with Mpeppe (MPEPE) The recent investments by whale investors into both a new, low-priced AI blockchain project and Mpeppe (MPEPE) alongside their existing Fetch.ai (FET) holdings highlight the importance of strategic diversification in the crypto market. While Fetch.ai continues to show strong bullish signals, the potential for explosive growth in these emerging projects is too enticing for savvy investors to ignore. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these developments will be crucial. Whether these new projects, including Mpeppe (MPEPE), will live up to their potential remains to be seen, but with significant backing and a promising start, they are certainly ones to watch. For now, whale investors appear to be hedging their bets by balancing the security of well-established tokens like Fetch.ai with the high-reward potential of emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) and the new AI-centric cryptocurrency. This strategic move not only showcases the importance of diversification in an ever-changing crypto landscape but also highlights the growing interest in innovative projects that push the boundaries of blockchain technology and meme culture. Whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) will follow in the footsteps of other successful meme coins or carve out its unique path in the market, one thing is clear: investors are paying close attention, and the next big wave in the crypto world might just be on the horizon. For those looking to stay ahead of the curve, now might be the perfect time to explore what Mpeppe (MPEPE) has to offer as it positions itself as a strong contender in the race for 100X gains in 2024 and beyond.

The Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed that he would undergo “initial questioning and possible indictment” in France’s capital.

According to a press release published by French authorities late Wednesday, Durov is being charged with being complicit in the administration of an online platform allowing illicit transactions, refusing to comply with police requests for documents or other communications in ongoing investigations, being complicit in the dissemination of child exploitation material and a host of other charges.  He's also being accused of providing encryption services without embedding controls in Telegram.  ""The almost total absence of response from Telegram to the judicial requisitions was brought to the attention of the cybercrime section (J3) of the JUNALCO (National Jurisdiction for the Fight against Organised Crime, within the Paris prosecutor's office), in particular by the OFMIN (National Office for Minors),"" the release said when translated from French. ""When consulted, other French investigation services and public prosecutors as well as various partners within Eurojust, particularly Belgian ones, shared the same observation. This is what led JUNALCO to open an investigation into the possible criminal liability of the managers of this messaging service in the commission of these offenses.""  The investigation began in February 2024, and an initial indictment was returned on July 8, the release said.  French police said they released him from custody ahead of his court appearance, which led to some confusion – and a brief jump in the price of the TON cryptocurrency linked to Telegram – that he'd been fully freed. In reality, he was just headed to the courthouse.  Wednesday evening's press release said he had to pay a 5 million euro deposit, report to a French police station at least twice a week and was barred from leaving the country.

This performance stands out, especially as XRP managed to respect a critical level of support, indicating strength amidst broader market weakness. Related Reading: Is $10,000 Possible For XRP? Crypto Pundit Shares Bold Predictions Both analysts and traders are optimistic about XRP’s potential, pointing to its strong fundamentals and recent price action as signs of future growth. Some bold predictions from market analysts suggest that XRP could reach as high as $500 next year, driven by increased adoption and favorable regulatory developments. While such predictions are ambitious, XRP’s resilience highlights its potential as a strong contender in the evolving crypto market. Investors are keeping a close eye on how XRP will perform in the coming months, particularly as it navigates this period of market volatility. Is XRP Reaching $500? XRP has shown remarkable strength over the past month, outperforming most altcoins and fueling speculation and expectations among investors and traders who believe it will be a top performer in this bull run. Prominent crypto analyst Amonyx reflects this optimism in his analysis, recently sharing a bold forecast on X. Amonyx projects an ambitious price target of $589 by 2025 based on the belief that XRP is primed for a massive breakout after years of accumulation. According to Amonyx’s analysis, XRP has been in a long-term accumulation phase since 2018, marked by steady accumulation and consolidation. Investors often see this prolonged phase as a precursor to a significant price surge, as the pent-up demand eventually drives the price higher. Following recent developments, XRP now operates in a cleaner regulatory environment, making its potential for a breakout even more pronounced. Related Reading: XRP Set To Explode? Top Analyst Predicts $33 Rally XRP’s solid fundamentals and resilience in the current market make it one of the most solid projects in the crypto space. As the market moves forward, all eyes are on XRP, with many expecting it to play a leading role in the next phase of the bull run. XRP Testing Key Support XRP is trading at $0.5754, holding above a critical indicator, the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $0.5502. This indicator is historically significant in defining an asset’s strength and direction, often marking the line between a long-term uptrend and a potential downturn. When an asset respects the daily 200 MA as support, it typically signals that it is in a sustained uptrend. It must break past the $0.62 resistance level to continue its bullish trajectory. Achieving this would likely solidify the uptrend and set the stage for targeting new highs. Related Reading: XRP Price Reverses Course: Are More Losses Coming? However, if the price fails to maintain its position above the daily 200 MA at $0.5502, it could signal weakness, leading to a potential retest of lower demand levels and sideways consolidation. This level is crucial for determining the next move, with traders closely watching for signs of a continuation of the uptrend or a deeper correction.

""OpenSea has received a Wells notice from the SEC threatening to sue us because they believe NFTs on our platform are securities,"" OpenSea's CEO Devin Finzer wrote on social media platform X.  ""We're shocked the SEC would make such a sweeping move against creators and artists. But we're ready to stand up and fight,"" he added.  Wells notices are preliminary warnings that inform respondents of the charges the regulator is considering bringing against them. They usually lead to enforcement actions.  Finzer said his company will fight the notice and pledged $5 million to help cover legal fees for any NFT creators and developers that may also get such a notice.  Read more: Blur, Tensor Tokens Dip After NFT Marketplace OpenSea Receives SEC Wells Notice  ""I hope the SEC will come to its senses sooner rather than later, and that they'll listen with an open mind,"" he added.  OpenSea is not the first crypto company to get a Wells notice from the SEC. In April, decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap recieved a Wells notice suggesting the SEC believed the company was acting as an unregistered securities broker and exchange. Similar Wells notices have been directed against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, and popular trading platform Robinhood (HOOD).  Is Art a Security?  As Finzer pointed out, however, OpenSea's reciept of a Wells notice is still a move into uncharted territory, because it implies that the SEC considers NFTs to be securities.  In 2023, the SEC brought two enforcement actions against NFT projects – Impact Theory and Stoner Cats – alleging that both projects were breaking securities laws. Both actions led to settlements with the agency.  The enforcement actions against Stoner Cats and Impact Theory, as well as a spate of class action lawsuits against other NFT companies like Dapper Labs, led to a sort of chilling effect in the NFT space as creators and companies wait to find out how they will be regulated. In July, online betting company DraftKings announced that it was shutting down its NFT business citing ""recent legal developments.""  In his X post, Finzer pointed to the recent lawsuit filed by two NFT artists in a Louisiana court seeking a declaratory judgment that their projects would not be considered securities.  Read more: Does the SEC Really Have Jurisdiction Over NFT Art? Two Artists Sue SEC to Get an Answer  ""It would be a terrible outcome if creators stopped making digital art because of regulatory saber-rattling,"" Finzer wrote.

The ether {{ETH}} ETFs commenced trading in the U.S. on July 23, roughly six months after the bitcoin {{BTC}} funds. In the five weeks following each launch, the ether funds suffered about $500M of net outflows while the bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of more than $5 billion, according to the bank's team.  The weak numbers for the ether ETFs were somewhat expected, said the bank, noting bitcoin's ""first mover advantage,"" the lack of staking, and lower liquidity meaning less appeal to institutional investors.  Unexpected though were $2.5 billion in outflows from Grayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which the bank had anticipated would be more like $1 billion as it converted from a closed-end fund to a spot ETF. JPMorgan noted that Grayscale has also launched a mini ether exchange-traded fund to counter the outflows from ETHE, but this ETF has only seen $200 million of inflows.  ""Due to weaker demand for spot ether ETFs compared to bitcoin, there appears to be a growing interest among asset managers to file for a combined ETF that offers exposure to bitcoin and ether,"" the team, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, wrote.  Institutional and retail ownership of spot bitcoin ETFs was little changed from the first quarter, with retail holding about 80%, the bank said, adding that ""most of the new spot bitcoin ETFs were likely bought by retail investors since their launch, either directly or indirectly via investment advisors.

32934023,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638291,1724850049,FLOKI: Mpeppe Casino Presale Attracts Whale FLOKI Investors To Double Profits,"Floki (FLOKI) has emerged as a significant player in the memecoin space, and recent analysis suggests that it could be on the brink of a massive breakout. As FLOKI gains momentum, investors are seeking new opportunities to maximize their profits, and many are turning to the Mpeppe (MPEPE) casino presale as a promising avenue. This article explores the growing interest of FLOKI investors in Mpeppe (MPEPE) and the potential for substantial returns. FLOKI’s Potential 200% Surge Floki (FLOKI) has recently captured the attention of analysts and investors alike. A well-known analyst on X (formerly Twitter), World of Charts, has predicted that Floki (FLOKI) could be set for a significant breakout, with the potential to surge by up to 200%. This forecast is based on Floki (FLOKI)’s resilience in the face of a broader market downturn, which has only fueled optimism for a substantial price increase by the end of the year. Currently trading at approximately $0,0001529, Floki (FLOKI) has already shown impressive growth, with a 28.84% increase in the last seven days. The token’s market capitalization now stands at around $1.46 billion, underscoring its growing importance in the memecoin sector. Analysts believe that if Floki (FLOKI) successfully breaks through the upper boundary of the triangle pattern observed on its charts, it could trigger a strong rally, potentially leading to a new all-time high (ATH). FLOKI Investors Eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) for Doubling Profits As Floki (FLOKI) investors anticipate a potential breakout, many are also exploring other investment opportunities to diversify their portfolios and maximize profits. One such opportunity is the Mpeppe (MPEPE) casino presale.

The presale has already attracted significant attention, with many investors seeing it as a potential vehicle to double their profits, especially as the token is currently priced attractively for early adopters. The Synergy Between FLOKI and Mpeppe (MPEPE) The appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) to Floki (FLOKI) investors lies in the potential for synergistic growth. Both tokens operate in the memecoin space, but Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a distinct advantage by tapping into the lucrative online casino industry. This dual focus on entertainment and investment potential makes it an appealing choice for investors who are already bullish on Floki (FLOKI). Moreover, the entry of Floki (FLOKI) whale investors into the Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale could further validate the token’s potential, attracting even more interest from the broader crypto community. As Floki (FLOKI) continues to build momentum towards a possible 200% surge, the profits from Mpeppe (MPEPE) could provide a substantial boost to investors’ portfolios. FLOKI’s Resilience and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Promise TimelessBeing, another prominent analyst, has highlighted Floki (FLOKI)’s resilience during the current crypto market downturn. Despite the challenging conditions, Floki (FLOKI) has maintained its value, and analysts are optimistic about its prospects for a significant price increase before the end of the year. This resilience has led many Floki (FLOKI) investors to retain their holdings, anticipating a major rally. In parallel, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is building its reputation as a promising new entrant in the memecoin and gambling sectors. The ongoing presale has garnered attention not only from Floki (FLOKI) investors but also from the wider crypto market, as Mpeppe (MPEPE) positions itself as a token with high growth potential.

32934022,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638287,1724850042,Tron: New Casino Cryptocurrency Attracts TRX & BNB Investors To Presale,"Currently, a new casino-focused cryptocurrency is emerging as a prime opportunity for Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) investors. This new player, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is gaining significant attention in its presale phase, attracting investors who are eager to capitalize on its potential to revolutionize the online gambling industry. Here’s why Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) holders are flocking to this new presale and what makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a must-watch token in 2024. The Rise of Casino Cryptocurrencies Online gambling has been a rapidly growing industry, and the integration of blockchain technology into this space is opening up new possibilities. Casino cryptocurrencies are designed to offer transparent, secure, and efficient transactions within the gambling ecosystem, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a leader in this niche. Tron (TRX) has already made a name for itself in the gambling sector, with several decentralized applications (dApps) on its blockchain catering to the online gaming and gambling communities. Tron’s high throughput and low transaction fees have made it a preferred choice for developers of gambling dApps. However, as the market evolves, even Tron (TRX) holders are looking for new opportunities that could provide even greater returns. Similarly, Binance Coin (BNB) has been a staple in the crypto industry, particularly for those using the Binance exchange and its various services. Binance Coin (BNB) has also seen adoption in the gambling sector, with several platforms accepting it as a payment method. However, with the emergence of new, specialized cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE), Binance Coin (BNB) investors are keen to diversify their portfolios to capture the next big wave. MPEPE: A New Contender in the Casino Crypto Market Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another memecoin; it’s a cryptocurrency with a clear focus on the online gambling market. The token is designed to facilitate seamless, fast, and cost-effective transactions on online gambling platforms, making it an attractive option for both operators and users. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from other tokens is its integration of advanced blockchain technology to ensure fairness, transparency, and security in gambling transactions. This approach is particularly appealing to Tron (TRX) and BNB investors who are familiar with the importance of these factors in the online gambling industry. MPEPE’s presale has already attracted significant attention, with early investors recognizing the potential for substantial returns as the token gains traction. The low entry price of $0.00177 offers an accessible opportunity for those looking to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next big thing in casino cryptocurrencies. Why TRX and BNB Investors Are Joining the MPEPE Presale Potential for High Returns: Both Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) have delivered impressive returns for their investors over the years. However, with MPEPE still in its presale phase, the potential for exponential growth is much higher. Early adopters could see significant gains as the token moves from presale to public listing and beyond. Niche Focus on Gambling: While Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) have broad applications across the crypto space, MPEPE’s specialized focus on the gambling industry gives it a unique edge. The online gambling market is massive and growing, and a cryptocurrency that caters specifically to this niche could see rapid adoption. Diversification: For Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an opportunity to diversify their holdings with a token that is still under the radar but has the potential to become a major player. Diversification is a key strategy for managing risk in the volatile crypto market, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) fits well into a balanced portfolio. Community and Development Support: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is backed by a strong community and a dedicated development team focused on building partnerships with online casinos and gambling platforms. This support network is crucial for the token’s long-term success and provides confidence to investors that Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a passing trend. Conclusion As the crypto market continues to evolve, new opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are emerging that cater to specific niches, offering the potential for high returns. Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) investors, recognizing the growth potential in the online gambling sector, are increasingly turning to Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) presale as a way to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the next big trend. With its focus on transparency, security, and efficiency in the gambling industry, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a strong contender in the casino cryptocurrency market. For Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) holders looking to expand their investments, joining the MPEPE presale could be a strategic move that pays off significantly in 2024 and beyond.

32933964,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638294,1724850020,FLOKI vs MPEPE: $1.5M Floki Whale Enters MPEPE Following Casino Update,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, timing is everything. Investors constantly seek the next big opportunity, and sometimes, it’s about recognizing the potential of emerging projects that could disrupt the market. This is exactly what’s happening with a recent $1.5 million move by a prominent Floki (FLOKI) whale into the Mpeppe (MPEPE) token following a significant update in the MPEPE casino platform. As both tokens continue to capture the attention of the crypto community, let’s delve into what makes this shift significant and why MPEPE is becoming the next big thing for FLOKI investors. Floki’s Potential Breakout: The Setup for Something Bigger Floki Inu (FLOKI) has been on a remarkable journey. The meme token, inspired by the Shiba Inu craze and building on its own mythology, has carved out a substantial niche in the cryptocurrency space. Recently, analysts have been buzzing about the possibility of a massive 200% surge in Floki Inu (FLOKI)’s value, driven by strong fundamentals and growing community support. The recent partnership announcements, such as the multi-year deal with the University of Miami Athletics, have further solidified Floki Inu (FLOKI)’s position in the market. This partnership is set to bring Floki Inu (FLOKI)’s blockchain game Valhalla into the mainstream, potentially attracting new users and increasing the token’s value. However, even with all these developments, some Floki Inu (FLOKI) investors are not content with sitting on their holdings alone. They’re looking to diversify and capitalize on new opportunities that could bring in even greater returns. This is where Mpeppe (MPEPE) enters the scene. The MPEPE Casino Update: A Game-Changer Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising star in the crypto world, recently made headlines with a significant update to its casino platform. The update includes enhanced features, a broader range of games, and integration with various cryptocurrencies, making it more attractive to users and investors alike. For the $1.5 million Floki Inu (FLOKI) whale, this update was the catalyst needed to diversify into MPEPE. The move is not just about diversification; it’s a strategic bet on the future of Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a major player in the online gambling sector. With the casino industry showing immense potential, particularly in the crypto space, MPEPE is positioned to benefit from a growing user base and increased transaction volumes. Why Floki Inu (FLOKI) Investors Are Looking at MPEPE Diversification of Investments: The cryptocurrency market is volatile, and even with a strong token like Floki Inu (FLOKI), diversifying into other promising projects is a wise strategy. MPEPE offers an opportunity to get in early on a project that is poised for significant growth, particularly with its innovative approach to online gambling. High Potential for Returns: Mpeppe’s recent casino update and its expanding ecosystem present a high potential for returns. The casino platform’s ability to attract users and generate revenue could lead to substantial gains for early investors. For Floki Inu (FLOKI) investors who have already seen impressive returns, MPEPE represents the next big opportunity to multiply their investments. Community-Driven Growth: Both Floki Inu (FLOKI) and MPEPE are driven by strong communities. The recent move by the Floki Inu (FLOKI) whale into MPEPE signals confidence not just in the project itself, but in the community’s ability to rally around it and drive its success. As more Floki Inu (FLOKI) investors follow suit, MPEPE could see a rapid increase in both price and adoption. The Future Outlook: MPEPE as a Major Contender As we look to the future, it’s clear that Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another token in the vast crypto universe. It’s a project with real potential, backed by innovative technology and a growing community. For Floki Inu (FLOKI) investors, the decision to enter MPEPE following the casino update is more than just a financial move; it’s a strategic play that could pay off significantly. While Floki Inu (FLOKI) continues to capture headlines with its potential 200% breakout, the smart money is also looking at MPEPE as a key part of a diversified portfolio. With the backing of major investors and the continuous development of its platform, MPEPE is well on its way to becoming a dominant force in both the crypto and online gambling spaces. As always, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable, but for those willing to take calculated risks, MPEPE could be the next big win. Whether you’re a Floki Inu (FLOKI) investor looking to diversify or a newcomer searching for the next opportunity, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is definitely a token to watch.

32934020,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638284,1724850018,$13M Solana Whale Enters New SOL & Internet Computer Rival Priced $0.00177,"Significant crypto whale activity often signals major market shifts, and the recent moves of a Solana (SOL) whale have certainly grabbed attention. After staking a massive $4.5 million worth of SOL, this whale has now made another strategic investment this time in an emerging blockchain rival to both Solana and Internet Computer (ICP), priced at just $0.00177 per token. Additionally, this savvy investor has diversified further by adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolio, signaling the growing interest in this rising star within the crypto space. These moves have sent ripples through the community, raising questions about the potential of these new players in the market. Solana’s Bullish Momentum and Whale Activity Solana (SOL) has been experiencing a period of significant accumulation, with whales and institutional investors quietly building large positions. The recent $4.5 million stake by a single whale is a clear indication of growing investor confidence in Solana’s future. This accumulation phase, as noted by crypto analyst Ali, often precedes a sharp price increase, with SOL potentially surging by over 33% to break past the $200 barrier. This bullish outlook for Solana is supported by various market indicators. For instance, Solana’s exchange netflow has been consistently negative, indicating more SOL being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited. This trend suggests increased buying pressure and a reduced circulating supply, both of which are key drivers of price appreciation. Additionally, the rising open interest (OI) in SOL reflects growing trading activity and investor interest, further bolstering the case for a significant rally. Entering the New Rival: A Strategic Move While Solana’s prospects look bright, the whale’s latest move into a new blockchain project priced at $0.00177 has caught the attention of market watchers. This emerging rival, which is yet to be widely known, presents a unique opportunity for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on early-stage growth. Alongside this, the whale’s decision to add Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolio indicates a keen eye for projects with high potential. The decision to invest in both this new project and Mpeppe (MPEPE) alongside a strong position in Solana suggests a strategic approach to balancing risk and reward. By getting in at the ground floor of these ventures, the whale is positioning themselves to potentially reap significant returns if these projects gain traction, similar to how Solana has performed over the past few years. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Gains Traction Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has been gaining considerable attention in the crypto community. Known for its strong community support and innovative tokenomics, MPEPE has attracted investors who are looking for the next big thing after the success of other meme coins. The whale’s addition of MPEPE to their portfolio further cements the token’s status as one to watch closely. MPEPE is not just another meme coin; it is backed by a strong community and is designed to create sustainable value for its holders. With a presale that has been attracting significant interest, MPEPE is positioning itself as a serious contender in the meme coin space, aiming to replicate or even surpass the success of its predecessors. What We Know About the New Rival Details about the new blockchain project the whale invested in remain scarce, but its low entry price and the backing of such a significant investor are strong indicators of its potential. The project is described as a rival to both Solana and Internet Computer (ICP), offering advanced scalability and a robust ecosystem designed to attract developers and users alike. The early investment by a Solana whale suggests that the project may have what it takes to carve out its place in the highly competitive blockchain space. Implications for Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Internet Computer (ICP) has been another major player in the blockchain space, known for its ambitious goal of decentralizing the entire internet. However, the entry of a new rival backed by Solana investors could present challenges for ICP, particularly if this new project can deliver on its promises of enhanced scalability and usability. At the same time, MPEPE’s rise could further diversify the landscape, offering a fresh alternative to both ICP and Solana (SOL). Investors who hold ICP may see this as a signal to diversify their holdings, especially if the new project begins to gain market share. The competition in the blockchain space is fierce, and the emergence of a credible rival, along with MPEPE’s ascent, could lead to shifts in investor sentiment and capital allocation. Conclusion: A Strategic Diversification The $13 million investment by a Solana whale into both a new, low-priced blockchain project and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a strategic move that highlights the importance of diversification in the crypto market. While Solana continues to show strong bullish signals, the potential for explosive growth in these emerging projects is too enticing for savvy investors to ignore. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these developments will be crucial. Whether this new project and Mpeppe (MPEPE) will live up to their potential remains to be seen, but with significant backing and a promising start, they are certainly ones to watch. For now, Solana investors seem to be hedging their bets, balancing the security of a well-established blockchain with high-reward potential of new market entrants like MPEPE.

32934017,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638279,1724850017,Husky Inu and Mpeppe Are The Hottest ICO Right Now,"Crypto investors are constantly on the hunt for the next big thing. The latest buzz surrounds two promising ICOs: Husky Inu (HINU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). These two tokens have captured the attention of the crypto community, and for good reason. Both Husky Inu and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are not only gaining traction rapidly but are also offering early investors a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next major memecoin sensations. Husky Inu (HINU): A Rising Star in the Solana Ecosystem Husky Inu (HINU) is quickly making a name for itself as one of the most exciting new memecoins on the Solana blockchain. Often affectionately referred to as Shiba Inu’s new best friend, Husky Inu (HINU) is more than just another memecoin; it’s a project with a mission to bring real utility and value to its community. By leveraging the fast and scalable Solana network, Husky Inu (HINU) is positioning itself as a top contender in the highly competitive memecoin market. The presale for HINU tokens has been nothing short of phenomenal. In a matter of days, Husky Inu (HINU) sold out its first presale stage, raising over $376,000, with the second stage selling out just as quickly. This rapid success speaks volumes about the growing interest and confidence in the project. Husky Inu (HINU)’s roadmap includes the launch of an Earn App, which will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project by performing simple tasks such as liking, reposting, and sharing content. Additionally, Husky Inu (HINU) plans to launch its own Decentralized Exchange (DEX), which will further enhance the utility and value of the HINU token. Key features driving Husky Inu’s popularity include: Capped Token Supply: With a total supply of 100 billion HINU tokens, scarcity is built into the project, ensuring long-term value retention. Deflationary Mechanism: Husky Inu (HINU) will burn 50% of all platform fees from its exchange and DEX, gradually reducing the circulating supply of HINU tokens over time. Charity Voting: 5% of the total HINU token supply is allocated for community rewards and charitable donations, allowing users to vote on which causes receive support. Speedy Transactions: Leveraging the Solana blockchain, Husky Inu (HINU) offers quick and low-cost transactions, making it an attractive option for traders. As the presale progresses, Husky Inu (HINU) is selling out at lightning speed, and the opportunity to buy HINU tokens at the modest price of $0.00012500 is quickly diminishing. Early investors are encouraged to act fast to secure their stake in what could become the next big memecoin. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Powerhouse While Husky Inu (HINU) is making waves in the Solana ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out its own niche as a powerhouse in the memecoin world. MPEPE, which has already completed over 80% of its Stage 3 presale, is rapidly gaining popularity due to its strong community support and viral marketing strategies. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) token is priced attractively at $0.001777, and with the presale nearing completion, early investors have a limited window to take advantage of this low entry price. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its potential for exponential growth, similar to the meteoric rise of other successful memecoins. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has garnered attention from various corners of the crypto community, with investors drawn to its promise of high returns. The project’s community-driven approach and innovative features make it a strong contender in the crowded memecoin market. A Winning Combination Husky Inu (HINU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) represent two of the hottest ICOs in the crypto space right now. Both projects offer unique value propositions and have the potential to deliver significant returns for early investors. Whether you’re drawn to the speed and scalability of Husky Inu (HINU) on the Solana blockchain or the viral appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE), these two tokens are worth keeping an eye on. As the memecoin market continues to evolve, Husky Inu (HINU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are positioned to be key players in the next wave of cryptocurrency growth. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios with high-potential projects, these two tokens offer an exciting opportunity to get in early on what could be the next big thing in crypto.

Popcat, a new addition to the long list of memecoins available for investors, has drawn the attention of investors and traders after its price shot up since it was first released on Solana. According to CoinGecko, the token has risen nearly 53% since last week, an incredible achievement for the token. Related Reading: New ATH Incoming? Expert Says PEPE Poised For ‘Humongous’ Breakout The rally has been impressive for the meme coin, but the market’s general bearishness cannot be understated. The broader market is down nearly 8% after weeks of continuous bullishness ever since the start of August. The question then is whether Popcat will continue its astonishing rally or follow the consensus of the market. Robinhood Announces Support For Solana Yesterday, the highlight went to Solana after news that Robinhood, a trading platform that caters to crypto enthusiasts as well, announced that it now supports the Solana network. Popcat, being part of the Solana network, will benefit from this it opens the meme coin to retail investors outside the typical crypto space.

These developments will help Popcat gain more traction despite the market forming a slippery slope as the bears overtake the bulls in the short term. However, investors should be cautious as the bearish consensus in the market might be foresight on what’s to come for Popcat. 📢RabbitX Listing Announcement 📢 By community request, $POPCAT is now available for trading with up to 20x leverage at https://t.co/wbZb9jUboe Back the Bunny! 🐰💕🙀 pic.twitter.com/PgQcQgFl8z — RabbitX 🐇 Get 📲 App Now! (@rabbitx_io) August 27, 2024 Rejection At $0.7172 Shows Downward Trajectory Despite Popcat’s surprising performance in the past seven days, a flip in investor sentiment might have already occurred within the past couple of days. As it currently stands, the token has been rejected on the $0.7172 ceiling, delaying any hope for the coin’s rally to break through $0.7172. The token has a strong position though. Sitting between $0.62 and $0.71 places it comfortably on a strong rebound platform that opens the opportunity to retest $1 if the market environment favors the bulls. It also sports a high correlation with Bitcoin which, at the very least, will pull the token upward once the bulls retake their dominance in the long term. However, the short term remains to be bear territory as the bears continue to halt any progress in the meme coin’s upward trajectory. In this case, bears are eyeing a target of $0.41 in the medium term to secure their gains. Related Reading: Floki Bullish Breakout Ignites: Could A 96% Surge Be Next? On the other hand, the bulls should continue attempting to stabilize the token’s price between $0.62 and $0.71 to prevent the bears from gaining ground in the long term.

42390528,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2djp,1724847183,WazirX Asks Singapore Court for 6 Months to Restructure Liabilities as CoinSwitch Weighs Legal Action,"WazirX, which lost $234 million in a hack, has filed an application with the Singapore High Court for a six-month moratorium.  It intends to develop a plan that allocates the impact from the cyberattack pro-rata across users.  Indian crypto platform CoinSwitch said it has ""no choice"" but to sue WazirX to recover its lost deposits.  Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX asked the Singapore High Court for six months' protection while it restructures its liabilities after losing $234 million to a hack in July as rival CoinSwitch said it is likely to pursue legal action to recover assets deposited on the system.  The filing by Singapore-incorporated Zettai Pte, whose subsidiary Zanmai India operates WazirX, said a moratorium will give the company the time it needs to develop a restructuring plan, which ""represents the most efficient way to address users’ cryptocurrency balances on the Platform and facilitate recovery for users,"" according to a WazirX blog post on Wednesday.  An automatic moratorium of 30 days kicks in with the Aug. 27 filing, providing protection from possible legal action by CoinSwitch, which is seeking to recover $9.6 million worth of deposits it had on the platform. A date for the hearing on whether to grant a longer moratorium has not been scheduled.  ""From the day of the incident, we have tried to be in constant touch with the WazirX team, seeking recovery of the funds that are stuck on their exchange,"" CoinSwitch said in a post on X. ""However, our efforts have not come to fruition, leaving us with no choice but to pursue legal action to recover the funds.""  WaxirX co-founder Nischal Shetty submitted an affidavit under the Zettai name to support the application. A dispute with Binance is ongoing over who owns the platform.  Under the ""restructuring, the impact from the cyberattack will be allocated pro-rata across users who rank equally with each other as unsecured creditors, and users will receive a share of available token assets associated with the Platform proportionate to their share of all users’ unsecured claims for their account balances,"" according to WaxirX's blog post.  Search for a 'white knight'  Among WazirX's options, one is to engage a ""suitable white knight,"" Shetty’s affidavit said.  WazirX’s management is in talks with 11 companies, and at least some have ""expressed interest in providing rescue financing or partnering,"" some of which voiced concerns over the uncertainty related to possible legal action.  The filing revealed that the hack ""caused a wave of panic"" and ""a real danger of an uncontrolled bank run of withdrawal requests that the Platform would not be able to meet.""  The platform has a user base of about 16 million users, of which around 4.4 million maintain cryptocurrency balances. As of Aug. 24, the platform has received more than 9,700 withdrawal-related emails and platform messages, and four legal notices.  Shetty provided a breakdown of the user balances on the platform as of 18 July, the date on which the exchange froze withdrawals. It showed that WazirX held $570,068,358 million for 4,353,299 users, 94% of whom are from India. WazirX still holds $284 million.  WazirX also said it had set aside $12 million in cryptocurrency tokens to meet anticipated costs for the investigations and legal expenses.

Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,934 −3.5%  Bitcoin (BTC): $59,953 −4.0%  Ether (ETC): $2,522 −4.0%  S&P 500: 5,625.80 +0.2%  Gold: $2,538 +0.9%  Nikkei 225: 38,371.76 +0.22%  Top Stories  The TON blockchain resumed activity after a nearly six-hour outage caused by a surge in network traffic. An airdrop of the DOGS memecoin might have been the culprit as the popularity of the token caused a jump in transactions. Some observers pointed out that the network struggled to meet demand, with transactions per second coming well under what was expected. Bybit temporarily suspended withdrawals and deposits because of the outage, citing network instability, according to a post on X by Wu Blockchain. The outage saw TON’s native token, toncoin, fall as low as $5.13, a drop of 9% from the $5.65 it was trading at beforehand.  Read More: Telegram-Linked TON Blockchain Suffers Second Outage  TON's toncoin token trimmed some of its losses to outperform the broader digital asset market following the blockchain's restart. TON is 2% higher in the last 24 hours, trading around $5.51. Though the downtime was partially blamed on the popularity of the DOGS airdrop, the token showed some resilience following the resumption of activity. DOGS was airdropped by the Ton Foundation to raise awareness for what it believes is the unjust arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov. Telegram and TON are separate entities even though one is often used with the other.  DeFi lender MakerDAO rebranded to “Sky” as part of its ongoing revamp. The protocol, which has $7 billion of assets, will also introduce new versions of its $5 billion stablecoin (DAI) and its governance token (MKR): the USDS stablecoin and the SKY governance token. DAI and MKR will stay in circulation unchanged, with the new tokens existing in parallel. Token holders will be able to exchange DAI tokens 1:1 for USDS, while each MKR token can be swapped for 28,000 SKY tokens. The new tokens will be issued on Sept. 18, and holders can choose to keep the old tokens or exchange for the new ones.

42390532,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2e9T,1724846400,Institutional Investors Continue to Increase Digital Asset Allocation: Economist Report,"Institutional investors continue to remain bullish about digital assets, embracing instruments beyond holding crypto like staking and derivatives.  Even though they are bullish, challenges to further adoption remain on the horizon.  Institutional investors are set to increase digital asset allocations in their portfolio to 7% by 2027, with the market for tokenized assets projected to surpass $10 trillion by 2030, signaling significant growth in the sector, but challenges remain on the horizon according to a new report on the topic from The Economist commissioned by crypto exchange OKX.  Currently, asset managers allocate between 1%-5% of their assets under management (AUM) to digital assets.  ""The positioning of digital assets within institutional portfolios has been focused on trading of cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin and ether representing the largest investment avenues,"" the report reads. ""But institutional investors are exhibiting greater optimism around digital assets, encouraged by the expanding availability of a wider range of investment vehicles that take them beyond just cryptocurrencies.""  The report says 51% of institutional investors are considering spot crypto allocations, 33% are looking at staking digital assets, 32% are exploring crypto derivatives and 36% are looking at funds that track crypto.  More institutional investors are now considering digital assets outside of just holding cryptocurrencies, such as staking, crypto derivatives, and tokenized bonds, highlighted by the uptick in digital assets on the market like the European Investment Bank's pounds 50 million ($66 million) digitally native bond, the $1 billion in tokenized U.S. treasuries, and the HK$6 billion ($766.8 million) Hong Kong digital currency bond.  Custodians are also playing an important role in allowing institutional investors to embrace digital assets, with 80% of traditional and crypto hedge funds surveyed using a custodian, the report says. Within Asia, many crypto custodians are obtaining the same custodian licenses as their TradFi counterparts, such as Hong Kong's Trust or Company Service Provider (TCSP) while in Singapore, the country's Monetary Authority has created its own crypto custodian framework.  But there are still challenges on the horizon, such as the lack of regulatory harmony.  ""The lack of uniformity in regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions creates uncertainty, making it challenging for institutional investors to navigate compliance requirements and manage the risks associated with regulatory changes,"" the report reads while praising Europe's MiCA as an example of regional regulation that works.  ""Varying approaches across regions can lead to market instability and complicate efforts for institutions to integrate digital assets into their portfolios,"" the authors continued.  The report said the fragmentation of liquidity is another concern for investors, as it can cause market instability and make it difficult for institutions to execute transactions efficiently in the digital asset space.  ""Liquidity fragmentation across different blockchain networks and digital asset markets can lead to price inefficiencies, posing a significant challenge for institutional investors handling large-scale transactions,"" the report reads.  There are attempts to solve this problem with technology like native token transfers, which are considered to be an evolution in wrapped crypto.  Native token transfers, as CoinDesk previously reported, enable seamless cross-chain movement of tokens while maintaining their unique properties and ownership, unlike wrapped assets, which create multiple, non-fungible versions.  This report from OKX reached a similar conclusion to a recent Nomura survey, which found that 54% of Japanese institutional investors plan to invest in cryptocurrencies within the next three years, with 25% having a positive view of digital assets and a preferred allocation of 2%-5% of AUM.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/28/institutional-investors-continue-to-increase-digital-asset-allocation-economist-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/829168f03a01d6b5c3e60ff18b6088bfc01c6c71-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32931881,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638207,1724844623,"Buying Bitcoin Now Is Like Getting It Below $10,000 In 2019: Experts","Bitcoin is weaving through a consolidation phase since marking a new all-time high of $73,777 in mid-March. Since then, Bitcoin’s daily closing prices have exhibited significant restraint, never sealing above $71,500 and maintaining a floor above $54,000, though it has seen a major intraday low touching $49,000. This consolidation phase has nudged the Fear and Greed Index towards a cautious “fear” score of 30, revealing an atmosphere of apprehension amongst traders who find themselves frequently whipsawed by the volatile market dynamics. Is $60,000 The New $10,000 For Bitcoin Price? Despite the prevailing market nerves, some market experts believe that this is a potential buying opportunity, reminiscent of similar market conditions seen in 2019. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart remarked via X: “Bitcoin right now around $50k-$70k over the last 6 months kinda sorta reminds of BTC trading around $7k – $10k from mid 2019 through early to mid 2020.” Related Reading: Expert Explains Why Bitcoin Price Could Explode To $1 Million This Cycle He acknowledges the complexities of comparing historical and current charts, emphasizing that while historical patterns should not dictate future outcomes, the comparative dynamics offer insightful parallels. “I obviously know not to equate historical charts with current charts. i know all the differences of the current price dynamics etc. $10k was way further off the $20k+ ATH that 60K is. But go ahead — make fun of me. I can take it,” Seyffart added. James “Checkmate” Check, a leading on-chain analyst and co-founder of Checkonchain, concurred with Seyffart’s observation. “The similarities between the 2024 chop-consolidation, and the one we experienced back in 2019 are strange, and uncanny.” In 2019, the market notably surged from $4,000 to $14,000 within three months, significantly driven by the PlusToken Ponzi scheme in China, which absorbed approximately 2% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply at the time. This was followed by a mass sell-off of these acquired coins on Huobi by the Chinese CCP, contributing to prolonged market choppiness until the sharp downturn in March 2020. Drawing a parallel, Check noted that a similar sequence unfolded in 2024 when the market climbed from $40,000 to $73,777, catalyzed by a substantial uptake in spot bids from US spot ETFs, absorbing around 5% of the Bitcoin supply. This was succeeded by substantial selling activities from the US and German governments, involving approximately 70,000 BTC, which contributed to sustained market chop until the 5-August Yen Carry Trade unwind. “Seriously, it is truly bizarre how similar these events are, and this is just based on the headline events. There is even more evidence below the surface,” Check concluded. He shared several on-chain metrics which highlight the strong similarities. Related Reading: Top Economist Predicts Bitcoin Price Top Before Worst Recession Since 1929 His “Supply Overheads During 2024 Chop-consolidation” chart showed that the 6-month sum of spent coins older than 1 year was quite similar to historical movements. In 2019, 1.75 million BTC was moved by this cohort; comparably, in 2024, as of today, 1.9 million BTC has been mobilized. Noteworthy, the large entities, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), German Government, and the US government, accounted for about 454,000 BTC of this movement. Additional data from Check’s analysis highlighted the “Realized Profits” during these periods. In 2019, 3.4 million BTC were sold for profit over six months. In 2024, this figure stands at 3.33 million BTC. However, the analysis of realized losses provides a stark contrast between the two periods. In 2019, losses equaled 30% of the profits, indicating a market fraught with investor fear and readiness to sell at losses. Conversely, in 2024, losses are only 10% of the profits. This comparison demonstrates how market sentiment has shifted from 2019 to 2024, with investors in 2024 appearing more confident and less prone to panic selling. At press time, BTC traded at $59,689.

Q2 results were mixed; revenue fell due to April's halving, but increased hash rate and BTC price helped mitigate losses. Bitfarms' potential expansion into HPC/AI offers future growth, but current capex exceeds operating cash flows, and Riot's control struggle adds uncertainty. For these reasons, it's safer to treat BITF as a Hold. Bitfarms ( BITF ) is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner I've covered twice now. The first time , I give a general summary of the company and my initial appraisal, and the second time I provided a follow-up after the release of Q1 2024 results. Both times I rated BITF a Hold, citing a lack of positive free cash flow; potential for share dilution; the strained departure of their CEO in the spring; an attempted takeover by a rival, Riot Platforms ( RIOT ); and potential revenue loss from April's halving event. It also had it good points, such as their more efficient operating model, positive cash flows from operations, a decent cash balance, lack of debt, and better overall strategic sense of their business. I still rate BITF a Hold, but new developments, good and bad, from the release of Q2 2024 results and afterward are worth an update to my thesis. Leadership Changes In Q2, Ben Gagnon was confirmed as the new, permanent CEO. Having previously served as the Chief Mining Officer, he's no stranger to Bitfarms or its operations. Q2 2024 Company Presentation Moreover, I've quoted him before from earnings calls. I've found that he's willing to give detailed answers to analysts that enhance investors' understanding of the business and why the goals they set are important. In my view, he was a natural replacement for Morphy as CEO. He is also replacing the interim CEO, Nicolas Bonta, who had taken the role as Chairman of the Board of Directors. On that note, Bonta, one of the company's founders, has been removed from the Board. This is a result of the continued takeover attempts by Riot, and much of this occurred in the third quarter and even after the Q2 earnings call , which was August 9th. The first thing worth noting is that Riot opened a suit against Bitfarms, appealing for three new directors on the Board. They also launched an activist website called ABetterBitfarms.com in early July. ABetterBitfarms.com The screenshot above speaks to Riot's displeasure with the response to their takeover attempt. As I mentioned last time, Riot acquired 12% of the company's shares, making them the largest shareholder. In turn, the Board announced a poison pill plan to dilute BITF with new issues if Riot ever exceeded 15% of the outstanding shares. As a result of the suit, however, the plan was overturned, resulting in a second that set a new threshold at 20%. Riot has since increased its stake in BITF to 18.9%. Bonta's removal as Chairman occurred on August 13th, after additional pressure from Riot. This follows the failure of Emiliano Grodzki, another co-founder, to win re-election to the Board at the annual shareholder meeting in May. Thus, while I feel good about Gagnon as a new CEO, the governance of the Board is in question and shows Riot steadily improving its position, even ousting founders. This may result in a deal to acquire all of BITF, which is important to keep in mind as I review the financial results. Q2 Results Their second quarter wasn't too bad, but it was affected by the halving in April. Q2 2024 Company Presentation While revenue and margin showed improvements compared to year-over-year results, this was not true for quarter-over-quarter. Revenue fell from $50M to $42M. In the earnings call, CFO Jeff Lucas summarized the causes: The change was due primarily to the decrease in block rewards following the April halving. During the quarter, we earned 614 Bitcoin, 35% fewer quarter-over-quarter, primarily the result of the halving and a 10% increase in average network difficulty. Why only 16% less revenue for 35% percent less BTC mined? The main reason would have to be the favorable shift in its price. BTC 1Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) With lower prices in much of Q1, Q2 results were enhanced despite the reduced volume, as the price as typically stayed around $60K. Q2 2024 Company Presentation This has further been helped by their ability to increase their hash rate and maintain competitive BTC production. Currently they are projecting that they will be able to double their hash rate by the end of the year and more than triple by the end of 2025. Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2024 Financial Report) Operating cash flows from the six months ending June 2024 were up significantly compared the prior year, indicating their ability to scale effectively. Yet, significantly more has been spent on capex, as indicated in the traditional line item of property, plant, and equipment, up to $123M from $19M last year. We must, however, almost count the $31M spent on equipment prepayments. As I discussed last time, these pertain to miner option contracts, allowing BITF to lock in prices on future miner purchases, making them a component of capex. Cash Flow Statement (Q2 2024 Financial Report) As those impacts make free cash flow negative, the gap has been plugged by increased sales of new shares on the open market and employee options, up to $181M from about $38M last year. (Ironically, BITF may not need to declare a poison pill to dilute Riot.) Q2 2024 Financial Report The balance sheet, meanwhile, shows about $195M in cash and crypto, providing what will likely be sufficient liquidity for the near term. Potential for Other Segments While Bitfarms is primarily a BTC miner, Gagnon spoke to his vision for growing the company, such that it will not depend exclusively on mining. Given their sites in Pennsylvania, he noted: ...the PJM grid is the largest wholesale electricity market in the U.S., offering abundant access to competitively priced, and flexible power that is attractive for multiple uses including Bitcoin mining, energy trading and even HPC/AI . Q2 2024 Company Presentation This is an interesting development, and it may ease the task of generating positive free cash flow. Of course, one has to wonder what makes them suited to this work when their focus has been mining. Gagnon had an answer for that, however: We own and operate a portfolio of high-quality energy assets that are currently monetized through Bitcoin mining. When we take a step back and look at how we get the most value and utilization out of our portfolio, we believe that HPC/AI has real potential. Recent HPC/AI deals are boasting revenues from approximately $140 to $210 per MWh these are potentially very attractive and stable high margin revenue streams not correlated to Bitcoin prices. Of course, it will take a year or two before anything is realized here, so it's difficult to comment on the actual financial potential, but it's a reassuring sign to see that, despite the battle over control of the company, management still is thinking critically about its operations and sees potential that goes beyond the original vision of simply mining BTC. Conclusion The new vision to branch into HPC/AI adds more potential for positive, cash flows in the future, but that is a couple of years out. At the present moment, capex exceeds operating cash flows, and a struggle for control of the company is occurring. If Riot succeeds in taking it over or exercises further influence, then the company's priorities could change entirely. While many details changed since my last coverage, my overall judgment is mostly the same. As free cash flow remains negative, a market cap of $1 billion for that doesn't give a margin of safety that is sorely needed here. Positive cash flows may not come close to that if and when they do occur. Even an optimistic thesis on the operations is complicated by the dispute with Riot. For these reasons, I continue to think that BITF is a good miner can't be rated better than a Hold.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4717551-bitfarms-blend-of-good-and-bad-news-makes-riveting-hold?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32931739.jpeg

42390527,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2du5,1724842800,"Cardano Blockchain Heads for 'Chang Hard Fork,' Biggest Upgrade in Two Years","Cardano, launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, is pushing toward its biggest upgrade in two years, with major changes to the structure of its main network, introducing mechanisms to users to participate in on-chain governance.  The upgrade, known as the ""Chang hard fork,"" is a major milestone in Cardano’s roadmap, punctuated by the much-awaited addition of smart-contracts functionality in 2021. The Chang hard fork was initially set to go through this week, but Hoskinson announced on Friday that it had been pushed back to Sept. 1 so some exchanges, including Binance, could prepare their systems.  ""The magic of deadlines is that people who aren't taking upgrades seriously suddenly say damn we got to get moving,"" Hoskinson wrote on X.  Cardano ranks as the 30th biggest blockchain by the website DeFILlama, but the project tends to be closely watched in crypto circles partly because of the colorful personality and outsize popularity of Hoskinson, known for his frequent video and podcast appearances. Hoskinson introduced Ethereum alongside co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2014 but split from the project soon afterward.  A hard fork is a major change to a blockchain that makes the older versions invalid. Sometimes contentious, but often planned and coordinated, hard forks can bring big changes for users and developers including new features or fixes to problems in the chain.  The main feature of the latest upgrade is to give Cardano the ability to introduce on-chain governance features. Those that hold ADA, Cardano’s native token, will be able to elect representatives (called Delegate Representatives, or dReps) and vote on improvement proposals as well as future technical changes to the blockchain.  “This will mark the first step towards a minimum-viable community-run governance structure outlined in CIP-1694, meaning that the Cardano community will be responsible for maintaining and shaping the blockchain network,” the Cardano Foundation, the main organization supporting the blockchain, wrote in a blog post.  CIP-1694 is the Cardano Improvement Proposal at the core of the upgrade, which introduces various governing structures to the Cardano ecosystem including its Constitutional Committee, dReps, and Stake Pool Operators (SPOs.) Once CIP-1694 is implemented, the Cardano blockchain and any changes made to it will be in the hands of these groups.  The Chang upgrade is part of the Voltaire Era, the final era on Cardano’s current roadmap. Voltaire is supposed to “provide the final pieces required for the Cardano network to become a self-sustaining system,” the foundation writes.

Through these Bitcoin futures, BITO generates income and offers a massive 44% dividend yield. Key catalysts for Bitcoin's future growth include increased retail and institutional investor exposure via Bitcoin spot ETFs and the recent halving event reducing new Bitcoin supply. BITO is best used as a complement to direct Bitcoin holdings, providing income during flat or declining markets, but it may underperform Bitcoin itself. Overview While I am predominantly a dividend investor, I do maintain some exposure to the crypto markets as a way to diversify my portfolio. Most of my exposure to crypto is Bitcoin related, and I feel that it would be a mistake to completely dismiss the asset class. While I understand the reservations people may have around the riskiness of the asset class, I think the benefits have far outweighed any of these risks. After all, Bitcoin has been the absolute best performing asset class over the last decade. Comparing the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) against the S&P 500 ( SPY ) really helps visualize how strong returns have been for long-term Bitcoin investors. Data by YCharts ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) has found the ultimate combo to get my interest by offering an ETF that has exposure to Bitcoin and also finds a way to generate a massive distribution yield for shareholders. The fund has a dividend yield greater than 44%, which has the ability to produce a large income stream without the need for a sizeable amount of starting capital invested. However, there are some risks involved here, and the yield can fluctuate depending on the month-to-month payouts. Despite potential risks, I believe that there are some positive catalysts that can take Bitcoin higher in price. As a result, BITO should also benefit from a growing price in the future, with the added benefit of collecting income while we wait. The two main sources of future appreciation may come from the recent halving event for Bitcoin in combination with a growing number of investors gaining exposure to the asset class, which ultimately adds a greater sense of price stability. BITO was launched back in 2021, making this a relatively new fund. The expense ratio sits at a very reasonable 0.95% considering that distribution yield that is offered here. According to the most recent fact sheet , net assets have grown to a total $1.77B. First, let's start by reviewing that the strategy is for BITO and how it manages to generate such a high yield in the first place. Strategy BITO has a stated objective to provide returns that correspond to the performance of Bitcoin. However, BITO doesn't actually hold any Bitcoin within and instead opts to maintain exposure to Bitcoin futures. More specifically, BITO invests in cash settled front month Bitcoin futures, which are contracts that have the absolute shortest time to maturity. If BITO is unable to get the desired futures exposure, it may choose to enter a swap agreement that provides a similar exposure to Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures. ProShares The usage of these futures are what enables BITO to pay out dividends in the first place. The fund sells these futures on a rolling month basis and the income is generated from the gains. The distribution is earned through a mixture of realized gains and net investment income. However, the distributions that are paid out to shareholders pulled directly from the NAV. Therefore, periods where Bitcoin is not rising in value will typically result in BITO's price decreasing with every single distribution paid. Therefore, I believe a good strategy here would be to use BITO as a compliment to an existing position in Bitcoin itself. This way, you would be gaining the price gains of Bitcoin but also being paid a large distribution that can help offset flat markets or even downturns. Think of it as an income hedge if you are long Bitcoin and believe that it will be worth significantly more a decade from now. As of the most recently declared monthly dividend of $1.4470 per share, the current dividend yield remains at a whopping 44%. Although the yield is high, it comes at a cost. Since the fund launched, BITO and Bitcoin have not seen any meaningful price growth. So while you're collecting a high level of income from an investment of BITO, it has the downside risk of your invested capital eroding over time. For instance, the price since inception has fallen by nearly 52%. While the distribution does help offset this a bit by increasing the total return potential, the fund is still heavily reliant on the success of Bitcoin. We can see how the total return for BITO jumps to a loss of 16% when distributions are included. Data by YCharts I do maintain a position in Bitcoin and believe that it will ultimately grow in value. My outlook is driven by two main catalysts that I will share with you all. These catalysts will likely be positive for both Bitcoin and BITO as I plan to strategically use BITO as a vehicle to get the best of both worlds: income and growth. Catalyst #1: Long-Term Buying I don't believe that Bitcoin is as risky of an asset that it once was. In the early days, Bitcoin had a reputation for more nefarious use cases, but this has since shifted to a point where BTC can be considered more of a store of value. As such, it's been an important year for BTC's history, as the SEC approved the first batch of Bitcoin spot ETFs to be available to retailer investors. As such, this expands the global reach of the crypto and makes exposure a lot more obtainable. This is huge because it means that everyone from the beginning investor to the traditional 401k retirement investors can now gain exposure to the asset class. A wider audience of exposure directly translates to a greater amount of capital flowing into this asset class. Recent reports state that BlackRock's Bitcoin Spot ETF saw the highest month-over-month inflows, totaling over $224M of new capital. This only represents cash flowing into publicly listed ETFs and does not show the number of crypto wallets that have exposure to Bitcoin. This prompted me to look at the data on now many unique addresses have exposure as well. There are near 80M different unique addresses that hold exposure to Bitcoin and although the large majority of these have balances less than $1,000, it is still great for the long-term stability of the asset class and reduces the overall volatility. Exploding Topics These are all relevant points because I believe we will slowly see the effects of reduced supply volatility. Assuming that a majority of Bitcoin investors continue to hold and outnumber the amount of investors selling, the price will eventually become more stable over time. As more of the supply gets bought up and there are fewer Bitcoins being traded back and forth, there will likely be less drastic price swings eventually, despite the price now approaching new highs. This also ties back into the fact that the asset class is now more widely available to the retail masses with the approval of the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. As more investors pile in, this could actually improve the sources of liquidity for Bitcoin, leading to smaller spreads on bids and asks. The approval of the ETFs also introduced an influx of institutional investors that may have longer time horizons, further increasing the overall stability of Bitcoin. Even if retail investors were to allocate only 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin, it could drive value and reduce overall volatility. Most retail investors obtain their exposure to the stock market through their 401k and other retirement-based accounts. Now imagine if the Bitcoin spot ETFs were one of the many pre-selected options available for employees that are deciding what allocation they would like to commit to. It's universally understood that retirement accounts like 401ks are not to be touched until retirement age, which means that a large portion of this exposure is going to be with investors that are holding for the long term. However, I will admit that this relies on investors holding on to their Bitcoin as a store of value over the long term, rather than selling out of their position. This does present a vulnerability because we have no idea what kind of unforeseen challenges can take place in the crypto markets. Bitcoin can still be subject to a wide array of regulatory challenges that ultimately minimize investor confidence in the asset class. Catalyst #2: Halving The Bitcoin halving takes place about every four years and can serve as the next huge catalyst for BTC. The significance is that the reward supply of Bitcoin gets cut in half for miners that contribute to new blocks in the network. The total Bitcoin supply is limited at twenty-one million and this process of reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin are created helps align keeping the value behind the asset. Think of this process as a simple supply and demand tradeoff: as the supply of newly mined Bitcoins decrease, the demand and cost for them will naturally increase over time. A significant piece of this relies on the reaction of Bitcoin's price after every halving event. The data clearly shows us that the price aggressively moves upward after every halving period. The last halving event took place in mid-2020, when the price of BTC sat slightly above $9k per coin. Only six months after the halving event, the price of BTC rapidly appreciated up over the $50,000 mark. Even the halving event before this in 2016, the price of BTC started around $650 per coin and rapidly grew and topped out at $17k by the end of the following year. BitBo I still believe this to be a catalyst because the most recent halving event actually happened this year in 2024. So far, it seems that the price of Bitcoin has not yet moved up in a similar fashion like prior years. While there is no specific timing as to when the price of BTC will react to the halving, I still believe that the price rise we are looking for has not happened yet and this presents an attractive opportunity to accumulate right now. An added bonus is that Bitcoin can benefit from the added volatility and uncertainty around the upcoming US Presidential elections. Looking at data compiled by Gray Scale, we can see that the price of Bitcoin has historically moved upward after every election period. The same data states that survey results showed a total of 47% of voters expect their portfolio to include some kind of crypto exposure. While this may be purely coincidental as it aligns with the timing of the halving, it's still a pretty cool data point that provides some optimism going forward. Gray Scale Lastly, inflation levels have continued to be a crushing weight on the economy. While they've recently been cooling, Bitcoin can serve as a great counterweight to the issue as it naturally aligns with a deflationary stance. This is because of the fixed supply that ensures new Bitcoins can never be created past the supply of 21M. While it seems like Bitcoin is no longer in consideration of totally replacing currencies, it's a great option to fight the effects of inflation. As more people become educated and understand this concept, I anticipate increase inflows to happen over the next decade. Downsides Despite the catalysts that, I believe, will happen in over Bitcoin's future, there are some clear risks involved here. The first being that Bitcoin is an extremely volatile asset class that can experience severe price swings at any moment. The same can be said for BITO and the high distributions implemented here have only multiplied this issue. Just as a comparison, following a large price drop throughout 2022 and 2023, BTC has ultimately rebounded and now sits in the green at 1.46%. Over the same time period, BITO has failed to recover to the same levels and still remains down over 52%. This can be attributed to the NAV erosion over time as a result of the high distribution rates issued out month by month. Therefore, BITO isn't the best choice if all you are looking for is Bitcoin exposure. BITO's income comes at the potential cost of your invested capital deteriorating over time if Bitcoin remains flat or decreases in value. I've been seeing the rise of investors using margin to take advantage of these higher yielding assets, and this is something I would not recommend with BITO because of its higher volatility. Data by YCharts Ultimately, it comes down to what your objective is. If you are simply seeking Bitcoin exposure and do not care for the income aspect, you'd be better off buying Bitcoin directly from one of the exchanges. Even if bitcoin were to double in value, BITO may underperform because of the structure that's used here. Remember, BITO doesn't actually hold any underlying Bitcoin and instead trades futures related to Bitcoin. Therefore, the price upside of BITO is likely capped in comparison. Investors should also take the tax consequences into consideration if they are holding a fund like this outside of a retirement account. The distributions received do not have favorable tax treatment similar to the qualified dividends you'd received from a more traditional ETF. They are made up from a combination of net investment income and realized capital gains, which may include portions of the dividend being classified as ordinary dividends. Takeaway In conclusion, I plan to utilize BITO as a compliment to my underlying Bitcoin exposure. The high levels of income received from BITO can be a great way to offset times of a flat or decreasing price in Bitcoin. However, I believe that the catalyst of these Bitcoin spot ETFs going public will ultimately contribute to a wider amount of investors that gain exposure to the asset class. This influx of capital has the power to make the price of Bitcoin more stable over time if there are more long-term holders and less sellers or active traders. Additionally, the price of Bitcoin has not experienced a meaningful rise after the completion of the halving event. The halving event cuts the supply of newly mined Bitcoin down and historically been associated with large price rises.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4717549-bito-2-potential-catalysts-to-look-forward-to?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32930972.jpeg

Related Reading: New ATH Incoming? Expert Says PEPE Poised For ‘Humongous’ Breakout Floki, a meme coin named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, is making waves within the crypto market. According to analysts such as CryptoAnalystHub and Javon Marks, this token is predicted to see colossal gains. But is this meme coin really due for major upside price action, or are hype and expectations running ahead of the fundamentals? On Falling Wedges And Potential Breakouts CryptoAnalystHub, a prominent analyst on social media, has successfully plotted a Bullish Falling Wedge in Floki’s price chart. This is generally indicative of the possibility of a price reversal, according to the respective technical indication. $FLOKI 🔥🚀 Update:(Formation of a Bullish Falling Wedge pattern is done )✅ Breakout is also happens, Expected move for short term buyers is 90-100% soon💰🎯#FLOKI #FLOKIUSDT #FLOKIBTC #SIGNALS #ALTSEASON #ALTCOINS #USDT$DOGS $REI $NULS $PDA $PHA $VIDT $HARD $DCR $FLUX… pic.twitter.com/ELtuhsTnks — CryptoAnalystHub (@Analysts_Hub) August 27, 2024 In other words, the pattern signals that the recent downtrend for Floki might be at its last stage, thus giving way to an upward rally. The Falling Wedge, characterized by two converging trendlines with a downward slope, has served to squeeze Floki’s price action between the lines and has printed a series of lower highs and lower lows. According to CryptoAnalystHub, a breakout above the upper trendline has already occurred, which would mean that Floki is at the cusp of a major bullish phase. However, the analyst explains that if Floki is to sustain an uptrend, it needs to be able to push above pivotal resistance areas around $0.00021176 and $0.00027969. These have been resistive zones showing renewed selling pressure in the past and, thus, are crucial for the digital asset to break through. Keeping An Eye On Floki Adding to the bullish sentiment, crypto analyst Javon Marks recently flagged Floki as one to watch. On X, Marks projected over 96% gains in store for Floki once a Hidden Bull Divergence has been confirmed. He noted that a break above $0.0002761498 would unlock the door for even healthier gains, pointing to the next key level at $0.0005467298 – a further upside of 90% from this point, further building on the optimistic prospects into the future of Floki. Coming off of a recently confirmed Hidden Bull Divergence, sights for $FLOKI (Floki Inu), in response to this divergence is still on an over 96% climb back above the $0.0002761498 target which may only open up even more room for climbing!

Noticeable growth in the network is seen, as depicted by the increase in new addresses. This could indicate a trend that fresh capital has started flowing into the Floki ecosystem and may be pushing up demand and, therefore, its price. Further supporting this is the increase in daily active addresses. Increased activity often suggests that interest and momentum are building within a community, which is usually a precursor to increased prices. Related Reading: Helium: Development Proposals Ignite 15% HNT Price Rally – Details Is The Hype Justified? While this might be so from the technical and on-chain indicators for Floki, an un-cautious approach towards such predictions is warranted, seeing that it is a meme coin. Meme coins are very prone to volatility and hence dramatic shifts in sentiment. That being said, while Floki has had a decent run in recent days, investors should be prepared to lose it all. Technical patterns, on-chain data, and the increase in investors’ interest support the great price surge of Floki. But it remains to be seen whether this meme cryptocurrency would sustain this.

32929548,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4717539-bitx-rate-cuts-could-disappoint-btc-bulls?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1724839166,BITX: Rate Cuts Could Disappoint BTC Bulls,"Summary Bitcoin's flash-crash in early August was followed by a strong recovery, the 2x leveraged ETF BITX more than doubled Bitcoin's performance over that time. September has historically been a poor month for Bitcoin, with only a 30% chance of positive returns and an average decline of 5.8%. More importantly, investment demand for BTC has been robust this year with over $20 billion in YTD capital flows into the asset. Rate cuts by the Federal Reserve may not benefit Bitcoin immediately; BTC's significant rise may occur when liquidity increases to combat a recession. On August 5th, the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) flash-crashed under $50k per coin. The price volatility was by no means unique to just Bitcoin. At the August 5th intraday lows, the S&P 500 had sold off by more than 8% from peak to trough over the course of just three trading sessions. At the time, I wrote that Bitcoin was likely a casualty of an unwind in the Japanese Yen ( USD:JPY ) carry trade. Data by YCharts Since the flash-crash at the beginning of the month, Bitcoin has recovered by 8.5% and even briefly hit $65k per coin on August 25th. As well as BTC has performed since that early-August flash-crash, the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ) has done even better after generating a 36.1% total return from the lows. This is well ahead of the 2x return goal and speaks to the importance of hitting the timing of a trade when the asset enters a strong uptrend. Data by YCharts If we judge the performance of BITX against BTC year to date, we can see that BTC is clearly the better play for longer-term holding, as the coin has outperformed a fund that is designed to double the returns of the coin itself. To reiterate, this is due to the daily rebalancing and long-term decay of leveraged ETFs like BITX. For those who are unfamiliar with this, I'd encourage you to read my previous BITX article for Seeking Alpha as I explain some of the fundamental issues more in-depth. To summarize; BITX is bad for investing, but potentially good for short-term trading. In this update, I'll get into some of the reasons why I believe speculators hungry to leverage BTC gains might want to wait before longing BITX. Seasonal Setup & Capital Flows I've covered Bitcoin's September seasonality in a previous Seeking Alpha article in August, so I'm not going to use too much real estate on it in this article. But September has historically been a rough month for BTC returns: BTC Seasonality (TrendSpider) Going back the last 11 years, with trading data from Kraken, Bitcoin has generated a positive return in September just 30% of the time. And at -5.8%, the month of September has historically been the worst month of the year for BTC by mean change. To be clear, this doesn't mean September 2024 is guaranteed to be a negative month for BTC. As the adage goes, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. Furthermore, capital flows into Bitcoin investment products likely matter more at this point than seasonality and those flows have been very strong recently per data from CoinShares: Crypto Capital Flows (CoinShares) As of the end of August 24th 2024, Bitcoin benefited from $543 million in single-week investment demand. This brings year to date investment flow into Bitcoin to a staggering $21.3 billion. And given the weakness in Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETF demand, if one strips out Bitcoin from the table above, crypto investment in the preceding week was actually negative. A week with $533 million in capital flows into digital assets was entirely reliant on BTC to be net positive. What is going on here? Liquidity And Fed Pivot I've been making the point through various Seeking Alpha articles this year that Bitcoin is an anti-fiat asset . Given that, Bitcoin likely goes as global liquidity goes, and we can see that very clearly in this chart that has been shared by Lyn Alden on X: Lyn Alden/X There are clearly large booms and busts along the way, but the price of BTC has been rising over the last 15 years because it is viewed as an alternative to state money printing. This is why we can see the booms in the price generally coincide with the large increases in global M2. With the Federal Reserve now indicating that it will be appropriate to cut rates in the future, the market is beginning to price in rate cuts in September that could be as much as 50 bps: September Rate Probabilities as of 8/27/24 (CME FedWatch) However, I think it's important to be mindful of what happened the last time the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, back in 2019: BTC vs Fed Funds (TrendSpider) Bitcoin was born out of GFC, so we only have one real attempt at a hiking cycle previous to 2022 that we can use to gauge the coin's performance following cuts. Back in 2019 when the Fed had the funds rate at slightly above 2%, Bitcoin was enjoying a large rally that had taken it from $3k per coin at the end of 2018 up to $14k in June 2019. This proved to be the top for the year, in spite of the Fed cutting rates shortly after. From the time of the first rate cut in 2019 to eventual ZIRP in 2020, BTC fell by over 60% over a 7-month period. Even if we take out COVID as an outlier, BTC still fell by over 40% from July 2019 through the end of the year, even with the central bank cutting throughout that time. Closing Summary There are admittedly competing signals from this post. On one hand, seasonality would indicate caution for the time being as Bitcoin has historically performed poorly in the month of September. On the other hand, investment demand for BTC has been robust all year and capital flows into the asset figure to matter more than historical performance. The question is, how much of that demand has already come? Any attempt at answering that would be a guess. What I do think is a fairly safe assumption is higher BTC prices generally go hand in hand with growth in global M2. But judging by the rate cuts that we saw in the second half of 2019, BTC may not actually like the widely expected cuts in September. I think it's possible that BTC's real move higher isn't going to come until it's very clear in the data that the United States is in a recession and the central bank liquidity hose gets turned back on to a much larger degree. BITX is not something that, I think, makes sense even as a trade at this point in time. I think BTC bulls who want leveraged ETFs like BITX need a clearer indication of short-term direction than what we currently have. If you like BTC, just hold BTC.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4717539-bitx-rate-cuts-could-disappoint-btc-bulls?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32929548.jpeg

The lending protocol, founded by Rune Christensen in 2014, will now be known as ‘Sky’, a shift aimed at appealing to a wider user base. MakerDAO Reinvents Itself As ‘Sky’ MakerDAO was one of the earliest applications in the DeFi space, allowing users to trade, lend, and borrow digital assets directly without traditional financial intermediaries. As Bloomberg reports, the platform’s success in the early days of crypto earned it a loyal following among the industry’s most seasoned participants, the so-called “OGs” or “original gangsters.” Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Price Performance 5 Days Post-Durov Arrest: What’s Next? However, like many DeFi projects, MakerDAO has faced challenges in recent years, with its total value locked (TVL) peaking at $20 billion in 2021 before declining in the wake of the broader crypto market downturn. In addition, the market capitalization of its DAI stablecoin, a key platform component, dropped from its highs of around $10 billion earlier this year. Christensen acknowledged that while MakerDAO had found “solid footing” within the core crypto community, the real challenge was “how to become more appealing and available to the mass market.” This realization has led to the decision to rebrand the platform as Sky. New Reward-Bearing Tokens According to Bloomberg, Sky will launch two new tokens on September 18 as part of the rebranding effort. Existing holders of MakerDAO’s MKR and DAI tokens can upgrade to the new upcoming USDS and SKY tokens, which will offer reward-based incentives for simply holding the assets within the Sky ecosystem. The new Sky.money app, also set to debut on September 18th, will be the primary platform for accessing these new tokens and the associated rewards. Christensen emphasized that the existing MKR and DAI tokens will remain in circulation, allowing users to continue using them if they prefer, as the new tokens are primarily targeted at attracting new users to the platform. Related Reading: Dogecoin Set For A Drop: Bearish Forces Eye $0.0914 Target The rebranding initiative is part of MakerDAO’s Endgame Plan, a roadmap ratified in 2022 that aims to increase the protocol’s resilience and drive accelerated growth. Christensen expressed the hope that the Sky rebrand will help DeFi “stop feeling like crypto and start feeling like finance got a lot better,” emphasizing the focus on highlighting the benefits and ease of use over the “constraints that have historically deterred mainstream adoption.” At the time of writing, MKR is trading at $2,123 following the news of the protocol’s rebranding, continuing a 10% surge in the past week. This outperforms the largest cryptocurrencies on the market, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which recorded losses in the same period.

The two common methods being used are pig butchering and deepfake technology.  Australians lost cryptocurrency worth Australian dollar 180 million ($122 million) to investment scams in just 12 months, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) warned the public in an announcement on Wednesday, adding ""urging all to be extra aware of the proliferation and sophistication of scams.""  Data collected by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) shows that Aussies lost A$382 million ($259 million) to investment scams in the 2023-24 financial year, of which 47% involved cryptocurrency.  The Australian Federal Police (AFP) said the victims now were more likely to be under the age of 50 years. In fact, 60% of the scam reports made to police came from the under 50 years age group.  Earlier this month, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said it closed down 615 cryptocurrency investment scams in the first year of a program to tackle fake investment websites and that Australians lost A$1.3 billion ($870 million) to investment scams last year.  AFP Assistant Commissioner Richard Chin said the data revealed that it was a misnomer that only older people were victims of scams.  “Scammers often use pressure tactics and different methodologies to lure victims into making poor investment decisions, with two common methods being pig butchering and using deepfake technology.”  Read More: Australian Securities Regulator Nabbed More Than 600 Crypto Investment Scams in a Year",NEGATIVE,없음,OTHER,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/28/australians-lost-122m-worth-of-crypto-to-scams-in-the-last-12-months-police,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d14414b88fb29112bf7204d1d7c33be73530a02d-1414x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32924715,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638133,1724828457,"RENDER Soars 30% In A Week, Here’s Why Experts Forecast A Massive Pump","The Render Network saw a remarkable performance last month after the finalization of its token rebrand. Its bullish rally was halted in August due to the market retraces, which made the cryptocurrency’s price tumble below the $4 mark. However, its most recent performance skyrocketed the price by over 33% in the past week. Some analysts believe there is a catalyst that could drive the price toward a massive pump in the coming days. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Ripe For Price Discovery, Analyst Eyes $600 Target RENDER Skyrockets 30% In 7 Days Following its rebrand, AI token RENDER saw a massive 140% increase in daily trading volume. Its price surged nearly 20% toward the $7 resistance level, considered a “great buying opportunity” for some investors and analysts. Nonetheless, the crypto market downturns hindered the token’s performance, making it plunge over 27% at the beginning of the month. Throughout the following weeks, RENDER moved sideways between the $4.3-$5 price range but started to gain momentum in the last seven days. The cryptocurrency registered a remarkable price action, surging 33% last week. RENDER’s pump propelled its price above the $5 range, which resulted in the retest and breakout of the descending upper trendline of its multi-month downtrend. The bullish momentum continued as the token retested and successfully reclaimed the $6 resistance level. As a result, the token saw a 50% price increase over the weekend, trading between the $6-6.5 price range since its jump. Despite this, the token registers a mild 2.8% decrease in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $5.95, seemingly fueled by the latest market retrace. NVIDIA’s Report: The Catalyst For A Massive Rally? Several market watchers predicted the token might see a massive pump in the coming days. RENDER has pumped, alongside most of the AI token sector, ahead of NVIDIA’s Q2 earnings report, noted some analysts. In the past week, cryptocurrencies like FET, AGIX, and OCEAN have seen a 46.2%, 53.9%, and 46.3% surge, respectively. Trader and investor Crypto Rand urged investors to “keep a close eye on the $NVDA results” as they could be the “catalyst” for a massive rally. He also suggested that RENDER was “consolidating nicely after the breakout.” Similarly, NoBSCrypto podcast’s host, Kyren, considers that investors should be bullish about the upcoming report. The NVIDIA Q2 earnings report is scheduled for Wednesday, August 28, and could be “the PERFECT catalyst” for Render’s breakout above the $6.5 level. Related Reading: FET Explodes 60% After New Project Announcement – Details Kyren highlighted that the token has been in a multi-month falling wedge pattern, losing over 55% of its all-time high (ATH) price. Per the post, RENDER could benefit from its “close connections to NVIDIA,” which could likely show “some more correlation just like before.” A positive impact from the report could propel the cryptocurrency to a $10 target before moving toward new heights. However, other market watchers believe a retrace to the $5.2 range could come before the bullish rally.

42390531,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2e4L,1724828087,"Toncoin Trims Losses, Beats Bitcoin and Ether, as TON Blockchain Comes Back Online","TON performed better than most of the market as the protocol restarted its blockchain.  Most major tokens were in the red, including AI tokens which had been riding high on anticipation of strong Nvidia earnings.  Toncoin {{TON}} has trimmed some of its losses as the blockchain restarted after a nearly five-hour downtime.  Though the downtime was partially blamed on the popularity of the DOGS airdrop, part of the Ton Foundation's way to raise awareness of what it believes is the unjust arrest of Pavel Durov, it wasn't a 'dog day afternoon' for the protocol's native token.  TON trimmed some of its losses throughout the east Asia trading day and is now only less than 1% according to CoinDesk Indices data. In comparison, the CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the largest and most liquid digital assets, is down over 6.5%. The CD20 is down as a bitcoin {{BTC}}-led market slide caused over $300 million in crypto futures liquidations, the highest since August 5.  BTC dropped 6%, with ether {{ETH}}, Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA and dogecoin {{DOGE}} falling over 5%. Xrp {{XRP}} showed relative strength with a 3.4% decline, while Tron's TRX was the best performer among majors with a 2% drop.  Ether futures racked up the highest liquidations at $102 million, followed by bitcoin at $96 million and a collection of smaller alternative tokens at $40 million.  The sudden liquidations likely contributed to a long squeeze that exacerbated losses. A long squeeze occurs when traders betting on higher prices feel the need to or are forced to sell into a falling market to cut their losses - thereby creating a cycle.  As such, CoinGlass data shows open interest on bitcoin futures is down to $31 billion from Monday's $34 billion as the asset's prices dropped - indicating waning sentiment among traders. Open interest refers to the number of unsettled futures and show whether new money is entering or exiting the market.  The dump came as U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw over $127 million in net outflows on Tuesday, breaking an eight-day streak of inflows. Outflows on ether ETFs continued into their ninth-straight day with over $3.45 million leaving the products.  ""BTC ETFs saw a very large $127 million in outflows as traders appeared to take profit after the Jackson Hole rally, while ETH continued its poor momentum with the 9th consecutive day of outflows as the Ethereum mainnet remains caught in a bit of an identity crisis,"" Augustine Fan, head of insights, at on-chain financial products provider SOFA said in a Telegram message.  ""Short-dated volatility was bid, with traders scrambling to buy downside protection (puts), as underlying momentum remains poor from the supply overhang and lack of on-chain catalysts in the near term,"" she continued.  AI tokens are also in the red, even though the prospect of Nvidia producing blockbuster earnings made some investors move into AI tokens.  NEAR is down 10%, according to CoinDesk Indices data, while ICP is down 6.5%, FET is down 11.8%, and Bittensor's TAO is in the red 11.3%, while RENDER (RNDR) dropped 9.5%.  ""Sentiment around AI has definitely shifted, as seen in the performance of AI tokens and NVIDIA. After a pullback and recovery, NVIDIA still holds significant influence, especially with its upcoming earnings report,"" Fairlead Strategies founder and Managing Partner Katie Stockton said on a recent interview on CoinDesk TV.  ""This could either push the market higher before a potential September correction or start that correction. We expect NVIDIA and the mega caps to enter a more range-bound environment amid increased volatility, regardless of AI exposure,"" she continued.

DOGE is down over 10% and struggling to start a recovery wave. DOGE price started a fresh decline and traded below $0.100. The price is trading below the $0.1050 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1025 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a recovery wave if it clears the $0.100 and $0.1025 levels. Dogecoin Price Faces Hurdles In the past few sessions, Dogecoin price saw a fresh decline below the $0.1050 level like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price traded below the $0.100 level to enter a short-term bearish zone. There was a spike below the $0.0980 level. A low was formed at $0.0962 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a minor increase above the $0.0988 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1064 swing high to the $0.0962 low. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1050 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1012 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1025 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1025 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1064 swing high to the $0.0962 low. A close above the $0.1025 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1088 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1120 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1250. More Downsides In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1025 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.0962 level. The next major support is near the $0.095 level. The main support sits at $0.0920. If there is a downside break below the $0.0920 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.0880 level or even $0.0850 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

The price reversed and now consolidates near the $0.570 level. XRP price started another decline after it failed to clear the $0.60 resistance. The price is now trading below $0.600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a short-term rising channel with support at $0.590 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could attempt a recovery wave if it clears the $0.5770 resistance zone. XRP Price Drops Again XRP price failed to gain pace for a move above the $0.60 level. It formed a high at $0.60 and started another decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.5850 and $0.580 levels. There was a break below a short-term rising channel with support at $0.590 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even spiked below the $0.5550 support level. A low was formed at $0.5538 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.5640 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.60 swing high to the $0.5538 low. The price is still trading below $0.600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5770 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.60 swing high to the $0.5538 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.5885 level. The next key resistance could be $0.60. A clear move above the $0.60 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6050 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.6160 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6250 resistance or even $0.6320 in the near term. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5770 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.560 level. The next major support is at $0.5550. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5550 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5320 support in the near term. The next major support sits at $0.520.

In a recent social media post, Davis outlined compelling reasons underpinning his bullish outlook for the crypto market. Looming Catalysts Set To Ignite Crypto Market One key catalyst highlighted by Davis is the anticipated potential for rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) within the next three weeks. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium hint at a dovish monetary policy stance, which could fuel a surge in risk assets like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Is $10,000 Possible For XRP? Crypto Pundit Shares Bold Predictions In addition, the specter of the upcoming US election, just 71 days away, looms large as a pivotal juncture for the industry. With former President Trump’s vocal support for cryptocurrencies, his potential return to the White House could usher in a new era of crypto-friendly policies. Trump has already promised to be the first “crypto president,” which could mean big changes in the leadership of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a more permissive regulatory environment for the industry, which under the Biden administration has been characterized by lawsuits and regulation by enforcement. Trump’s advocacy for digital assets, including a proposal to create a Bitcoin reserve to offset the $35 trillion national debt and the firing of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler on day one, could further boost confidence in the market, leading to further price appreciation, as analysts expect. The release of Changpeng Zhao (CZ), former CEO of the world’s largest exchange Binance, from legal entanglements on September 29, could also mark a turning point for the industry, according to the expert, offering a fresh catalyst for the market. FTX Payout, China Unban, And Geopolitical Shifts Further bolstering the bullish outlook is the anticipated $16 billion payout from the collapsed FTX exchange. As these funds are distributed to affected users, a significant portion of the capital could flow back into the crypto market, fueling a surge in demand for the leading digital assets. Lastly, rumors of China potentially unbanning crypto and Russia’s move towards embracing international crypto payments are additional factors that could contribute to the market’s momentum in the coming months. According to Davis’ analysis, reopening the Chinese market and Russia’s pro-crypto stance are both incredibly bullish developments. This could potentially unlock massive new sources of capital and demand for cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Price Performance 5 Days Post-Durov Arrest: What’s Next? Ultimately, these developments are seen as potential catalysts for the market in the next 3 months, which could contribute to further price appreciation for the largest cryptocurrencies. It remains to be seen if all eight can be achieved, but if not, the vast majority of them could significantly impact virtual asset space. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $61,830, down 3% in the 24-hour time frame, after hitting a one-month high of $65,000 on Sunday.

ETH could start another increase if it stays above the $2,400 support zone. Ethereum started a major decline below the $2,650 and $2,550 levels. The price is trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,575 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if it stays above the $2,400 level. Ethereum Price Dives 10% Ethereum price failed to recover and extended its decline below the $2,650 level.

According to Mags, a well-known crypto analyst, Bitcoin may follow a familiar pattern observed in previous cycles, where the cryptocurrency reaches its peak several months after the halving event. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To ‘Chop’ Around This Range Until Q4, Analysts Say Peak Will Be 2025, But What Price Target? In a recent post on X, Mags highlighted the notable gains Bitcoin experienced in the aftermath of previous halvings, suggesting that if history repeats itself, Bitcoin could top out between June and October 2025, approximately 400-550 days from now. Mags noted that in the 2013 cycle, Bitcoin surged by more than 9,500%, peaking 406 days after the halving. The 2017 cycle also saw a 4,100% increase, with Bitcoin topping out 511 days post-halving. Additionally. in 2021, Bitcoin’s gains were more modest, with a 636% increase, peaking 546 days after the halving. Currently, Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase following its recent halving, and Mags speculates that even if the growth in this cycle is just half of what was seen in previous cycles, it could still result in a 300% increase from current levels, pushing Bitcoin’s price to around $200,000. #Bitcoin – When Will Bitcoin Top Out?

Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin’s price has declined by 2.1%, bringing it down to a current trading price of $61,911 at the time of writing. This decline is reflected in Bitcoin’s market capitalization, which has seen approximately $27 billion flow out over the same period. Interestingly, despite the price drop, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has increased significantly, rising from $24 billion yesterday to over $28 billion today. In addition to these market movements, there has been notable activity in Bitcoin’s exchange netflows. A recent report from a CryptoQuant analyst highlighted several instances of large negative netflows, where significant amounts of Bitcoin were withdrawn from exchanges. The report pointed to three dates: July 5th, July 16th, and August 27th, where 60,000 BTC, 50,000 BTC, and 45,000 BTC, respectively, were withdrawn from exchanges. Related Reading: Data Shows Sellers Have Returned To Bitcoin: Is A Major Price Drop On The Horizon? It is worth noting that large negative netflows like these are generally seen as a bullish indicator, as they suggest that investors might be moving their Bitcoin off exchanges to hold for the long term, potentially reducing selling pressure in the market.

32918414,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638170,1724814018,Cardano (ADA) Q2 Digest: Major Double-Digit Decrease Across Four Vital Metrics,"According to a recent report by data intelligence firm Messari, Cardano and its native token, ADA, experienced a notable decline in the second quarter (Q2) of 2024, reflecting the broader downturn affecting the cryptocurrency market. Key performance indicators also showed significant decreases in various metrics. Price Plunge, Market Cap Dips To $14 Billion According to the report, ADA’s price plummeted 39.7% to $0.39, while its market capitalization fell by 39.4% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to $14 billion. Messari noted that this decline was influenced by a slight increase in circulating supply, which accounted for the minor discrepancy in market cap figures. Consequently, ADA’s market cap ranking dropped from 9th to 10th place. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Price Performance 5 Days Post-Durov Arrest: What’s Next? Transaction fees on the Cardano network, which are essential for processing transactions and covering storage costs, also suffered. Revenue in USD decreased by 44.3% QoQ to $0.74 million, while revenue measured in ADA fell by 28.0% to 1.60 million. The platform’s average daily transactions also decreased by 27.5% QoQ to approximately 51,400, and the number of daily active addresses (DAAs) fell by 33.2% to 31,800. Additionally, the average transaction fee in USD dropped 23.1%, from $0.21 to $0.16. However, the average fee in ADA saw only a marginal decline of 0.6%, remaining at 0.34. Treasury Balance Grows Despite these setbacks, the ratio of transactions to active addresses increased by 8.4% QoQ to 1.62, suggesting a rise in “power users” engaging more frequently with the platform. In terms of staking metrics, total ADA staked and the staking rate increased slightly, although the total value of staked ADA in USD decreased significantly by 39.6% to $8.9 billion, primarily due to the falling price of ADA. Cardano’s treasury balance, measured in ADA, rose 5.8% QoQ to 1.57 billion, although its dollar value decreased by 36.7% to $604.7 million. Currently, 20% of transaction fees are allocated to the treasury. Decentralized application (DApp) activity on Cardano also saw declines, with average daily DApp transactions falling 35.7% QoQ to 34,300 and average daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volume in USD decreasing by 42.5% to $4.2 million. Cardano TVL Drop Amid Market Downturn Total value locked (TVL) on Cardano dropped 41.2% QoQ to $219 million, following a peak of $506 million in March 2024, driven by a broader crypto market downturn rather than Cardano-specific factors. Moreover, for the first time since the introduction of Cardano’s stablecoins in late 2022, the stablecoin market cap on the platform decreased by 12.4% QoQ to $19.6 million. Average daily non-fungible token (NFT) sales also took a hit, plummeting 57.4% QoQ to under 730 transactions. Related Reading: Dogecoin Set For A Drop: Bearish Forces Eye $0.0914 Target Despite these challenges, the report highlights ongoing developments within Cardano’s ecosystem. The emergence of new stablecoins like USDM and MyUSD saw their market caps rise dramatically, indicating a shift in the landscape. Additionally, upcoming upgrades, such as the Chang Hard Fork, promise to increase Cardano’s governance capabilities, moving the network closer to achieving its long-term goals of self-sustainability and participatory decision-making. At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.34, down 0.7% for the 24-hour period.

32916868,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638035,1724810455,Litecoin Sees Sudden Exodus Of Retail Investors: Why This Can Be Bullish,"On-chain data shows Litecoin has recently seen a sudden exit of small hands, which can favor LTC’s price. Small Litecoin Investors Have Been Displaying FUD Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment discussed the latest shift in Litecoin’s userbase. A couple of relevant indicators are relevant here: Total Amount of Holders and Supply Distribution. Related Reading: Solana, Ethereum Attract Traders Amid Bitcoin Open Interest Plunge The first of these, the Total Amount of Holders, measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses on the LTC network carrying some non-zero balance. When this metric’s value goes up, new addresses with balance are popping up on the blockchain. This indicates that adoption is taking place, which can naturally be bullish for the asset. On the other hand, the indicator’s value decreasing suggests some investors have decided to clear out their wallets, perhaps in an attempt to exit from the cryptocurrency completely. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Litecoin Total Amount of Holders over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Litecoin Total Amount of Holders has registered a sharp drop recently, a potential sign that many investors have decided to leave the asset. While the decrease shows a departure from the network, the Total Amount of Holders contains no information about which type of investors are selling here. This is where the second indicator comes in: the Supply Distribution. This metric tells us about the total number of addresses currently belonging to a particular wallet group. In the chart, Santiment has attached the Supply Distribution data specifically for the investors with their address balance in the 0.1 to 1 LTC range. This is a small amount, so the only holders who qualify for this group would be the smallest of the hands: retail. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Litecoin addresses falling within this range have recently seen their number go through a rapid decline. More specifically, around 45,200 retail addresses have suddenly cleared themselves out during this plunge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $64,000, But This Pattern Could Mean Bull Run Isn’t Safe Given this trend, it would appear that a good chunk of the decrease in the Total Amount of Holders has come from these small investors. While selling itself can be bearish, the fact that the retail holders are capitulating here may not be so bad. As the analytics firm explains, “Small fish impatiently ‘jumping ship’ is often a turnaround sign for an asset to begin turning bullish once again.” Thus, whether this market FUD would lead to a rebound for Litecoin remains to be seen. LTC Price At the time of writing, Litecoin is floating around $62, down more than 4% over the last seven days.

42390543,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2f3t,1724810421,TON Resumes Block Production After Near Six Hour Outage,"The TON blockchain stopped producing blocks in the morning on Wednesday.  The network resumed producing blocks in the early afternoon Hong Kong time after a nearly six-hour outage.  This downtime might have been a result of a new memecoin called DOGS crashing the network.  Toncoin {{TON}}, the native token of the TON blockchain, has resumed producing new blocks after a nearly six-hour outage caused by a surge in network traffic.  A blockchain not producing blocks for an extended period of time is concerning because it disrupts network stability, potentially leading to security risks and transaction delays. These crashes are uncommon with blockchains, but do occur during times of high network activity.  In an earlier post on X, the official TON blockchain account had written that the ""issue is occurring due to the abnormal load currently on TON.""  Read More: Telegram-Linked TON Blockchain Suffers Second Outage  ""Several validators are unable to clean the database of old transactions, which has led to losing the consensus,"" the team explained.  For TON, a recent airdrop of the DOGS memecoin might have been the culprit as the popularity of the token caused a surge in transactions, and some observers pointed out that the network struggled to catch up to meet demand with its transactions per seconds (TPS) coming well under what was expected.  Solana experienced something similar in February when the chain failed to produce new blocks for over 5 hours, leading to significant sell pressure on its native token {{SOL}}.  Bybit announced that as a result of TON's network halting block production it was temporarily suspending withdrawals and deposits citing network instability, according to a post by Wu Blockchain.  Recently the CEO of Telegram, Pavel Durov, was arrested in France which caused the price of TON to plunge. Telegram and TON are separate entities even though one is often used with the other.  Before the blockchain froze, TON's price had bucked a broader market trend, trading up over the past 24 hours while other major cryptocurrencies fell 4% or more.

32915329,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638078,1724806807,Bitcoin’s August Candle Hints at Major Reversal—Are Bulls About to Take Over?,"As August draws to a close, Bitcoin price action has caught the attention of market analysts who believe the current monthly candle could be one of the most significant in the cryptocurrency’s history. The end-of-month price movement has sparked discussions about a potential trend reversal, particularly among those closely following technical analysis. However, while some analysts are optimistic, others urge caution, reminding traders that the month is not over, and external factors could still influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin And NASDAQ Show Tight Correlation: What Does This Mean For BTC? August Candle Shows Dragonfly Doji One of the most intriguing aspects of the current Bitcoin price chart is the formation of a potential “dragonfly doji” candlestick on the monthly time frame. In a recent post on X, an analyst from HODL15Capital referred to this candle as “arguably the most interesting monthly candle in Bitcoin’s history.” Notably, the dragonfly doji is a Japanese candlestick pattern that typically indicates a potential reversal in price direction. It forms when the open, high, and close prices are nearly the same, but the low price is significantly lower, creating a long lower shadow. This pattern often suggests that sellers were in control during the early part of the month, but buyers pushed the price back up by the close, signaling strong bullish momentum. Bitcoin Bulls About To Take Over? The potential dragonfly doji on Bitcoin’s monthly chart has sparked optimism among some traders and analysts who believe it could indicate a strong reversal in Bitcoin’s price trend. Javon Marks, a well-known crypto analyst on X, commented on the significance of this monthly candle. He noted that if Bitcoin closes the month with a dragonfly doji, it would represent the largest seller rejection (the strongest bull presence) since March 2020. Marks further pointed out that a similar pattern in 2020 preceded one of Bitcoin’s most significant bullish movements during the previous bull cycle, suggesting that history could repeat itself. However, while forming a dragonfly doji is often seen as a bullish signal, it’s worth noting that it does not guarantee future price action. The pattern indicates that the market has rejected lower prices, but it doesn’t necessarily mean a sustained uptrend will follow. As some have cautioned, the month is not yet over; therefore, the candles are yet to close, and a lot can change in the 4 days of trading left.
