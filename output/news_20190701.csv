42382234,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r0uz,1562022003,Longenesis Brings South Korean Medical Records to the Blockchain,"Longenesis, a Riga, Latvia-based but Hong Kong-incorporated company, is bringing medical records to the blockchain in South Korea using Bitfury's Exonum platform.  Longenesis  , which was formed in late 2017, provides a suite of modular blockchain solutions for medical providers, supplying everything from user interfaces for patient interaction to medical recordkeeping. But its main focus has become medical-consent technologies.  With its platform, every step of the process is linked, verifiable and auditable. The patient agrees to specified care or participation in a study or a trial. They can withdraw that agreement, while the medical provider can offer to extend, modify or amend the agreement.  According to the company, it will be providing its medical-consent platform-as-a-service to Hanshin Medipia Medical Center and Infinity Care. That brings to four the number of business relationships it has in South Korea, currently the company’s primary market of focus.t  The key, said Denis Bazinov, Longenesis project manager, is the way in which the system works with pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. They can peruse the anonymous metadata to see what information might be available. They can then offer to the owner of the data—the patient—the opportunity to participate trials or studies or release their existing information to be used in the evaluation of a medicine or procedure.  Bazinov said this is very different from current normal operating procedures. In most cases, consent is handled by using paper forms, and the system for renewing, updating and altering consent is haphazard and inconsistent. Once the data is collected, it is traded in an OTC-like manner, with researchers paying for bulk deliveries of information that may not be reliable or properly collected.  “What our platform offers is a transparent chain from the patient through to the hospital,” Bazinov said. “Our desire is to make more information available to the researchers, who now face problems of quantity and quality.”  Hanshin Medipia, located in Seocho, Seoul, specializes in testing and health checkups. Infinity Care is the developer of a healthcare algorithm.  Longenesis is already active in South Korea and has two previous transactions in the market. In April, it signed an agreement with Incheon-based Gil Medical Center to develop a blockchain solution for medical-data management. The other relationship is with Korea’s Terragene.  The solution being provided by Longenesis utilizes Bitfury's Exonum, a framework for decentralized blockchain applications. According to Bitfury, the platform is highly secure, transparent and auditable, written using the Rust programing language.  Longenesis has the exclusive license for the use of Exonum in the medical field.  The company notes that the product is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant, so it meets both US and EU standards.  Insilico  was founded in 2014 and has raised a total of $14.3 million, according to Crunchbase. Bitfury, a blockchain company, has raised a total of $170 million over a number of funding rounds. Investors include Macquarie Capital. At the end of 2018, valuation was estimated at more than $1 billion.  Bitfury, which is considering an initial public offering this year, already has significant relationships with South Korean partners. Earlier this year, it established Bitcoin mining operations in Paraguay with Commons Foundation, a Seoul-based group. Korelya Capital, which is based in Paris and connected with South Korea's Naver, was an investor in an $80 million Bitfury funding round late last year.

42382227,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r0oh,1562015512,TD Ameritrade-Backed ErisX Gets Green Light to Settle Futures in Bitcoin,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has cleared the way for crypto derivatives provider ErisX to offer futures contracts with a new license approval Monday.  ErisX, which is backed by U.S. brokerage TD Ameritrade, announced that the CFTC granted it a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license, acting as a secondary approval on top of an existing designated contract market (DCM) license that the exchange already held. The approvals mean the company can now launch crypto futures products under the auspices of the U.S. regulator.  While no firm timeline was provided, ErisX's announcement said it would launch its futures contracts – which would be physically-settled, meaning customers receive real bitcoin and not the cash equivalent – ""later this year.""  In a statement, ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas said that the company is ""unique"" because it ""divided the trading and settlement functions using traditional DCM (exchange) and DCO (clearing) models.""  He added:  “This reflects the structure that institutional investors expect from other asset classes and will help drive these markets toward greater relevance and accessibility.”  ""Under the DCO order, Eris will be authorized to provide clearing services for fully-collateralized virtual currency futures. Eris’ indirect parent company, Eris Exchange, LLC, is registered with the CFTC as a designated contract market,"" a CFTC press release read.  ErisX's approval comes a week after competitor LedgerX received its own DCM license. Like ErisX, LedgerX has yet to announce a firm timeline for the launch of its bitcoin futures contracts.  Bakkt, the subsidiary of NYSE parent firm ICE, is also planning to launch its own physically-settled bitcoin futures, and is currently waiting on a trust company license from the New York Department of Financial Services.  Seed CX, another crypto derivatives provider in the U.S., hopes to offer forwards contracts in the coming months as well.  No-action relief  On top of its DCO approval, ErisX received no-action relief from the CFTC for certain aspects of its offering.  Companies apply for no-action relief when they believe their product can fit the spirit of the law, but not necessarily the letter. It is up to regulators to determine whether the applicants can fulfill that promise. When no-action letters are granted, the applicants must adhere strictly to the list of requirements laid out within.  Specifically, the CFTC Division of Clearing and Risk granted ErisX relief from aspects of Part 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations Title 17.  The letter details how ErisX's requirement that customers collateralize all transactions enable the CFTC to grant it relief from various provisions that seek to verify the clearinghouse can cover any losses.  According to the letter, ErisX now has relief from regulations that would require it to: conduct stress testing on its financial resources; maintain liquidity to fulfill its obligations during a one-day settlement cycle; require periodic financial reports from all of its clearing members; conduct individual stress testing on large traders; produce daily reports on margin payments and end-of-day positions; and detail its margin methodology.  Because ErisX does not allow for margin positions, the Division of Clearing and Risk has agreed to provide relief against these different sections of Part 39.  ErisX will also certify its futures contract market participant rules prior to launch.  In a statement, ErisX head of marketing Jessica Darmoni told CoinDesk that ""Prior to onboarding FCMs, ErisX must first certify to the CFTC that its FCM rules comply with the CEA and commission rules and provide market participants and CFTC an opportunity to review the rules.""  ""We have already begun the work in this regard and look forward to working with the CFTC on these requirements,"" she added.

Despite bitcoin’s surge in price and attention last week, most altcoins were unaffected by the market drive. Prior to the recent market exuberance directed at the largest cryptocurrency by capitalization, an “Alt-Season” – comprised of 118 cryptos that increased faster year-over-year than bitcoin – was in play.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3TzVgGyBFs  Lil Bubble’s All-Time Lows  , a parody of Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road, showcases the mindset and strategy of those playing the altcoin long game.  Bagholders retweeted the song 2,291 times and lauded it with 6,686 likes on Twitter since it was published yesterday evening, at press time.  In the music video, a spaceman wearing a “ledger on [their] neck” plays an acoustic guitar and tells of their intention to ride their alts down to all time lows, and buy until they cannot do so anymore. They reason that the alts are oversold, and therefore undervalued, and will one day increase in price. In other words, they are going to the moon. Hence the spacesuit.  The spaceman ambles through the desert as the sun sets behind them, never sharing the shot with a spaceman that walks alongside, carrying garbage bags presumably filled with altcoins such as Litecoin, Bytecoin, Zilliqa, Icon, Vechain, and Verge.  At one point the spaceman sits and reflects, perhaps wondering how they ended up in such a desolate place. “FOMO buy the pump, Panic sell the dump,” is the rejoinder.  However, this could not be the adventure’s case, as they know they haven't lost so long as they have not sold. They check their phone while holding a stack of hundred dollar bills, looking instead to buy more. The spaceman sayeth:    Buying all these sh*tcoins      You can keep your bitcoin    I am broke as hell    But I will never sell    In a moment of pure will the spaceman replies to himself, “I’ll be holding bags ‘cause I’m never missing my chance.”  The account that hosts the song did not respond to a request for comment.

His $28 million acquisition of the Kirkwood Bank of Nevada “is a small but critical step in helping the nascent company achieve its wildly ambitious goals,” reported The Nevada Independent. In addition to financing his own projects, Berns hopes Kirkwood Bank of Nevada will become a leading bank for the blockchain industry.  “It’s to create an environment where the blockchain ecosystem, the legitimate businesses out there who are trying to build projects that are going to empower the individual and better the world… have a bank that understands what they’re doing and isn’t fearful,” he said.  “Banks are hesitant, because if this takes off, you don’t need banks anymore. They become obsolete,” Berns said.  Berns purchased the bank through a separate holding company to mitigate the reporting and ownership responsibilities. Additionally, he said he planned to decentralize his companies in the future, turning power over to users of the system.  “I don’t think the regulators would have ever been comfortable with that,” he said, adding he may attempt limited integration of Blockchains with the bank to create a sandbox to test his financial technology and blockchain ideas.  “I needed a playground,” he said. “I needed a place to do proof-of-concept with regulators to show that loans can be done in such a way that if I have $1,000, I could invest 10 cents in 10,000 loans and, it would all be done on the blockchain and micro payments would be made, and there’s no funny business.”  Berns’ negotiation with Kirkwood began in February 2018, after he spent a year searching for a banking partner. He paid $25 million for the entity, and invested an additional $3 million.  According to the FDIC the bank has more than $86.6 million in assets and has had a 9.14 percent return on equity in 2019. It has never changed ownership since its founding in 2008.  Bank President John Dru said were no immediate planned changes for banking operations except for the name and a branch opening in Northern Nevada. It is unconfirmed what the bank's new name will be.  “I know for sure that the customers won’t see any changes,” Dru said. “All executive management is staying on board. The directors, there’s no change there, they’re all going to stay on. And even the account numbers won’t change.”  Berns also said he plans to buy or create a 3D printing company to print a portion of his blockchain city. He’s considering using an undervalued building material – hemp – during the process and may cultivate the resource on 67,000 acres of land owned by Blockchains.  “It’s environmentally friendly, it sucks carbon out of the air, it rehabilitates soil and it’s all around an amazing product,” Berns said. “And we had planned to do it on a smaller scale and after hemp was legalized, we intend to go much bigger.”  Blockchains recently partnered with slock.it to further its integration within the Internet of Things.

42382226,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r0mB,1562004045,"Facebook's Inches Towards Global Regulatory Compliance, Applies for New York BitLicense","Facebook’s initiative to create an accessible, frictionless, globally-available cryptocurrency and payments network is brushing up against unprecedented regulatory hurdles, at least according to a new report from Reuters. Though the social media company is taking steps to comply with watchdogs around the world, many experts are concerned that it won't be enough.  Facebook's path forward will involve careful orchestration with central banks, financial overseers, and enforcement officers around the world. This administrative tightrope-walk may involve “literally hundreds, perhaps thousands, of licenses from hundreds of different regulators,” said Sean Park, Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Anthemis, a venture capital company that invests in the crypto industry.  So far, Calibra, a Facebook subsidiary that will develop a wallet and financial services for the Facebook ecosystem, has registered as a money services business with the U.S. Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network (FinCEN), applied for money-transfer licenses in the United States, and began the process to obtain a BitLicense from New York’s Department of Financial Services.  The company has also reportedly spoken with authorities at Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, the Bank of England, and Switzerland’s financial regulator, FINMA.  Additionally, the Russian Ministry of Finance said Libra will be treated in Russia like any other digital asset, with forthcoming regulations expected. A similar sentiment was expressed by Swiss Regulators.    Local scrutiny    Despite these steps toward compliance, Facebook ""will not get a free pass anywhere,” said Park.  Authorities in Europe, United States, and India promised a close look at the social media company's proposal, immediately after it launched. Singapore’s Central Bank said it requires more information about the project and the announcement spurred G7 members to rethink how it organizes its cryptocurrency task force.  Libra was put forward at a time when Facebook is already facing public and governmental scrutiny for its outsized influence and questionable privacy policies. Or as Barry Lynn, executive director of Open Markets Institute put it: “This is a corporation that’s got fires all over the world with regulators. It’s only going to get worse.”  While Libra is not exclusively Facebook’s project, being overseen by a consortium of corporate and non-governmental investors based in Geneva called the Libra Association, the currency itself faces existential challenges.  The Bank for International Settlements and the International Organization of Securities Commissions are expected to place deep restrictions on the global applicability of the tender. And last week Randal Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board, called for closer scrutiny of retail payments using cryptocurrencies.  “The scrutiny that we’ve seen is something that we expected and welcome,” a Facebook spokesman said. “We announced this early by design in order to have this discourse in the open and gather feedback.”  Libra plans to reinvest customer deposits in government bonds and currencies to create a reserve that will stabilize Libra’s price. A Facebook representative told Reuters that these reserves would follow the monetary policies of the source countries. He added, that Libra is not planning to acquire local banking licenses.  It is unknown the total costs of applying for the right to operate seamlessly across the world, irrespective of local laws. The company will need to arrange compliance networks, monitor for money laundering, tax evasion, and fraud, appease consumer protection watchdogs, and establish KYC protocols for every country it intends to operate in.  “I would say the risks are commensurate with the returns – potentially huge,” Pascal Bouvier, managing partner at MiddleGame Ventures, a financial technology venture capital firm, told Reuters.  Given the anti-trust roadblocks Facebook is already facing, as well as the challenges of attempting to disrupt global finance with system’s planned launch in 2020, at least one analyst is predicting Facebook hasn’t fully considered their position.  “A year is enough time to meet with regulators, figure out where the real trouble spots are and potentially scale it back to something narrower,"" Jeff Bandman, a former U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission official turned fintech regulatory consultant at Bandman Advisors, said.

At press time, bitcoin prices in South Korea are once again trading at a notable premium to Western exchanges. The spread, popularly known as the ""Kimchi Premium"" after a Korean preserved food dish, rose to $1,048 on Sunday, the highest level since Feb. 24, 2018, according to data from cryptocurrency exchanges Bithumb and Coinbase.  Bithumb is South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange while Coinbase, headquartered in San Francisco, California, is the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.  As of writing, the price differential on two exchanges is seen at $520.  Kimchi premium daily chart  As seen can be seen, the spread alternated between positive (premium) to negative (discount) in the range of +200 to -200 for nearly 15-months before rising sharply from $80 to $1,048 in the seven days to June 30.  Interestingly, the kimchi premium has spiked with bitcoin's break above $10,000. While the spread is on the rise, it is still down 90 percent from the record high of $7,484 registered on Jan. 8, 2018.  Back then, a bull frenzy had gripped South Korea with the cryptocurrency reportedly drawing demand from many demographics, including college students and housewives. After all, BTC had rallied from $6,000 to $20,000 in the preceding two months.  With Korean’s paying nearly 25 percent premium, the government decided to clamp down on speculation in January 2018. As a result, the kimchi premium was all but evaporated by the end of February 2018.  Kimchi premium in the ether market  Other markets also witnessed a rise in the Kimchi premium last week. For instance, the spread between the price of ethereum's ether (TH) token on South Korea exchanges and Western exchanges rose to $28.57 on Sunday, the highest level since May 2018. As of writing, the spread is seen at $14.40.  The kimchi premium in both bitcoin and the ethereum markets is falling back along with the correction in prices. While bitcoin is now trading at $10,500 representing a 24 percent drop from the recent high of $13,880, ether is changing hands at $286 - also down more than 20 percent from last week's high of $365.

42382238,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r0xV,1561993243,Monarch Unveils a Marketplace and Crypto Trading Platform,"Monarch, a wallet and exchange platform, launched a digital asset marketplace to supports 1,900 separate tokens.  The company also announced a partnership with financial-services provider Ambisafe to create a licensed alternative trading system which will enable investment in tokenized entities. A pre-IPO token for SpaceX, representing private shares of the aerospace company, will be offered on the ATS, according to the company.  The Monarch Marketplace consolidates a number of services including a decentralized wallet, ERC20 exchange, a portfolio tracker, and universal KYC integration on a platform that also enables financial services like credit purchases of cryptocurrency and offers 7.1 percent APR interest on crypto holdings.  Monarch President Robert Beadles hopes his company’s suite of applications will streamline the industry and help consumers cut excessive applications. He said the average cryptocurrency user needs nine applications to manage their digital assets.  “Right now, overly complex processes are preventing cryptocurrencies from going mainstream and allowing people to control their financial lives,” said Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, in a statement, who advised on the project.  The platform supports almost all available ERC20 and SLP tokens.  Additionally, consumer safety will be bolstered by reducing potential points of attack, according to Beadles. To that end, the company offers asset transfers between hot and cold wallets and allows users to maintain ownership over their private keys and seeds. The wallet feature is licensed as a broker-dealer and awaiting approval by the SEC and FINRA.  Monarch’s integration of Ambisafe’s Orderbook used to buy, sell, and hold securities on the blockchain is also pending FINRA and SEC approval. The platform will allow early investment access to private launches.  Host of Crypto Beadles on YouTube, Beadles teamed up with former Johnson & Johnson engineer Sneh Bhatt to launch Monarch’s free decentralized wallet and marketplace. The two founders provided seed funding for the project, and are currently conducting a token generation event that ends June 30.  Beadles said the ecosystem's quarter-million clients – with “a few thousand new downloads every week” – have generated a “soft cap of over $2 million” through using the platform.  “For merchants, Monarch allows companies to accept crypto with an easy-to-use plugin, opening them up to new revenue streams and user bases. For partners, Monarch offers access to Monarch users, partner development services, revenue share, and marketing exposure,"" he said.  Eric Ly, co-founder of LinkedIn, David Zimbeck, lead developer at BitBay, and Damon Nam, founder of CoinVest, also serve as advisors.

He added:  ""Nobody is going to ban it. ""  On the other hand, no cryptocurrency of any sort will ever become legal tender in Russia, Moisseev said. ""The ruble is our national currency and all operations should be conducted using it.""  Rather, cryptocurrencies will have a status similar to foreign currencies.

But it's out of the question that under the banner of a legitimate market, everything is possible.""  Although it is not the leading social media platform in Russia, Facebook has a significant presence in the world's ninth most populous country, with a 39 percent market share by one measure.  Facebook's vision for Libra – a global cryptocurrency backed by a basket of fiat currencies – has riled regulators and politicians worldwide, with the U.S. Congress set to hold hearings this month and the G7 forming a task force to study the project.  Legislation coming  Moisseev also told reporters that many businesspeople were asking about opportunities to conduct transparent initial coin offerings (ICOs) and a new law for it will be ready soon.  Earlier he told news agency RNS that a bill on digital assets, which has been stalled in the Russian parliament since last May, is likely to pass the main, second hearing in a couple of weeks.

42382232,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r0rD,1561987061,S&P 500 Gains Can Earn You Bitcoin on New Bain Capital-Backed Exchange,"Crypto investors have a new way to bet on the price of bitcoin – or on traditional assets – with the formal launch of EverMarkets Exchange (EMX)’s derivatives platform.  The Palo Alto, California-based startup was founded two years ago and opened the exchange to a restricted audience at the end of May 2019. Effective Monday, the market is now available to participants worldwide – though U.S. residents are excluded.  Co-founder Craig Austin told CoinDesk that the company wants to give customers access to a “world market” by trading derivatives tied both to crypto and traditional assets, and while it bills itself as “institutional-grade,” EMX is primarily interested in a retail market.  “We kind of over the last year and a half built one platform to let traders from around the world trade global markets collateralized in cryptocurrency,” he said. “That’s the key idea for us, to let anyone in the world outside the U.S. to send cryptocurrencies to a marketplace and get exposure to the world market, so not just cryptocurrencies but also equity markets.”  At present, EMX offers two products: a bitcoin perpetual swap contract and a U.S. 500 Equity Index perpetual swap (based on the S&P 500). Perpetual swaps are futures contracts with no expiration date; the underlying asset is never delivered, and payments are periodically exchanged between the buyer and seller. The contract type was initially designed for the crypto market by derivatives exchange BitMex.  Down the road, EMX will look at other traditional swaps, such as gold and crude oil, as well as different cryptocurrencies to build futures contracts on top of.  Notably, while EMX isn’t licensed as an exchange or financial services business by any jurisdiction, it is registered in Bermuda. Austin said, “we’re trying to offer a more regulatory-safe market” by abiding by know-your-customer and anti-money laundering guidelines.  He added:  “A lot of those markets don’t have strong KYC and AML procedures. We see the regulatory environment changing over the next 12 months and we want to be positioned that we’re trading on the platform but we’re also ready for more exchanges, more regulations.”  Soft launch  The company currently sees a few hundred traders active on its site every week, as part of the company’s initial testing phase, Austin said.  “We were testing internally for about two months now with friends and family,” he said. The company selectively invited external users shortly thereafter.  Roughly 25,000 individuals signed up to trial the platform, with the entire list being granted access a few weeks ago.  Away from blockchain  When EMX first announced its intention of building a derivatives exchange in March 2018, the company intended to utilize a blockchain-based trading platform, co-founder Jim Bai told CoinDesk at the time.  However, the company has since moved away from this model. Austin explained that, in his team’s view, the technology is not yet mature enough to support a widely accessible trading platform.  “I guess our thesis is in the next 12 months we won’t see DEXs take off for broad adoption,” he said, referring to decentralized exchanges.  As of right now, EMX’s trading platform is based on “standard, cloud-based” technology, he said.  Moving forward, the company does intend to make its trading platform compatible with different blockchains, allowing users to collateralize their trades with multiple cryptocurrencies. Austin wouldn’t commit to any specific tokens just yet, though he said “maybe a stablecoin makes the most sense.”  The fact that EMX is only a derivatives exchange means that customers won’t actually be trading crypto, he noted, adding:  “You get exposure to markets like us equities and other cryptocurrencies. You won’t actually trade the token, you just get exposure to a future or a swap.”  At any rate, EMX will only launch with its existing products in order to build up liquidity. Only once the platform sees higher transaction volumes, will it start adding its other products.  Ongoing development  The company previously raised $1 million in early-stage financing from Bain Capital Ventures and Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn. EMX is now in the middle of raising another $2 million, Austin said.  These funds will be aimed at improving the customer experience, including by building a mobile application.  “We found that half of our users are accessing us on the go,” Austin said. “No one really has a great [mobile app] yet but being on everyone’s devices is important to us.”  Also included in EMX’s roadmap is a plan to launch a spot market for crypto traders, though this is further down the road and not necessarily a priority.  Ultimately, once the exchange has raised sufficient funding, Austin said the company will try to apply for the requisite U.S. licenses to offer services in its home country.  “As a U.S. company, as U.S. people we are interested in the U.S. market but … there’s a ton of hurdles to offer to the U.S. people that we’d have to get through and it’s not even determined which hurdle we’d have to get through,” he said, concluding:  “You’ve seen Kraken and other exchanges try to navigate that so we’re going to let a couple pioneers do it first.”  EMX Co-founders Craig Austin, Jim Bai image courtesy EMX",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/01/sp-500-gains-can-earn-you-bitcoin-on-new-bain-capital-backed-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec909b16c623a958ca5d60ef7de2bc7ae4d906de-1500x915.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382225,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r0kv,1561977045,Metronome Now Lets Users Move Tokens Between Blockchains,"MET token holders now have the option to choose their blockchain, a feature that was first announced a year ago at launch but only rolled out last week.  The developers of the Metronome project announced activation of the cryptocurrency's cross-blockchain capability following successful test transfers of MET tokens from the ethereum blockchain to the ethereum classic blockchain and back.  Cross-chain hops allow holders to pick the ledger that suits their risk profiles and requirements for stability and governance.  While that may sound like an atomic swap, Jeff Garzik, principal architect, CEO and co-founder of Metronome, explained how it would work on BitcoinTalk in 2017:    Metronome is the opposite of a swap: There is no asset exchange, thus no exchange rate difference, thus no exchange rate risk or volatility risk.      If you swap BTC/ETH, then you risk BTC price changing or ETH price changing. Volatility risk + exchange rate risk.    With Metronome, the [MET] asset moves to a new blockchain, but keeps the same asset (and same asset price).    After the chainhop capability was activated, beginning with ethereum blockheight #8,036,077 on June 26, the company initiated the first non-test chainhop of MET between ethereum and ethereum classic. Once an on-chain validator votes on and approves the transaction – a process that takes up to 24 hours, as a measure to mitigate reorgs – the token will be transferable on the ETC network.  One small step for MET  Import and export algorithms, equivalent to burn and minting events, enable tokens to jump to and fro between sets of Metronome smart contacts while maintaining the original source supply. Metronome's documentation on GitHub explains:  Before emitting an Export event, the Source chain creates and stores the burn transaction, capturing all details of the burn, including the previous burn transaction. In this way, each chain maintains a list of all burn transactions that have originated from that chain, regardless of what their Destination chain will be.Also, each burn transaction hash depends on the previous burn transaction hash. By definition, the very first burn transaction on a given chain has no previous burn transaction, so uses the value of “0” for its hash.  The project employs Merkle-trees and proofs to track the events. The root hash is the first event on the tree, which will be affected by all subsequent data changes, but if an event can be traced back to the root providing an element and it will be validated.  Going forward the chain will rely on attestors, ""who are known entities on a given blockchain"" rather than validators.  A built in proof of a total supply of 10,000,000 initial supply plus the present sum of the daily minted tokens will prevent the possibility of double spend. Though the developers are still engineering ways to accompany hard forks.  Cross-chain capabilities  Garzik told CoinDesk that the insistence on the one-currency-to-one-blockchain dogma introduces unnecessary risk into a portfolio by tying digital assets to the stability, or potential instability, of the community that maintains its blockchain.  “‘Decentralization’ is an article of faith within the blockchain industry…” he wrote in a blog post, yet “one species of centralization that our industry has become comfortable with is the notion that a digital asset must be forever tied to its blockchain ledger.”  Metronome is attempting to further the tenet of blockchain decentralization by eliminating chain permanence. What's more, token portability, Garzik reasons, also bolsters the ideals if self-governance, choice, and reliability. To that end, Qtum and RSK compatability are also being built, and the organization is researching options for EOS and cardano.  The enabling of chainhopping to ETC and back comes one year and a day after Metronome’s launch – Metronome's ""1.0"" moment, which raised $12 million in an initial supply auction with a promise to build a “boxcar” that can ride on any compatible blockchain.  Autonomy was a foundational principle for the company, which boasts of ""zero founder control."" Four smart contracts oversee the governance of the system, including the allocation and distribution of new tokens, a contract to move funds between accounts, and systems that regulate supply and liquidity. The system is set up to mint 2,880 MET per day, which will now fluctuate between the ETH and ETC chains guided by smart contracts that monitor global supply and demand. Additionally, the Autonomous Converter Contract –used to purchase tokens on ethereum - will have a mirror ACC on ethereum classic.  ""All four contracts work together to form autonomous money, that can survive if one blockchain goes down,"" said Garzik, adding now ""you can choose which lilypad will govern your money.""  The function will be available on Metronome desktop wallets for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, as well as on mobile iOS and Android. The organization is also offering the components on GitHub.  The validation procedure enabling this process to mainnet began approximately 48 hours ago, when the collective deployed a “lilypad” on the ethereum classic chain that users can hop on. After sending tokens over to ETC, during the first non-test case, project representatives waited in ecstasy for the coin to become transferable. They wrote, ""...and then we'll move it back.""

42382247,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r18p,1561975240,Bitcoin Charts Hint At Price Pullback to Below $10K,"View  Bitcoin could fall below $10,000 this week as a strong sign of buyer exhaustion have emerged on the weekly chart in the form of “gravestone doji” candle.  A bear cross of short-term moving averages and weakening buy pressure on the daily chart also suggest scope for a drop.  The case for a price retreat into the four digits would weaken if bitcoin jumps above $12,450, invalidating a bearish pattern on the 4-hour chart. That would open the doors to a retest of the recent high of $13,880.      With the technical charts flashing signs of buyer exhaustion, bitcoin (BTC) risks falling to levels below $10,000 this week.  The top cryptocurrency by market value rose to a 17-month high of $13,880 last Wednesday only to end the week on Sunday (UTC time) with a 0.66 percent loss at $10,760, according to Bitstamp data.  Essentially, BTC created a candle called “gravestone doji” on the weekly chart, which comprises of tall upper shadow (marking a big gap between the open and high) and little or no lower shadow (meaning low and close are almost identical).  The narrative behind the candle is that buyers had pushed prices up to unsustainable levels during a specific period, then sellers ended up pushing prices back to the starting point.  This sort of price action, if witnessed following a stellar rally, is widely considered a sign of bullish exhaustion and an early warning of an impending price drop. That may well be the case here, as the gravestone doji formed after bitcoin reached 17-month price highs.  As a result, BTC could be quoted in four digits across cryptocurrency exchanges later this week. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $11,000 on Bitstamp, representing a 6.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  It's worth noting investors may view any pullback to levels below $10,000, as just another chance to get involved in the bull market. After all, a number of bullish price drivers are lined up over the next few months, according to Alex Kruger, a prominent technical and fundamental analyst.  BTC created a gravestone doji last week with the biggest red volume (selling volume) bar since November.  Further, the candlestick has appeared following a near 90-degree rise from levels near $4,000 seen at the beginning of April and the relative strength index (RSI) continues to report overbought conditions with an above-70 print. Therefore, the case for a price drop to $10,000 looks strong.  It is worth noting that the 5- and 10-week moving averages are still trending north, indicating a bullish setup. As a result, the averages, currently located at $9,840 and $8,757, could fuel a price bounce.  Daily and 4-hour charts  As seen on the daily chart (above left), the Chaikin money flow index has retreated sharply from 0.39 to 0.19 in the last five days – a sign of weakening buying pressure. The oscillator takes into account both the price and trading volume to gauge buying and selling pressures.  The 5- and 10-day MAs are also teasing a bearish crossover. Over on the 4-hour chart, meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has carved out a bearish lower high at $12,448.  Overall, both charts are aligned in favor of a short-term drop to levels below $10,000. The bearish case, however, would weaken if the price breaks above $12,448 with high volumes. In that case, BTC could revisit the recent high of $13,880.

42382233,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r0tj,1561968036,BIS Chief: Central Banks May Issue Digital Currencies 'Sooner Than We Think',"After issuing comments and reports heavily critical of cryptocurrencies over the last few years, Agustin Carstens, chief of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has acknowledged that central banks will likely soon need to issue their own digital currencies.  Speaking to the Financial Times on Sunday, Carstens said that BIS – which acts like a central bank for central banks – is supporting global central banks' efforts to research and develop digital currencies based on national fiat currencies.  A number of central banks are engaged in such work and ""we are working on it, supporting them,” Carstens said. Further, the arrival of such products might just around the corner if there is clear evidence of demand from the public.  According to Carstens:  “[I]t might be that it is sooner than we think that there is a market and we need to be able to provide central bank digital currencies.”  The comments come soon after Facebook's unveiling of its planned Libra cryptocurrency made headlines and shook regulators worldwide, as the prospect of a tech firm with users in the billions launching is own money potentially poses a threat to state currencies.  France's finance minister has said that Libra must not be allowed to become a sovereign currency.  Over in the U.S., Congresswoman Maxine Waters has asked Facebook to halt development of the Libra Network until hearings can be held.  BIS itself name-checked Facebook in its latest annual report, expressing fears that initiatives like Libra pose a long-term threat to central banks control of money:  “Regulators need to ensure a level playing field between big techs and banks, taking into account big techs’ wide customer base, access to information and broad-ranging business models.”  Talking to the FT, Carstens again addressed the Facebook issue.  “The issue is how will the currency be used? Will there be discovery of information, or data that can be used in credit provision and how will data privacy be protected?” he said, adding that a ""simple way"" to regulate such cryptocurrency networks is to start addressing ""immediate and very obvious"" money laundering concerns.

42382241,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r13n,1561953645,"Bitcoin, Facebook and the End of 20th Century Money","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      There is never a dull moment in the world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies.  The two earth-shattering stories of the past two weeks – the launch of the Libra project and the wild swings in the bitcoin market – might seem like unrelated topics. And, for the most part, the causal impact of the former on the latter is probably not much greater than that of another oft-noted bitcoin price correlation: the avocado chart.  However, the coincidence of these two developments does speak to how globally impactful Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention has now become.  From that wider perspective, these two developments are not at all unrelated. Indeed, they both capture elements of a massive, worldwide financial transformation, all happening at a time of growing economic uncertainty.  Bitcoin's role as 'digital gold'  Whether now or in the future, I believe the arrival of Libra, far from being a competitive threat, will be extremely supportive of bitcoin.  Not only will the looming international debate over Libra elevate the conversation around cryptocurrencies and so draw more people into the most established of them, it also represents a major step toward the kind of world in which bitcoin should thrive.  Whether or not Libra succeeds, it confirms the inescapable reality that international money movements in the digital era will be based on blockchain-like solutions that disintermediate the existing gatekeepers and challenge the bank-and-sovereign money-dominated model of the 20th century. It also underscores how we are moving into an age of digital assets.  And, just as people sought out physical assets to protect their wealth from the vulnerabilities of the analog era’s trust-dependent system – by storing value in gold, for example, or in real estate – they will now seek out similar protection in digital assets with similar properties. Bitcoin is not described as “digital gold” for nothing; it offers a level of censorship resistance and isolation from the politicization of money that the corporate-driven Libra project cannot.  I see mainstream global money movements in the next decade or so flowing through a mix of blockchain-era stable-money services that operate along a centralization-to-decentralization spectrum -- from JPMorgan’s JPM Coin and the new Swift blockchain project at one end to Libra and more open-standard crypto stablecoin projects such as CENTRE’s USDC at the other. But as those grow in usage, the demand for bitcoin as the digital asset hedge of choice will also grow.  So, regardless of whether or not there is a causal relationship, the Libra announcement offers important context for the continued, accelerating demand for bitcoin, the surge of buying that saw it rally from around $7,000 on June 10 to a peak just below $14,000 on Thursday last week.  A backdrop of global economic uncertainty  This wider transition in the world’s money paradigm adds a dynamic new variable to what may be a serious global economic downturn. As with previous periods of global economic tensions, the current dicey state of U.S.-China trade relations is directly impacting monetary conditions and policy expectations. But this time it’s happening at a time when cryptocurrencies and blockchains are looking like an alternative vehicle for people to manage the risks they face in this deteriorating environment.  The trade war between the U.S. and China has spooked businesses and investors the world over, resulting in a surge of demand for traditional safe-haven assets. A flood of demand into long-dated bonds has driven down their yields and led to an inversion in the U.S. Treasury yield curve – a market scenario that Wall Street has traditionally viewed as a harbinger of recession.  That, in turn, has stoked expectations of monetary easing by central banks, most likely led by the European Central Bank, whose President, Mario Draghi, last week signaled the strong possibility of stimulus. Recalling the trillions of dollars, euros and yen that were added to the world’s base money levels during the “quantitative easing” era that accompanied and followed the global financial crisis and European debt crisis within the past decade, investors have once again started buying inflation hedges. And this time, it’s not just the traditional version (gold, up almost 10% in June); it’s also the new one (bitcoin, up almost 40%).  Chinese capital flight  More specifically, there is talk of capital flight out of China and Hong Kong, a pattern of behavior that naturally boosts interest in bitcoin if not outright demand.  China’s balance of payments is showing a very large “errors and omissions” component, traditionally an informal measure of how much renminbi is escaping through unofficial channels to bypass the limits that Beijing imposes on its citizens’ purchases of foreign currency. Almost certainly, this is in part driven by Chinese manufacturers seeking to move their production operations offshore, to places such as Taiwan, to bypass the U.S. tariffs. (Their ability to do so is more evidence of why this is such a harmful, ham-fisted policy by the Trump administration.)  But it’s also likely coming from wealthy Chinese businesses and individuals who are simply looking to protect their funds in an uncertain environment, a group that these days includes bitcoin miners.  Meanwhile, the massive protests in Hong Kong, stoked by concerns about encroaching judicial oversight by the Chinese mainland, have also stirred talk that the territory’s business class will move funds offshore.  The bulk of that flight capital will go into dollars. But if even a small part of it, spooked by the prospects of more quantitative easing from central banks, goes into bitcoin, it can have an outsized impact on the price of the cryptocurrency. Certainly, volumes seen on the more data-reliable crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase’s, have shown surging demand.  The wider point, however, is that the new round of global economic uncertainty is occurring at the same time that cryptocurrency and blockchains are establishing themselves as key elements of the emerging financial architecture of the world.  In the financial crisis of 2008, nobody other than the small number of names on the cypherpunk mailing list to which Satoshi posted his white paper on Oct. 31 of that year had any idea that this alternative model for the global finance existed. Now cryptocurrencies and blockchain are high of mind among banks, global companies and regulators – with Libra, as I mentioned, playing no small role in elevating the technology’s profile.  I hate to say it, but maybe this time is different.  Burning dollars via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Michael J.
