42399252,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihR0,1471103006,The Emergence of Blockchains as Activity Registers,"Antony Lewis is a bitcoin and blockchain consultant, who previously served as the director of business development at bitcoin exchange itBit.  In this article, Lewis attempts to describe two very different uses for blockchain technology and why the division of these two functions is increasingly of interest to enterprise firms.  On Tuesday, 2nd August, I had the privilege of attending an event hosted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state's central bank and financial services regulator.  For 90 minutes, we heard from an all-star panel: Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset; David Gurle, CEO of Symphony; Daniel Gallancy, CEO of SolidX; and Tim Grant, head of R3's Lab and Research Centre.  One of the panelists said something that got me thinking – using blockchains for what she called 'proof of satisfaction', ie evidence of agreement or assertion that something happened to the satisfaction of the parties involved.  It seems that two types of blockchain* or distributed ledger are emerging: blockchains as digital token ledgers, and blockchains as registers where proofs of activities (transactions, bets, etc) are recorded.  1. Digital token ledgers  These ledgers record ownership and changes to ownership of digital tokens.  There are two distinct types of token:  Digital assets: The token is the asset. The classic example of this is bitcoin. You own a bitcoin, that's it – you can’t take that to anyone and claim the 'underlying' thing. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, doesn’t own a bunch of gold he promises to give you if you wave a bitcoin at him. (Neither do central banks for fiat currencies, but that’s for a different post).  A bitcoin is your asset, and there is no corresponding liability owed by someone else.  Digital claims: The digital token is a claim for something against someone else who promises to give you the actual asset upon presentation of the token. It's a debt token, or an IOU. It’s your asset, but their liability.  The classic example is user-issued tokens on Ripple, where ""gateways"" (eg banks) issue tokens representing underlying assets (eg gold) or issue them in place of existing liabilities (eg currency deposits).  These tokens can be passed around to different owners, where changes to ownership are recorded on the shared ledger, and where owners ultimately need to come back to the issuer to claim the underlying thing, rather like claiming your coat by presenting your cloakroom ticket at the theatre.  (Note: user-issued tokens on Ripple are not to be confused with Ripple’s underlying token XRP, which actually is an asset).  2. Activity registers  This second class of blockchain contains entries that feature data, usually fingerprints of data called hashes, possibly stored with some other non-sensitive metadata. The data can represent anything, but in the financial services context, they might be trading facts about transactions negotiated and agreed ""off-chain"" via another channel.  This keeps the commercially sensitive secrets off the industry-shared ledger, while leaving an indelible mark on it that can be referred to later if needed.  For example:  Two banks agree on a trade, with various trade facts (dates, price, amounts, etc). They can agree via any mechanism such as telephone, email, click and trade, or carrier pigeon.  They both record the trade details in some very standardized way (standards are important here as pedantry is key when creating and agreeing hashes).  They calculate and agree the hash of the trade facts.  The hash gets submitted onto some sort of timestamped industry blockchain, cryptographically signed or agreed by one or more parties.  Note that the hashes themselves can't be backwards-engineered into the trade fact data if they are well constructed. But in the future, either party can take their copy of the trade facts and show it to anyone interested and point to the hash on the blockchain which proves:  These are the original trade facts – or at least these trade facts existed at the timestamp time.  Whoever signed the hashes, must have also agreed to the trade facts (if there was some some sort of requirement for both parties to put a signature against the hash in the first place).  This concept can also be used to store data such as images, newspaper headlines, identity information, etc.  Which blockchain should activities be registered on?  Private blockchain supporters prefer to store proofs of activity in databases visible to only known participants, with the comfort that all writers are known entities, and censorship may be possible, if required, and it is also cheap to write on a private blockchain.  Public blockchain supporters would argue that if all you’re doing is putting hashes somewhere without giving away any trade facts, then why not use bitcoin’s blockchain as it is the most tamper-resistant and battle-tested chain, and the cost of transactions can be kept low by bundling data and committing the bundle at once – using techniques like Merkle trees.  Personally, I think the industry needs more differentiated terminology, or to at least be clear on what we are talking about. I would suggest ""distributed ledgers with asset tokens"", ""distributed ledgers with claim tokens"" and ""distributed activity registers"".  Not as sexy as ‘blockchain’, but probably more clear.  Summary  Blockchains seem to be being used for very different uses: recording ownership changes of digital tokens, and recording activity with timestamped proofs of existence of data or agreements about data.  Bitcoin  Bitcoin has a blockchain which contains:  Asset tokens (BTC) – this was the intended use  Claim tokens in the form of volored coins etc – not really the intended use  Hashes of data – not really the intended use.  Ethereum  Ethereum has a blockchain which contains:  Asset tokens (ETH or ETC depending on which ethereum!)  A multitude of 'user generated' tokens that are created and managed through smart contracts  Hashes stored in smart contracts.  Ripple  Ripple is a distributed ledger which contains:  Asset tokens (XRP) used mainly as an anti-spam mechanism to make each transaction cost a tiny amount  Claim tokens (gateway-issued tokens) whose transmission from user to user is the main purpose of Ripple  Hashes of data – not really the intended use  Private Industry Activity Registers  These may be distributed or not, but they are databases that contain:  Immutable(ish) records of hashes of private activities between participants  Usually cryptographically signed by known participants for non-repudiation.  The distributed ledgers may not include records of real final settlement of actual digital assets eg stock ownership unless the token is the asset a la bitcoin or a real central bank-issued digital currency.  In the private blockchain space, there are still privacy issues around letting your competitors know what you own.

42399261,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihco,1471099419,"Steemit Bridges Blockchain and Social Media, But How Does It Work?","When an obscure cryptocurrency with a total market cap of approximately $14m skyrockets to over $400m, people take notice.  But, when that cryptocurrency forms the backbone of a social media entity rewarding people for creating content, sometimes with thousands or tens of thousands of dollars for single posts, excitement and skepticism ensues.  Launched in March and gaining prominence in July, Steemit, a self-described ""blockchain-based social media platform"", has seen this level of notoriety in just its first few months of operation. To date, it has polarized blockchain experts while winning scores of newcomers to the technology.  The brain-child of Daniel Larimer, founder of BitShares, and Ned Scott, a former financial analyst, Steemit aims to provide a place for individuals to create content, promote the content they believe is good and comment on stories — all while earning money.  But Steemit is more than just a website for earning spare change.  It’s an actual blockchain built on a piece of technology developed by Larimer called Graphene, which allows for the deployment of application-specific blockchains.  Scott, in interview with CoinDesk, explained that the team only had the idea for Steemit back in January and, because of the Graphene framework, they were able to quickly roll the project out.  The rest, like most things in the blockchain space, is a bit difficult to explain.  The pop  For the first few months, there wasn’t much talk about Steemit.  While there were early miners and people contributing content, the real big bang didn’t come until 4th July. When the dam opened, $1.3m worth of stored-up blockchain-based currency called ""steem"" was released to those that had been participating on the platform.  Scott explained that, while all of the blog posts, comments and upvotes that had occurred on the site pre-July 4th were all on the blockchain, the rewards users had been promised for their contributions had not been distributed. The underlying idea was that the team wanted to continue testing the platform, finding bugs and fixing them prior to a rush of new people signing up.  He cautioned that, no matter how diligent the development team is, there are going to be bugs and that they wanted to ensure that Steemit was safe and secure for everyone.  Nevertheless, 4th July was a day that they had all been looking forward to.  Scott said:  ""What happened on 4th July, it was like a three-month long day that finally ended. Today, the rewards pool distributes in a continuous matter. On that first day, it was sort of this moment that had been building up.""  And with that pop, users who had been watching their balances rise were instantly rewarded.  One currency, two smart contracts  Part of the confusion with Steemit lies in the different ways that the currency is presented to users.  At the root is the currency Steem, which is the typical transferrable, fungible, freely moveable token akin to bitcoin, ethereum or any other cryptocurrency. But that same Steem can be put into two different types of smart contracts depending on the particular utility an individual wants.  The first is called Steem Power, which provides utility and leverage. Steem Power is the backbone of an account's voting-potential. In other words, the more Steem Power an individual has, the stronger their vote is on Steemit.  Scott explained that the team wanted to provide a mechanism by which individuals could take a long-term interest in the project, while allowing others to continue with their speculation. In the white paper, Steem Power is compared to long-term capital commitments, similar to what a venture capitalist might do.  While users can invest their money instantly, there is an expectation that it will take time to see a return on that investment.  In the case of Steem Power, should a user want to convert back to the base currency of Steem, it will need to occur in 104 weekly conversions.  The second smart contract is called Steem Dollars. This is a debt-like instrument that promises to distribute $1 worth of Steem to the token holder at some point in the future.  Scott explained:  ""[This is] the blockchain telling the holders of Steem Dollars that, at any point in the future, the blockchain will convert their Steem Dollars into a dollar’s worth of Steem after a seven day conversion process.""  This seven-day conversion process is meant to minimize the ability to create arbitrage attacks by market timers. If the Steem Dollars were convertible to Steem immediately, a user could take advantage of a difference in price, convert their Steem Dollars into regular Steem and earn more than the $1 worth the smart contract intended for it.  Because it is a stable debt instrument, users who hold Steem Dollars miss out on any Steem price increases. If Steem is worth $1 and this conversion took place, the individual would receive 1 Steem for every Steem Dollar they owned. If Steem rose to $2, the individual would receive 0.5 Steem for every Steem Dollar they owned.  To compensate for the locked value, Steem Dollars accrue interest. At time of story, users that hold Steem Dollars will earn 10% a year in interest, paid out in Steem Dollars.  Rewards for writing and curating  There are two methods of earning Steem on Steemit.  The first is by writing a blog post. As that blog post accrues votes, the amount of Steem that will be distributed to the writer increase.  However, every vote on the site is not worth a flat amount of money. Instead, the amount earned is based on both the number of votes an individual receives and the amount of Steem Power a voter has.  For example, if one user had 1,000 Steem Power and another had 10,000 Steem Power, it's clear that the latter has a more powerful account than the former. The effect of each of those two people voting on a piece of content is not equal; specifically, the user with 10,000 Steem Power's vote is worth more.  This has resulted in the development of a sort of whale chasing culture, whereby writers hope to convince the large Steem Power holders to give them upvotes. A vote by Scott or Larimer has been seen to increase the value of a post by hundreds of dollars, resulting in a pile-on effect where others chase the post.  To incentivize this sort of voting, there is also the curation reward paid out in the form of Steem Power. If a post does well, you earn more Steem Power than if a post doesn’t do well, thus incentivizing you to only vote for content that you believe is high quality.  Further, not every vote from the same account is equal in value. Voting on multiple pieces of content reduces the strength of each of your votes depending on how much time passes between each vote. Scott explained voting power by comparing it to certain video games.  He said:  ""It’s a lot like Diablo or something where you have mana. What happens is, if you're casting a lot of spells, your mana decreases and then it generates over time. The same is true of voting power. You have to put some thought into votes because you don’t want to waste your voting power.""  There are two reward pool distributions.  The first is approximately 12 hours after the post has been submitted. The reward, denominated in US dollars, is released to the writer divided evenly between Steem Power and Steem Dollars. Voters receive the reward entirely in Steem Power. The second reward pool distribution occurs one month later.  Delegated proof-of-stake  A blockchain without security is not one anyone would have faith in.  Steemit gains its security from a delegated proof-of-stake algorithm, first developed for Larimer's BitShares project, which is a variation of proof-of-stake. A true proof-of-stake algorithm, such as peercoin, relies on those who hold the currency to verify transactions.  The more currency held by a wider variety of people, the more secure the network is.  In a delegated proof-of-stake system, the community votes for individuals, called witnesses, to be responsible for verifying transactions.  The easiest way to think about it is proof-of-stake is true democracy similar to ancient Athens. Delegated proof-of-stake is more of a democratic republic, such as the US. By that logic, witnesses are like Congressmen, elected by the community to be responsible for securing the network.  However, the analogy ends there, because witnesses can be kicked out of their job for not doing it, something the US Congress has been immune to for some time.  Scott said:  ""It’s a paid position. We're not talking about four-year terms. We're talking about people with very specific jobs, which are to produce and verify blocks.""  In total, there are 21 witnesses responsible for creating and signing blocks of transactions each time a block is made. The first 19 are voted for, as described above. Then there is a 20th witness, which is a random witness who might not have been in the top 19. The 21st witness is a miner doing typical proof-of-work.  In the Steemit white paper, the authors write:  ""This process is designed to provide the best reliability while ensuring that everyone has the potential to participate in block production regardless of whether they are popular enough to get voted to the top.""  New, but growing  Since catapulting in value to over $400m, Steem has cooled to an approximate market-cap of $157m, but this still makes it one of the six largest cryptocurrencies on the space.  While there are certainly naysayers, the reality is that Steemit continues to see more people signing up and participating.  However, it’s not simply Steemit the social media site, but also the blockchain that has experienced tremendous growth. Scott said that entrepreneurs and developers have already created 50 different tools, such as Catch a Whale (which tracks where whales have recently voted) and SteemMarket (which lets users buy, sell and rent goods with Steem).  Ned said:  ""The people showing up to use this are going directly to the blockchain. We don't have the authority to tell them not to. In fact, we implore it. What we set out to do is build an ecosystem and that’s exactly what’s happening.""  Whether they stick around past the excitement, though, remains to be seen.  If the stories of people paying off bills, buying family members washing machines and going on vacations is any indication, Steemit might have found a niche for content creators looking for ways to generate income.  Disclosure: The author posted several articles on Steemit in conjunction with writing the report, for which he earned $2,400 in Steem.

42399262,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihaq,1471093238,Decentralization & Governance: Can Bitcoin Have the Best of Both?,"Ariel Deschapell is content manager for blockchain real estate startup Ubitquity, and a recent Henry Hazlitt fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education.  In this opinion piece, Deschapell argues that in order to solve issues around decentralized governance, the blockchain community must ask difficult questions about what kind of decentralization solutions need.  Since the earliest days of bitcoin, decentralization has been key to its value proposition. But it's also been its greatest obstacle.  Whether it's the block size debate, or the ethereum classic debacle more broadly, decentralization in public blockchain networks presents significant hurdles to what can seem like straightforward objectives. After seven years of open-source study, decentralized governance remains a little explored and unsolved enigma.  But solving it will likely mean going back to the beginning, asking what exactly we mean by 'decentralization'. Do we mean the distribution of hash power? The number of nodes? The inherent ability to fork and secede as recently demonstrated by ethereum?  The exact definition of decentralization in cryptocurrency debates depends on the context. Yet, semantics and technical terms tend to obscure the fact that, at its heart, ""decentralization"" refers to a system of voluntary cooperation between peers.  Efficiency trade-offs  Decentralization is a means to an end.  As a tool, it is not optimal for every possible use case. In fact, decentralization tends to be incredibly inefficient compared to centralized solutions. When it comes to transaction throughput, for example, bitcoin lags far behind centralized payment networks like MasterCard or Visa.  Yet, network distribution is a necessary prerequisite for preserving the consensus rules that give bitcoin its value, such as immutability and progressive reward halvings. Distribution of the network promotes extreme redundancy to safeguard against censorship and attacks that would threaten these well-defined consensus rules.  This comes at the inherent expense of efficiency in transaction throughput, power consumption and the overall pace of development.  Yet, the value of a digital network that can preserve these rules is so great that these costs are proving to be justified. As the foundation of the entire decentralized ecosystem, it becomes essential we understand and are able to maintain network distribution before we can start on the problem of governance.  A relative measure  Like hash power, network distribution is a pivotal factor when it comes to blockchain security. However, we have no definitive metric for measuring hash power distribution.  Fortunately, that doesn’t mean we’re blind when it comes to determining preferences. Network distribution itself consists of identifiable contributing factors.  These include the number of nodes that propagate transactions, the amount of mining machines, the number of operators behind both miners and nodes, the geographic distribution of it all, and the number and size of mining pools.  If we isolate any of these factors, it's trivial to determine what more and less distributed looks like.  For example, 100 independent miners spread across the world are clearly more decentralized and less vulnerable than 100 clustered in the same region. But it's when we start to consider trade-offs that it begins to get murky. When we do this, the weight of these individual factors becomes largely determined by subjective preference.  Is it more decentralized to have 20 globally spaced miners, or 200 in close geographic proximity?  More decentralized  As we can see, when all else is equal, identifying what is more 'decentralized' is easy despite the lack of a standard unit of measurement. It's when it comes to making potential development trade-offs on the protocol level that it gets difficult.  This is compounded because, while decentralization is a means to an end, there is an important fact we are missing. How much and what kind of decentralization do we actually need? What minimum amount of network distribution is required to ensure bitcoin or any cryptocurrency continues to maintain its security? The answer: nobody has any idea.  The reason for this is no one can predict the scale and method of future attacks that will be carried out on the bitcoin network. Given the right circumstances, a single Black Swan event in the form of a formidable attack could have tremendous negative impact.  If bitcoin is to become as successful as many hope, such attacks should not be out of the question.  Whether they are carried out by extremely well-positioned private parties shorting the currency, or an organized collection of state institutions determined to stamp out its popularity, entertaining wildly successful bitcoin adoption demands we take serious the possibility of coordinated attacks on the network.  For this reason, if any public blockchain hopes to become the core of a truly pervasive and global financial web, it must be prepared for the worst. This means developers should be inclined to encourage network decentralization.  Delicate balance  But this alone is no easy task. If we could determine the minimum amount of distribution needed to ensure the worst possible attacks would fail, and could ensure network changes do not push it below that threshold, then vetting development decisions would be trivial.  But we can't do either of those things. Bitcoin is a system of voluntary peers, and therein lies the difficulty.  We can't force stakeholders to run full nodes, or prevent miners from joining pools that are already a certain size. All we know is that greater decentralization is generally more secure, and the only way to encourage greater decentralization in a voluntary network is by incentivizing it.  For node distribution, this means lowering the cost of running one or increasing the value of doing so. For mining, this includes improving block propagation to negate an advantage of larger pools. Such developments would see the network become more distributed than it otherwise would be by making it easier, less costly or more advantageous to become a peer on the network.  This isn’t to say greater distribution must come at the cost of everything else.  There are in fact trade-offs that are likely worth making for less decentralization. Bitcoin's hashrate dwarfs the combined power of all the world’s supercomputers. It represents the raw computing power securing each new block of transactions on the blockchain, and it wouldn't be possible without specialized mining centers.  Most trade-offs are not so clear however.  By allowing for larger blocks, the proposal would increase throughput, but like all economic actions this comes at a cost.  Larger blocks demand more computational resources from nodes and are more difficult to propagate amongst miners. However, because non-mining full nodes lack monetary incentive, the benefits derived from doing so will remain the same after the limit increase. Because the cost of running a node rises with the size of a block, and the benefits do not, then all else being equal there must be more nodes dropping off the network than there otherwise would be.  Next challenges  This alone doesn’t tell us if such a change is worth implementing. But because the cost to the network in terms of distribution is not zero, the burden of proof rests with showing there is a beneficial and pressing need to do so.  In this particular case, this means showing that the block size limit is the limiting factor when it comes to bitcoin adoption. If it is not, then there is no pressing need to increase throughput and we can wait for solutions that do not risk impacting distribution at the base network layer.  Given the importance of network distribution and the inherent constraints in measuring and controlling it, this should be the standard criteria for vetting decisions which can sway it one way or another. Ultimately, the more distributed the network is, the more secure and certain its future.  If the prevailing ethos of modern law is ""innocent until proven guilty"", then the guiding ethos of blockchain development should be ""decentralized until proven otherwise"".  So long as network distribution can be adequately maintained, it can serve as the basis for a large and decentralized ecosystem of stakeholders and contributors who depend on a secure and reliable blockchain. The next challenge is understanding the relationships and incentives of these disparate stakeholders and determining how they can best work together to progressively improve the ecosystem without a centralized decision maker.  Early objections against bitcoin focused on the question of whether or not a deflationary currency with no sovereign backing could possibly become proper money. Yet the skepticism was misplaced. This isn't the most immediate or even the greatest challenge facing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  The much more important question pundits should be asking is can bitcoin or its successors pull off decentralized governance?  As a new phenomenon, the decentralized ecosystem of cryptocurrencies presents novel problems for stakeholders and independent thinkers alike. These challenges are undoubtedly great, but so are the potential rewards.
