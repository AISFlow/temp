42393485,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bixaIz,1685058351,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Holding Pattern Continues as Lawmakers Make Progress in Debt Limit Negotiations,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin hovered near $26.5K for much of Thursday as investors shrugged over unexpectedly strong jobs and productivity data.  Insights: Nvidia GPUs were useful in AI because they can process large amounts of data. Now, they seem key to the company's growth because they are also well-suited for artificial intelligence (AI) technology.  Prices  Bitcoin's Debt Limit Holding Pattern  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,148 +3.8 ▲ 0.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $26,504 +144.6 ▲ 0.5% Ethereum (ETH) $1,809 +7.6 ▲ 0.4% S&P 500  4,151.28 +36.0 ▲ 0.9% Gold  $1,942 −21.2 ▼ 1.1% Nikkei 225  30,801.13 +118.5 ▲ 0.4% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,148 +3.8 ▲ 0.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $26,504 +144.6 ▲ 0.5% Ethereum (ETH) $1,809 +7.6 ▲ 0.4% S&P 500 4,151.28 +36.0 ▲ 0.9% Gold $1,942 −21.2 ▼ 1.1% Nikkei 225 30,801.13 +118.5 ▲ 0.4% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Will the U.S. be able to pay its bills after June 1?  The question seemed foremost on the minds of crypto investors who continued to track negotiations about the U.S. debt ceiling. House lawmakers reported progress in the discussions, although whether they and the Biden Administration reach an agreement remains uncertain.  Bitcoin hovered between $26,400 and $26,500 for large swathes of Thursday, a little above where it spent the previous day but below the tight range it held for the previous 12 days in May. The largest crypto by market cap was recently up about 0.5%.  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was similarly range-bound, changing hands just above $1,800, up roughly 0.4%.  Other major cryptos were mixed after edging up slightly earlier in the day. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was up 0.4%.  “For now, we are stuck in a holding pattern of sorts until we see a resolution to this debt ceiling crisis,"" Dave Weisberger, the CEO and co-founder of CoinRoutes, an algorithmic-trading platform for cryptocurrencies.  Read More: DeSantis and the Growing Culture War Around Bitcoin  Crypto markets' Thursday stasis came even amid the release of unexpectedly positive weekly unemployment figures and GDP – the type of data that has regularly sent markets spiraling. The Labor Department announced that 229,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, well below the anticipated 245,000, and the U.S. economy increased 1.3%, the third consecutive quarter of growth. Those figures failed to stir equity markets, although a strong forecast by graphics-chip giant Nvidia based on the surging needs of artificial technology seemed to send tech stocks rising as the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite surged 1.7%.  Weisberger, a TradFi vet who worked for Morgan Stanley earlier in his career, sees three possible paths out of the debt ceiling crisis, each with its own outcome for crypto.  The Biden Administration halts negotiations to pursue its own actions and spending increases, which would be ""wildly bullish for bitcoin in the long run,"" Weisberger wrote.  A lengthy government shutdown ""and/or technical default"" sends interest rates spiraling and BTC drops ""in the short-term, along with other assets,"" but then rebounds. ""Bitcoin is an asset that does well when confidence in institutions is low, and such confidence in a default-like scenario would certainly drop further,"" he wrote.  Or in the most likely result, the U.S. House and administration reach an agreement and ""this period of uncertainty and volatility would come to an end,"" sending bitcoin higher, albeit only if the U.S. central bank pauses rate hikes.  Weisberger noted the recent lull in trading volumes, though he added that data suggests ""that we are in an accumulation phase, where the buyers are relatively passive.""  ""Tether-denominated trading for BTC, however, is stronger and the liquidity has grown relative to USD-denominated pairs, suggesting that both volumes and liquidity are higher overseas,"" he wrote.

The graphics-chip company’s stock price closed up 25% on Thursday.  So if the earnings were lukewarm but not spectacular, what’s driving the stock’s growth?  Artificial Intelligence.  Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are useful for AI because they can process large amounts of data in parallel, making them much faster than CPUs for the complex computations needed in machine and deep learning.  Their strength in parallel processing is the same reason why GPUs were useful for proof-of-stake mining. At one time, the price of ether, and the adoption of the ethereum blockchain dictated the price of GPUs, and, likewise, once Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake mining, GPU sales collapsed.  Nvidia was always a bit coy to disclose the amount crypto mining that contributed to the company’s revenue.  In November 2018, as crypto was dealing with a chilly winter thanks to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) bubble bursting, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang complained that a “crypto hangover” had caused Nvidia to lose $23 billion in market value.  Then, in May 2022, it paid a $5.5 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to settle the affair.  Looking at market research data from firms like Jon Peddie Research (JPR) paints a better picture of the material impact.  In August 2022, as the Merge drew closer, JPR reported overall GPU shipments decreased by 14.9% from the previous quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2022, which JPR says is usually flat, GPU shipments were down 15%. Year-over-year shipments decreased by 38%.  Around the same time, Nvidia’s Crypto Mining Chip revenue – a dedicated processor the company built to preserve the supply of GPUs for its intended market of gamers – began to decline fast and hard.  JPR said that GPUs are expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 0.19% from 2022 to 2026, not exactly the kind of numbers that drive double-digit growth in stocks.  On Nvidia’s latest earnings report, its gaming vertical (where it fits in retail GPU sales) has begun to recover.  But that’s all low-margin, old news for Nvidia now. Its eyes are set on AI. And it doesn’t have to be coy about it with investors.

12922328,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535051,1685057438,"Avalanche (AVAX) Ecosystem Poised For An Explosion, Here’s Why","The Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem is gaining increasing attention in the world of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi). Despite not being as well known as other chains, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche’s unique consensus mechanism and interoperability with other chains make it a compelling option for developers and users alike. With a promising Total Value Locked (TVL) and strong engagement from users and developers, the Avalanche ecosystem is on the cusp of significant growth and innovation. Related Reading: XRP Bears Prevail As Asset Retreats From Recent Highs Is AVAX The Next Big Thing? According to DeFi researcher Wacy, the Avalanche ecosystem is on the verge of blooming, and there are several reasons behind its recent increase in popularity. While many are focused on the new Layer 2 solutions, Wacy suggests that the potential of Avalanche should not be overlooked. One important measure of a chain’s success is Total Value Locked, and despite the token price dropping over 80%, the TVL for $AVAX has only decreased by 50%. This indicates continued interest in the chain and serves as a positive indicator of its future potential. In addition to TVL, other metrics such as daily active addresses and daily transactions show good growth, indicating strong engagement from users. The number of contracts and deployers is also a powerful indicator of interest in a project, and this metric also shows strong engagement from developers. Furthermore, Wacy notes that The Avalanche community is also growing, with increasing followers on Twitter and a high level of Twitter mentions over the past 7 days. These basic metrics may be overlooked by some, but they provide valuable insights into the potential of the Avalanche ecosystem. Avalanche Emerges As A Hidden Gem For Developers and Users According to Wacy, as the Avalanche ecosystem continues to gain attention in the world of blockchain and decentralized finance, several projects are emerging as potential main narratives that could see a significant rise during this heyday. One such project is Trader Joe, which is currently the number one decentralized exchange (DEX) on Avalanche. By creating the most capital-efficient DEX in DeFi, Trader Joe is shaping the future of decentralized finance. The JOE token allows users to earn a share of the platform’s revenue and unlocks access to exclusive rewards and features. With a current price of $0.35 and a market cap of $120M, Trader Joe is listed on Binance, OKX, and Huobi, and is poised for significant growth in the coming months. Another project that could see significant growth during the Avalanche ecosystem’s heyday is GMX. GMX is a decentralized exchange with low swap fees and zero price impact trades. While it is well known for its support of Arbitrum, GMX also supports AVAX. With a current price of $54 and a market cap of $475 million, GMX is listed on Binance, OKX, Huobi, and KuCoin, and staking GMX earns rewards, with 30% of swap and leverage trading fees converting to ETH/AVAX and distributing to GMX tokens. Staking on Arbitrum earns ETH while staking on Avalanche earns AVAX. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance Overall, these projects represent the unique potential of the Avalanche ecosystem. With its unique consensus mechanism, interoperability with other chains, and promising metrics, Avalanche is attracting significant interest from developers and users alike. As more projects like Trader Joe and GMX emerge, we can expect to see continued growth and innovation in the ecosystem, with new use cases and applications for blockchain technology. At present, AVAX is experiencing a significant drop in value across all time frames. Its current trading price is $14.09, with a slight increase of 0.1% over the last 24 hours. However, over the seven, fourteen, and thirty-day periods, AVAX has experienced a decline of 5%, 6%, and 16% respectively.

Here’s What The Roadmap Says,"Crypto exchange Coinbase announced and launched the testnet for its very own Layer 2 blockchain called Base earlier in February 2023. Since the launch, there have been speculations about the exchange launching a token for the L2, which has now been clarified in the newly released roadmap for Base. Base Roadmap Mentions No Token Following the launch of Base, crypto exchange Coinbase made it known that there were no plans to actually launch a token for the Layer 2 blockchain. Nevertheless, this did not stop the speculations, but with the release of its roadmap, the team seems to have put an abrupt halt to all rumors regarding a token. Related Reading: Elon Musk Reveals Reason Behind Dogecoin Investment, But Why Is DOGE Down? The roadmap which was published on Wednesday on the Coinbase website clearly states that “Base has no plans to issue a network token.” Instead, it will continue to operate like most other Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains, using ETH as a way to carry out transactions and pay for gas fees. As the L2 moves closer toward a mainnet launch, the team is rather focusing on builders on the chain. It is also looking toward upgrading Optimism’s Bedrock, as well as all of the reviews and audits while making sure the testate remains stable. “We’ve been building towards Mainnet Genesis, the first step of delivering a decentralized platform that scales Ethereum with fast, low-cost and secure transactions. As we prepare to upgrade from testnet to mainnet, we want to build in the open and keep the community informed of our roadmap and status,” the statement said. COIN stock trading at $56 | Source: COINUSD on TradingView.com Coinbase Will Face Fierce Competition In L2 Market While blockchain is still not as mainstream as industry participants would like, they are being developed rapidly. As Coinbase enters the L2 space, it is coming into fierce competition with other L2s that are already live on the mainnet. The likes of Optimism and Arbitrum have seen a reasonable level of success since their launch, which signals that Base could be just as successful. However, one thing the former have are tokens that are already trading across major exchanges. As such, they may continue to see the most interest from investors who are chasing gains from these tokens. Related Reading: Data Suggests Small Holders Will Drive Next Cardano (ADA) Rally Nevertheless, Base is still a highly anticipated L2 expected to launch in mainnet sometime in 2023. There is no reason to doubt Coinbase’s stance in not creating a token, but this could always change as Arbitrum operated for two years before launching a token. Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism remain the dominant L2s in the space with total value locked of $2.31 billion, $986.88 million, and $881.1 million respectively.

12920808,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=535067,1685052053,"FUD Or Fact? Multichain Team Arrested, On-Chain Data Uncovers Fantom Exposure To Wrapped Tokens","Rumors of the arrest of the Multichain team have sent shockwaves throughout the Fantom ecosystem. Despite trading volumes of $129 million, the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) have resulted in a 5x increase in daily bridging volumes. However, upon closer examination of the on-chain data, the bridging volumes do not show a significant sign of panic. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Under Bearish Strain As Selling Pressure Mounts Fantom’s Risky-Wrapped Token Exposure According to a Twitter thread by the crypto researcher DeFi Ignas, Fantom (FTM) is the most exposed to Multichain’s wrapped tokens. This suggests that Fantom is particularly vulnerable to any negative impact that may result from the rumored arrest of the Multichain team. This is because Fantom has significant exposure to Multichain’s wrapped tokens, with 35% of its total value locked (TVL) dependent on these wrappers. In addition, Multichain issues 40% of non-FTM assets, which is equivalent to a sizable $650 million. This means that if anything were to happen to Multichain, it could have a significant impact on the overall value of these assets. Furthermore, Multichain handles 81% of Fantom’s total stablecoin market capitalization. Stablecoins are digital assets that are pegged to the value of a real-world asset, such as the US dollar. They are often used as a way to hedge against market volatility. However, If anything were to happen to Multichain, it could have a significant impact on the value of these stablecoins and cause instability in the Fantom ecosystem. Fantom Investors Stay Calm Amid Multichain Arrest Rumors According to Ignas, there should have been a significant outflow of Total Value Locked from Fantom due to its reliance on Multichain. However, the data shows that the amount withdrawn was only 1% of its total TVL of $1.78 billion, which indicates that there is not much panic in the market. Furthermore, while the TVL has dropped by 9.55% in USD, adjusting for the price of FTM shows no significant outflow of capital. The clearest and only sign of panic is the Multichain Liquidity Providers (LPs) on Fantom, with a total of $33 million being withdrawn by LPs from Fantom, and only $1.7 million in deposits. However, what is most worrying is the lack of communication from the Multichain team. It has been reported that the current Multichain CEO Zhaojun hasn’t been online in a week. This has left many investors and traders in the cryptocurrency market feeling uncertain about the future of the project. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance Additionally, Multichain has reported that some of the cross-chain routes are unavailable due to force majeure and that Kava, zkSync, and Polygon zkEVM routes were temporarily suspended.

42393494,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bixanl,1685051549,"Nike OF1 NFT Sale Surpasses $1M Despite Delays, Tech Issues","Nike's .SWOOSH Web3 platform has released its first non-fungible token (NFT) sneaker collection, surpassing $1 million in sales despite persistent delays and technical issues that hindered the user experience.  The sale of the highly-anticipated Nike virtual creations began on May 15, nearly a week after their previously-announced start date of May 8. The first round of sales, called ""First Access,"" was open exclusively for select users who were airdropped ""posters"" that served as their early entry ticket. In total, Nike says there were 106,453 posters distributed to its earliest .SWOOSH community members.  The ""General Access"" sale began on May 24 – two weeks after its proposed sale date of May 10 – and aimed to offload any remaining NFTs from its total inventory of 106,453. (Disclaimer: This author collected one)  As of Thursday afternoon, over 66,000 NFTs had been sold, according to Polygonscan. Each NFT was priced at $19.82 – a tribute to the year the Air Force 1 sneaker was first released – indicating that Nike has raked in about $1.3 million from sales so far, though the sale is ongoing and now ends on June 1.  While initial numbers look promising, the launch was delayed several times due to technical and traffic issues, according to Nike, leaving excited buyers frustrated by the cumbersome process.  Meanwhile, updates from the Nike team have hinted that sales are moving slower than expected. While popular Nike physical sneaker releases often sell out in minutes, over a third of the OF1 NFTs are still available for purchase.  Chronic delays and technical glitches  When the First Access sale finally took off on May 15, the launch was bogged down by repeated delays, setting the tone for a bumpy NFT mint.  On May 7, the Twitter account for .SWOOSH tweeted that the platform needed a few more days to ""fine-tune"" its rollout and create a ""seamless"" experience.  However, when the First Access sale began, the website frequently crashed, leading to an uneven minting experience that lasted several hours. Some users expressed disappointment with the finicky experience, considering Nike's expertise in releasing limited-edition collectibles to the masses.  On May 16, Nike extended its First Access sale ""due to the ongoing tech issues,"" pushing back its General Access sale in response. Additional ""traffic issues"" led to a second delay.  On May 17, Nike said that there were still over 85,000 OF1 boxes left. By May 22, that number still hovered around 83,000, despite what appeared to be a large number of users eagerly awaiting the ability to purchase their NFTs.  The General Access sale began on May 24, though the site was again plagued with processing delays. Some users even reported being charged for OF1 NFTs despite not receiving them. In response, .SWOOSH said that it ""ran into an unforeseen error that held up the minting process"" that ""also blocked additional purchases.""  On May 25, Nike tweeted that over 55,000 OF1 boxes had been sold to over 30,000 unique buyers and hailed the sale a success. Other Nike staff praised .SWOOSH for ""managing some insane traffic.""  Nike did not immediately respond to CoinDesk for comment.  The global sneaker giant has been making steady moves to expand its Web3 strategy over the past several years, previously acquiring digital fashion startup RTFKT Studios. RTFKT has launched several successful NFTs, including its CryptoKicks collection, and has partnered with brands like Rimowa and artist Takashi Murakami on limited-edition releases.  .SWOOSH has teased the release of a .SWOOSH marketplace in the coming months and has touted plans to expand into virtual and IRL experiences, gaming, mint passes and 3D Files.",NEUTRAL,없음,TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/05/25/nike-of1-nft-sale-surpasses-1m-despite-delays-tech-issues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7d9f761db1d4c469ec89d82f8cb97385f41acfc-618x347.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393475,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bixZtL,1685049568,U.S. Presidential Candidate Ramaswamy Takes Potshot at DeSantis Bitcoin Remark,"Bitcoin has suddenly found itself at the center of campaign trash-talking and chest-thumping ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.  Biotech-entrepreneur-turned-Republican-candidate Vivek Ramaswamy told CoinDesk in an interview that he is the only candidate who understands Bitcoin deeply enough to discuss it intelligently on the presidential debate stage.  His remarks came after fellow hopeful and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Wednesday launched his own presidential campaign on Twitter – amid a myriad of technical glitches – and promised to “protect the ability to do things like Bitcoin.”  Ramaswamy says even the language DeSantis used reveals a shallow understanding of the world’s dominant cryptocurrency.  “I understand this stuff in a much more deep and rich way,” Ramaswamy told CoinDesk in an interview. “Even the way he said that, ‘Do things like bitcoin.’ When we think about the leader we want in the White House, that needs to be somebody who understands the ‘why.’”  Ramaswamy wrote the book “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam,” which DeSantis is reported to have read. Ramaswamy says DeSantis borrowed many concepts he originated, including the importance of Bitcoin and the denouncement of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).  “Since the time I wrote Woke, Inc.,” Ramaswamy explained, “DeSantis has studied it and he has adopted many of the proposals as his own, and I think that's a good thing. I'm not sure he has the same understanding of it that I do, be it central bank digital currencies or Bitcoin. But that's okay. He's saying the right things.”  CoinDesk sent an email to the DeSantis campaign asking for a response to Ramaswamy’s comments but had not received a response as of press time.  Longshot versus Trump, DeSantis  Some consider Ramaswamy a longshot in the presidential race. According to the website FiveThirtyEight, Ramaswamy is polling 3.5% among declared or presumed Republican candidates for the 2024 race, behind Donald Trump’s 54%, DeSantis’s 21% and former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence’s 5.1%.  He is certainly not the first politician to take up the cause of Bitcoin or other digital assets. Robert J. Kennedy Jr. delivered a keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2023 conference.  “I am an ardent defender and a lifelong defender of civil liberties,” Kennedy said. “And Bitcoin is both an exercise and a guarantee of those freedoms.”  But Ramaswamy – who also spoke at the same conference – might be the only pro-Bitcoin candidate who claims a sophisticated understanding of the cryptocurrency.  Conversely, former U.S. President Donald Trump once referred to Bitcoin as a “scam,” according to a story by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). It’s not clear if he will maintain that stance during his run for reelection.  Ramaswamy says he’s pro-Bitcoin because he views it as a “decentralized alternative” to the U.S dollar, augmenting the country’s financial infrastructure by holding the “existing system's feet to the fire.”  “Competition breeds strength,” said Ramaswamy. “I view it as a source of competition to the existing system.”  He says Bitcoin antagonists like U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, are “blinded by their quest for power, dominion, control and punishment.” Warren’s team didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.  “Even some more intelligent minds lose the ability to think with clarity when it comes to their natural guttural tendencies to seize power as much as possible,” Ramaswamy said. “Many of them may think they're starting with good intentions and think they're protecting people by doing so, but in fact, they end up harming the very people they purport to protect.”  He says if he became president, he would slash headcount at the Federal Reserve by 90% and that he would be open to overhauling the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), especially given what he described as its “vague enforcement discretion.”  “A lot of our existing securities regulation apparatus is outdated and broken. We can actually learn from allowing units of measurement like bitcoin to roam free of SEC regulation,” Ramaswamy said. “The administrative state in its entirety needs to be reformed.”  Ramaswamy’s Bitcoin backstory  The 37-year-old former high school valedictorian and summa cum laude Harvard biology graduate says he first came across Bitcoin while at Yale Law School.  “When I was in law school I had a full-time job as a hedge fund manager too. So I was entrenched in financial markets,” Ramaswamy explained. “Then I heard this completely parallel system under the mantra ‘code is law.’ That's when it caught my attention.”  The “code is law” principle is popular in the crypto community and considers actions triggered by computer code just and fair despite being potentially controversial. The most popular instance of this is the 2016 Ethereum DAO hack.  Ramaswamy, who has a reported net worth of around $630 million, eventually bought some bitcoin (BTC), but for the sake of “best practice” during his campaign, no longer self-manages his personal portfolio and can’t confirm if he still holds any.  During a speech at the Bitcoin 2023 conference, he claimed to be the first Republican candidate in the current election cycle to accept bitcoin donations and the first ever to do so over the Lightning Network, a Bitcoin scaling solution for cheaper and faster transactions.  “We're accepting donations via the Lightning Network,” Ramaswamy said. “I will elevate these issues that we just talked about to the center of the Republican debates in the primaries.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/25/us-presidential-candidate-ramaswamy-takes-potshot-at-desantis-bitcoin-remark,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2efd57d031b8390a098fbae91a7867bb06da3712-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Within the past 24 hours, the asset’s price experienced a slight decline, demonstrating sideways movement under the influence of bearish sentiment. On a weekly timeframe, there has been limited movement in the price of DOT. In terms of technical indicators, DOT has exhibited bearish strength, with low buying pressure. Both demand and accumulation levels have decreased based on the daily chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NUPL Finds Rejection At Long-Term Resistance Given the indecisiveness in Bitcoin’s chart, many altcoins, including DOT, have either remained constrained under immediate resistance levels or have entered consolidation phases. It is crucial for DOT to maintain a price level above its immediate support to avoid the possibility of another substantial decline in upcoming trading sessions. If selling pressure intensifies, there is a risk of the altcoin breaking below its crucial support level. The declining market capitalization of Polkadot indicates that sellers are still exerting control over the asset. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the current writing, DOT is being traded at $5.29, with Polkadot hovering near its critical support level of $5.15. Should the price fall below this level, it may further decline to $5. On the upside, a significant resistance level is observed at $5.40. If DOT bulls manage to surpass this resistance, it could potentially trigger a rally towards $5.71, indicating a 6% appreciation. Further progress could then lead the price into the $6 range. Notably, the trading volume of DOT in the last session was relatively low. This suggested that buying strength was weaker compared to selling pressure. Technical Analysis During the months of April and May, the demand for DOT remained relatively weak. Analysis shows that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained below the 40-mark, indicating that selling pressure outweighed buying pressure in the market. Additionally, DOT remained below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), further affirming the dominance of sellers in driving the price momentum. However, if DOT manages to surpass the $5.30 mark, it has the potential to climb above the 20-SMA line. This could potentially attract buyers back into the market and shift the overall sentiment in a more positive direction. As demand for DOT declined, the altcoin exhibited decreasing buy signals on its one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which represents price momentum and trend reversal, displayed declining green histograms, indicating a weak buy signal for DOT. Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands, which illustrate price volatility and fluctuations, exhibited constriction, indicating a range-bound movement.

42393490,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bixast,1685048188,Bitcoin Lingers Below $26.5 Amid Debt Ceiling Worries,"The U.S. announced unexpectedly strong unemployment and GDP data, but crypto investors had debt ceiling negotiations on their minds, Thursday.  They recently kept bitcoin lingering under $26,500, up about 0.3% but below its most recent nearly two-week-long range between this threshold and $27,500. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost some of its 2023 gains in recent weeks as investors wrestle with a mix of macroeconomic uncertainties, most prominently of late the U.S.’s ongoing debt limit stalemate that will determine whether the U.S. government can pay its bills. On Thursday, Republican House lawmakers reported progress in discussions with the White house, but whether the sides can reach agreement in time to avert a government default remains uncertain.  ""Debt ceiling concerns are definitely weighing on BTC and crypto generally,” Riyad Carey, research analyst at digital assets data provider Kaiko, wrote via Twitter to CoinDesk. “We've been fairly range-bound in the past few weeks as there have not been many crypto-specific catalysts.  Carey does not expect any dramatic price shift in bitcoin’s price in the near future, if not beyond with the next major catalyst, the BTC halving, almost a year away. “Of course, regulatory developments could shake this up,” he wrote.  Ether was recently changing hands at just over $1,812 up roughly 0.3% from Wednesday, same time. Most other major cryptos assumed faint shades of green with MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, recently rising 2%. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was up 0.46%.  Tech stocks seemed to levitate after chipmaker Nvidia said sales would rise because of the growth of artificial intelligence protocols. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component climbed 1.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Safe haven asset gold continued itsrecent decline less than a month after reaching a near record high, falling more than a percentage point to trade at $1,959.  But assets of all stripes seemed largely unmoved by Thursday’s jobs data, which showed 229,000 Americans filing unemployment benefits last week, well below the anticipated 245,000, and the U.S. economy expanding 1.3%, the third consecutive quarter of growth. Earlier this year and throughout 2022, such news might have sent digital assets cascading, but CoinDesk analyst on Thursday highlighted a shift in the good-economic-news-leads-to-lower-crypto- prices narrative.  Still, the debt limit negotiations remained at the center of many market observers’ radars. “Everything hinges on the debt ceiling right now, and until a resolution of some sort is found, I don’t expect to see Bitcoin outperform as it has since the start of the year,” Brent Xu, CEO and co-founder of Umee, a Web3 bond-market platform, wrote to CoinDesk. “If the crisis gets prolonged, it seems like BTC and other digital assets might linger or even push downward for a good while.”  Xu wrote that bitcoin and other digital assets remain in a “crypto Spring phase, so the current sideways volatility, punctuated by pullbacks after short runs, is to be expected, that this trend will continue until next year when the halving kicks in.

The tool will begin “address[ing] existing gaps within the privacy and compliance space” by providing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) services on the Lumina DEX when it goes live later this year, read the release The prototype is powered by zkApps, which enables private and compliant transactions.  “The zkp-ID solution will ensure builders can do so in a way that helps satisfy concerns of KYC and AML regulators around the globe without requiring users to share sensitive personal identifying information,” Mina Foundation COO Kurt Hemecker said.  Etonec’s partnership with decentralized exchange Lumina DEX will use zero-knowledge technology to create a sort of permissioned pool, a liquidity pool market that is compliant with AML regulations. This will hopefully allow the DeFi community to attract more institutional investors to the space and grow, Jonathan Knoll, co-Founder and head of strategy at Etonec, told CoinDesk.  The compliance tool isn’t solely designed for decentralized protocols. It also aims to serve a wide range of applications across the Web3 space, the team behind its development told CoinDesk.  “It’s broader than just DeFi,” Hemecker said. “You're gonna have a large number of use cases…where you can allow users to control their own data, privacy and to decide who and what they want to share information with.”  DeFi protocols have increasingly become a target of regulators' efforts to assert greater control over the crypto industry.

42393491,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bixaid,1685047006,CoinDesk at 10: The Ghost of Libra Lives On,"Facebook’s Libra stablecoin was going to let anyone, anywhere, transact money over the internet. A basket of fiat currencies would ensure Libra’s price stability, while a group of 28 varied companies would oversee the project.  Libra users wouldn't even need to have a Facebook account to send money, the social media giant revealed in 2019. Libra, it seemed at the time, had potential to reshape cross-border remittances and international commerce. Conceptually, it combined the promise of cryptocurrencies with the might of Facebook’s awesome social media network.  This feature is part of our ""CoinDesk Turns 10"" series looking back at seminal stories from crypto history. Libra is our choice of the most momentous story from 2019.  “There are two sets of work that we do on payments,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during a Congressional hearing in October 2019. “One is building payment systems that allow people to send money on top of the existing financial systems.”  “[Then] there’s another set of work, which is what we’re trying to do with Libra, which is trying to help rethink what a modern infrastructure for the financial system would be if you started it today rather than 50 years ago on a lot of outdated systems.”  If only any part of the project had ever come to fruition.  Also in this series: 2016 - How The DAO Hack Changed Ethereum and Crypto  Instead, legislators worldwide led a backlash against the project, forcing Facebook and its partners to shed its plans for a dividend token, the basket of assets to back the stablecoin, many of its partners and even its name in a bid to launch something, anything.  Ultimately, the remnants of the project were sold off to Silvergate Bank (which shuttered its doors earlier this year), having launched a single (now-defunct) wallet project and not much else. Facebook, the driving force behind Libra, rebranded to Meta and refocused its efforts on the metaverse, a virtual world effort (which itself is struggling). The various other payments, telecommunications and other companies that were part of the original coalition have gone back to their normal businesses, though some remain active in the crypto sector.  Though the project itself never took off, it managed to leave a few enduring legacies from its 958 days of existence: Legislative efforts worldwide have been born in reaction to Libra, and crypto in general received a massive boost in mainstream recognition. And, of course, there's the technology underpinning the project. As of press time, there's multiple projects launched by former Meta employees and using Libra (later Diem)’s technology.  What went wrong  The project may have been doomed from the start, largely due to its association with Facebook, which, at the time, was fresh off the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  Almost immediately after it was announced, lawmakers around the world were calling for hearings and investigations.  “I think Libra was met with a giant overreaction around the world,” said Dante Disparte, who was the Libra Association’s head of policy and communications in June 2019. He is now the chief strategy officer at stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial.     Libra sought permission rather than forgiveness, Disparte said, echoing comments made by both Zuckerberg and David Marcus (one of Libra’s creators) during the project’s early days.  “We’re committed to getting all of the appropriate U.S. approvals before launching the Libra payment system in any country in the world, even where those approvals might not be strictly required,” Zuckerberg told Congress in October 2019. “All of the regulators that have jurisdiction over a part of what we’re doing, we’re working with them and we’ll seek approval.”  I think Libra was met with a giant overreaction around the world  Regulators appeared loath to grant that permission. Nor were policymakers reassured by the Libra Association’s oversight of the project, seeing it as a Trojan Horse for Facebook’s ultimate control.  A number of payment tech heavyweights were founding members of the Libra Association, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Uber, Lyft, Mercado Pago, Booking Holdings, eBay, Stripe, Vodafone and Kiva.  Crypto members ranged from Coinbase and Xapo, to Anchorage Digital and Andreessen Horowitz.  “When the Libra project showed up, the personal calculus I had was it would be a project that would change the world, and if nothing else, change the arc of the conversation,” Disparte said.  Read More: David Marcus - Stablecoin Statesman (2019)  Instead, lawmakers went so far as to warn some of the payments firms participating in the Libra project that they may be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. Ultimately, companies like Visa and Mastercard and PayPal withdrew before the Libra Association was even formally instituted.  Disparte felt underprepared for the fight. “We were armed with little more than a white paper that talked about an idea,” he said.  Within months of Facebook announcing that white paper, there were three different full Congressional committee hearings focused specifically on Libra.  “Ultimately, that was a split screen moment that was replicated all over the world,” Disparte said.  Secrecy  Libra was formally announced in 2019, but rumors of its imminent launch had been circulating for six months, and Facebook’s involvement in blockchain and crypto technology had been known for well over a year.  Despite this, Facebook kept mum about what exactly it was working on, leaving reporters to speculate based on what little information was available.  Zack Seward, who was an editor at CoinDesk in 2019, flew out to Menlo Park, California, for private briefings from Facebook executives and Libra’s leaders ahead of the big reveal.  “It was super secret. Everyone was so excited about this thing. There had been these dribs and drabs of reports based on sources, but this was the official revealing of what had really been under wraps,” he told me.  Also in the ""CoinDesk Turns 10"" series – 2020: The Rise of the Meme Economy  In the heart of Silicon Valley, Seward was able to hear directly about the project with other CoinDesk editors listening in.  “They shared the technical documentation and the white paper, the grand vision for what this was going to accomplish,” he said. “At the time, we were most interested in all these big, giant corporate partners that were involved. They put up money to secure this network, and they would lend this thing legitimacy, right?”  The project was complex enough that CoinDesk ended up publishing five different stories in quick succession covering the dividend token, a hint at a digital identity project, showing how the technical issues borrowed from Bitcoin and Ethereum, exploring the white paper and the announcement itself.  The project remained shrouded in secrecy, nevertheless. In October 2019, this reporter flew to Geneva, Switzerland, to cover the formal creation of the project’s governing council, though that body did not want immediate press coverage.  Legacy  For a token that never launched, Libra still leaves a massive legacy.  Facebook’s involvement helped mainstream the idea of cryptocurrency, propelling what at the time was a relatively staid bear market into broader public awareness.  “It was June 2019, so this was in the doldrums of the last bear market prior to the mania of 2021, where crypto went mainstream. And this was kind of like the first time crypto went mainstream a little bit,” Seward said.  A lot of people were asking what Libra was, which in turn drew them to the question of what crypto was well before it became an everyday term.  CoinDesk Turns 10: What We Learned From Reporting a Decade of Crypto History  Crypto “popped onto the public’s radar in a way that it hadn’t before,” Seward said. “It was one of those first ‘Oh, wait, this Web3 thing, smart people in Silicon Valley are thinking about this. OK, we better start thinking about this, too.”  And lawmakers started talking more about crypto than they had before. Libra inspired various legislative bodies to start introducing and passing legislation addressing the crypto ecosystem, and it spurred more action from some regulators and central banks on addressing the issues Libra sought to address, Disparte said.  There is no question that the very concept of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) was mostly an abstraction pre-Libra, Disparte said. At the time, no country had launched a CBDC or was really thinking of digitizing its currency on a distributed ledger.  Now, more than 100 central banks are studying CBDCs to some extent, he said.  Legislation was also drafted that would specifically address stablecoins as its own subsector of the broader crypto ecosystem.  Disparte pointed to the European Union’s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation, which is now – after years of debate and work – close to taking effect.  “It was a body of regulation born in response to the fear of big tech, and big tech particularly, entering the movement of money,” he said. “And so in some ways, [Libra was] a project that was also a heat shield that took the brunt of the world's policy responses and regulatory responses and public hearings.”  Read more: Meta to Shutter Novi Crypto Payments Wallet in September, Ending Libra Saga",NEGATIVE,없음,ETH | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/25/coindesk-at-10-the-ghost-of-libra-lives-on,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6af4ff7687ddb09defc2e8d5ef2abf910898698-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393496,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bixb8H,1685044684,Nvidia's Blockbuster Outlook Reminds Bitcoin Miners to Give AI a Look,"Nvidia (NVDA) gave an extremely rosy financial forecast as the chipmaker benefits from surging demand for hardware to power the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution ushered in by the likes of ChatGPT. It was the talk of Wall Street on Thursday as Nvidia's stock price soared.  For bitcoin (BTC) miners, it's a reminder that they already have the expertise and data-center space to join in and run AI applications. Whether they'll dive in remains to be seen.  ""The overwhelmingly positive market reaction"" to Nvidia's news ""will incentivize more mining companies to follow suit making announcements of their own and allocating more of their power capacity to other forms of compute,"" said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies.  Vera noted the Wednesday announcement that Applied Digital (APLD) is working with data center design firm Supermicro (SMCI) on its AI cloud offering.  Applied Digital is one of a handful of miners that have had their eyes on diversifying their data center space into other areas of computing for a while, along with peers Hut 8 Mining (HUT) and Hive Blockchain (HIVE). Miners will see better margins in AI than mining, said Applied Digital CEO and Chairman Wes Cummins – at least before another bull run in the price of bitcoin.  However, the transition might not be a straight line. High-performance computing such as AI and cloud applications ""requires a different level of infrastructure build"" than bitcoin mining, Vera said. Firms will have to hire engineers to plan their sites differently and sales staff to sign up clients, he said.  ""It's not a straightforward process for a miner to repurpose their mines for AI compute – latency, compliance, cooling, environmental factors (humidity, dust) and power redundancy all need to be factored in when upgrading a site,"" said Erin Dermer, Hut 8's senior vice president of communications and culture, echoing Vera.  The cost to build a data centre in North Dakota that meets the standards of the AI industry was ten times higher than mining, said Cummins, sharing his experience.  Even though most miners are not likely to repurpose their facilities for AI, ""there are some miners who have always had a more diverse approach to their business operation, with high-performance compute or edge-compute services, in addition to bitcoin mining. With the rapid growth of AI, these companies may accelerate the development of those business lines,"" said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at Foundry Digital (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group).  Meanwhile, Nvidia’s forecast is lifting AI-linked crypto tokens, including SingularityNET (AGIX), which climbed about 13% on Thursday. Fetch.ai (FET) and Render (RNDR) are up more than 5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

But now good economic news may lead to improved cryptocurrency prices, or at least have minimal effect.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Labor Department announced that 229,000 Americans had filed for unemployment benefits last week, 4,000 higher than the prior month, but well below expectations of 245,000. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy expanded for the third consecutive quarter, as second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.3%.  Crypto markets reacted positively at first, as bitcoin and ether rose 0.44% and 0.71% on heavy volume. Prices retraced in subsequent hours, with both assets trading flat as of publication.  Traditional financial markets were mixed, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Indexes opening higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined.  Worth noting is the direction and magnitude of change following the data releases. We can gather a few points from what’s occurred over the last 12 months.  Elevated inflation remains a concern for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has viewed a robust job market as an obstacle to reducing inflation as prices rise when economies expand. Job growth is a sign of economic strength.  As a result, asset prices have often responded negatively to strong jobs data and positively to poor jobs data.  For example, in December, reduced jobless claims and economic expansion led to declines in asset values.  With interest rates now at 5.25% and inflation slowing, the market reaction to strong data may become more positively correlated, which bodes well for cryptocurrencies as the economy improves.  FOMC minutes from its meeting earlier this month indicate that U.S. central bankers expect to keep interest rates between 5%-5.25%, through January of 2024.  Central bankers did not signal whether they would tighten or relax the Fed’s current monetary hawkishness and otherwise remained cautious in their remarks, at one point noting “the possibility that the cumulative tightening of monetary policy could affect economic activity more than expected”  But bankers also said they expected a “mild recession starting later this year, followed by a moderately paced recovery”.  Bitcoin holders could find themselves with opportunities for profit if the recession followed by a rebound occurs as expected. If the relationship between crypto and macro shifts to a good-news-equals-good-news one, the expected recession will likely have a negative impact on prices, resulting in a lower acquisition price for traders.  A moderately paced recovery could present outsized returns for those who accumulate a position ahead of it.  A proxy for bitcoin’s connection to economic growth would be its correlation to copper. Price movement in “Dr. Copper” often indicates economic strength. Bitcoin’s correlation with the metal has risen from -0.63 on May 9, to 0.85 implying a strong relationship between the two.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/25/the-relationship-between-economic-news-and-crypto-prices-may-be-turning-for-the-better,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72fd0432946506168692f42c2cca936653d6b0c5-3374x5061.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393479,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bixa8j,1685038064,"Pudgy Penguins NFT Project, Once Endangered, Proves Web3 Turnaround Is Possible","Pudgy Penguins, a non-fungible token (NFT) project made up of cute chubby birds, has experienced waves of success and mishap since its debut in July 2021, including a rapid downturn in price and sentiment as doubts surrounding the founders emerged later that year.  The community of holders, known as Pengus or “the Huddle,” was upset that the founders had failed to deliver on the project’s original roadmap. Their feathers were further ruffled after accusations arose that the founders had drained funds from the treasury.  This led to some very angry birds in the Huddle, who moved to oust the founders in a community vote in January 2022. This is where most NFT stories end – the high-flying promises and hopes get grounded by bad actors and all that remains is a community united by disappointment.  But this bird tale found a different flight path: In April 2022, a Los Angeles entrepreneur and member of the Huddle himself, Luca Netz, swooped in and led the purchase of the brand for 750 ETH, or $2.5 million at the time, with a promise to build out the brand and foster better communication. A little more than a year later, new investments, real-life toys and a rebound in NFTs sales have restored the penguin NFTs’ ethos of “good vibes and positivity for everyone” and helped the penguin prices hit new heights.  The penguins’ march to success  After Luca Netz and the new team took over the project, they laid out their plans to focus on building out the project’s intellectual property (IP) and “to be the brand that leads the way in onboarding people from Web2 into Web3.” Unlike the original founders, they took steps to start putting that roadmap in place, announcing during the summer of 2022 that they would be creating toys based on the penguin NFTs and releasing a children’s book.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV, Netz said that he was “a firm believer that IP is going to be the Trojan Horse for really bringing hundreds of millions of people into crypto and into Web3.”  “For them to participate in the space, they're going to have to fall in love with a character and this character to us is Pudgy Penguins,” he said.  The mood and momentum had shifted, leading to a new all-time high sale in August and a Christmastime rally in December 2022, despite the overall crypto winter.  In May 2023, they announced a new $9 million funding round and shortly after, launched the promised toys, which reportedly sold 20,000 units in a few days and sent the floor price of the project soaring to 6.2 ETH on May 20, 2023, according to data from NFT marketplace OpenSea.  In tandem with the toys, the team unveiled Pudgy World, which connects people’s real-life toy purchases with the digital world and onboards them to Web3 in a frictionless way – the very “Trojan Horse” Netz spoke about creating. Toy buyers who register with an email address receive NFTs and a crypto wallet without even realizing it, easing the otherwise burdensome process of setting up and funding a crypto wallet.  Rounding out a strong first half of 2023, NFT lending platform Blend announced the inclusion of Pudgy Penguins onto their platform, further legitimizing its place among other popular collections like Azuki and Bored Ape Yacht Club.  The Huddle is key  While the list of NFT projects that looked like the next big thing and then flamed out is vast, there’s a much narrower group of projects that got past a dark, icy winter. So what went right for these penguins?  In Web3, the power of the community shouldn’t be underestimated. Netz and the leadership team understood they needed to earn their trust and support or they could suffer the same fate as the founders.  To that end, the team made good on their promises to provide “monthly updates for penguins who may have been fishing in a cave” on their blog and give regular updates on Twitter and Discord as well. Further, they empowered the community to create subcommunities or clans and planned real-life and virtual events to connect the community.  On the opposite end, NFT projects like More than Gamers have suffered from unclear communication and a general lack of transparency, while the Pixelmon NFT promised the ""largest and highest quality game” and delivered what even they had to admit was laughably bad art. Neither has managed to bounce back as of writing.  The Huddle is also able to share in the Pudgy Penguins’ success. Part of the DNA of the project is allowing holders to leverage their IP and profit off their penguins, whether through licensing or other deals.  Luca Netz said on a Twitter Spaces with Blur Founder Pacman on May 25 that the toys were created with the “IP of 16 different holders.” He added that he felt it was his and the team’s responsibility to help the community to monetize and find licensing opportunities as the average person doesn’t have any idea of how to make a licensing deal successful.

From May 19 till date, LINK recorded a bearish pressure as the price gradually decreased each day till May 24, when it closed at $6.33. Currently, on May 25, 2023, Chainlink’s price stands at $6.30 on CoinMarketCap, indicating a further decline over the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Why This Top Financial Expert Is Saying ‘Buy Bitcoin’ Amid Looming Bank Failures LINK Bears Dominate Market With Strong Momentum LINK is a prominent cryptocurrency that bridges the gap between smart contracts and real-world data. The native token of Chainlink, LINK, has exhibited negative performance within the last day’s trading session. Notably, the asset has been on a downtrend in the last seven days resulting in a loss of 6.25%. These losses suggest sellers pressure buyers beyond their capacity to hold the price, leading to downward pressure on LINK’s price. Investor’s market confidence was reduced, resulting in a steady price decline over the last seven-day trading session. Based on social sentiment indicators, CFG, Chainlink (LINK) displays a general negative sentiment with a reading of 17.5%. This implies negative social media conversations or a lack of enthusiasm among investors toward LINK. Bearish Trendline Pattern LINK has been on a bearish trendline chart pattern since April 18 till date, resulting in a constant price decline within the context of the downward trend. This pattern is characterized by a series of lower highs and lower lows, indicating sustained selling pressure and a lack of bullish momentum. Traders and investors may interpret this pattern as a signal to anticipate further price declines and consider strategies that align with a bearish market outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Aim Big After Recent Breakdown Below $26,500 Due to increased selling pressure, LINK has broken through the first primary support level of $6.2 and is heading to the next support level of $5.9. With the current bearish momentum, the asset may soon hit this support in the short term. LINK Technical Analysis Using Indicators LINK’s trading chart for May 25 shows that the asset’s market trend is bearish. The asset trades below the 200-Day And 50-Day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), suggesting a bearish market sentiment. This indicates that LINK will experience a bearish momentum both in the long and short-term trends. Investors may see this as an opportunity to take profits, which will cause a further price decline. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of LINK currently stands at 37.73, indicating a neutral market. However, the trend line is moving downwards, suggesting an increase in bearish momentum. It is worth noting that an RSI below 30 signifies strong selling pressure, indicating that bears control the market, whereas a level beyond 70 suggests bulls dominate. Lastly, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) trading below the signal line confirms the bearish moves present in the market. This indicator suggests a high bearish momentum in the market, just like the RSI depicts.

42393481,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bixa3b,1685035911,Centralized Exchanges Are Here to Stay,"This month marks one year since the Terra-Luna fallout and six months since the implosion of FTX. These spectacular events, which marked the beginning and culmination of several other collapses respectively, severely shook confidence in cryptocurrencies and arguably triggered the industry’s most daunting existential crisis in its 15-year history. While the asset class has recovered this year, with bitcoin up almost 65% year-to-date, these milestones are nevertheless an opportune moment to reflect on the setbacks of last year and how the industry can build back better.  First, we should acknowledge that these events are not failures of blockchain technology but are instead a result of poor risk management and corporate governance, with fraud taking place in some of the companies that failed. The market continues to recognize the integrity and innovative potential of blockchains, as evidenced by the significant capital inflows into decentralized exchanges following FTX’s collapse, as well as positive reactions towards Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) transition and Shapella upgrade.  Lionel Lim is the CEO of DBS Digital Exchange.     Yet, despite these developments, centralized digital asset exchanges (CEX) will continue to remain relevant and wield outsized influence as the key entry point into the asset class, especially as it grows in sophistication and institutional adoption. After all, they remain the dominant platform when it comes to digital asset transactions. According to DefiLlama, the total trading volume on CEXes accounted for almost 90% of all transactions across centralized and decentralized exchanges, as of mid-May 2023. Despite the setback in investor confidence last year, the case for CEXes remains clear.  What the industry does need to address, however, are the many points of weakness borne out of interdependencies and an early-held ethos of ""moving fast and breaking things."" To survive this crisis of confidence, CEXes will need to address the need for better investor protections, risk controls and prudent governance structures.  CEXes are here to stay  Managing a digital asset portfolio is operationally complex, with investors requiring a comprehensive set of capabilities such as custody, trading, investment products, advisory and efficient fiat on-off ramps. In this regard, many CEXes integrate these solutions into a single platform, greatly reducing the technical complexity of owning and managing tokens native to different blockchains. This value proposition is clear when considering the alternative: where investors manage several wallets and directly participate in multiple liquidity pools across different blockchains. While some investors will have the capabilities to do so, the steep learning curve suggests that CEXes will remain the preferred platform for many.  Investors who actively manage their portfolios may also wish to rebalance their asset allocations frequently between traditional assets and digital assets. The fiat on-off ramps in CEXes thus forms a critical infrastructure layer to do so quickly, which is especially important during periods of market volatility.  Safety and security are other advantages that CEXes can offer. This may come as a surprise given the industry’s “not your keys, not your coins” mantra. Yet, according to Chainalysis, 18% of all cryptocurrencies stolen by hackers in 2022 came from CEXes, with decentralized applications accounting for the remaining 82%. While CEXes still have some way to go to better protect clients from cyber breaches, they are comparatively safer. With the industry working hard to restore trust and enhance their cybersecurity systems, the safety gap between CEXes and decentralized applications should continue to widen.  See also: Crypto Hacks Are Down and Hackers Tend to Return Stolen Money: TRM Labs Report  Finally, an often underappreciated benefit of some CEXes, particularly those that serve high net worth and institutional clients, is the peace of mind that “there’s someone to call” if something goes wrong. This is especially so for investors managing assets on behalf of clients, such as family offices and hedge funds. With horror stories of individuals being locked out of their own wallets worth millions in bitcoin, investors will find value in working with CEXes that provide dedicated hotlines or account managers.  Rebuilding trust by segregating assets  While CEXes are likely here to stay, one area where such platforms must improve on is the segregation of customer and corporate assets. Now, more than ever, scrutiny around this is mounting. Largely in response to the co-mingling of funds by FTX, a practice which led to many retail investors incurring significant losses when the exchange unraveled, policymakers like U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recognized asset segregation as a key area to be addressed in future regulatory frameworks.  Even prior to the collapse of FTX, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) proposed new regulations in a consultation paper published in October of 2022 requiring cryptocurrency platforms to segregate their assets from their customers’. The MAS has also sought industry feedback on whether cryptocurrency platforms should appoint independent custodians to safeguard customer funds.  While CEXes still have some way to go to better protect clients from cyber breaches, they are comparatively safer.  As such, CEXes should rethink the “one-stop-shop” narrative. While it makes sense to have a seamless front end user interface across custody and trading, in the back end, investors’ assets should be custodized separately by an external and qualified custodian, such as a bank or a registered broker-dealer. CEXes should seek and publish independent attestations by auditors to verify that the assets are indeed segregated, and that robust risk and governance requirements are in place.  Instilling trust in a trustless system  When Satoshi Nakamoto published the seminal Bitcoin white paper in 2008, they envisioned a monetary system that no longer needed to rely on blind trust. Yet, the very entry point to which most investors today are exposed to digital assets – exchanges – is still run in a mostly opaque manner.  The events of 2022 have shown that for the industry to move forward, investor protections, transparency, robust governance structures and providing value to clients must return to the forefront of how exchanges are built and run. CEXes that embrace these values will find themselves having a competitive advantage as investors increasingly rely on trusted centralized platforms to manage their digital asset portfolios.

42410588,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfn5c,1685035569,"If Crypto Is the Future, Advisors Need to Embrace It Now","It’s fair to say sentiment toward crypto among the general public has plummeted in the past year. This may have a secondary effect of pushing financial advisors to shy away from the category, and digital assets in general, at least until there is more certainty in the markets and the forces driving them.  Looking at the long term — as advisors are supposed to do — lends itself to a different perspective. Crypto is still a relatively new technology, and with all new technologies, there is an adoption curve, and a good way to evaluate this is Metcalfe’s Law. Metcalfe's Law states that a network's impact is the square of the number of nodes in the network. For example, if a network has 10 nodes, its inherent value is 100 (10 x 10).  If you believe crypto is still early in its evolution (and it almost certainly is), it has unmatched potential to grow in an exponential manner. The analogy isn’t perfect, but one of the toughest times to buy Amazon stock was in the 2000s, when it was virtually stagnant; of course, that also turned out to be a great time to buy.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  In addition to its untapped potential, crypto and blockchain have come to be defined by such features as decentralization, security, transparency, efficiency, innovation and financial inclusion. Many of these facets are attractive to financial advisors as they scan the macroeconomic landscape for investment opportunities for their clients. With a difficult 2022 behind us – during which almost every asset class went down – and the traditional 60/40 portfolio had its worst year in over a century, it is important for advisors to be open to possibilities in the future landscape to rebuild, protect and grow their client portfolios.  Managing feelings  Emotion can be a difficult thing to manage, and in one sense, that is part of an advisor’s job description. The situation in the U.S. has big challenges: The country has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios we have encountered, a devaluation of fiat currencies is ongoing, and demographics are aging with no end insight. A natural question arises: How can we find opportunities to outpace these challenges? It is important to realize that the economy is often slow to reflect economic conditions. We should expect to see challenged earnings, a credit crunch and uncertainty around the Fed. One answer is blockchain and crypto.  There are several reasons why investing in crypto makes sense: diversification, high growth potential, being on the bleeding edge of new technologies, a hedge against inflation and self-custody, to name a few. The question is, how should advisors allocate a portion of client portfolios to digital assets?  Without taking a single token or third-party risk, the SEC’s intransigence in disallowing a spot BTC ETF, and trying to keep up in this 24/7 cycle market, what is a regulated option? As famed value investor Warren Buffet once said, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”  Now it is one of those periods. In preparing for the long term, we need to get out of the day-to-day noise. Will this asset class be higher in five, 10, 15 years and beyond? I believe so and believe it is responsible to research this asset class and have a portion of client portfolios allocated to it, just as it was for Amazon in the early 2000s. Crypto and blockchain are important because they offer a new way to manage and secure financial transactions, increase transparency and accountability, and enable innovation in a variety of industries.  A hedge against uncertainty  Debt has been the backbone of the global economy. As debt grows and credit tightens, it challenges all facets of the markets. This ultimately devalues fiat currencies. While the U.S. dollar remains the world reserve currency (for now), there is no guarantee of that in the future. The ultimate story is that all fiat currencies depreciate because of our system.  As advisors, our job is to maintain purchasing power for our clients. Moving forward, 60/40 portfolios and traditional wealth management strategies may not be enough to do this. This is why we see an allocation to crypto as a responsible decision moving forward so as to not miss an exponential opportunity. Crypto as an asset class is directly tied to global liquidity; this faucet cannot be shut off. As money supply rises over time, we need to be prepared to capitalize on that environment.  In the new world of “work from home,” where does commercial real estate fall in? We just hit a first-quarter record in office vacancies approaching 13%, which is larger than after the financial crisis of 2008. Commercial real estate loans account for nearly 40% of what’s on bank lending books. This issue, along with the now very apparent potential for a bank run via a cellphone, adds pressure on the system, compounding the challenges to advisors. Crypto and digital assets expand the set of tools to help deal with them.  With a system built on debt and big challenges ahead for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, now is the time to look at additional alternatives. Advisors owe it to their clients to put in the work to navigate the digital asset space so they’re better positioned to endure the looming headwinds. No single solution is a perfect fit, but a combination of these strategies puts the people we work for in a better position to be successful for themselves and their families.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Sander Read,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/25/if-crypto-is-the-future-advisors-need-to-embrace-it-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb6b89ae9155ee829a5c9dbe96d8392ada20d261-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

When such investors who are holding unrealized profits/losses do end up selling eventually, the profits/losses they were previously holding are said to be “realized.” When the value of the NUPL is greater than zero, it means the average investor is carrying a profit on their coins right now. On the other hand, the indicator being below this threshold suggests the market as a whole is sitting on some loss currently. The zero value of the metric itself naturally represents the break-even level, as the total amount of unrealized profits in the market equals the unrealized losses at this mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hangs At $26,200: Why This Is A Crucial Support Level Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL, as well as its 365-day moving average (MA), over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant In the above graph, the quant has marked the “long-term resistance” zone that the Bitcoin NUPL has seemed to have historically followed. This area, which lies in between the values of 0.31 and 0.38, has been an important retest for the cryptocurrency, as failure here has often meant the start of a drawdown. When coming from above, however, there have also been bullish retests of this zone, as the points marked by the green checkmarks in the chart display. A prominent example of such a successful retest was back in July 2021, when BTC hit a local bottom and proceeded with the second half of the 2021 bull run following it. The example of a bearish resistance appears to have formed just recently, as the indicator entered the zone recently but has been rejected downwards. And with it, so has the asset’s price. It’s uncertain yet, but this rejection may have started an extended drawdown for the coin. “Given that the NUPL index has also formed a bearish Head & Shoulders (H&S) pattern, this could mean that Bitcoin could fall into the $24,000-$20,000 range,” notes the quant. “With the successful implementation of the H&S, the local uptrend of the NUPL index will also be broken.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio Nears All-Time Lows, Big Move Soon? The Bitcoin NUPL has also shown interesting interactions with its yearly MA in the past; the indicator has sometimes found resistance or support at this level as well. “The last frontier for maintaining Bitcoin bullishness is the 365-day MA, which acts as reliable long-term support,” says the quant. “For the above scenario to be declared invalid, it is necessary to overcome long-term resistance sustainably!” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,300, down 2% in the last week.

42410585,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfmsO,1685030895,DeSantis and the Growing Culture War Around Bitcoin,"This week CoinDesk published one of the most thought-provoking and balanced articles on bitcoin mining I’ve ever read. The report is focused around the Greenidge bitcoin mining company in upstate New York, which was at the center of a protracted media cycle last year after environmental activists claimed the facility was boiling the waterways and poisoning delicate ecosystems. Those claims went on to influence an actual policy decision by Governor Kathy Hochul restricting bitcoin mining in the state.  The thing is, most of the worst claims about Greenidge were straight up wrong. CoinDesk’s Nik De, Doreen Wang and Cheyenne Ligon took a trip to Dresden, in Upstate New York, to take the temperature of the lake and speak to locals, finding that not a single lawmaker visited the rust-belt town or spoke to its mayor before drafting what is essentially a freeze on new bitcoin miners.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Most of the bitcoin mining debate today has centered around the Bitcoin network’s environmental impact. Greenidge became a lightning rod because before the company moved equipment into the plant that now uses natural gas it was deactivated, meaning when the miners were turned on they weren’t just drawing on electricity that would have been produced anyway, but actively releasing “fresh” carbon into the atmosphere.  See also: The Blocksize Wars Revisited: How Bitcoin's Civil War Still Resonates Today  The Bitcoin network uses as much energy as a country like Norway, and trying to wrap your head around whether that is or isn’t “worth it” often comes down to your point of view on how you value permissionless money. Individuals can certainly make up their minds on the matter, but how a state should treat Bitcoin – for instance, whether mining should be encouraged or banned – is a societal-level conversation involving politicians, stakeholders and those affected.  In a behind the scenes account of how the story came to be, De wrote that he expected locals to hate the plant. He and his team had heard that Greenidge was pumping pollution into Seneca Lake and creating incessant noise (a claim that was also debunked). Instead, De’s team found that many in the town and surrounding area supported the upstart business. Although Greenidge created a relatively small number, every job counts in a town like Dresden (population: 296).  In fact, the few complaints about Greenidge lodged by locals came from so-called “cottage people” – the wealthy out-of-towners with vacation homes on the lakeshore. Sure, as taxpayers these people have a right to be concerned about their property value, but should their opinion matter more? Because it seemed to.  And here layeth the nut: Beyond all the other intractable debates about bitcoin mining lies a class conflict. You all know the story: Bitcoin was born during the Great Financial Crisis, a tool that allowed anyone to access a semi-private electronic cash system where the money supply would always be verifiable – a total rebuke of banking and the Federal Reserve.  Over time, that narrative has gotten a little more complicated, especially as some of Bitcoin’s biggest supporters have become entrenched elites themselves essentially for making a few good trades a decade ago. There are now a lot of white-collar jobs based around analyzing bitcoin’s price performance and lobbying for new-fangled investment vehicles derived from bitcoin.  Bitcoin mining too has gone from something you could do on your home computer to becoming a highly-capital intensive industry, requiring the purchase of hundreds or thousands of specialized computers that draw electricity 24/7, if you want to compete on any meaningful scale. But the proof-of-work algorithm that makes Bitcoin also tethers it to the ground: these investments are being made in real communities.  Greenidge, for instance, has hired unionized electricians and created dozens of short-term construction jobs. The company has made a number of improvements into Dresden, including fixing up a children's playground and other beautification efforts. Not all facilities operate their own converted coal-plant like Greenidge requiring as much labor, but many do create opportunities for people where opportunity doesn’t always come a-knocking.  If Greenidge is any indication, the real conversations we could be having around bitcoin mining and class will be increasingly consumed by another conflict: the Culture War. I’ve said for a while, perhaps being too reductionist, that bitcoin is going to become a red-blue issue in the U.S., with Republicans increasingly endorsing it and Democrats disavowing. Although the network itself will likely always remain “credibly neutral,” the way we think about it, and politicize it, will fall along predictable lines. Many topics have traveled thus. Before climate change became a wedge issue in American politics, for example, it was a relatively non-partisan issue that many politicians agreed on the need to do something about.  See also: You Can Be a Bitcoin Maximalist and Like Ethereum, Too | Opinion  Just yesterday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R.) spoke about Bitcoin’s “threat to the current regime,” in an announcement event for his 2024 presidential campaign. Although modeling himself as a populist, DeSantis has the early support of monied technologists like Elon Musk and fellow PayPal Mafia member David Sachs. DeSantis is probably most well-known nationally for what’s been termed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill and a fight with Disney.  Something tells me DeSantis’ pledge to “protect” Bitcoin is as performative as his “ban” on central bank digital currency (CBDC) in Florida (before the Fed has even decided whether it’s worth fully studying a digital dollar). But it’ll still be enough to color some people’s impressions of crypto, furthering the type of political feedback loop that enabled environmentalists to lie about Greenidge’s ecological footprint and the Democratic government in New York to buy it whole cloth.  As my colleague Nik De said, “a conversation that doesn’t include the people most directly impacted can lead to wonky outcomes.” When the only two political parties of consequence are shadow boxing about fake internet money, the only people who can get a word in edgewise probably own a vacation home.

The bulls had sustained the price momentum driving XRP to $0.4688 on May 19. The asset traded within this range till May 24, when the bears dropped it to a closing price of $0.454. But today, XRP’s price has gradually declined to the $0.451 level as the bears continue to exert pressure on its price. More Bearish Trend For XRP XRP is in a downtrend today, forming a second consecutive red candle on the daily price chart with lower lows. The asset trades below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a short-term-bearish sentiment. The 50-day SMA indicates XRP’s average price over a specific period. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Green Today – What’s The Energy Behind The Glow? Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 46.71 in the neutral zone and descending, further confirming a bearish sentiment for XRP. The RSI has two critical regions the overbought region and the oversold region. RSI values between 70 and 30 are neutral. Given the descending line of XRP’s RSI, the asset is entering the oversold region from which a trend reversal is imminent. XRP’s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line, suggesting a bullish sentiment. However, the MACD displays negative values, and its histogram bars hint at a bearish reversal. The MACD identifies the trend direction of an asset and is often used to place trades. Currently, it displays a tentative sell signal in the market today. But XRP is trading above the 200-day SMA, suggesting a bullish trend in the long run. The altcoin is trading at the $0.4504 support level as the bears seek to push it down. Bearish pressure at the $0.46591 resistance level pushed XRP into a downtrend. A further decline will see XRP return to the $0.44446 support level and push it to the oversold region. XRP will likely record more price drops in the short term. However, since it is still trading above its 200-day SMA, a long-term bullish sentiment, the bulls will rally again once they regain control of its price. XRP Updates Might Influence Price Action In Long term Ripple Labs’ ongoing legal case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission is likely one of the reasons behind XRP’s price downturn. However, as the Ripple CEO said, the case may likely conclude soon.

Countries around the world have been looking at the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which is close to taking effect. MiCA may apply within the broader European Economic Area, but the central bank does not want to stop there: it believes there is a need to further develop specific crypto regulations, the report said.  The collapse of stablecoin issuer Terra and crypto exchange FTX has also encouraged regulators to speed up efforts to regulate the sector.  “The Norwegian authorities should assess whether to proceed more quickly rather than wait for international regulatory solutions,"" said Norges Bank Deputy Governor Pål Longva in a public statement. ""Norges Bank can contribute to such assessments and to regulation that promotes responsible innovation.”  MiCA applies to a range of service providers in the crypto market and covers market abuse, consumer protection, market integrity and financial stability but what it does not cover is ""developments in decentralized finance as the regulation’s primary focus is on centralised market participants,"" the central bank said.  Norges Bank says lawmakers should take advantage of existing regulations that cater to systemic risk and enforcement actions for example. The report stressed the need for crypto specific laws.  However, the central bank believes there is also a need for more knowledge around exposure, attitudes and applications of crypto in Norway. Norges Bank wants to help increase knowledge in this area, the report said.

As the US economy continues to deteriorate and the country’s debt ceiling discussions take center stage, Kiyosaki emphasizes the urgency of securing one’s financial future by investing in alternative assets, including the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The State Of The US Economy Robert Kiyosaki begins by shedding light on the deteriorating state of the US economy, expressing concern over the growing national debt. With Congress currently discussing raising the US debt ceiling to $31.4 trillion to avoid blemish, Kiyosaki dismisses it as nothing more than “kabuki theater.” Drawing attention to the dire financial situation, he asserts that the US is already bankrupt, citing unfunded liabilities, such as Social Security, which surpass $250 trillion. Related Reading: Why This Top Financial Expert Is Saying ‘Buy Bitcoin’ Amid Looming Bank Failures Furthermore, Kiyosaki highlights the size of the financial market’s “derivative assets,” amounting to thousands of trillions of dollars. Against this backdrop, he presents his solution: investing in tangible assets like gold, silver, and digital gold – Bitcoin. The Bestselling author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” noted: Politicians debating raising $30 trillion US debt limit bad comedy, “kabuki theater.” Facts are: US [is] bankrupt. Unfunded liabilities [such] as Social Security are over $250 trillion. Financial market “derivative assets” [are] measured in quadrillions…thousands of trillions. WTF. Buy G,S, BC. Robert Kiyosaki has since been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, emphasizing the top crypto value for several years. During the onset of the pandemic in 2020, as the US government printed trillions of dollars to stimulate the economy, Kiyosaki voiced his concerns regarding the lack of backing and the inflationary risks associated with fiat currency. He famously referred to these newly printed dollars as “fake money,” warning of the consequences of such actions. With over $6 trillion already printed in 2020 alone, Kiyosaki anticipates that the ongoing printing spree will cause Bitcoin’s price to surge to approximately $500,000 by 2025. Bitcoin Downtrend Amid Buy Signal Meanwhile, despite the buy signal from Kiyosaki, Bitcoin has shown no uptick but instead a continuous decline. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a 1% decline, while the past seven days have seen a dip of 3.1%. At the time of writing, the top crypto currently trades at $26,412. Bitcoin’s trading volume has, however, surged in the past 7 days indicating a possible short-term downward pressure. The asset’s trading volume has spiked from a low of $15.3 billion last Thursday to a high of $17.6 billion in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Aim Big After Recent Breakdown Below $26,500 Furthermore, over the past week, Bitcoin has recorded a loss of over $10 billion from its market capitalization down by nearly 4%.

42410589,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfn2J,1685026800,Blend Seizes 82% of NFT Lending Market Share: DappRadar,"In the weeks since leading non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur released its lending platform Blend, it has taken 82% of total lending volume market share.  According to a report from blockchain data aggregator DappRadar released on Wednesday, in its first 22 days, Blend accumulated 169,900 ETH, or about $308 million in trading volume. During that same time, the trading volume across all NFT lending platforms reached about $375 million.  On the date of its release, the platform experienced 4,200 ETH, or roughly $7.6 million, in lending volume – meaning, Blend has seen a 3,945% increase in its trading volume in just under a month.  In the same time period, total NFT market trading volumes reached $466 million, according to DappRadar, signaling a shift in attitudes from NFT ownership to NFT lending. Additionally, 46.2% of Blur’s total trading volume is now from lending.  Sara Gherghelas, a blockchain data analyst at DappRadar, told CoinDesk that while Blend’s success is promising for driving capital into stagnant NFT markets, it comes with its own concerns for the market’s maturity and its impacts on collection prices.  “The significance of this large volume can be positive, as it indicates liquidity and market validation,” said Ghergelas. “However, there are also potential negatives, as high volumes on Blend could increase the price volatility, impacting market stability and making it difficult for traders to predict price movements accurately.”  The report also notes that since Blend’s launch, Blur’s total value locked (TVL) has increased from $119 million to $146 million. However, it says that wash trading remains a concern and that $19 million of that has been wash traded just in the past week.  “The significance of this number is that it raises concerns about the legitimacy of the trading volume on the Blur platform and also on the entire NFT industry,” said Ghergelas. “It is important for platforms and participants in the market to maintain transparency and avoid engaging in manipulative practices that can mislead market participants, especially if we want a wider adoption of NFTs.”  Blur rolled out Blend, Blur Lending, on May 1, to court traders who couldn’t afford to purchase an expensive blue-chip NFT upfront. However, a handful of collectors raised concerns that new traders may not be aware of changing market trends, and thus face liquidity issues when paying off their loans.  According to data platform Dune Analytics, Blur has amassed a trading volume of over $120 million in the past week, while runner-up marketplace OpenSea is trailing behind at nearly $37 million. Meanwhile, OpenSea leads with nearly 59,000 active users, while Blur follows with about 26,000.

According to a statement by Arthur Delaporte and Stéphane Vojetta, who led negotiations in the National Assembly, the deal allows promotions for products of any crypto firm that has registered with the Financial Markets Authority – a softer line than they had previously taken.  The new law, which may be the first in Europe to regulate social media personalities who do paid marketing – and includes areas such as cosmetics and gambling – was the subject of disputes between the two chambers of the French legislature.  An Assembly draft of the influencers bill would have effectively banned crypto publicity through influencers by restricting it to digital asset companies with a license. That plan raised concerns from the industry, which warned the rules could jeopardize the country’s ambitions to be a crypto hub.  Senators favored gentler restrictions, saying social media influencers should be allowed to promote any company that gained registration – a much broader category that currently includes dozens of companies such as Binance and Bitstamp.  The Joint Mixed Committee, which includes representatives from both chambers, subsequently published a draft of the agreed legislative text.  On Wednesday, the European Commission proposed new rules, which would make regulated investment firms responsible for content that they pay or encourage a social media “finfluencer” to promote. If passed into law, those proposals would apply across the European Union, including France.

42410603,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfnmb,1685023912,How Crypto Can Help Secure AI,"Both, crypto and AI, have seen remarkable progress in the past few years.  Crypto celebrated successes like DeFi, and more recently DeSci.  AI celebrated successes like AlphaFold2, and more recently ChatGPT.  Back in 2018, Peter Thiel pointed to the tension between the decentralizing forces of crypto and the centralizing forces of AI, coining the term “Crypto is libertarian, AI is Communist.” Here I want to argue that we may learn something by combining the two.  Why? Because skills and approaches honed by the security and crypto community have the potential to unlock useful applications of AI and mitigate AI risks.  Allison Duettmann is the president and CEO of Foresight Institute. She directs the Intelligent Cooperation, Molecular Machines, Biotech & Health Extension, Neurotech, and Space Programs, Fellowships, Prizes, and Tech Trees, and shares this work with the public.  Are we all going to die?  Eliezer Yudkowsky, an eminent figure in AI safety, recently made a surprising appearance on the Bankless Podcast, a distinctly Web3 podcast.  It was surprising for two reasons:  First, Eliezer thinks we are on a rapid path to developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that can perform virtually all tasks that humans, and that such AGI will very likely kill us all.  Second, when asked if there is anything one may do to increase the tiny chance we could survive, he encouraged security and cryptography-oriented people with a strong security mindset to take a hand at AI alignment.  Let’s unpack that. First, we’ll discuss why we should worry about AGI, before zooming into the promises that the crypto (here meaning primarily cryptography) and security community has for mitigating some of the dangers of AGI.  AI Safety: harder than you think?  As anyone glimpsing the news recently can attest, no week goes by without progress in AI accelerating dramatically. In case you missed it, here are just three crucial developments:  First, there has been a push toward more centralization of AI, for instance by Microsoft investing in OpenAI, Google investing in OpenAI’s competitor Anthropic, and DeepMind and Google Brain merging into one organization.  Read more: Michael J. Casey - Why Web3 and the AI-Internet Belong Together  Second, there has been a push for more generalized AI. The recent paper “GPT4: Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence” showed how GPT-4 already demonstrates first instances of theory of mind, a measure usually used to assess human intelligence.  Third, there has been a push for more agency in AI systems, with AutoGPT becoming more agentic by re-prompting itself to achieve more complex tasks.  Back in December, Metaculus, a forecasting platform, predicted the arrival of AGI roughly in the year 2039. Now, in May, the date is at 2031 – in other words, an eight-year timeline drop within five months of AI progress.  If we take these developments as signs that we are on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence, the next question is why is AGI safety considered so hard?  Arguably, we can break the problem of AGI safety down into three sub problems:  Alignment: How can we align AI with human values?  AI alignment is the simple question of how do we get AIs to align with our values. But it’s easy to forget that we don’t even agree on what our values are. Since the dawn of civilization, philosophers and mere mortals alike have argued about ethics, with convincing points on all sides. That’s why our current civilization arrived, mostly, at value pluralism (the idea of humans with conflicting values peacefully co-existing). That works for a diversity of human values but is a difficult thing to implement into one artificially intelligent agent.  Let’s imagine for a sweet minute that we knew, roughly, what moral values to equip the AGI with. Next, we need to communicate these human values to a silicon-based entity that doesn’t share human evolution, mind-architecture, or context. When humans coordinate with other humans, we can rely on plenty of shared implicit background knowledge since we share our species’ biology, evolutionary history, and often even some cultural context. With AI, we cannot rely on such a common context.  Read more: Michael J. Casey - Web2’s Lesson for AI: Decentralize to Protect Humanity  Another problem is that, for the pursuit of any goal, it’s generally instrumentally useful to be alive and to acquire more resources. This means that, an AI set to pursue a specific goal could resist being shut down and seek more and more resources. Given the countless possibilities in which an AI could achieve goals that include human injury, neglect, deceit, and more, and given how hard it is to predict and specify all those constraints in advance in a reliable way, the job of technical alignment is daunting.  Computer security  Even if humans agree on a set of values, and figure out how to technically align an AGI with them, we still can’t expect it to act reliably without proof that the underlying software and hardware is itself reliable. Given the sizable advantage that AGI conveys to its creators, malicious hackers may sabotage or reprogram the AGI.  Further out, an unintentional bug could interfere with the AGI’s goal execution or the AGI could itself exploit vulnerabilities in its own code, for instance by reprogramming itself in dangerous ways.  Unfortunately, we have built today’s entire multi-trillion-dollar ecosystem on insecure cyber foundations. Most of our physical infrastructure is based on hackable systems, such as the electric grid, our nuclear weapon technology. In the future, even insecure self-driving cars and autonomous drones could be hacked to turn into killer bots. Mounting cyberattacks such as Sputnick or Solarwinds are severe but may be benign when compared to potential future AG-enabled attacks. Our lack of meaningful response to these attacks suggests that we are not up to the task of AGI-safe security which may require rebuilding much of our insecure infrastructure.  By leveraging technologies and skills in the security and cryptography communities, we may be able to pursue a multipolar superintelligence scenario  Coordination  Making progress on alignment and security of AGI could take time, which makes it important for actors building AGI to coordinate along the way. Unfortunately, incentivizing major AI actors (this may be cooperations or nation states) to cooperate and avoid spurring arms race dynamics to get to AGI first is not that straight forward. Catastrophe takes only one actor to defect from an agreement, meaning that even if everyone else cooperates, if one races ahead, they secure a decisive advantage. This first mover advantage persists until AGI is built and given the power that the unitary deployment of AGI system may convey on its owner, and it is a difficult temptation for the owner to forgo.  Secure Multipolar AI  Perhaps you have nodded along so far: Yes, sure, AI safety is really hard. But what in the world does crypto have to do with it?  Given the rapid pace of AI progress, and the difficulties in making it safe, the traditional concern is that we are racing toward an AGI singleton scenario, in which an AGI displaces human civilization as the overall framework of relevance for intelligence and dominates the world, potentially killing humanity along the way.  By leveraging technologies and skills in the security and cryptography communities, we may be able to change course to instead pursue a multipolar superintelligence scenario, in which networks of humans and AIs securely cooperate to compose their local knowledge into the collective superintelligence of civilization.  This is a big, abstract claim, so let’s unpack how exactly the crypto and security communities could help tame AI risks and unleash AI’s beauty by unlocking new applications.  How can security and cryptography tame AI risks?  Red-teaming  Paul Christiano, a reputable AI safety researcher, suggests that AI desperately needs more red-teaming, usually a term used in computer security to refer to simulated cyber attacks. Red-teams in the AI context could, for instance, be used to search for inputs that cause catastrophic behaviors in machine learning systems.  Red-teaming is also something the crypto community has experience with. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are developing in an environment that is under continuous adversarial attack, because insecure projects pose the equivalent of multimillion-dollar cryptocurrency “bug bounties.”  Non-bulletproof systems are eliminated, leaving only more bulletproof systems within the ecosystem. Crypto projects undergo a level of adversarial testing that can be a good inspiration for systems capable of withstanding cyberattacks that would devastate conventional software.  Anti-collusion  A second problem in AI is that multiple emerging AIs may eventually collude to overthrow humanity. For instance, “AI Safety via Debate,” a popular alignment strategy, relies on two AIs debating topics with each other, with a human judge in the loop deciding who wins. However, one thing the human judge may not be able to exclude is that both AIs are colluding against her, with none promoting the true result.  Again, crypto has experience with avoiding collusion problems, such as the Sybil attack, which uses a single node to operate many active fake identities to covertly gain the majority of influence in the network. To avoid this, a significant amount of work on mechanism design is emerging within crypto, and some may have useful lessons for AI collusion, too.  Checks and balances  Another promising safety approach currently explored by OpenAI competitor Anthropic is “Constitutional AI,” in which one AI supervises another AI using rules and principles given by a human. This is inspired by the U.S. Constitution design, which sets up conflicting interests and limited means in a system of checks and balances.  Again, security and cryptography communities are well-experienced with constitution-like checks and balance arrangements. For instance, the security principle, POLA – Principle of Least Authority – demands that an entity should have access only to the least amount of information and resources necessary to do its job. A useful principle to consider when building more advanced AI systems, too.  Those are just three examples of many, giving a taste of how the type of security mindset that is prominent in security and crypto communities could aid with AI alignment challenges.  How can crypto and security unleash AI’s beauty?  In addition to the AI safety problems you may try your hand at, let’s look at a few cases in which crypto security innovations cannot just help tame AI, but also unleash its beauty, for instance by enabling novel beneficial applications.  Privacy-preserving AI  There are a few areas that traditional AI can’t really touch, in particular solving problems that require sensitive data like individuals’ health information or financial data that have strong privacy constraints.  Fortunately, as pointed out by cryptography researcher Georgios Kaissis, those are areas in which cryptographic and auxiliary approaches, such as federated learning, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption and more, shine. These emerging approaches to computation can tackle large sensitive datasets while maintaining privacy, and thus have a comparative advantage over centralized AI.  Leveraging local knowledge  Another area traditional AI struggles with is sourcing the local knowledge that is often required to solve edge cases in machine learning (ML) that big data cannot make sense of.  The crypto ecosystem could aid with local data provision by establishing marketplaces in which developers can use incentives to attract better local data for their algorithms. For instance, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam suggests combining private ML that allows for the training of sensitive data with blockchain-based incentives that attract better data into blockchain-based data and ML marketplaces. While it may not be feasible or safe to open source the actual training of ML models, data market places could pay creators for the fair share of their data contributions.  Encrypted AI  Looking more long-term, it may even be possible to leverage cryptographic approaches to build AI systems that are both more secure and powerful.  For instance, cryptography researcher Andrew Trask suggests using homomorphic encryption to fully encrypt a neural network. If possible, this means that the intelligence of the network would be safeguarded against theft, enabling actors to cooperate on specific problems using their models and data, without revealing the inputs.  More importantly, though, if the AI is homomorphically encrypted, then the outside world is perceived by it to be encrypted. The human who controls the secret key could unlock individual predictions that the AI makes, rather than letting the AI out into the wild itself.  Again, these are just three examples of potentially many, in which crypto can unlock new use cases for AI.  The examples of memes controlling memes and of institutions controlling institutions also suggest that AI systems can control AI systems  Putting the pieces together  Centralized AI suffers from single points of failure. It would not only compress complex human value pluralism into one objective function. It is also prone to error, internal corruption and external attack. Secure multipolar systems, as built by the security and cryptography community, on the other hand, have lots of promise; they support value pluralism, can provide red-teaming, checks and balances, and are antifragile.  There are also plenty of disadvantages of cryptographic systems. For instance, cryptography requires progress in decentralized data storage, functional encryption, adversarial testing, and computational bottlenecks that make these approaches still prohibitively slow and expensive. Moreover, decentralized systems are also less stable than centralized systems, and susceptible to rogue actors that always have an incentive to collude or otherwise overthrow the system to dominate it.  Nevertheless, given the rapid speed of AI, and the relative lack of security and cryptography minded folks in AI, it is perhaps not too early to consider if you could possibly meaningfully contribute to AI, bringing some of the benefits discussed here to the table.  The promise of secure multipolar AI was well-summed up by Eric Drexler, a technology pioneer, back in 1986: “The examples of memes controlling memes and of institutions controlling institutions also suggest that AI systems can control AI systems.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Allison Duettmann,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/25/how-crypto-can-help-secure-ai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e77cd91da26146fbe779a7a3b6ab498211b0ccb5-2120x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410598,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfnZN,1685023411,South Africa’s Crypto Firms Will Soon Need to Apply for Registration or Face a Heavy Fine,"Crypto companies looking to operate in South Africa will need to apply for a license from the country’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) in the six months starting June 1.  While South African crypto companies have welcomed the new licensing regime, they worry the fine waiting for those that fail to register in time may sink smaller companies or drive away firms that want to enter the market after the deadline has passed.  South Africa ranked 30 on Chainalysis’ global adoption index last year, and is behind other African countries like Nigeria and Kenya in terms of crypto use. But regulators in the country, like those elsewhere, have been trying to supervise the sector, which hit close to $3 trillion in global market capitalization in 2021 before crashing spectacularly in 2022.  In November 2020, South Africa’s FSCA proposed crypto should be treated like financial products, and that firms offering crypto-related services must apply for a license. Following a consultation on the drafted legislation, on October 19, 2022, the FSCA published the final declaration on the licensing requirement.  ""This is an extremely positive step for both the crypto industry and South Africans,” said Nick Taylor, head of public policy at Luno for Europe, Middle East and Africa. Luno, like CoinDesk, is owned by the Digital Currency Group.  “The licensing requirements that will flow from the FSCA’s classification will drive up standards, protect consumers, and give businesses the certainty to invest, innovate and create jobs,” Taylor added.  The regime is being set up to protect consumers and that is really important, Mpumelelo Ndamane, CEO of South Africa-based crypto wallet provider Nuud Money, told CoinDesk.  Instead of enforcing the requirement immediately following the declaration, South African regulators set the start date for seeking approval on June 1.  Firms that apply for registration in the designated six months will be allowed to continue operating while regulators make a decision on approval. To continue operating, firms will have to show they comply with the country's norms for financial service providers, including conditions that firms should operate with integrity, be diligent and provide the FSCA with information they request.  However, crypto derivatives services providers do not qualify for the exemption, which allows companies to keep operating while applications are being processed, the declaration said.  The cost of not applying  It's not yet clear exactly how much crypto companies have to pay to register with the FSCA but the application fees that companies usually pay the regulator usually range from 2,544 South African rand ($132) to 46,251 ($2,395), depending on the category firms fall under.  Crypto companies will likely fall under category one, which has the lowest fee, and is for firms that don't fit into any of the other categories. But if applicants fall under multiple categories, they may have to do several applications, Meiran Shtibel, associate general counsel at crypto custody platform Fireblocks said.  The cost of not applying is much heavier.  If crypto companies do not apply to register, but continue operating after the November deadline, they could face a fine of 10 million South African rand ($510,000), up to 10 years in prison, or both, the declaration said.  Nuud Money is raising a seed round of $350,000, and a $510,000 fine would be unfeasible for it to pay, Ndamane said.  A 10 million South African rand fine may be a slap on the wrist for other capital-rich financial sectors, but for a new industry like crypto in an emerging market, a fine like that could ""sink the entire operation,"" Shadrack Kubyane co-founder of South Africa-based blockchain company Coronet told CoinDesk.  The fines are not specific to crypto and are a part of the existing penalties under the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act (FAIS), which also applies to other financial firms, Shtibel said, adding the fact that they’re not tailored to the crypto sector may be part of the problem.  However, the regulations' benefit to the financial services industry outweighs the potential cost implications, the FSCA said in the declaration.  Timing  Some companies felt that the timeframe allocated to prepare for the regime was not enough. Crypto companies had actually asked for the application period to be between eight months to up to two years, but the FSCA settled for a six month time frame instead because two years could not be justified, the declaration said.  Companies should still be able to apply to register after November, but they will not be able to operate until they have been approved by the regulator, Shtibel said. In countries like the U.K., this approach, where companies have to register before they can operate in the country, has driven firms out of the market in search of more lenient regimes.  For those who choose to set up closer to the deadline, it may feel near impossible to get themselves ready in time to be able to fill out the paperwork properly, Ndamane said.  When it comes to applying, insufficient time ""might just be the barrier,"" as it could take some firms time to be able to properly comply, Kubyane said.  Crypto companies wishing to get licensed will need to fill out forms asking for information on business activities and shareholders, as well as the financial soundness of the business, the declaration said.  Digital asset companies that have applied within the allocated time will only have to cease operating if they get rejected, the declaration said. The FAIS act is unclear about whether or not companies can apply again if they are rejected, but they can file an application for reconsideration under existing regulations.  Eventually, crypto asset-related financial services will fall under the Conduct of Financial Institutions (COFI) bill once this comes into law, instead of the FAIS Act, which is an interim measure, the declaration said. The COFI bill sets out protections for consumers.  Non-fungible token providers will not need to register at this stage and will be considered in a “future framework,” the declaration said. Mining nodes and node operators would also not be considered.  Kubyane said he wants regulators to continue to work with the industry to develop appropriate measures for all crypto players, not just big ones.  The FSCA did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment by press time.

12912884,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=534971,1685023246,"Bitcoin Hangs At $26,200: Why This Is A Crucial Support Level","Bitcoin has plunged during the last 24 hours and now finds itself at the $26,200 level. Here’s why this level is important for the asset. Bitcoin 200 WMA & 111 DMA Are Both At $26,200 Right Now In a new tweet, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the different technical pricing models for Bitcoin may be interacting with the asset’s price currently. There are four relevant technical pricing models here, and each of them is based on different moving averages (MAs) for the cryptocurrency. An MA is a tool that finds the average of any given quantity over a specified region, and as its name implies, it moves with time and changes its value according to changes in said quantity. MAs, when taken over long ranges, can smooth out the curve of the quantity and remove short-term fluctuations from the data. This has made them useful analytical tools since they can make studying long-term trends easier. In the context of the current topic, the relevant MAs for Bitcoin are 111-day MA, 200-week MA, 365-day MA, and 200-day MA. The first of these, the 111-day MA, is called the Pi Cycle indicator, and it generally finds useful in identifying short to mid-term momentum in the asset’s value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio Nears All-Time Lows, Big Move Soon? The 200-week MA is used for finding the baseline momentum of a BTC cycle as 200 weeks are equal to almost 4 years, which is about what the length of BTC cycles in the popular sense is. Here is a chart that shows the trend in these different Bitcoin technical pricing models over the past year: Looks like pairs of models have come together in phase in recent weeks | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As shown in the above graph, these different Bitcoin pricing models have taken turns in providing support and resistance to the price during different periods of the cycle. For example, the 111-day MA turned into support recently, as the price rebounded off this level back during the plunge in March of this year, as can be seen in the chart. The 111-day and 200-week MAs have recently come into phase, as both their values stand at $26,200 right now. This is the level that Bitcoin has been finding support at in recent days, so it would appear that the base formed by these lines may be helping the price currently. Related Reading: Sharks & Whales Accumulate Stablecoins, Why This Could Be Bullish For Bitcoin Glassnode notes that if a break below this region of support takes place, the next levels of interest can be the 365-day and 200-day MAs. The former of these simply represent the yearly average price, while the latter metric is called the Mayer Multiple (MM). The MM has historically been associated with the transition point between bullish and bearish trends for the cryptocurrency. When the 111-day MA provided support to the price back in March, the metric had been in phase with the MM. From the graph, it’s visible that the 365-day and 200-day MAs have also interestingly found confluence recently, as their current values are $22,300 and $22,600, respectively. This would imply that between $22,300 and $22,600 may be the next major support area for the asset. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,200, down 4% in the last week.

Justin Bram, CEO and co-founder of Astaria, told CoinDesk that peer-to-peer lending models are hard to scale and utilizing a three-actor model helps make the lending process much easier.  “There's sort of this bid and ask process that happens offline in Discord, where users are negotiating different rates for loans – it's really cumbersome, you have to have capital and knowledge to lend out and as a borrower, and you don't really know what you're getting,” said Bram. “We're extremely borrower friendly, we don't force-liquidate anyone, you get fixed terms and you only get liquidated to pay – you don't pay your debt at maturity.”  In order to manage the capital flow within the protocol, Astaria is releasing a pre-funded vault that Upshot will help control in order to manage risk and rewards options between borrowers and lenders.  Astaria took advantage of the bear market to build out its protocol before releasing it to the public. In June 2022, Astaria raised $8 million in seed-funding to deliver robust NFT lending infrastructure.  NFT lending has been on the rise since NFT marketplace Blur released its lending platform Blend in May. According to data from platform Dune Analytics, the marketplace has already loaned out 46,472 ETH, about $83.7 million.

Worldcoin, a decentralized open source protocol, was co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.  The nine-figure funding round is a rare sight during an extended crypto bear market that has slowed venture capital investments in the space to a trickle. The announcement comes as a black market for Worldcoin credentials emerges in China.  Currently in beta, Worldcoin is being built around the decentralized World ID and the Worldcoin token. The project has onboarded nearly 2 million people already, according to the company. The capital will help accelerate research and development and growth efforts on the Worldcoin project and the World App, the first crypto wallet for the Worldcoin ecosystem.  “As we embark on the age of AI, it is imperative that individuals are able to maintain personal privacy while proving their humanness. In doing so we can help ensure that everyone can realize the financial benefits that AI is poised to deliver,” said Alex Blania, CEO and co-founder of Tools for Humanity and Worldcoin contributor, in the press release.  Worldcoin has attracted controversy with its use of a biometric imaging device called the Orb, which verifies a person is a unique person and not a bot.  Blockchain Capital general partner Spencer Bogart noted on Twitter that Worldcoin is a widely misunderstood project that ""appears to be a noxious combination of hardware, biometrics, crypto and AI."" Bogart hmself thought Worldcoin was ""some dystopian Orwellian nightmare"" until the Blockchain Capital team spent hundreds of hours evaluating what Worldcoin contributors had actually built. The team found that World ID has a ""unique opportunity to establish and scale a new privacy-preserving primitive"" that can allow any application to distinguish between humans and bots.  ""With an ability to easily distinguish between machines and humans, we can improve the UX of the internet, enable myriad new features and applications, and help restore trust in digital communities (knowingly conversing with real humans instead of bot armies),"" wrote Bogart.

The new token Stably USD aims to become a go-to currency for traders transacting in the wave of novel assets being built on bitcoin, according to issuing company Stably. The crypto startup says its token can make trading in ordinals cheaper and more efficient than paying in fiat, or even bitcoin itself.  Bitcoin’s quickly maturing ordinals scene has come a long way since January. First envisioned as a method to “inscribe” NFTs on bitcoin’s smallest denomination, the satoshi, the ordinals protocol has since become a gateway for creating all sorts of tokens – including Stably USD.  This latest so-called “BRC-20” token could make trading in all ordinals a little easier – if it catches on. Right now ordinals traders pay in two ways: either by on-ramping stable fiat currency for a fee, or with accessible but volatile bitcoin. Stably says its stablecoin will solve both issues by retaining a stable value and remaining accessible on-chain.

The company’s first bitcoin-linked stablecoin will have to fare better than its other stablecoin products if it wants to succeed in the long term. Stably’s stablecoin in the ethereum ecosystem, called StableUSD (USDS) has only 752 holders and a market cap of $264,000, per etherscan – basically irrelevant when compared to market leaders Tether and USDC.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin's (BTC) recent price slide may have legs, according to technical analysis by alternative asset management firm Valkyrie Investments. The leading cryptocurrency by market value has declined by 10% to $26,200 this month – including a slide of nearly 4% over just the past day-plus – thanks in part to renewed bets the Fed will remain hawkish, a recovery in the U.S. dollar index, and lingering U.S. debt ceiling uncertainty. Per Valkyrie, a further decline toward $24,000 may be seen as bitcoin's daily chart Ichimoku cloud – a momentum indicator – has flipped bearish. ""This suggests an ongoing high-timeframe bullish trend with a decline in bullish momentum and the potential for near-term retrenchment,"" wrote Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg and team in a note to clients on Tuesday.  Crypto consortium Fahrenheit has won a bid to acquire insolvent lender Celsius Network, whose assets were previously valued at around $2 billion, according to court filingsmade early Thursday morning. The group will acquire Celsius’ institutional loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrencies, mining unit and additional alternative investments, and must pay a deposit of $10 million within three days to cement the deal, court filings show. A consortium of buyers that includes venture capital firm Arrington Capital and miner US Bitcoin Corp, Farenheit was selected as successful bidder following a lengthy auction process. Under the terms of the deal, the newly-formed company will get between $450 and $500 million in liquid cryptocurrency, and US Bitcoin Corp will construct a range of crypto mining facilities including a new 100 megawatt plant.  Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon will remain in detention while he faces charges of falsifying official documents in Montenegro, according to a court statement Thursday. Although the Basic Court in the country's capital Podgorica had initially accepted a bail proposal from Kwon's lawyers, Bloomberg reported that a higher court had later annulled the decision. The Basic Court of Podgorica confirmed to CoinDesk the high court's decision, and that it had received the agreed payment of 400,000 euros ($428,000) from Kwon on May 17. Following the High Court ruling, the Basic Court has decided to extend Kwon's detention.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows smaller tokens like decentralized GPU-based rendering solution Render Network's RNDR, and ARPA, the native token of privacy-preserving computation network ARPA Chain, outperformed market leaders by a big margin in the week ended May 23.  RNDR has perhaps benefitted from speculation that Apple's virtual reality headset will utilize its decentralized graphics processing network.  APRA Chain's impending mainnet launch, reportedly due in June, seems to have galvanized investor interest in the native cryptocurrency.

42410590,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfmz0,1685014955,Bitcoin Options Market Signals Weakness over 6 Months Amid Debt Ceiling Drama,"Bitcoin's (BTC) options market is showing bias for weakness over six months for the first time since early March as the U.S. debt ceiling drama continues.  The six-month call-put skew, which measures the difference between what investors are willing to pay for bullish calls and bearish puts expiring in 180 days, has declined to -1, the lowest since March 13, according to data from leading crypto options exchange Deribit, tracked by Amberdata.  Puts refer to a type of option that increases in value as prices of the underlying asset fall. This gives their holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a predetermined date at a specific price, effectively allowing them to bet against whichever asset that put option tracks.  The one-week, one- and three-month skews also show bias for puts. The development is consistent with the recent flows in the S&P 500 market that show traders paying up for put volatility.  Perhaps traders in crypto and traditional markets are starting to hedge against the U.S. debt ceiling risks, considering Congress is struggling to raise the $31.4 trillion borrowing limit with less than a week until the government runs out of money to meet obligations.  The escalating uncertainty over debt ceiling negotiations has also hit the bond market, where the one-month yield has risen to a record high above 6%, data from charting platform TradingView shows. Rating agency Fitch has put U.S. on credit watch for a possible downgrade amid the debt ceiling impasse.  The 10-year yield has jumped by over 30 basis points to 3.76% this month, reaching the highest in over two months. The U.S. dollar has picked up a haven bid, pushing the dollar index above 104.00, a 10% monthly appreciation. Bitcoin has dropped 10% to $26,260 this month.  The minutes of Federal Reserve's early May meeting released Wednesday have firmed up expectations for another interest rate hike next month, according to ING.  ""Macro still dominates,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said in a note to clients on Thursday.  Per Thielen, crypto investors should closely track the 10-year Treasury yield.  ""On May 15, 2023, the 10-year treasury yields climbed back above 3.5% and since then, bitcoin prices have declined by 1,000 points. Investors should now patiently wait until the yields are losing their upside momentum before they buy crypto again,"" Thielen said.

Interest income, Coinbase's largest growth segment, is likely to be lower due to ongoing USDC redemptions. Coinbase has been a net loser in ETH staking flow following the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade. On May 4th, Coinbase ( COIN ) reported a surprisingly decent earnings update highlighting performance in the first quarter of 2023. Coinbase's net revenue increased 22% sequentially to $736 million and the company simultaneously reduced recurring opex by 37%. Despite those efforts, Coinbase still generated a net loss of $79 million in the period: Data by YCharts Net loss aside, Coinbase just had its best quarter since the crypto market top back in Q4 2021 and I think it's worth examining how the company's revenue generation story has adapted over the last 18 months. Revenue Breakout Revenue (Millions USD) Q1-22 Q2-22 Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 Total Transaction Revenue 1,013.0 655.2 365.9 322.1 374.7 Total Subscription & Service Revenue 151.9 147.4 210.5 282.8 361.7 Net Revenue 1,164.9 802.6 576.4 604.9 736.4 Source: Coinbase Coinbase breaks revenue out into two main categories consisting of transaction revenue and revenue from subscriptions and services. Transaction revenue is broken out into institutional and retail customer buckets. Subscription and service revenue is broken out a bit further: Blockchain rewards Custodial fee revenue Interest income Other The combined revenue growth from those four segments has quickly pushed the subscription and services category from just 13% of total revenue in Q1 2023 to over 49% as of the last quarter. This has been driven mainly by interest income earned from a USD Coin (USDC-USD) revenue sharing agreement with token issuer Circle. Subs & Service Revenue (millions) Q1-22 Q2-22 Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 Blockchain rewards 81.9 68.4 62.8 62.4 73.7 Custodial Fee Rev 31.7 22.2 14.5 11.4 17.0 Interest income 10.5 32.5 101.8 182.2 240.8 Other Sub & Service Rev 27.8 24.3 31.4 26.7 30.1 Total Subscription & Service Revenue 151.9 147.4 210.5 282.8 361.7 Source: Coinbase At just under $241 million in quarterly revenue, a third of the Coinbase's total Q1 revenue came from interest income. At $74 million, blockchain rewards have also been a significant sequential revenue growth driver quarter over quarter. Projecting Q2 Revenue On the last call , CFO Alesia Haas mentioned just $110 million in April transaction revenue and cautioned using that as a baseline for projecting category revenue for the remainder of the quarter. However, the month to date indications from May transaction volume don't look positive. According to data from The Block, May is on pace to be the industry's lowest transaction volume month since October 2020: Monthly Exchange Volume (The Block) Using margin estimates from April's $34.8 billion in transaction volume, Coinbase currently has approximately $65 million in May transaction revenue heading into a holiday weekend at the end of the month: Millions Volume Revenue April $34,800 $110 May* $20,300 $65 June** $27,550 $88 Sources: Coinbase, The Block, *Through May 24th, **Author's estimates If we average April and May to project June figures, Coinbase's transaction revenue for the second quarter is pacing just over $263 million. On the call, Haas was willing to give more concrete guidance on the subscriptions and services revenue category. There the company is guiding for $300 million this quarter and attributes the sequential decline from $361.2 million to activity in the stablecoin market: This decline is largely driven by USDC market cap which fell 23% in April from the Q1 average levels directly correlated with the banking crisis. That decline has since continued 4% lower from the $30.4 billion end of April market cap to $29.2 billion as of article submission (blue line below is USDC): Stablecoin market caps (Defi Llama) Furthermore, blockchain rewards could possibly be a smaller driver of revenue going forward as well. Despite the approximate 2 million ETH inflow following Ethereum's (ETH-USD) Shanghai upgrade , Coinbase is suffering the second largest net outflow from ETH staking behind only Kraken: Entity (ETH) Inflow Principal Outflow Rewards Outflow Net Flow Kraken 106,560 -562,783 -115,127 -571,350 Coinbase 257,824 -316,064 -164,255 -222,494 Huobi 32,448 -59,616 -11,417 -38,585 stakefish 32,416 -25,248 -24,515 -17,347 Stkr (Ankr) 32 -10,522 -5,865 -16,355 Source: Dune Analytics/Hildobby, as of 5/23/23 This reduction in aggregate ETH staking may be partially offset by the US dollar denominated increase in the price of ETH over the last several weeks: Data by YCharts However, even we project a flat quarter in rewards revenue and take the $300 million from the company's subscription & service revenue guidance as the right estimate, we still get to just $563 million in Q2 revenue given the expected decline in revenue from transaction volumes. But I have to caution that estimate is assuming June volume is larger than May and that might be overly optimistic given the macro environment. Frankly, even Coinbase's $300 million subscription and service revenue guidance might be optimistic. Circle's treasury holdings mature at the end of May. To what degree USDC is monetized going forward isn't exactly clear as the US debt ceiling showdown continues. Risks I detailed some of the regulatory implications from the Wells Notice Coinbase received in a previous article for Seeking Alpha. I won't make those same arguments here beyond simply acknowledging the crypto market in general is experiencing outflow. The regulatory climate domestically continues to be a major headwind for US-based businesses within the industry. Despite putting up a fight in the courts, Coinbase won't be immune from that. The company is projecting technology and development and general and administrative expenses will be between $600 million and $650 million in the second quarter. Q2 Guidance (Coinbase) A large portion of that expense continues to be stock-based compensation and the company isn't guiding for any further head count reduction this quarter that could potentially mitigate some of that. Furthermore, sales and marketing expense will increase sequentially. This is coupled with what is almost certainly going to be a dramatic reduction in revenue from Q1 to Q2. Summary Q1 was a solid quarter for Coinbase. The company still lost a lot of money but it was much less than during the previous four quarters. The company grew cash and investments over Q4 but it's difficult for me to see that continue given what I believe will be another 9-figure loss in Q2. Coinbase is an important business in the crypto industry but it's a fish swimming upstream at the moment. I expect Q2 revenue to decline between 20-25% sequentially. In my view, it's difficult to justify going long in this environment.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4607258-coinbase-q2-going-to-be-rough?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12909233.jpeg

The Luban hard fork incorporates three different Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Evolution Proposals (BEPs): BEP-126, BEP-174 and BEP-221, which cumulatively aim to make the network faster and more secure for users.  BEP-126 introduces the “Fast Finality” mechanism, which makes it impossible for a block to be reversed once it is finalized on the network. This reduces the possibility of a chain reorganization by bad actors, if that situation ever arises.  Blocks refer to data within the blockchains where transactional data is permanently recorded and secured by cryptography. These are finalized by network entities called validators, and can theoretically be reserved if a majority of those validators collude and decide to revert to a data point in the past.  BEP-174 brings forth a “Cross Chain Relayer Management,” which aims to mitigate any potential security issues in the BSC Bridge. Attacks on bridges were the biggest security threat in the crypto sector in 2022 – making this a critical area to deploy solutions.  Relayers are on-chain messengers who help transfer tokens between different blockchains via bridges, playing an important role in ensuring that such transactions are completed smoothly. These relayers are typically whitelisted entities that currently need to be manually added in a complex process.  However, BEP-174 will introduce “managers” for relayers that are selected by on-chain governance. These managers would be responsible for managing the registration of individual relayers in a way that makes it easy to remove or add any relayer during a potential time of crisis.  Lastly, BEP-221 brings forth the “CometBFT Light Block Validation,” a system that proposes adding a new contract to blockchains that use CometBFT technology.  This contract helps verify specific blocks from other CometBFT-compatible blockchains and enables the transfer of data between those blockchains, such as the storage-focused BNB Greenfield, and the BNB Chain.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB | FORKS,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/25/bnb-chain-expected-to-undergo-luban-upgrade-in-june-heres-all-you-need-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cb02ef38ee45b0a5f6dcb5d71c2ab324d777288-6016x4016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the new Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) set to take effect within the bloc in 2024, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), chaired by EU central bank chief Christine Lagarde, warned in a Thursday report of the risks of crypto lending and staking, and of high leverage in digital asset markets.  Under one policy option, “DeFi developers could be required to abide by specific regulations covering the design and creation of smart contracts,” the report said. It floats the possibility of mandatory code audits, pharmaceutical-style intellectual property restrictions, and rules for the “oracles” that transmit real-world data to automated software.  While MiCA sets governance, licensing and reserve requirements for players such as wallet providers and stablecoin issuers, it leaves out areas such as crypto lending and staking – though the report warns those areas can pose “significant risks to consumers.”  Companies will have to manage conflicts of interest between their business lines under MiCA – but, the ESRB said, there’s no overarching requirement to identify and mitigate the operational or reputational risks that might mount up from offering services like trading and custody.  “Taking account of any market developments, and experience acquired with the application of MiCA, the activity of crypto-asset conglomerates in the EU should be studied,” the report said, citing existing payment laws that mean supervisors can force risky services to divest to a separate subsidiary.  “While this past year has been turbulent for crypto-assets and DeFi, systemic implications have not materialized,” the report said, adding that “exponential growth dynamics” could mean future upsets may pose a major threat similar to the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.

ExpressVPN and NordVPN are two of those standouts . Read our full ExpressVPN review and NordVPN review if you’re looking for a deep-dive into each service. In this ExpressVPN vs NordVPN article, we’ll be comparing these two quality services head-to-head to help you decide which is the best option for your particular needs and circumstances. NordVPN and ExpressVPN are always in our top 5 best VPNs in every category. There is a reason for this, they never stop innovating and improving. However, in a head-to-head comparison which one comes out on top? ExpressVPN or NordVPN – Which one is the best? Note: There is intense competition in the VPN space. Details like average download speeds, numbers of servers in the network, and specific features change frequently. The information in this report was current at the time of writing. Get ExpressVPN Get NordVPN Introducing the Contenders Here’s a really quick introduction to the two VPNs we are looking at in this article: ExpressVPN ExpressVPN is a premium no-logs VPN at a premium price. Based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), ExpressVPN is known for state-of-the-art features, top-notch encryption, high performance, and excellent customer support. Frequently touted as the best VPN , ExpressVPN supports the Windows, Mac, and Linux desktop operating systems, along with the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, including the iPhone . They also have browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. Beyond this, ExpressVPN can run on many different routers and assorted other devices , such as routers, tablets, games consoles such as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and even e-readers like the Barnes & Noble Nood HD and Amazon’s Kindle. ExpressVPN guarantees access to streaming services such as Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu, and also sports streaming channels from around the world such as ESPN, SkySports, and European channels such as BBC and ITV. There are recent reports that Netflix works perfectly with ExpressVPN and that you even unblock US shows from other countries by choosing a USA IP within ExpressVPN. More recently, Express VPN ‘s A irc ove router has been met with great reviews for its built – in VPN , intuitive interface, and easy setup . The company regularly listens to customer feedback and is always working to improve the product . Recently , they have released a list of 6 new features and improvements that are designed to make the A irc ove router even better . ExpressVPN Supported Devices Get ExpressVPN NordVPN NordVPN is a quality no-logs VPN service with very attractive pricing on multi-year subscriptions. Based in Panama, they are known for top-notch encryption, strong privacy and security protections, and a generous connection policy. NordVPN supports the Windows, Mac, and Linux desktop operating systems, along with the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. They also have browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. Beyond this, NordVPN can run on Android TV, many different routers and other devices, including Raspberry Pi. NordVPN also provide access to a huge number of streaming services, which includes Netflix , Amazon Prime, BBC iPlayer, and more. If you have many devices on many different operating systems then NordVPN has you covered. NordVPN Supported Devices Get NordVPN How We Compared Them We compared these two great services using the following criteria: Speed – Which one is the fastest head to head? Security and Privacy – One of our top criteria: do they keep logs? is there any DNS leaks? And so on. Geographic and Legal Considerations – Another very important criteria, are they based in a country which would force them to give up data, or would actively spy on them? Global Coverage – Do they have enough servers in different countries and regions? Streaming and Torrenting – Do they allow streaming and torrenting, which is a important feature for many users. Connections, Price, and Value – How does the price compare vs others in the space Customer Support – If something goes wrong, can you expect them to fix it quickly? Ready? Let’s start. Speed Source: Shutterstock.com Testing the speed of a VPN is difficult. There are so many variables to take into account. Some factors that can affect the results include: The location of the computer doing the testing The location of the VPN server (or servers) being tested The time of day The type of data used in the test Happily, in 2018 AV-TEST GmbH published its VPN Comparative Test report. This report was commissioned by AnchorFree, the publisher of HotSpot Shield Elite. For this test, they compared 12 VPNs, including both NordVPN and ExpressVPN. In these tests, both NordVPN and ExpressVPN scored well for latency and download speed. NordVPN also did well on upload speed, with ExpressVPN several percent behind. See page 10 of the report for the full performance breakdown. While neither of these VPNs are the fastest in the world, they are both better than average performers that should be adequate for any use. Update June 2020 – With the release of NordLYNX we can finally say that NordVPN is the fastest VPN around. They have managed to hack Wireguard to make it perform at amazing speeds that are faster than OpenVPN. At the same time they have also managed to do it while getting around privacy issues associated with using Wireguard. Well done NordVPN, very impressive. Security and Privacy Privacy and Security – Source: Shutterstock.com How well they protect your security and privacy are two of the key things to look for in a VPN. Let’s look at how these two products stack up. Security and Privacy Technology Both of these products offer high-end encryption technology and the industry-standard OpenVPN protocol. They both protect against IP and DNS leaks. Recently NordVPN made some big advances in both speed and security by releasing NordLynx which is built using wireguard and NordVPN’s own NAT (Network Address Translation) system. Basically this means that it is even faster than before, but with all the same security and privacy features we have come to expect. According to Nordvpn, it is the fastest VPN protocol they have ever used. While ExpressVPN is secure against WebRTC leaks, NordVPN did sometimes leak during the 2018 AV-TEST testing program. Based on this blog post , NordVPN seems to have the WebRTC leak issue under control now. ExpressVPN does have a big advantage over NordVPN when it comes to Kill Switch technology. Network Lock is ExpressVPN’s Kill Switch. When triggered by a problem with the connection to the VPN network, Network Lock blocks prevent any traffic from entering or leaving your device. Network Lock is enabled automatically when you launch the VPN client. By automatically blocking all traffic to and from your device, ExpressVPN prevents your real IP Address from being exposed. NordVPN Kill Switch technology doesn’t protect your privacy, as well as Network Lock, does. Instead of blocking all message traffic, NordVPN shuts down applications you specify when the VPN connection is lost. The NordVPN team recognizes the limitations of this approach and are working on a solution that will shut down all communication automatically. ExpressVPN is definitely ahead in this area for now. Privacy Policies & Confirmation of No-Logs Status Both of these services have solid “ no-logs ” policies. There is some controversy over the use of the term “ no-logs ” because all VPNs have to keep some logs to function properly. Perhaps the best thing to do is to treat, “ no-logs ” as short for, “ no connection or activity logs that could be used to connect a specific user to specific activities .” Using this definition, both ExpressVPN and NordVPN are confirmed as no-logs VPNs. This was shown for ExpressVPN in 2017 when the Turkish government tried to get user data from them. ExpressVPN – “The best anonymous VPN protection” After the company refused to cooperate with Turkish authorities because it felt the Turks had no jurisdiction over them, the Turkish police raided the data center and seized the server. Even with the server in hand, the authorities were unable to get any useful information since ExpressVPN doesn’t log that information. NordVPN took a more proactive approach to confirm its no-logs status. In 2018, they engaged PriceWaterhouseCoopers AG to audit their claim. According to this post in the NordVPN blog: “The auditors’ goal was to see if our service lives up to our claims of providing a no-logs VPN service, and we believe we’ve passed the test.” NordVPN – “5 reasons why NordVPN is the best service for privacy” While we do not have access to the results of the audit, we have not seen anything that contradicts NordVPN’s claim of providing a no-logs VPN service. NordVPN passed a second audit in June 2020, again commissioned by third-party assurance firm PwC Switzerland, which confirmed a second time that NordVPN never kept user information on file. Call this one a tie, with both services ranking near the top among all VPNs when it comes to protecting your privacy. Geographic and Legal Considerations Source: Shutterstock.com While we seldom think about real-world geography when doing things online, geographic considerations are important when it comes to your VPN. There are several reasons why this is so. They include: Legal Jurisdiction: Source: Shutterstock.com Where a VPN service is located determines whose laws they are governed by. ExpressVPN is located in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), while NordVPN is located in Panama. Neither of these countries imposes any mandatory data retention policies on VPN services. However, because the BVI is part of the British Commonwealth, there is some small chance they could be pressured into applying England’s policies. Those policies are not privacy-friendly at all. In the meantime, Panama is a privacy-friendly jurisdiction but imposed an extremely strict copyright law in 2012. This law can result in huge (as in $100,000 US dollars huge) fines for downloading copyrighted material. In theory, the government could someday pressure NordVPN to log user activity in an attempt to collect more fines from their citizens. A good way to reduce the risk that you will be affected by jurisdictional issues is to never use a VPN based in your home country. The odds of a country going after a non-citizen for violating local laws are far smaller than for a citizen. Neither of these services is legally located on United States territory, which provides a little protection against US government snooping. But it is probably best not to use a VPN server that is physically located on US territory since that makes the data on that server subject to US surveillance laws. Physical Distance: Source: Shutterstock.com When you use VPN signals travel back and forth between your computer and the particular VPN server you are using. The further apart these are physically, the longer it takes to pass information back and forth. Using a VPN with servers located physically close to you allows you to minimize this delay. Each of these services has thousands of servers distributed across dozens of countries around the world. You should be able to connect to a VPN server close to you or to the website or other resources you want to view, thereby minimizing the impact of this factor. Censorship and Surveillance: Source: Shutterstock.com In some countries the government censors news and information that it doesn’t want the local populace to see. In other countries, you may not be prevented from viewing certain content, but the police and intelligence agencies watch everything you do. No good can possibly come of the government recording your actions for future use. To minimize the risks of this, it is best to avoid using a VPN service that is based in your home country. Call this one a tie as well. Global Coverage In general, you want your VPN service to have as many servers as possible, located in as many different countries as possible. This gives you the most options for access to content that might be geo-blocked. Results are mixed on this one. While these numbers fluctuate, ExpressVPN has servers in far more countries, but NordVPN has far more servers overall. Number of Countries Number of Servers ExpressVPN 94 3,000+ NordVPN 60 5,200+ Further complicating things, both services provide multiple server locations within specific countries. For example, NordVPN has over 1,800 servers in the USA, spread across 20 locations. NordVPN Server Locations USA ExpressVPN has its USA servers spread across 32 locations. ExpressVPN Server Locations USA To add yet another layer of confusion to what once seemed simple, not all servers are the same. Both services offer general-purpose servers. But they also offer servers that are optimized for specific protocols, for torrenting (P2P), for people who need a dedicated IP Address, and so on. Users can choose an IP from a wide selection of countries, meaning they can access geo-locked services such as streaming, gaming, or using a Bitcoin casino . What’s the final call? If you are a general VPN user, both of these services provide thousands of servers spread across the countries you are most likely to be interested in. If you have specialized VPN needs you will need to contact the support team at each company. Alternately, you can investigate their server locations and capabilities yourself. To see what servers ExpressVPN has to offer, start here . To see what NordVPN has to offer, start here . Get ExpressVPN Get NordVPN Streaming and Torrenting The first thing that people look for when talking about streaming and torrenting is the speed of the VPN. Both ExpressVPN and NordVPN are generally fast enough for this, in that they both provide fast connections, with no bandwidth limits or throttling. They are both frequently referenced as the best VPN for torrenting . ExpressVPN – “Use a uTorrent VPN for safe, fast downloading” According to the 2018 AV-TEST GmbH report, both were far faster for torrenting than most VPNs tested, with NordVPN just slightly the faster of the two (see page 13 of the report). NordVPN was also faster when it came to streaming, although the difference in speed was only about 1% (page 12). But things can quickly get complicated. How you connect to the source of the content you want to download is one factor. If you connect using a VPN server that is physically further from the source than you are, it can slow things down. If you use one of your VPN’s servers that are optimized for streaming, it can speed things up (relative to an unoptimized server). NordVPN – “Best VPN for streaming” In some rare cases, using one of these VPNs may even speed up your connection when streaming. Sometimes ISPs will throttle your connection to streaming services to reduce the load on their network, or even completely block certain sites due to local laws. In these cases, the encryption provided by the VPN may let you avoid this throttling and deliver higher downloads speeds than otherwise. Speed Isn’t Everything While speed is important for streaming and torrenting, it is not the only consideration. When torrenting in particular, you want to be sure that your VPN will never expose your real IP Address. Both of these VPNs have you covered here. With their automatic kill switches and IP leak protection, a glitch might kill your download, but it won’t expose your identity. Both NordVPN and ExpressVPN have proven over time that they can unblock Netflix. Netflix goes to great lengths to try to force you to use the Netflix library assigned to your physical location. Use NordVPN or ExpressVPN to unblock Netflix – Source: Shutterstock.com In other words, if Netflix thinks you are in the UK for example, it will try to force you to use Netflix UK, and block you from using logging into your Netflix US account. While this kind of blocking may serve Netflix’s contractual obligations to their content providers, it only makes your life more difficult. You may have a paid subscription to Netflix US, but if they think you are in the UK right now, they are going to try to force you to watch only Netflix UK. And pay for that too! ExpressVPN – How to watch Netflix with a VPN in 2023 In their ongoing war with Netflix, both of our contenders have generally done a good job of getting past the blocks Netflix tries to impose. If you log into a server located in the USA (continuing our example from a moment ago), both of our VPN services do some techno trickery to convince Netflix that you are in the USA, so you can log into the account you pay for. In other words, while we can’t give you hard numbers or 100% guarantees, we believe you will find both of these VPN services to be fast enough for streaming or torrenting, good enough at getting past blocks to give you the access you want, and secure enough to protect your identity while doing so. NordVPN – “Enjoy the internet with no restrictions” Connections, Price, and Value While all the technical details we’ve looked at are important, they aren’t the only things to consider when choosing a VPN. Let’s look at three more characteristics that could help you choose between ExpressVPN or NordVPN. Connections These days, most of us have several devices that we want to protect with a VPN. At a minimum, a computer and a smartphone. Or maybe two computers. And what about the rest of the family? It is easy to see how the need for connections can multiply. NordVPN – Connect up to 6 devices with 1 account VPN services normally place a limit on the number of simultaneous connections they allow. You can have the VPN client installed on any number of devices. But only a certain number of them are allowed to connect to the VPN at any one time. ExpressVPN gives you five (5) simultaneous connections. NordVPN gives you six (6) simultaneous connections. Assuming you have a need for more than 5 simultaneous connections, NordVPN offers one more so that might work better for you. ExpressVPN – 1 Subscription. 5 Devices What about running the VPN on your router? But what if you need more than 5 simultaneous connections and you prefer ExpressVPN? Or what if you need more than 6 simultaneous connections? If your router runs the VPN software, then every device connected to the router will automatically be connected. Both NordVPN and ExpressVPN have apps that can be installed on routers. Not all models of routers are supported by either company and setting this up is more complicated than installing the VPN app on your computer or phone. If you want to explore this further, follow these links: NordVPN router instructions ExpressVPN router instructions Unless you are willing and able to install VPN software on your router, give NordVPN the win for this feature. Price Price is another area where NordVPN tends to lead ExpressVPN. Here are their prices as of 2023: NordVPN Pricing ExpressVPN Pricing As you can see, while their pricing models don’t match exactly, for 1-year and longer plans, NordVPN is significantly less expensive than ExpressVPN. It might seem risky to sign up for NordVPN’s multi-year plans to get the lowest price, but try running the numbers. NordVPN is definitely the less expensive option. Note: Both NordVPN and ExpressVPN offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so you can test them out for a bit without being locked in. Interestingly, in March 2023, NordVPN made its Meshnet private tunnel feature available for free to all users, regardless of whether or not they have a subscription. It initially launched Meshnet as a paid feature in June 2022. It allows users to establish secure, encrypted tunnels between trusted devices for network traffic, essentially allowing them to create their own VPN (virtual private network) servers. Value We can’t give you a definitive answer for this one. With a lower price and double the number of connections, NordVPN looks like the better value. But that assumes that all other factors are equal. As we’ve seen throughout this article, while these services are similar, they each have unique characteristics that may make one or the other more suitable for your particular situation. You’ll need to do that evaluation yourself. What we can say is that both of these are quality VPN services, and for typical usage patterns (browsing the web, streaming content) both offer good value. If you are on a budget, or you want a cost effective and cheap way to cover the entire family’s devices, then NordVPN is a clear winner on price, costing just a fraction of ExpressVPN over a longer subscription period. Get ExpressVPN Get NordVPN Customer Support NordVPN and ExressVPN customer support – Source: Shutterstock.com While you hope to never need it, the odds are good that at some point you will need to contact customer support. When you do, you’ll be glad to know that both NordVPN and ExpressVPN offer a full range of support options. But which is best out of ExpressVPN vs NordVPN? We’re talking about 24/7 support with: Live Chat Email Knowledge Base FAQ NordVPN also have a special email address for business users, so if you need a VPN to cover a whole office or your business computing infrastructure, you can get put through to a specialist team straight away. This service is called ‘ NordVPN Teams ‘, and it offers a number of cost effective ways to cover your work communications. While we haven’t used either service’s Customer Support very much, both teams have a good reputation. We would rank them both to be better than practically any other VPN support team. ExpressVPN vs NordVPN – Which Should You Choose? There isn’t a clear-cut winner here. As we’ve seen, there are only a few areas where one of these services is clearly better than the other. So what we’ve done here is put together two tables. One idea would be to use the NordVPN VPN Speed Comparison Tool, which is currently hosted on Github , to check which VPN works the fastest for you. The tool is available free of charge to the public and offers reports which include the median download speed results, the arithmetic mean, median winner, and more. One summarizes the case for choosing ExpressVPN over NordVPN and the other summarizes the case for choosing NordVPN over ExpressVPN. The Case For and Against ExpressVPN vs NordVPN For Against Premium reputation Premium price Better Kill Switch than NordVPN Thousands of fewer servers than NordVPN No WebRTC leaks Based in BVI, part of the British Commonwealth Servers in more countries than NordVPN Five (5) connections per subscription Turkish court case confirmed No-Logs VPN claim That’s the case for and against ExpressVPN . Now let’s flip things around and look at the case for and against NordVPN. The Case For and Against NordVPN over ExpressVPN For Against Outside auditor confirmed No-Logs VPN claim Kill Switch needs to be updated Low price than ExpressVPN Servers in fewer countries than ExpressVPN Thousands of more servers than ExpressVPN Reported WebRTC leaks (fix being developed) Six (6) connections per subscription You now have all the information you need to choose between the two services. If you are still not sure, remember that both offer 30-day money-back guarantees. Install the one that looks best to you and try it out for a few weeks. If you are happy with your choice, perfect. If you are not happy with your initial choice, grab the refund and install the other VPN. Since these are both quality products, one or the other of them will almost certainly satisfy you.

42410600,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdfnSl,1685002706,Lawyers Challenging U.S. Tornado Cash Sanctions Say Free Speech Is at Stake,"Are smart contracts property? Are holders of a protocol’s token members of an unincorporated association? Is banning open-source software an attack on free speech?  Those are the questions before a U.S. court in Austin, Texas, as a lawsuit from a group of crypto engineers and investors in response to sanctions placed on the Tornado Cash protocol comes closer to having its day in court.  In a court filing from late Wednesday, the plaintiffs argued that the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctions against the privacy protocol violates the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by failing to correctly identify a foreign ""national"" and ""property"" related to Tornado Cash, and by not demonstrating sanctionable interest in immutable, open-source smart contracts.  “The Department has failed to establish that the immutable smart contracts can be owned,” the filing reads.  They also argue that the Treasury's definition of Tornado Cash as an unincorporated association does not meet the test for such an association.  “There is nothing in the record to suggest that those token-holders have combined to execute the supposed 'common purpose' of operating, promoting, or updating the Tornado Cash privacy protocol,” the filing said.  Should the Treasury's actions be authorized, the defendants argue that it would infringe on the First Amendment due to its broad nature.  “The Department's action violates the First Amendment's free speech clause as it prohibits Plaintiffs and thousands of other law-abiding American citizens from interacting with open-source code to engage in a wide range of speech protected by the First Amendment,” reads the docket.  While Tornado Cash is usually the tool of choice for hackers to obfuscate their gains such as with the hack of Crypto.com last January or the Transit Finance hack, law enforcement experts have previously cautioned that this doesn’t necessarily make it complicit in money laundering.  In the court filing, the plaintiffs argue that the evidence Tornado Cash is a tool for money laundering is “weak,” noting that the Treasury has only given “three examples of money laundering have been found from millions of transactions.”  Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev continues to face a trial over money laundering allegations. On Wednesday, Pertsev won the right to cross-examine blockchain analytics company Chainalysis which is often cited as a source of on-chain evidence during court cases.  Tornado Cash’s DAO was recently the victim of a vote fraud attack, and the attacker has begun to move their proceeds via Tornado Cash.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/25/lawyers-challenging-us-tornado-cash-sanctions-say-free-speech-is-at-stake,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09f79c245230f54e2ce75e7e8b5a55dd39c14682-4543x3407.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although the Basic Court in the country's capital Podgorica had initially accepted a bail proposal from Kwon's lawyers, Bloomberg reported that a high court had annulled the decision on Wednesday.  In a statement, the Basic Court of Podgorica confirmed to CoinDesk the high court's decision, and that it had received the agreed payment of 400,000 euros ($428,000) from Kwon on May 17.  The High Court decided against the bail approval after it found the Basic Court did not sufficiently assess the the value of the defendant's property, saying the lower court could not accept the value of defendants' property ""based on their statements, but only concrete evidence,"" that was, in this instant, not in the case files.  Following the High Court ruling, the Basic Court has decided to extend Kwon's detention.  ""In the renewed proceedings, the court will proceed according to the High Court's grounds for termination and after that make a decision based on the proposal of the defense counsel for the defendants to accept bail,"" the court said.  Kwon, along with former Terra executive Han Chang-joon, will be due in court for their next hearing on June 16.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value has declined by 10% to $26,200 this month, thanks to renewed hawkish Fed bets, the recovery in the dollar index, and the lingering U.S. debt ceiling uncertainty.  Per Valkyrie, a further decline toward $24,000 may be seen as bitcoin's daily chart Ichimoku cloud, a momentum indicator, has flipped bearish.  Japanese journalist Goichi Hosada created the Ichimoku Cloud in the late 1960s. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K) and a lagging closing price line.  The difference between Leading Span A and B makes up the cloud, which is used to identify broader trends. A bullish cloud is green, while a bearish one is red. Crossovers of Tenkan-Sen, a nine-day price mid-point, and Kijun-Sen, a 26-day price mid-point, are used to identify short-term trading signals.  The chart below shows a green Ichimoku cloud, indicating a constructive broader outlook. However, the cryptocurrency's price has recently fallen back into the cloud, and the Tenkan-Sen (blue line) has crossed below the Kijun-Sen (red line), confirming a bearish crossover.  ""This suggests an ongoing high-timeframe bullish trend with a decline in bullish momentum and the potential for near-term retrenchment,"" analysts at Valkyrie, led by Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.  The early March bitcoin pullback ran out of steam at the lower end of the cloud, with the subsequent bounce taking prices to $31,000 by mid-April.  ""A price close within the cloud is suggestive of losing cloud support and triggers the possibility of traversing to the opposite [lower] edge of the cloud.

Addresses tied to the attacker moved 100 ether (ETH) and 38,000 torn (TORN) tokens in two transactions using the Tornado Cash protocol on Wednesday night, Etherscan data shows.  The DAO handling the privacy-focused crypto mixer's operations, funds and future plans was taken over by an unidentified attacker, or attackers, on Saturday.  The attacker holds over 20 ether ($35,684) in their wallet, and continues to have access to potentially all of Tornado Cash’s treasury funds.  The attacker floated a malicious proposal that hid a code function that granted them fake votes that can now be used to handle some aspects of Tornado Cash, such as torn tokens held in the main governance contract or withdrawal of locked torn tokens.  DAOs, short for decentralized autonomous organizations, allow token holders to lock up their holdings as votes for proposing changes to a project. These changes can range from deploying treasury funds to purposes that benefit the project to expansion on other networks.  The attack does not impact the actual Tornado Cash protocol – which allows users to pass funds through the service to mask or obscure the movements of funds and crypto addresses. This attack was not an exploit of any smart contracts or technology related to the working of Tornado Cash.  As such, there’s still hope for Tornado Cash.  The attacker floated a proposal to revert all malicious changes before the takeover earlier this week – sending torn prices up 10% at the time.  The proposal looks as though it will pass when voting closes on May 26, though it's unclear when the action will be executed.

LUCIE, a prominent Shiba Inu (SHIB) community influencer and a member of the SHIB marketing team, recently took to Twitter to share insights and predictions regarding the highly anticipated mainnet launch of Shibarium, the upcoming layer-2 scaling solution for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. In an attempt to address the persistent speculation and questions surrounding the launch date, LUCIE provided valuable information about the estimated timeline and emphasized the team’s commitment to delivering a secure and sustainable platform. LUCIE’s personal estimate aligns with that of Shytoshi Kusama, the community-appointed Shiba Inu project lead, who forecasted a July launch. However, Shibarium1, an anonymous yet prominent Shibarium developer, made a projection of August. https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1661306086438084608 Based on these inputs, LUCIE clarified that the team’s official estimate for the Shibarium mainnet launch is set for the second to the third quarter of 2023. ""Stop saying you don't have an estimated time. You do!!! Q2 -Q3 2023,"" she emphasized in an attempt to address the prevailing uncertainty. According to LUCIE, the Shiba Inu development team is confident about the progress of Shibarium, with multiple dedicated teams working on its development, including a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) integration. This statement aimed to clarify and discourage the spread of inaccurate information among Shiba Inu enthusiasts regarding the launch date. However, LUCIE also acknowledged that unforeseen complications during the testing phase could potentially extend the timeline. Shibarium Developer Confirms Launch Moreover, Shibarium1, who made a projection of August, recently disclosed that the launch was closer than the community expects, as The Crypto Basic previously reported . In a Discord chat, the admin noted that things were going fine with the development process and that the teams were accelerating the release time. He added that they have not encountered any issues yet within the testing stages. Ultimately, as Shiba Inu's popularity continues to soar, the successful rollout of Shibarium is crucial for further growth and development.

The group will acquire Celsius’s institutional loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrencies, mining unit and additional alternative investments, and must pay a deposit of $10 million within three days to cement the deal, court filings show.  Fahrenheit, a consortium of buyers that includes venture capital firm Arrington Capital and miner US Bitcoin Corp, was selected as successful bidder following a lengthy auction process.  The Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium, which includes Van Eck Absolute Return Advisers Corporation and GXD Labs LLC, was selected as backup, with rival bidder NovaWulf – at one stage the firm favorite – losing out.  Under the terms of the deal, the new company will get between $450 and $500 million in liquid cryptocurrency, and US Bitcoin Corp will construct a range of crypto mining facilities including a new 100 megawatt plant.  The bid, though accepted by Celsius and a committee of its creditors, must still be approved by regulators to finalize the acquisition. Months ago, Bankruptcy Court Judge Martin Glenn warned “regulatory roadblocks” could plague the sale of Celsius much like it thwarted a fellow lender’s acquisition. In April, crypto exchange Binance.US abruptly terminated its purchase of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager’s $1 billion in assets after federal officials appealed the sale, citing the ""hostile and uncertain regulatory climate"" in the U.S.  Celsius filed for bankruptcy last July after cratering crypto prices triggered a bank-run style rush of withdrawals that exposed the platform’s profound liquidity issues. The exchange’s implosion was a harbinger of things to come for the crypto industry, which later saw the collapse of several other high profile crypto exchanges, lenders and venture capital firms that plunged the industry into a deep winter.

The price is now trading below $19.80 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $19.90 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could recover but upsides might be limited above $20. Solana Price Extends Losses This past week, Solana’s price started a fresh decline from well above $21. SOL gained bearish momentum and was able to trade below the $20.50 support. The bears gained strength and pushed the price below the $20 support. The price is now showing bearish signs below $20, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. A low is formed near $18.70 and the price is now consolidating losses. SOL is now trading below $19.80 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $19.90 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $19.80 level and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $20 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $21.51 swing high to the $18.70 low. The main resistance is now forming near the $20.50 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $21.51 swing high to the $18.70 low is also near $20.50. A close above the $20.50 level could resend the price toward the $21.50 resistance zone. Any more gains might send the price toward the $22 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to clear the $20.50 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $19.00 level. The first major support is near the $18.80 level, below which the bears might gain strength. In the stated case, Solana price may perhaps decline toward the $18.20 support.

As Florida’s governor, he signed legislation prohibiting the use of central bank digital currencies within the state (although some lawyers question if the law does what it says).  “I just do not have the itch to have to control everything that people may be doing in this space,” he said. “Bitcoin represents a threat to them, they’re trying to regulate it out of existence.”  During the interview, DeSantis insisted on Congressional authorization for a CBDC, vowing to avoid it during his potential presidency, due to concerns over its potential misuse to influence politically unfavorable purchases.  Some have argued, however, that CBDCs enshrine constitutional protections over commerce, giving these unfavorable purchasers or merchants – such as someone buying ammunition or a pornographer selling their creations – a defense against un-banking that can’t be used when dealing with a private company.  Regardless, CBDCs might be the newest wedge issue in U.S. politics.  In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Samuel Armes, president of the Florida Blockchain Business Association, which helped draft DeSantis’ anti-CBDC bill, said that DeSantis’ office has gotten more phone calls about CBDCs than any of the usual issues.  A recent poll from Quinnipiac University shows that DeSantis still trails former president Donald Trump among Republican and Republican-leaning voters, with 56% supporting Trump followed by 25% for DeSantis.  DeSantis isn't the first Republican candidate to mention bitcoin. Former pharma entrepreneur and longshot contender Vivek Ramaswamy said onstage at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami that the next election should be a ""referendum of fiat currency"" and has also come out against CBDCs with a ""hell no.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/25/desantis-bitcoin-represents-a-threat-to-the-current-regime,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea2d1fbbd6bfff9695972086fc9dc0e3852eccff-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin was recently trading at $26,362, down about 3.1% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had been hovering in a narrow range before dipping below its recent $26,500 support early Wednesday. Markets have been roiled by an ongoing debt ceiling stalemate and inflationary and crypto regulatory concerns. Federal Open Market Committee minutes showing a difference of opinion among U.S. central bankers about further rate hikes did little if anything, to soothe markets – crypto or otherwise.  ""Bitcoin remains rangebound and should continue to consolidate near the lower boundaries of its downward sloping trading range, with the $25,000 level providing massive support,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email.  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,800, down 2.8% from Tuesday at the same time. Other major cryptos were mostly in the red, with popular memecoins DOGE and SHIB recently falling about 3% and 4%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of cypto markets performance, was down 3%.  Moya wrote that ""bitcoin is under pressure as the risk of a U.S. default grows,"" and the U.S. central bank faces the prospect of continuing its monetary tightening.  ""Bitcoin is going to be very sensitive to surging Treasury yields as too many crypto/blockchain companies will struggle with financing,"" he wrote. ""It is hard enough to find a bank that will deal in cryptos, let alone take out loans for long-term projects.""  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Terra LUNA −5.8% Smart Contract Platform Decentraland MANA −4.8% Entertainment Shiba Inu SHIB −4.5% Currency  Insights  Market Maker Flowdesk Aims for U.S. Expansion  It’s tough to find someone that’s bullish on the U.S. crypto market. Some of the most recognizable names in the industry are bearish, citing a lack of regulatory clarity, like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.  Coinbase has threatened to move offshore if regulatory clarity isn’t established soon. And its sentiment is shared by many – plenty of crypto venture capitalists prefer to invest in places like Singapore.  But Guilhem Chaumont, CEO of market maker and liquidity provider Flowdesk, sees things differently.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Chaumont says he views the U.S. as a central hub for the crypto market and believes his company can thrive there due to its commitment to compliance and regulatory requirements – as onerous and unclear as they might be – from day one.  Chaumont told CoinDesk that his company had just opened a New York office, which it wants to expand.  The sophistication and size of the U.S. capital markets is a worthwhile trade-off for having to deal with its regulatory regime, he argues.  He said that there’s an inevitable convergence of crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) regulations, which he views positively. He also notes the potential for a talent bridge between the sectors.  ""Crypto is not going to happen without regulation. And if that means that regulation needs to be TradFi levels, we are on this side, as we prefer to have this than having no regulation basically,"" he said.  Hong Kong, for example, heavily emphasized the TradFi experience when it recently released the first draft of its crypto licensure framework.  “The convergence of these two regulatory frameworks is a positive sign for us. Because it will allow for a massive bridge of talent to come into crypto,"" Chaumont said.  In an ideal world, Chaumont says, there would be purpose-built regulation for crypto, but sometimes a compromise is necessary. After all, the future of crypto trading involves more and more regulated assets.  “There was a hope, which I shared, that we could reinvent everything from scratch and take the best of both worlds to devise new regulation that is simpler than that of TradFi and lacks its costly complexity,” he said. “What we're seeing is that this hope is slowly fading away, and crypto regulation is basically converging with TradFi.”  Which, for Flowdesk, isn’t a bad thing.
