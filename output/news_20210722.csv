In a draft form of the 1040 form for 2021 released on Wednesday, the tax agency has proposed asking the question ""At any time during 2021, did you receive, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in any virtual currency?”      That compares to the lengthier 2020 question that asked “At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?""      The 2020 version of the question generated considerable confusion about whether simply acquiring cryptocurrency or moving it from one wallet to another would incur taxes.      In its guidance last year, the IRS made it clearer that cryptocurrency transactions would only be taxable if they were sold, exchanged for goods or services or exchanged for property including other crypto assets.

The New Jersey-based company declined to comment on the current state of its plans.      BlockFi is set to close its Series E on July 27, the documents show. The round, as previously reported by The Block, amounts to $500 million, people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. The investor documents reviewed by CoinDesk say BlockFi is expected to command a $4.75 billion post-money valuation.      BlockFi has been telegraphing its intention to go public for over a year, at one point even eyeing the second half of 2021. That timeline appears to have been delayed even before securities regulators in Texas, Alabama and New Jersey put BlockFi on notice.      A BlockFi stock listing would follow a raft of high-profile public-market crypto debuts, kicked off by Coinbase in April and followed by everyone from Circle to Block.one’s Bullish.      For now, BlockFi remains in startup mode. Its Series E is being led by Hedosophia and Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC, the documents said. Coinbase Ventures, Tiger Global and Bain Capital are also participating. The round was first reported in June by The Information.    Path forward    BlockFi’s road to Wall Street grew complicated this week as state securities regulators in the U.S. began questioning the legality of the firm’s marquee BlockFi Interest Account (BIA) offering.      That product, which promises to reward crypto depositors with high interest payouts, had amassed over $15 billion in assets by March 31, according to the Texas State Securities Board. In its filing, the Texas agency said it notified BlockFi of alleged violations on April 20, 2021.

New Jersey is giving BlockFi until July 29 to explain itself. If the pair fail to come to a resolution, the state could halt BIA account onboarding.      CEO Zac Prince said Wednesday that BlockFi is talking things through with New Jersey. After Alabama issued its own order, his firm tweeted that “we have active dialogues with regulators worldwide.” After CoinDesk’s reporting on the Texas filing, BlockFi tweeted that “we firmly believe that the BIA is lawful,” without referencing Lone Star State regulators.      “I think most states are looking at BlockFi,” Joseph P.

42387348,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmYbP,1626985801,NFT Craze Remains a Nonfactor for Ether's Price,"Not everyone’s happy with the rapid growth of the non-fungible tokens (NFTs), especially some people who are already inside the volatile crypto market for a bit longer time, aka, the ""crypto natives.""      As NFTs gain popularity despite an overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market, some NFT critics inside the market took to Twitter blaming the non-crypto natives who cash out their ether immediately after NFT sales for the lackluster price movement of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.      But according to multiple analysts and market participants, the impact of NFT sales, if any at all, remains a nonfactor on ether’s prices. Instead, the complaint showcases many traders and investors’ frustrations in a dull market.      The speculation “is more like a reflection of the current market sentiment,” Daniel Lv, co-founder of China-based blockchain Nervos Network, told CoinDesk through a representative.      The blame, though, isn’t completely irrational since growth in the NFT market has not quite slowed down partly because of the large number of endorsements it has received from non-crypto celebrities.      The sort of statement or action by non-crypto people like Mike Winkelmann, aka Beeple, only further legitimated the blame: Beeple, who received his record-breaking $53 million in ether (ETH) for selling his NFT through Christie’s, told The New Yorker that he converted ether into fiat, which was seen by the crypto industry as a “betrayal.”      “I’m not remotely a crypto-purist,” he said in The New Yorker interview. “I was making digital art long before any of this [nonsense], and if all this … NFT stuff went away tomorrow, I would still be making digital art.”      Meanwhile, data compiled by CoinDesk Research also shows that the monthly ether flow to centralized exchanges moved in tandem with the monthly NFT trading volume. A large inflow of ether or other cryptocurrencies to exchanges poses some pressure to their prices as more tokens are available for sale on the exchanges.      While all that is happening in the NFT market, ether, the cryptocurrency that is a main payment supporting NFT sales, is down about 50% from its all-time high price a little more than two months ago and is struggling to clear $2,000.      It’s worth pointing out that even when NFT’s monthly trading volume hit its highest level this year in May, the volume denominated by the U.S. dollar was still relatively small at around $250 million compared with the amount of ether deposited on exchanges at nearly $50 billion.      “NFTs, though still extremely popular, are just one component of the Ethereum ecosystem,” said Brian Mosoff, CEO of investment firm Ether Capital.      According to CoinGecko, ether has a circulating supply of about 116.8 million. At the time of publication, more than 6.3 million ether are locked in the ETH 2.0 network and about 9.6 million ether are locked in decentralized finance (DeFi).      Only about 1.1 million ether went into NFTs this year so far, according to data compiled by blockchain data cite DappRadar.      “We’re far from the stage where ether prices are impacted by NFTs, regardless of non-crypto native sellers entering the space and potentially cashing out their ether,” Patrick Barile, chief operation officer at DappRadar, said via a representative earlier Thursday, citing that NFTs’ trading volume in the past 24 hours was only about 0.1% of ether’s.      That said, ether, alongside other alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), remains highly correlated with bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, despite different fundamentals. When bitcoin gets hit, others follow.      “What we are seeing [in ether’s correction] is still a shakeout of new money that entered the space over the last half year,” Mosoff said. “Overzealous newcomers are being tested in their conviction that the asset class is truly here to stay.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | CKB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/22/nft-craze-remains-a-nonfactor-for-ethers-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d1afb3270f40ea56220031b97d8bf62727a0f09-2560x1188.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42387349,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmYcf,1626985781,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Holds Above $30K as Sentiment Improves,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly higher on Thursday as bullish sentiment returns. Bitcoin was trading around $32,300 at press time and is up about 1% over the past week. The price recovery off $30,000 support stalled following positive comments from Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday. Technicals suggest upside is limited around $34,000 resistance.      Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at Bitpanda, an Austrian financial services platform, described the trading environment across cryptocurrencies as a “roller coaster ride,” in an email to CoinDesk.      “The price of Bitcoin has been producing lower highs and lower lows recently while remaining in a downtrend,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad wrote. “Even though pressure from sellers might be diminishing, buyers won’t turn things around until resistance is broken.”    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $32370, +2.37%  Ether (ETH) $2028.2, +4.57%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4367.3, +0.2%  Gold: $1806.1, +0.11%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.259%, compared with 1.291% on Wednesday    Bitcoin was already well bid ahead of The B Word conference on Wednesday. And now analysts are questioning whether Musk's comments are enough to keep bitcoin bulls active.      “The jury is still out on whether this positive spark will bring enough confidence to change the direction of the markets,” wrote Ulrik Lykke, executive director of crypto hedge fund ARK36, in an email to CoinDesk.      “Investors should still be attentive to the risk and realize that this may indeed not be enough to bend the current downwards momentum,” Lykke wrote.    Bitcoin short-term holder capitulation    Short-term holders who are underwater (holding bitcoin significantly below the acquisition cost) are in capitulation mode, according to data from Glassnode.      The chart below shows the short-term holder market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio, which is at the lowest level since January 2020. In a bearish price trend, a low MVRV ratio is typically aligned with capitulation events, according to Glassnode.    Bitcoin dominance stabilizes    Bitcoin’s dominance ratio, which measures bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total market capitalization of major cryptocurrencies, is stabilizing around 46%. The ratio has risen from a June low around 39%, which could signal further upside in bitcoin relative to other cryptocurrencies.      It is possible that bitcoin is seen as a safe haven as altcoins experience sharper selloffs during bear markets similar to 2018.    Ether to outperform bitcoin?    Ether has been consolidating relative to bitcoin over the past two months. The ETH/BTC ratio could see a short-term breakout, especially if ether holds above the $2,000 level.    Stablecoins in the spotlight    Financial regulators need to consider “the worst case scenario, the adverse scenario and the different likelihoods of those scenarios, and then assessing risk” when regulating stablecoins, Dan Burstein, general counsel and Chief Compliance Officer of Paxos, said in a TV interview at CoinDesk’s First Mover.      The worst-case scenario would be a run on assets, according to Burstein. “If those assets are held in illiquid assets, or risky assets, then those might not be able to be sold for $1. And those tokens are then going to be under reserved, they're going to break the buck, and they're not really entitled to the name of stablecoins.”    Altcoin roundup    Reddit chooses Arbitrum: Arbitrum has been selected by Reddit to make the social media site’s Ethereum-based Community Points system ready for prime time. Rollups, a solution for the world computer’s limited capacity, temporarily bundle transactions on a sidechain so that more users can participate in the primary network. Reddit said Thursday that Arbitrum beat out 21 other entrants to become the winner of its “Scaling Bake-Off.” Other projects being considered included Solana, StarkWare and Polygon, to name a few.      Ethereum-based authentication platform raises $27M: Magic, an Ethereum-based authentication platform that allows users to log into websites without relying on passwords or the centralized honeypots that store vast lists of them, has closed a $27 million funding round. The Series A round, announced Thursday, was led by Northzone and included Tiger Global, Volt Capital, CoinFund and Digital Currency Group (also the owner of CoinDesk). It brings Magic’s total funding to $31 million, following a $4 million seed round in May 2020 that included the likes of Placeholder, SV Angel and Naval Ravikant.

42387340,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmYNZ,1626984458,BlockFi Is in Regulators' Crosshairs. DeFi Is Next,"In the last couple of days, embattled cryptofinance company BlockFi has been hit with cease and desist notices from three different state regulators for its BlockFi Interest Account, or “BIA,” product – first, in its home state of New Jersey and today, we learn, Alabama and Texas as well. It seems likely more states and eventually the federal regulators will follow.      “But BlockFi offers interest accounts just like I have with my bank,” I hear you say, “as do many other DeFi businesses in crypto. It seems these products are offered everywhere in crypto. But I’ve had a bank account for years and my bank isn’t being hauled over the coals by state regulators.”    Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist, is a partner in Anderson Kill's Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies.    So what’s going on? Is this a one-off instance of regulatory overreach or misinterpretation of crypto by legacy regulators, or is it a sign of things to come for all “decentralized” lenders selling investment products across state lines in the United States?      Before we answer that question, it’s important to do a quick review of the rules regarding securities regulation in the U.S. The principal statutes governing securities transactions are the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities Act of 1933, Section 5 which says “unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security it shall be unlawful… to make use of any… communication in interstate commerce… to sell such security” unless an exemption applies.      In English, Section 5 means that you have to have a set of offering documents and those offering documents need to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before you can sell a security to the investing public.      There are a number of exemptions to this requirement. Most frequently encountered in cryptoland are Section 4(a)(2) exemptions for transactions not involving any public offering and Rule 506 exemptions for private placements to accredited investors.      Securities laws are designed to capture myriad arrangements where investors give money to a manager and expect to receive a return. For this purpose, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act define a “security” broadly as being “any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest... transferable share...investment contract… or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a ‘security.’”    Read more: SEC Chair Hints Some Stablecoins Are Securities    The term “investment contract” is also construed broadly, beginning with the 75-year-old decision in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. and its eponymous “Howey Test.” This test was described by the Supreme Court as embodying “a flexible rather than static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek to use the money of others on the promise of profits.”      “But wait,” you say, “I have just such an arrangement with my bank. I give it money, it manages the money and it gives me a return. So why isn’t my checking account a registrable security?” That’s a good question, one the Supreme Court answered in Marine Bank v. Weaver in 1982.      The facts of Weaver do not bear repeating save that the case involved a $50,000 FDIC-insured CD issued by a bank, allegations of false advertising and the history of securities law. In a decision that both clarified and generalized the Exchange Act, the Supreme Court opined that the definition of “security” is context dependent.      Since bank deposits and CDs are not commonly known as or treated like securities, it was therefore unnecessary to treat them as such, due largely to the near-zero risk of default on such instruments rendering them as not security-like when considered in context.      This explains why Alabama appears to be treating BlockFi’s BIA as an investment product. It refers to the BIA not as a deposit account but a product which “BlockFi allows investors to purchase” – terminology which is not used to describe the opening of current accounts.      The bank deposit carve-out in Weaver is not expressed to apply to shadow bank alternatives where federal guarantees do not exist, and there is an increased element of risk.    BlockFi is a more borderline case than the securities questions raised by the 2017 ICO boom    Granted, the current enforcement actions we’ve seen to date – from Alabama, Texas and New Jersey – are state law enforcement actions and will, accordingly, be governed by state and not federal law. I consider it highly improbable that the federal regulator, which so far this week has avoided joining the party, is going to sit on the sidelines for too much longer.      BlockFi could certainly adjust its product offering to sell it only to certain states if there are particular states with rules that permit it to sell the BIA without registration. For now, however, the BIA is offered to persons nationwide. Sales to date likely fall under federal jurisdiction, as do other products sold by other DeFi companies on a 50-state basis.      This could mean that the end-state of U.S. regulation in this area, on a nationwide basis and in states following the federal rules, might be that fixed-income DeFi regulatory products, BlockFi included, will be required to register products like the BIA before selling them to the public.    Read more: US Lawmakers Make Third Attempt to Bring Legal Clarity to Cryptocurrencies    Such regulatory treatment is likely to limit substantially the availability of the BIA to U.S. customers, render products like the BIA uneconomical to offer in states requiring registration, render the UX of such products utterly terrible, and present the daunting possibility that existing DeFi banks may have a difficult regulatory climb ahead of them unwinding their current, noncompliant, businesses.      This could either end in discontinuation of the products in the U.S. (the more likely result), or securing a federal bank charter and offering federally insured cryptocurrency products (without enlightened federal regulators and legislative changes, i.e. under the status quo, less likely).      This does not mean that all crypto-denominated loans are or should be treated as registrable securities. For example, Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act exempts securities which do not form part of any public offering from the registration requirement as one might see with, for example, a one-off, privately negotiated business to business cryptocurrency loan not made in the ordinary course of either company’s business. Similarly we might see something like a BIA offered in a regulatory-compliant fashion via the Rule 506(c) private placement exemption that is generally advertised.      It will be interesting to see whether and when the SEC takes a view on the BIA. What is clear to me as a legal observer is that the BlockFi situation is fundamentally a more borderline case than the last big set of securities questions that our industry encountered in the wake of the 2017 ICO boom.      To the extent that cryptocurrency begins to be used as actual money, it will eventually make sense for the treatment of cryptocurrency deposits at fractional-reserve crypto banks to be aligned with the treatment of fiat currency at fiat banks.      One advantage of regulatory change along these lines, unlike, say, the token issuance safe harbor proposals (in relation to which the effects of adoption would be wholesale evisceration of any ability to enforce federal securities laws in the crypto arena), BIA-type products seem more amenable to tailored exemptions that would allow them to be offered with sufficient levels of investor protection.    Read more: Yes, We’re Still Talking About Regulatory Clarity | State of Crypto    Provided adequate prudential supervision and hedging, it’s conceivable that BIA-type products could exist and be regulated like CDs or deposit accounts.      I suspect that cryptocurrency adoption needs to go through a few more exponential doublings before it makes political sense for the SEC and legislators to seriously explore what a legislative regime around crypto-denominated accounts will look like. Given that crypto’s growth rate – in terms of aggregate number of users – is faster than that of the internet, the sooner this happens the better off we will all be.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Preston J.

A new report from CryptoCompare highlights the decline in trading activity as well as a drop in total assets under management (AUM) in the digital asset investment sphere.      Compared with traditional asset classes, digital asset markets still have a “long way to go before more risk-averse investors are fully at ease,” according to CryptoCompare.      Key findings from the report include:    Since June, total assets under management across exchange and over the counter-traded digital asset investment products decreased by 14% to $34.8 billion according to the report.  “Grayscale products represent the vast majority of AUM at $27.9bn (80.1% of total) followed by those of XBT Provider ($2.7bn, 7.8% of total) and 21Shares ($949mn, 2.7% of total)” according to the report. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  The report also found that trading activity in the investment products continued to slow, with aggregate daily volumes of $319 million, down 35% so far in July compared with June levels. Grayscale’s bitcoin trust product (GBTC) sustained its majority share of trust product volume at 59.1%. However, average daily volume for GBTC was down 37% to $160 million  Despite the decrease in trading activity and drop in AUM, net investment flows turned positive in July. Net inflows increased to $58.5 million, in comparison to net outflows of $59.5 million in June.

The Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) filed for a cease-and-desist order against BlockFi, BlockFi Trading and BlockFi Lending. The cease-and-desist hasn't taken effect, and won't unless a judge signs off after a hearing in October, CoinDesk has learned. The filing gives the company a chance to formally respond to the allegations. The company is allowed to continue operations until the hearing.  “This legal action affords BlockFi and its affiliates the opportunity to respond to our allegations and present admissible evidence,” Joe Rotunda, TSSB's director of enforcement, said. He shared a copy of the notice with CoinDesk.  The proposed cease-and-desist order would prevent BlockFi from offering its BIA product without at least registering with the state’s securities regulator.  Texas joins Alabama and New Jersey in alleging that the crypto lending platform’s interest-bearing product might violate state securities laws.  While a spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment, the company tweeted, ""we firmly believe that the BIA is lawful"" after the publication of this article.  Read more: NJ Regulators Give BlockFi 1 Week Before Blocking New Interest Accounts  Like New Jersey, Texas is arguing the fact that the company's customers place their cryptocurrencies in the lending platform’s control for BlockFi to invest and commingle with other customer and corporate funds may violate the state's securities laws.  “The BIAs constitute investment contracts, notes, or evidences of indebtedness regulated as securities as that term is defined by Section 4.A of the Securities Act,” the filing said.  Texas said it notified BlockFi in late April that its lending product might be violating state securities rules. The lender continued to illegally offer BIA in Texas, TSSB alleged.  TSSB said BlockFi has at least 25,000 clients in Texas with $691 million in total assets.

42387347,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmYYt,1626976960,Elon Is 'In It for the Profit Motive': An Interview With Google's Neel Mehta,"This week bitcoin fell below the $30,000 mark again. In the crypto industry, this is a pretty big deal, but for a lot of folks out there, the reaction is more like “okay, so what?”      It’s been over a decade since bitcoin was first introduced, and yet there’s still a lack of understanding of the crypto industry in the United States, and that’s in the country with the biggest bitcoin trading volume in the world. A recent study shows that 24% of American adults still don’t know how cryptocurrency works and 20% don’t know how to buy it.      Society is still very much divided when it comes to the world of crypto and blockchain, not just in terms of knowledge but also, and especially, when it comes to seeing a future for it.      Two years ago, Neel Mehta, a product manager at Google, alongside leaders from Microsoft and Facebook, wrote a book trying to answer the question of whether the crypto world is a “Bubble or Revolution,” and the question is still alive today.      The last couple of years have yet again shown us both sides of the coin. While a single tweet from the uber-rich made people bitcoin millionaires, it was also introduced as legal tender in El Salvador, one of the most serious and promising steps for crypto so far. Meanwhile, people who were once leaders and pioneers have stopped believing in the industry and left. The crypto world is still divided.    Read more: It’s Official: El Salvador’s Legislature Votes to Adopt Bitcoin as Legal Tender    CoinDesk got a chance to speak to Mehta about his opinion on no-coiners and superfans, the current crackdown on mining in China, the competition between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, and, of course, Tesla CEO Elon Musk.      The following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.      CoinDesk: You’re a product manager for Google, one of the biggest Web 2.0 adapters in the world, but you also seem to be very interested in Web 3.0. Isn’t that a little contradictory?      Mehta: One of the conclusions we came to towards the end of the book is that crypto is a revolution in ways that we may not have anticipated for a long time. I don't know if it's so much a Web 3.0 versus Web 2.0, it may just be a combination of the two or it may be that Web 3.0 adopts on Web 2.0. When Web 2.0 came around, Web 1.0 didn’t go away, and I think something similar happened here.      Maybe you’ll see big tech adopt crypto or maybe you’ll see crypto work with big tech – we've already seen that within the financial system. The banks that crypto was supposedly trying to make obsolete, they're all working together. They realize that there's some overlap and some positive ""synergies"" there to abuse the corporate buzzword, and I think the same is going to happen in tech. Web 2.0 has its advantages and Web 3.0 does, and as it organically evolves, they layer inner mesh together. It’s not like one replaces the other.      There’s still a lot of people out there who believe that crypto isn’t going anywhere, that it’s just a “bubble.” Do you think that’s fair?      The folks who say that crypto is going to be very big in the future and the people who say that there's a lot of bitcoin bubbles going on right now, they're both right in their own ways, but it’s about understanding what the core tenets are that lead to both of these sides’ analysis. Maybe a couple of percent of the world has heard of crypto and a fraction of a percent hold crypto. Many people don’t think crypto is a good investment; there’s also many good points about the ecological, environmental impacts of it and there are plenty of people who are in their rights to be no-coiners.      On the other hand, with any new financial innovation, there are people who aren’t for it, and then there are people who have it and eventually what happens is that these new technologies do achieve mass adoption, maybe not in ways they were originally conceived. Not everyone is going to become an NFT (non-fungible token) superfan and not everyone is going to be hunting for the latest altcoin and putting money into it.    People like crypto and they’re going to make it big.    With every technology, there’s superfans, but one of the predictions of the book is that bitcoin slowly becomes normalized. You’re exposed to crypto for better or worse, and I think what happens is that eventually these new technologies mesh into the existing systems in play, so you can imagine some years down the line, maybe there’s a normal bitcoin index fund that works just like the S&P. What happens with these new technologies is that they mold into it and become part of the status quo and that’s how I think crypto achieves that mass adoption.      One of my complaints about some of the no-coiners is that they say it has problems and because of that, it will never go anywhere. I agree there are problems, but it’s still going to go somewhere, whether you like it or not. It’s all about thinking about where it’s going to go and accepting that it will go somewhere. People like crypto and they’re going to make it big. It will become part of the establishment.      Is El Salvador an example of a bubble or revolution?      There’s a lot of complicated geopolitics going on there. A lot of it hinges on what counts as legal tender. Do you want to tokenize your economy? Maybe there’s an argument for that, but the thing with El Salvador is that the president thought it would be good for his country and he made it a legal tender, but I don’t know if he thought through all of the consequences of that.      Steve Hanke recently on CoinDesk TV said that El Salvador’s bitcoin adoption is not a legal but “forced tender.”      It’s funny. One of the things I tell crypto boosters is that it’s great to see this stuff go to the moon but at least be consistent with some of the philosophies you put out there. I think one of the goals of crypto is that it should organically replace the system, but when it’s forced, it kind of goes against some of the philosophical tenets that were put behind it, so it feels a little weird.      Elon Musk? Bubble or revolution?      Elon Musk is a billionaire. He likes having money. If he’s here pumping dogecoin or bitcoin, you better believe that he is long on those things and that he’s trying to make a buck off of it. Tesla lost money on cars last year, and they made more money on bitcoin than from all of that, including the carbon offset they were selling.      With Elon, you better believe that he’s in it for the profit motive. I’m sure crypto fans have enjoyed this kind of rich, famous, super cool guy who was backing their thing and I think a lot of crypto feels burned as a result.    Read more: Tesla Sold Bitcoin in Q1 for Proceeds of $272M    Elon Musk bought in, he very rationally pumped it, and then he managed to get out, and I think it should be a lesson to everyone, which is when you see someone really pumping and hyping something and making predictions like this in the future, think why are they saying this – are they trying to make a quick buck off of it? – and with Elon Musk I think that was the case.      China is heavily cracking down on mining right now, and it has a huge effect on the industry not just there, but across the globe. What do you think is China’s motive behind this?      Crisis reveals things that were already broken. China’s mining explosion showed that centralization is a problem for crypto because in theory, if it was a truly completely decentralized system, if one country banned it, it wouldn’t be a big deal, they’d just go somewhere else. But what you’re seeing was an incredibly high reliance on China. The big mining companies are all based there, so many innovations are coming out of there and so much of the new crypto coins investments are coming out of it. It is a mark against crypto, and I think it hopefully shows that the crypto community and the economy need to change things we have already centralized, like get back to the original tenet. Regulation is increasing around the world, and this is going to happen again, so I hope it’s a wake-up call for crypto boosters and investors to [realize] that they need to decentralize and not be so heavily reliant on one country.

The rollup technology was selected by the social media site to make Reddit’s Ethereum-based Community Points system ready for prime time. Rollups, a solution for the world computer’s limited capacity, temporarily bundle transactions on a sidechain so that more users can participate in the primary network.      Reddit said Thursday that Arbitrum beat out 21 other entrants to become the winner of its “Scaling Bake-Off.” Other projects being considered included Solana, StarkWare and Polygon, to name a few.      Community Points, which are ERC-20 tokens that can be earned by Reddit users for quality comments or other contributions, can be spent on things such as exclusive badges, custom emojis and GIFs.      In a statement, Reddit said Arbitrum, a project of New York's Offchain Labs, was “the most promising scaling technology for Community Points,"" citing the fact that Arbitrum is decentralized, developer-friendly and has broad ecosystem support.    Scaling wars    The decision is yet another feather in the cap of Arbitrum, which, since launching for developers on May 28, has seen adoption or interest from projects such as Alchemy, Uniswap, Chainlink and Etherscan as projects look for layer 2 solutions to thwart Ethereum’s high gas fees.      Reddit launched its own layer 2 rollup using Arbitrum tech on the Rinkeby testnet today, before migrating to the Ethereum mainnet.      Community Points are being experimented with in two communities. One is r/CryptoCurrency, where the Points come in the form of “Moons;” the other is r/FortNiteBR, where the Points are known as “Bricks.” Together, these two communities contain around 4.8 million members.      Reddit noted that while it migrates Moons and Bricks to the scaling network, each will be unavailable for a few hours and updates will be posted in each community when completed.      In addition, Reddit is looking for developers to build a more decentralized web at “Reddit-level scale.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LINK | TECHNOLOGY | ARB,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/07/22/reddit-rolls-with-arbitrum-to-scale-its-ethereum-based-community-points-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f652b739818b0c7367aa8c4819b2801f3e8baa85-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387338,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmYRL,1626969895,Can This Network Theory Predict if Bitcoin Is Undervalued?,"A specter is haunting bitcoin – the specter of Metcalfe’s Law. In a new report from Goldman Sachs, analysts in the bank’s global investment research division suggested that bitcoin’s price may be undervalued relative to the size of the network. Bitcoin has grown, but the price apparently hasn’t kept pace.      Goldman analysts Zach Pandl and Isabella Rosenberg draw upon a framework popular in computer science, but relatively unexplored in economics – Metcalfe’s Law, named after the founder of Ethernet – that states the value of a network grows along with the number of possible connections. In particular, a network’s value is proportional to the square of all connected devices.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Network effects have been crucial for understanding the development and adoption of the internet and social media. Likewise for cryptocurrencies. But it’s worth stepping back to ask what type of network Bitcoin is and why these interpretive frameworks might fall short. “Metcalfe's Law is a simple statistical rule-of-thumb for thinking about the value of network technologies, and not a complete description of these assets' fundamentals,” Pandl said in an email. Yet, it’s often been cited to presage a surge in the price of Bitcoin or even predict its collapse.      Looking at data provided by Coin Metrics, Pandl and Rosenberg found that the number of blockchain addresses for eight different digital assets – BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH, DASH, ZEC and ETC – is often correlated with price. But, in many cases, you’d expect such developed networks to have more societal value (at least as measured by market cap).      Taken together, they found that these assets had a “Metcalfe coefficient” of about 1.5, whereas Metcalfe himself would expect a two – a squared relationship. (A Metcalfe coefficient measures the relationship between network capitalization and users – a coefficient of one suggests a one-to-one relationship.)      A variation of Metcalfe’s Law has often been applied to social media giants. Facebook’s valuation, especially before going public, was derived from looking at monthly active users (MAUs). If just Mark Zuckerberg was on the blue page, it wouldn’t be a very useful social platform. The same could be said for Bitcoin – it wouldn’t be the same if it was just Satoshi and his node.      What separates cryptocurrencies from other information networks commonly measured by Metcalfe’s Law is that the asset being valued is also the technology being adopted. A Bitcoin user is a stakeholder in the system.    Last November, bitcoin-native upstart NYDIG published “ The Power of Bitcoin’s Network Effecthttps://nydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NYDIG-Power-of-Bitcoins-Network-Effect.pdf,” which was nominally a look at Metcalfe’s Law but which also included a look at how the use of bitcoin has changed as it is adopted.    The number of daily active addresses was shooting up at the time, the company noted, as was the number of addresses that held BTC without moving it for at least a year. This latter statistic played into NYDIG’s argument that Bitcoin’s adoption is driven by its qualities as a store of value.      Bitcoin’s hard-capped supply of 21 million coins coupled with a growing user base means the price is due to increase over time, NYDIG argued. It provided a chart showing potential five-year price levels, if the annual address growth was 5%, Bitcoin might reach $20,905. If 25%, then $118,544. That’s not just Metcalfe’s Law: it’s ""pumpanomics.""      Others have looked to Metcalfe’s Law to explain the messy way crypto bubbles burst. In 2018, Spencer Wheatley from the Swiss university Zurich ETH and colleagues found that bitcoin grows at an exponential rate with a Metcalfe coefficient of 1.69 (they used a slightly different way to generalize what counts as an “address” than Goldman).      With that in mind, the researchers were able to look back at periods where Bitcoin’s price surged past its level of uptake and crashed – like the downturns of 2012, 2013 and 2017 – to come up with a generalized rule. Put simply, when the growth rate itself is growing, you’re in trouble.    Read more: Bubbles Are Good for Bitcoin | Yanhao Max Wei    So does Metcalfe’s Law help us predict the future value of bitcoin or its periodic crashes? According to Pandl and Rosenberg, Metcalfe’s Law is likely a misnomer – less of a law than a mental model. “This research report was [to] explain the basic statistical relationships for some of the oldest crypto assets for our clients,” Pandl said.      In fact, of all the assets the Goldman analysts looked at, bitcoin was the closest to meeting the expectations of Metcalfe’s Law – with a coefficient of 1.9. But Pandl was wary of saying the asset “behaved in line with expectations.” A number of factors could influence this: most notably bitcoin’s use as a speculative asset, which is hardly sustainable, he said.      “Bitcoin's market cap has risen almost two times more than measures of network size over this period – similar to the rate implied by Metcalfe's Law – whereas the average token has risen about one and a half times more than measures of network size,” he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/22/can-this-network-theory-predict-if-bitcoin-is-undervalued,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4593efe37ca7b622ed31071a5423485022754db9-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""When you look at FTX US, there's an enormous amount of potential growth in the states,"" CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said Thursday on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program.      ""There isn't nearly as much business going on right now as you would expect given the size of the economy,"" the 29-year-old California-born entrepreneur went on. ""A lot of that is regulatory.

""There isn't any dominant jurisdiction,"" and no single jurisdiction makes up more than 10% of the company's revenue, he said.      While acknowledging that China's recent crypto crackdown has weighed significantly on the price of bitcoin and the asset class broadly, Bankman-Fried downplayed its direct impact on FTX's business.

The report mentioned sizable funding rounds, such as those from stablecoin company Circle, which snagged a then-record $440 million in May. (The new largest funding round by a crypto firm came earlier this week when crypto derivatives exchange FTX announced it raised $900 million.)      Also noted by CB Insights was hardware wallet maker Ledger’s $380 million funding in June; a $300 million round in April for custody firm Paxos (which, like Circle, also acts as the steward of stablecoins); Block.one’s $300 million funding round in May for its Bullish exchange; and Mexico City-based crypto exchange Bitso’s $250 million haul in May.      While bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices have flattened in recent weeks, the size of crypto raises appears to be increasing so far in the third quarter, with FTX leading the charge.      “Q2’21 was the largest funding quarter on record,” the report said of fundraising overall, adding:    “Across 657 deals, global VC-backed fintech companies raised a record $30.8B, shattering last quarter’s funding record by 30%. This impressive funding growth was accompanied by a modest 2% deal growth quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and a 29% increase year-over-year (YoY).”  Sectors to watch    Crypto has brought about a new age in banking compliance, the report said. Blockchain analytics companies, which track transactions and aid regulators and law enforcement, are another hot area in terms of funding.      The report mentioned two major rounds for such companies in June – Chainalysis raising $100 million and CipherTrace raising $27 million.      CB Insights also singled out crypto custody and infrastructure as sub-segments that were notable for their ability to raise money.

The Eastern European country, which is a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption according to Chainalysis, is trying to become the jurisdiction of choice for crypto startups and is one of the few nations in the world to present a strategy for developing its digital asset industry.      The report (in Ukrainian) entitled “Virtual Assets of Ukraine – 2030,” reflects the results of research conducted between March and June by the ministry together with crypto exchanges, miners and other crypto-community participants.      According to the report, to provide an optimal environment for the digital asset market to develop, the government needs to tackle legal and educational goals.      Among them:    Provide an appropriate legal framework.  Ensure a stable taxation regime for the next 3-5 years.  Allow crypto companies to open bank accounts.  Issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  Reform the courts to enhance the protection of private property.    The road map also says the bill on the digital assets now before parliament should be passed this year. Tokenized assets, it says, should become part of the existing financial system, and there should be an official way to buy virtual assets for fiat money.      Education also features in the plan, with the development of programs dedicated to blockchain and virtual assets starting with school-aged children. There should be a special program for members of parliament and a master’s course on decentralized finance.      The 11 working groups that compiled the report included examining a way for people to “buy bread for tokens,” the launch of a “fiat-to-crypto gateway,” establishing a regulatory sandbox for crypto ecosystem projects and creating new policies for regulating the digital assets market.      The report predicts that if its recommendations are followed, by May 2024 Ukraine should become of the top 10 crypto nations, with 47% of the population using digital assets and 10% of businesses having their assets tokenized.

42434865,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPu81h,1626965713,US Credit Union Regulator Wants to Know How Its Firms Handle DeFi,"The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is formally looking for more information about how the financial institutions it regulates can interact with the crypto industry.      The NCUA published a request for information (RFI) on Thursday after its three board members unanimously voted in favor, asking how distributed ledger technology (DLT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) might affect the credit union system and how its regulated entities might interact with either of these technologies or other crypto-related tools.      The NCUA is a federal U.S. regulator overseeing credit unions, acting as a counterpart to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which regulates national banks.      With this, every major federal banking regulator is now looking at crypto. In addition to the NCUA and the OCC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) published a RFI in May asking similar questions about crypto, while the Federal Reserve is seeking feedback on a proposal to allow fintech and crypto firms to have access to its master accounts.      There’s also growing scrutiny of digital assets from regulators, with stablecoins and securities-backed tokens in particular starting to garner attention. The OCC, the Fed and the FDIC are also forming an interagency team to examine crypto.      In its RFI, the NCUA asked about insurance, risk/compliance, operations, supervision and related areas where the NCUA might be involved if a credit union wants to offer a crypto-related service.      The RFI also included a question about stablecoins and how those accounts might be insured.      The general public – including individuals who may not directly be part of a credit union's compliance team – has 60 days after the document is published in the Federal Register, the nation's logbook, to weigh in on the questions.      NCUA Vice Chairman Kyle Hauptman first called for his agency to take a look at crypto earlier this year. He pointed to the OCC’s work in letting national banks interact with stablecoins and provide custody services for cryptocurrencies as a potential example for credit unions, though he said any NCUA guidance might not match up exactly with the OCC.      “At some point, we’ll speak with NCUA staff about doing a side by side with what the OCC did and see what we do or don’t want to adapt for credit unions. NCUA benefits a bit from ‘somebody else went first,’ so we can, where appropriate, build on the OCC’s experience,” he told CoinDesk in March.      In a statement about the RFI on Thursday, he likened the crypto industry to the internet in the mid-1990s, and said early action by the NCUA could help ensure credit unions don't have to play catch-up at a later date.      ""The U.S. is in a race to be the center of this new industry, much the way this country did so well with the internet economy,"" he said. ""While I’m a Republican, I feel compelled to mention that one reason America dominated the internet industry is because, 25 years ago, Bill Clinton’s White House published principles that said the government will not interfere with the growth of this new technology. Millions of Americans have jobs today due to that early guidance from the federal government.""

42434855,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPu7lh,1626965582,"Blockchain Is Secure, but You Are Not","The going mantra in crypto today is ""institutions are coming."" That could not be further from the truth. The degree of safety financial services require is far beyond what we in crypto can provide today.      The problem is that what institutions mean by safety is very different and goes far beyond what the cryptocurrency crowd understands the word to mean. It includes conventional digital security, but it also includes a reasonable ability to correct mistakes and retrieve stolen funds, as well as to share access with others and remain confident that such sharing won't lead to problems.      Here's an illustration of what it takes to achieve safety in crypto, at least in terms of digital security. This post lists all measures cryptocurrency users should take to stay secure. (Footnote: Read it and follow it to the letter!) To carry out the author's advice, one must spend many hours, and not just once, but every so often, to ensure that there is no avenue for the attacker to get in or that keys are not lost.    Alex Bulkin is the founder of adaptframework.solutions and a general partner at A100x.com.    Crypto was started on the premise of financial sovereignty, a worthy goal, to say the least. Yet, when it comes to money, sovereignty is not what the majority of the population needs or wants. It wants safety and measured, predictable and low-risk income. That is what institutions want to provide to their customers, because ultimately the institutions don't benefit when their customers lose money for any reason whatsoever, including a lack of understanding or lack of education.      And then there is the simple fact that full control of funds means added incentives to kidnappings and physical attacks. When the extent of that problem becomes clear to the mainstream finance community (say, after a high-profile kidnapping of a cryptocurrency fund partner or two), whatever interest the institutions had in this asset class will disappear overnight.    It is not necessary for sovereignty to stand in stark opposition with safety    Custodians purport to solve the problem, but more often than not, they merely hide it, while lulling their customers into a false sense of security. (For instance, the custody solution FireBlocks did not protect its customer from permanently losing keys to his blockchain wallet.)      Or, alternatively, custodians can remove the customer's prized financial sovereignty through added safeguards to access, and the consequent exposure to regulatory interference, and freeze customer's accounts much like banks do.      It is not necessary, however, for sovereignty to stand in stark opposition with safety. A viable compromise between safety and sovereignty is possible through a deep and nuanced examination of what people need, and through learning from the past and current mistakes. But as long as the cryptocurrency community is unwilling to compromise and blames users for their perceived lack of security savvy, there is no chance of mainstream adoption.    Read more: How Institutions Are Looking at Bitcoin Right Now    So, yes, institutions are coming, but they are only coming to learn from our mistakes, to adopt our ideas and to build their own blockchain systems that answer the exact set of requirements their customers have. These requirements will include the conventional understanding of customer safety and will reduce risks to all customers, even those unable to understand, let alone follow, a complex set of security procedures, or ensure military-grade physical security. These systems will leave crypto behind and will instead drive value into an entirely different generation of digital assets.      In order to drive mainstream financial organizations to crypto-asset networks, our approach to security has to change. It must necessarily include a safety net to prevent or at least reduce the likelihood of human error. We must stop accusing users of stupidity, and instead provide them with reliable tools that make it easy for them to prevent hacks and keep their keys safe, all without an in-depth understanding of digital security.      We must also build systems that actively remove incentives to physical attacks, for example through shared control of accounts. Either that, or as the novelty of crypto assets wears off, we will become irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ZRX,Alexander Bulkin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/22/blockchain-is-secure-but-you-are-not,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Kathy Kraninger, who served as the CFPB’s director from 2018 until she resigned in January, will oversee Solidus Labs’ regulatory strategy and build a global team to work with governments that are looking more closely at digital asset markets and how to regulate them.      Solidus makes market surveillance tools to flag manipulation across cryptocurrency trading platforms. This ability is seen as crucial to helping U.S. regulators finally approve a cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF).      In an interview Thursday, Solidus CEO Asaf Meir declined to estimate when such an ETF might be approved. But he did say that ""the rails and infrastructure [are] much more mature, and there's the right players in the market to usher in that type of instrument in a safe way. I can't say if it's going to be in a year or two, but we're moving towards there.""      Kraninger said her experience at the CFPB will likely prove useful in her new role.      ""I spent a lot of time at the bureau really thinking about innovation in fintech and promoting that engagement between government and industry, so I'm very excited to further that,"" Kraninger told CoinDesk. ""And I certainly have a lot of experience with how regulators think.""      Kraninger is the latest Trump administration regulator to join a cryptocurrency company. Former bank regulator Brian Brooks was appointed the CEO of Binance U.S. in May, while Chris Giancarlo, the former head of the U.S. derivatives regulator, is an investor in Solidus and the founder of the Digital Dollar Project, which supports the development of a digital dollar.      Kraninger had previously held senior government positions at the Office of Management and Budget, the departments of Homeland Security and Transportation, and in both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.      She was asked to resign when President Joe Biden took office.      In May, Solidus Labs announced that it had raised $20 million in a Series A investment round led by Evolution Equity Partners and that included Hanaco Ventures, which led the startup’s $3.75 seed round in early 2019.      Other investors in the Series A round included FTX and VC Avon Ventures, which is affiliated with Fidelity Investments. Several former regulators also joined the round, including Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alumni Giancarlo and Daniel Gorfine, and former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Troy Paredes.

The Series A round, announced Thursday, was led by Northzone and included Tiger Global, Volt Capital, CoinFund and Digital Currency Group (also the owner of CoinDesk). It brings Magic’s total funding to $31 million, following a $4 million seed round in May 2020 that included the likes of Placeholder, SV Angel and Naval Ravikant.      Passwords are generally the way users prove ownership of long alphanumeric private keys. Those secret passwords are trusted to platforms such as Equifax, LinkedIn or Kickstarter, and once an attacker has infiltrated one of these platforms and accessed a database of hashed passwords, they can attempt to brute force weaker passwords, which are probably used elsewhere too, such as the user’s bank account.    Read more: ​​We Should Sign On to the Web, Not to Websites    Magic’s authentication system uses key pairs created on the platform-independent Ethereum blockchain. Rather than sharing a secret, the user signs a piece of data with their private key, generating a signature; in computing terms, proving you have knowledge of a secret without revealing anything is called a zero-knowledge proof. Magic makes this all happen via user-friendly emailed links, and it can also be simply plugged in as an SDK by software developers.      “Under the hood, every user that signs up with Magic has an Ethereum key pair generated for them, whether they use that key pair or not,” Magic CEO Sean Lin said in an interview, adding:    “So we actually have users in the millions now, growing at 6% a week, which means we are probably one of the fastest distributors of decentralized identity and blockchain key pairs. Eventually, when the time’s right, they are all going to come back and be Web 3 users.”    Going back a couple of years, the majority of Magic users were non-blockchain apps, or regular Web 2 fans, said Li. However, he said this past year has seen a surge of interest, particularly driven by things like non-fungible tokens (NFTs).    Read more: ‘Passwordless Login’ Startup Magic Raises $4M From Naval Ravikant, Placeholder    “Before this year, I would say about 60% or even 70% was from Web 2,” Li said. “But this year there has been a real shift towards Web 3 and it now accounts for maybe 80% of use.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/22/magic-numbers-ethereum-based-authentication-platform-raises-27m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e518bc60d17fe51d9fb01f5d1c69ec5ed438f30-1500x1135.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434874,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPu8Hh,1626953390,Bitcoin Looks North After Biggest Single-Day Rise in More Than a Month,"Bitcoin appears to have found its footing after Wednesday's nearly 10% rise, its biggest gain since July 17, and may soon challenge the upper end of its monthslong trading range of $30,000 to $40,000.      ""We are now short-term bullish to the topside against the $30,000 region triple bottom with strong bullish divergence,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said. ""In addition to this, the market is short gamma to the topside – a break above $35,000-$36,000 could trigger a quick short squeeze towards the $40,000-$42,000 range top.""      Bitcoin bears have failed at least three times in the past two months to establish a foothold under $30,000. While prices did close (UTC) below the key support earlier this week, Wednesday's jump to $32,000 negated the bearish breakdown.      The persistent defense of the $30,000 mark has taken the shape of a so-called triple bottom pattern on the daily chart, which also shows a bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI). The pattern occurs when the indicator prints higher lows, contradicting weakness in price, and is a signal of seller exhaustion and scope for a price bounce.      The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $34,500 may offer immediate resistance. According to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, a breakout above the 50-day SMA would target the 200-day SMA near $44,000.      Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance, also pointed to $35,000 as a critical level. ""Order book flow looks good, but a lot of stale selling orders are coming up in the $35,000 area, which still need to be cleared,"" Heusser said.      Lastly, market participants who went ""short gamma"" by selling call options – or insurance against bullish moves – at or above $35,000 over the past few weeks may resort to hedging, that is buying spot or futures, if prices rise to above $35,000.      That, in turn, may bolster the bullish move, possibly yielding a test of $40,000-$42,000, as anticipated by QCP Capital. Being short gamma means being an option writer (seller) regardless of whether the option is a call or put. Traders typically write options when they expect the underlying asset to see low-volatility consolidation.      Bitcoin is currently trading at near $31,800, representing a 1% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk 20.      The cryptocurrency rose from $29,800 to over $32,000 yesterday on a string of bullish news. The day ended with tech entrepreneur and provocateur Elon Musk saying that his aerospace company, SpaceX, holds bitcoin. Musk also said that he owns bitcoin, ether and dogecoin, and added that Tesla might relist bitcoin as a payments alternative.

42411949,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh4jn,1626953340,What is Gemini Dollar (GUSD)?,"The Gemini dollar (GUSD) is a crypto stablecoin pegged to and backed by US dollars held in FDIC-insured bank accounts. The funds held in reserves are routinely audited by the accounting firm, BPM LLP.  GUSD was created by crypto exchange Gemini, which was founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2014. Gemini received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to launch its stablecoin in 2018. The company has claimed that GUSD is the first regulated stablecoin, though Paxos also launched a NYDFS regulated stablecoin the same day. The Gemini Trust Company LLC holds USD deposits that correspond to the number of tokens in circulation.  The Gemini dollar is an ERC20 crypto token built atop the Ethereum network, and its smart contracts are audited by security company Trail of Bits Inc.  The Vision for Gemini Dollar  The Winklevoss brothers have said that the Gemini dollar is intended to bridge the divide between the traditional finance sector and the crypto industry. The brothers have sought to set their stablecoin apart from others by emphasizing that it is regulated by the NYDFS.  Launch and Issuance of Gemini Dollar  The Gemini dollar launched in September 2018, with the Gemini Trust Company as the sole issuer. Gemini holds the US dollar reserves that back its stablecoin in Boston’s State Street Bank. The currency is insured through an FDIC deposit insurance program. Registered customers are able to convert USD into Gemini Dollars and deposit them to an ethereum address, while Gemini adjusts their holdings to correspond to the number of tokens in circulation.  The Gemini dollar is built on Ethereum, meaning token creation is the result of executable smart contracts. The contract responsible for increasing the supply must be signed by an online key up to a certain limit. To mint coins beyond that limit, an offline signature is required. This is intended to increase the security of token issuance.  Network and Security  Smart contract execution requires a multi-signature scheme of approval for “high-risk action,” which includes an offline signature for added fault tolerance. After approval, these particular actions are time-locked for a period of detection or response to security incidents. Any pending actions can be revoked to avoid malicious actors.  Gemini Dollar Monetary Policy  The Gemini dollar does not have a set circulation schedule or hard cap on supply. It is pegged to the US dollar with a reserve backing the token 1:1.  Transaction Processing  Gemini dollars are created at the time of withdrawal from the Gemini platform and are transferable to any Ethereum address the user specifies. The US dollar amount of Gemini dollars is debited from a customer’s account upon withdrawal, and credited at the time of deposit. There are zero fees charged to users when buying or selling GUSD crypto tokens on Gemini's native exchange. However, Ethereum gas fees will apply once tokens are migrated off its platform.",NEUTRAL,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-gemini-dollar-gusd,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/240bdc477acff66b2c60f1a56203d2ef5f67a3e2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a notice and explanatory letter published by the Bank of Russia, stock exchange operators should avoid listing any securities, such as exchange-traded funds, that provide payments based on the prices of cryptocurrencies, digital assets issued abroad, cryptocurrency price indexes, crypto derivatives and securities issued by cryptocurrency-related funds.      Asset managers should also exclude such securities from mutual fund portfolios, and brokers should not offer such securities to nonqualified investors.      The bank's Securities Market and Commodity Market Department is the regulator for Russia's equity markets. The ruling is designed to prevent retail investors from getting access to products they may not understand.

""Purchase of investment products tied to them exposes people who lack experience and professional knowledge to a high risk of losing money.""

According to the latest CBECI update, China&apos;s control over Bitcoin mining was already waning. The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index shows that and much more, it &apos;provides an up-to-date estimate of the Bitcoin network&apos;s daily electricity load.&apos; However, China is the headline. The government&apos;s recent ban on Bitcoin mining left the world speechless, and this feels like another piece to solve that puzzle. It doesn&apos;t quite fit, though. According to Arcane Research, CBECI numbers say that: China&apos;s share of total Bitcoin mining power has declined from 75.5% in September 2019 to 46% in April 2021 — before the restrictions on Chinese miners were even imposed. That figure is much lower than the older estimate of 65%. Related Reading | Why China&apos;s Crackdown On Bitcoin May Be Just Beginning That&apos;s a sharp decline. Why did China&apos;s miners lose so much ground before the ban? Did the Chinese government turn off the machines that they reportedly own? Why would they do that? Is everyone missing an obvious explanation for all of this? It&apos;s also very interesting that the CBECI shows that the United States and Kazakhstan were growing at a tremendous rate before the ban.

Mawson said it has received 250 Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro machines and is expecting a further 570 Avalon A1246 units from Canaan by month's end, according to a press release on Tuesday.  The S19 Pro is one of the latest editions in mining chip maker Bitmain's lineup capable of producing 110 tera hashes per second with a power efficiency of around 29.5 joules per tera hash. Tera hashes are a measure of the computational power of the mining machine. Joules per tera hash measure energy consumption.  At its flagship U.S. site in Georgia, which generates power derived mostly from renewable sources of energy, Mawson expects the addition of the new machines will help it break even when mining costs are hovering at around $4,000 or less per bitcoin.  Gross margins are expected to be more than 80% based on the current bitcoin price and its network difficulty.  Mawson expects to receive 588 more Avalon A1246 mining machines in August, according to the release.  It's the latest in a string of deliveries for Mawson. The company picked up 11,760 A1246 miners from Canaan in April.  ""Our strong relationships with major ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) mining hardware manufacturers give us confidence in reaching our corporate goal of 2,000 PH by end 2021, and 5,000 PH by end 2022,"" Mawson CEO James Manning, CEO said.
