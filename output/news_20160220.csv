42378624,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqQx,1456009114,Bitcoin Miners Back Proposed Timeline for 2017 Hard Fork,"A group of bitcoin miners constituting close to 80% of the network hashrate, as well representatives from exchanges, service providers and contributors to the Bitcoin Core development project, have proposed a development timeline for scaling the bitcoin network.  The statement’s release  comes after a more than 18 hour-long meeting in Hong Kong that drew participants from China's bitcoin mining community and members of the Bitcoin Core team.  Some of the letter's signatories were party to a previous statement that voiced opposition to any ""contentious hard fork"" to the bitcoin network.  According the proposed timeline, Bitcoin Core contributors Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Cory Fields, Johnson Lau and Peter Todd will produce and recommend code for a hard fork to the bitcoin network that would feature a block size increase. The code for this proposal is expected to be made available by July.  This proposal would be presented three months after the release of Segregated Witness, a proposed change to bitcoin's code that alters the way in which bitcoin transaction signature data is stored.  Representatives for miners AntPool, A-XBT, BitFury, Bitmain, BTCC, BW, F2Pool, GHash.io and Genesis Mining have agreed to support Segregated Witness, expected to be released in April. According to data from Blockchain.info, the larger miners on the list of signatories have produced roughly 80% of all blocks in recent days.  The group went on to say that, following approval by the volunteer Bitcoin Core team and a show of “strong community support”, it would support the deployment of that hard fork – a change to the network that would require users to download new software in order to stay compatible – with activation taking place sometime “around July 2017”.  The statement reads:  “This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.”  Further, the statement indicated that the signatories would, for now, only use production versions of the Core software.  “We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future,” it said.  This reflects a change from a previous version of the statement published online that featured stronger language in the commitment to use Core over other alternatives. Later removed, it said that the group would “not run Bitcoin Classic”, a reference to the alternative implementation released earlier this month that includes code for a transaction block size increase to 2 megabyte (MB) versus the current 1 MB per block.  A full list of signatories can be found here.

42378626,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqSD,1455993109,This Proposal Could Reshape Europe's Cryptocurrency Policies,"Jacek Czarnecki is undertaking an MSc in Law and Finance at the University of Oxford, and is a lawyer specialising in digital currencies, distributed ledgers and financial regulation. He also co-authored the first Polish report on digital currencies as featured on CoinDesk.  In this article, Czarnecki discusses an overlooked aspect of a recent European Commission proposal concerning the regulation of cryptocurrencies which he says may have far-reaching consequences.  Recently the European Commission (EC) announced plans to apply the EU anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations (the Fourth AML Directive or 4AMLD) to digital currency exchanges and possibly wallet providers.  This move is a part of the EC’s broadening action against terrorist financing.  But while this news comes as no surprise, another EC proposal, far less publicized and somewhat overlooked, has the potential to revolutionize the current state of affairs in digital currency regulation in the EU.  Hackneyed idea  The intention to embrace digital currencies by AML/CTF regulations has been expressed many times by the EU institutions – for example, by the European Banking Authority in 2014, and by others after terrorist attacks in Paris in February and November 2015.  It seems that the latter tragic event finally prompted regulatory action from the Commission's side.  It is interesting that the intended changes (details of which will be revealed in the second quarter of 2016) will be probably made to the 4AMLD, even though it has been adopted as recently as May 2015 and the EU member states still have time to implement the new regulations.  This was not an unexpected course of events, as many other jurisdictions have either introduced (including the US and Canada) or considered introducing analogous regulations (such as the UK and Australia).  Such measures have also been recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body that is mainly in charge of setting AML/CTF international standards and assisting in their implementation.  Breakthrough proposal  Besides a plan to extend the scope of the 4AMLD to cover digital currency exchanges, the EC briefly presented another regulatory idea, which was not even mentioned in the press release.  It seems, however, that its consequences (if implemented) would be far-reaching.  The EC announced that it will consider applying the licensing and supervision rules of the Payment Services Directive (PSD; a new version of which, 2PSD, has been adopted in 2015) to digital currency exchanges in order to ""promote better control and understanding of the market"".  PSD is one of the cornerstones of the EU single market for payments. It sets out rules for regulated payment services and contains a catalogue of such services.  Firms which render payment services have to comply with many regulations, including licensing and supervision rules, which now the EC apparently also intends to apply to digital currency exchanges.  Such a plan seems to be sensible. It is clear that there are two legal acts in the EU that would be well-suited for regulating cryptocurrencies: PSD and another related directive, the E-Money Directive (EMD). Works on the new '3EMD' are now under way, so some changes could be introduced there as well.  Revising basic assumptions  What matters, however, is what the current PSD regulatory methodology looks like.  A crucial piece of the PSD is the definition of ""funds"", which so far has included only cash, bank (scriptural) money and e-money (regulated by the EMD). Cryptocurrencies do not fall into any of those categories – a fact confirmed by the European Central Bank (ECB) and others.  It follows that, for the EC, digital currency exchanges would be best covered by some provisions of the PSD, although in the current form it does not apply to digital currencies at all.  It therefore appears that regulatory change might have to be much deeper than merely adding a few provisions extending the scope of licensing and supervision regulations on digital currency exchanges.  New regulations would probably have to revise some of the basic assumptions and concepts of the PSD, including definitions of ""funds"", ""payment transaction"" or ""payment institution"".  How should stakeholders react?  It is difficult to evaluate the EC's plan, since at the moment it is extremely general and vague. However, very likely it will open the door for the introduction of cryptocurrencies to the EU payment services regulations.  Various proposals may emerge afterwards, from cautious and restrained ones to those proposing comprehensive and broad regulation.  Firms that may be affected by any regulatory change should monitor developments closely and be ready to react.

42378633,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqb1,1455943427,"Steps from Wall Street, Bitcoin Still in Style With Fashion Designers","To the financial firms rushing to evaluate blockchain technology, the idea of bitcoin as a distributed global currency often appears threatening, or at least in opposition to the needs of consumers and a long-established set of rules for governing the financial system.  But where they see an idea and culture opposed to government, proponents often argue that bitcoin should be best considered as a means of individual empowerment.  Steps from Wall Street, it’s this message that is resonating in surprising places, from small business owners to independent fashion designers who see bitcoin as a force of social good.  Although their aesthetics differ greatly, both Alisha Trimble of I Love You Bedford and Sylvia Heisel of HEISEL now accept bitcoin from their customers due to their alignment with the digital currency and its larger ethos.  While visitors to Trimble’s Williamsburg boutique are treated to a colorful display of femininity, the design lab of HEISEL in lower Manhattan is incredibly minimalistic. Yet beneath the surface of their designs lies a common interest in embracing both social good and digital currency.  Discovering bitcoin  The name of Trimble’s boutique loudly proclaims her feelings for its location on Bedford Avenue, the main street of the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn. “I like that Williamsburg is still unpredictable,” she said.  Trimble told CoinDesk:  ""In my creative process, there's often an element of spontaneity that sparks the creativity.""  It was also that element of unpredictability that initially drew Trimble to bitcoin. She first learned about it from one of the jewelry designers whose work she stocks in the store and was drawn to the stories of its price fluctuation.  I Love You Bedford opened its doors in July of 2015, and by November of the same year, Trimble had set up a bitcoin wallet to allow customers to pay with the currency for any of the products in her store. She advertised her decision to accept bitcoin by hanging up posters along the streets of Williamsburg.  ""One thing I like about accepting bitcoin is that it’s safer than cash. I’m a women-owned business, and I’m here alone all the time, so I almost never accept cash because it’s a security risk,"" Trimble commented.  If I Love You Bedford stands out for its intricate femininity, the HEISEL line’s distinction lies in its focus on emerging technology. Heisel keeps up with new technologies by reading newsletters and attending conferences, acknowledging that technology has huge potential to have a serious impact on the fashion industry.  Although Heisel was uncertain of exactly where she first heard about bitcoin, her discovery of the digital currency came from her immersion within the technology world.  ""I do a lot of research with how technology can affect consumers. One of the things that’s so cool with bitcoin is that it’s a way to change how corrupt getting things made in a lot of countries is. It opens up the conversation: Why should governments control our money?"" she said.  Focus on sustainability  Williamsburg, the Brooklyn neighborhood in which I Love You Bedford resides, is one known for its spotlight on artisanal, local and eco-friendly products, and Trimble draws inspiration with respect to sustainability from her spot on Bedford Avenue.  The boutique’s website highlights that the products are locally crafted and ""created from the best quality conflict-free materials"". Most of the designers that Trimble highlights in the store's rotating inventory use textiles, beads and other materials sourced directly from the area.  The HEISEL line is made with new sustainable fabrics such as Polartec, Tyvek, and Cuben Fiber. The materials are often discovered at industrial trade shows and chosen for their low impact on the environment and their transparent supply chain.  Heisel commented:  ""Sustainability has to be a given in anything we do now. It’s really important to know your supply chain. I have to know where the fabric is coming from – and the consumer has a right to know, too. There aren’t any perfect solutions right now, but technology can make it better. I’m really interested in how technologies can be used to make our lives more sustainable.""  The idea of authenticity is increasingly resonating with millennials, as studies have shown the generation responds well to sustainable companies. In a recent survey conducted by the Natural Marketing Institute, 51% of millennials surveyed stated that they would pay more money for a sustainable product.  It is the same idea of authenticity that draws so many to the bitcoin community. As traditional banking institutions lose the trust of the millennial generation, bitcoin emphasizes the transparency of all transactions available through its blockchain.  A focus on constructing positive change in today’s world drives both the bitcoin movement and the sustainability movement, creating a significant degree of overlap in the populations supporting each.  In support of this overlap, Heisel’s interest in social good meshes well with the elements of bitcoin that most appeal to her.  ""If you’re working in Third World countries, in places where the person doing the work for something doesn’t always get paid, bitcoin provides an alternative. And I think that’s amazing,"" she said.  Bitcoin for merchants  The HEISEL line has seen a few bitcoin purchases since the initial decision to accept the currency. The brand has taken advantage of opportunities to display the products at bitcoin-centric events, most recently at a bitcoin art show at Rabbithole in Brooklyn.  Heisel sees more merchants beginning to accept bitcoin in the future: ""It’s pretty easy for most websites to accept bitcoin at this point.""  I Love You Bedford is still awaiting their first bitcoin purchase from a customer, but Trimble is excited about the prospect.  ""I think [the price of bitcoin] is going to go up,"" she predicted. ""People have more trust in it now, whereas before, they thought it was questionable. More and more people are coming to understand what it is, and you’re going to see more people buying into it.""  Trimble encourages other merchants to begin accepting bitcoin in their retail locations. She believes that by accepting bitcoin, a merchant is also playing an important part in raising the general population’s awareness of digital currency and increasing customers’ desires to learn more about it.  “If a merchant asked me if they should accept bitcoin, I’d say there’s no reason not to,” she said.
