Blockchain data on Arkham Intelligence shows the crypto address associated with the exploiter transferred 10,580 ether (ETH), worth some $19 million, to Euler on Monday.  The event signals a positive ending to one of this year’s largest crypto exploits.  The lending protocol suffered an exploit last month that resulted in almost $200 million of digital assets being drained including in dai (DAI), wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), staked ether (sETH) and USD coin (USDC).  In the following weeks, the exploiter returned a bulk of the stolen funds to the protocol and seemingly apologized in a message attached to one of the blockchain transactions.  The protocol is set to unveil a plan to restore user deposits in the coming days, the Euler Foundation posted Tuesday in the protocol's forum.

11395472,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525460,1680565080,Data Says Bitcoin Has Begun Its Most Bullish Month Historically,"Bitcoin price is trading around $28,000, holding relatively stable after a large move upward in Q1 2023 from 2022 lows. Not only is a new quarter beginning, but BTCUSD has entered its most bullish month in its history, according to data. Historical April Bitcoin Performance Is No Joke According to seasonal analysis and serial correlation, BTCUSD has typically been stronger in April than any other month out of the year. There is no telling why this phenomenon occurs, but should the trend continue, Bitcoin could be on its way to kicking off a more significant bull trend. The below table highlights April performance each year, since BTC had a price to trade at. The data begins with April 2011, which saw more than 343% in growth in the nascent digital currency. Year April Percentage Change 2011 +343.45% 2012 +1.37% 2013 +46.9% 2014 -2.56% 2015 -3.91% 2016 +7.87% 2017 +27.02% 2018 +33.24% 2019 +29.83% 2020 +34.3% 2021 -1.58% 2022 -17.41% This represents a total April return of 537.94%, or an average of 44.83% upside in the month over the years. This even includes bear market data, such as the 17% decline in 2022. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Could Be Less Than 120 Days Away From Retesting ATHs In finance, performance often recurs with unusually specific timing. The phenomenon called the January Effect, for example, sees a sharp increase in the valuations of small cap stocks and altcoins. Bitcoin has also historically topped in November or December, so why couldn’t major bull movements happen in April? Past performance is not a guarantee of future results, but history does often rhyme. BTC in April over the years | BTCUSD on TradingView.com BTCUSD Analysis: April Showers May Bring A 44% Price Increase A 44% move in BTCUSD would take the top cryptocurrency above $40,000 for the first time since –– interestingly enough –– last April 2022. That month the cryptocurrency market fell be 17%, breaking below descending support. The breakdown below the support trend line resulting in a dramatic fall further, to the tune of an additional 46% in the two months to follow. BTCUSD dropped a full 58% from the April 2022 close until the current bottom set in November. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Points To New Uptrend, Here’s Why Since November, Bitcoin has risen by nearly 80%, and another 44% on top of that would mean BTC doubled in value from the bottom in November, to the end of this month. But only if BTCUSD adds that average to the current price. Will April fool the market with its bullish data and pull the rug? Or will the recurrence have enough credence to result in a massive rally?

42412435,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4wme,1680557970,Bitcoin Drops to $27.5K While Dogecoin Spikes After Twitter Logo Change,"Bitcoin (BTC) remained firmly within the range it has held for much of the past two weeks, trading as low as about $27,200 and as high as $28,400 Monday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $27,500, down over 2% from 24 hours ago. BTC is up nearly 70% for the year after a buoyant first quarter in which investors grew more optimistic about inflation and other macroeconomic issues.  Yet, BTC’s price has been unable to ride above $29,000 for more than a few fleeting minutes in recent weeks as investors mull banking failures and fresh economic indicators that have been inconclusive.  “Bitcoin needs a bullish catalyst to break above the $30,000 level, but until some significant use case argument is made prices could consolidate around the mid-$20,000s,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, also slid 0.2% Monday to hover around $1,787. ETH’s price jumped 48% in the first quarter. Among other altcoins, the meme-based dogecoin (DOGE) – long supported by Twitter CEO Elon Musk – surged 16.5% after the social media platform changed its logo to the dogecoin symbol from the usual blue bird. Payments provider Alchemy Pay's native ACH token rose 7% after a Monday report that the company has received $10 million in investment from market maker DWF Labs at a $400 million valuation.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 0.1% for the day.  Meanwhile, market liquidity has continued to worsen. Crypto data firm Kaiko’s Monday report noted that both BTC and ETH’s 2% market depth, a metric for assessing liquidity conditions, has dropped by 50% and 41%, respectively, since the collapse of Alameda Research, the trading arm of crypto exchange FTX in November – a so-called “Alameda gap.” The ongoing decline has followed exchange Binance’s announcement that it was curbing its zero-fee trading program, Kaiko said.  “Both assets (bitcoin and ether) have suffered in the aftermath of the FTX collapse and banking crisis, with fewer market makers supplying liquidity to order books,” the report said.  Equity markets were mixed Monday. The S&P 500 closed up 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose by 0.9%. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 0.2%.  Traditional market movements came after OPEC+ unexpectedly announced an oil production cut of over one million barrels a day, sending oil prices higher.

Gala Games will offer its affected users $25 million worth of node licenses. The firms will begin compensating victims within the next week.  The announcement comes five months after a bad actor minted $1 billion worth of pGALA, a wrapped version of GALA that trades on BNB Chain, and offloaded the tokens on decentralized exchanges including PancakeSwap, plunging the price of the GALA 94%. PNetwork, Gala Games’ cross-chain interoperability bridge, said at the time that it coordinated a ""white hat attack"" on itself to prevent bad actors from absconding with users' money.  User refunds are just one measure Huobi and Gala Games are taking to address the fallout of the pGALA scheme.

SHIB has surged by nearly 4% in the past day, emerging as the second highest gainer among large crypto by market cap after Dogecoin (DOGE). SHIB is currently in the green, with a 24-hour high of $0.00001144 and a low of $0.00001057. The token is moving upward after recording a sharp decline as of last week. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Accelerates, How Will The Price React? Over 25 Million SHIB Burned In 24 Hours As a result of the Shiba Inu army’s consistency in burning SHIB tokens, the token’s burn rate has recorded a more than 20% spike in the last 24 hours. According to the Shiba Inu burn tracker, Shibburn, there have been a total of 25,767,627 SHIB tokens burned in the past 24 hours via eight separate transactions. Of the eight transactions, SHIB super store, a themed SHIB product, burned the highest number of tokens through its weekly burn event. Over the past 24 hours, the store reported 9.5 million burned SHIB tokens in just a single transaction. Alongside the burned tokens, the SHIB superstore also reported an additional 9.4 million Shiba Inu tokens distributed to the community as a reward. According to this platform, this move is an “advancement in community support and encouragement in the continuous event of burning SHIB.” The SHIB superstore has since been a core player in the weekly SHIB burn events. Starting in September 2021, the store has burned 3.48 billion SHIB and has distributed roughly 314 million SHIB to the community via its burn and earn program. As of last month, SHIB superstore recorded over 6.7 billion SHIB burned via 540 distinct transactions. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Fundamentals Look Strong, When Will SHIB Price Follow?

SHIB is currently moving in a bullish trend, following suit with DOGE price action. In the last 24 hours, over $400 million have been added to the asset’s market cap by nearly 4%. At the time of writing, the SHIB market cap currently sits at $6.7 billion. Interestingly, despite its surge, at the time of writing, the asset’s trading volume hasn’t moved much compared to the amount seen earlier today. SHIB currently has a 24-hour trading volume sitting at $291 million. Meanwhile, DOGE has recorded a double-digit gain up by 17% in the last 24 hours.

Turns out, the catalyst for all this was an encrypted message contained in a tweet that was apparently not meant for the public's eyes – at least not yet – and that might've just been a wild guess.  ""Interpol Red Notice for CZ,"" read the tweet from @cobie, who is followed by much of the crypto community. Not only is that account private, the text of the message was actually a garble of letters and numbers. It had been encrypted using the SHA-256 hash function, the same cryptography that secures many cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.  But somebody figured out how to crack the post, and word spread. With Binance and its CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, having just been sued by U.S. regulators for ""willful evasion"" of U.S. laws, the idea that CZ might face a criminal probe rang true to many – and prices reacted accordingly as the rumor spread quickly. Binance's exchange token and bitcoin rapidly dropped.  Spokespeople for Binance and Interpol didn't respond to a request for comment. On Twitter, Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann said, ""One of two things is true: 1. It's bullsh-t; 2. A law enforcement agent is illegally leaking elements of a case file."" He added: ""My bet is #1.""  Later Monday, @cobie said via Twitter that they'd posted the encrypted tweet after hearing a rumor. Effectively, @cobie was creating a record of something that they could reveal later they knew in advance – provided it came true. (The person could also just quietly delete the tweet and nobody would be the wiser that it was wrong.)  ""The point of a hash commitment scheme is nobody is supposed to be able to read them until after the secret is revealed,"" @cobie tweeted. ""Looks like someone I discussed the rumour with (handful of possible ppl) leaked the seed to 'create a stir' at my expense, removing the context of rumour, etc.""  @cobie added: ""Anyway, it was not supposed to be readable ever unless I revealed it, so sorry about that. Will once again narrow down the list of ppl I can trust. Since tweeting only leads to bad things instead of good things I will probably do much less in the future.""

42421279,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmYP,1680552305,Wondering What Web3 Means? Listen to Ethereum's First Marketer,"The building at 49 Bogart Street: Steps away from the Morgan Avenue stop on the L train in Bushwick, Brooklyn, covered in graffiti and stickers like most of the neighborhood’s other low, converted warehouses. When I joined in 2016, this was ConsenSys' headquarters, a single room in a mostly residential building with no security desk or formal process for entry. The building’s unassuming façade – seemingly worlds apart from the gleaming office towers across the river in Manhattan – would prove irresistible to nearly everyone profiling the company, even appearing as the lead image in a Bloomberg profile on the “crypto world” decamping to Brooklyn, N.Y.  Amanda Cassatt is the founder and CEO of Serotonin, a Web3 marketing agency and product studio and president of Mojito, an NFT commerce suite spun out of Serotonin. This chapter was excerpted from ""Web3 Marketing: A Handbook for the Next Internet Revolution"" published by Wiley.  It was largely here that, as chief marketing officer of ConsenSys from 2016 to 2019, I had a front-row seat to witness the emergence of Web3 and an important responsibility to tell its story. Marketing wasn’t a common skill set among the core of builders working on early Ethereum. When I first entered 49 Bogart, the environment was far more academic than commercial: Most of my colleagues were computer scientists, engineers, developers and a few key businesspeople. My new colleagues were some of the most brilliant people I’d ever met. Some had technical degrees from top universities; others were self-taught coders and hackers.  My path to joining them wasn’t an obvious one. After four years of college, during which I was relatively oblivious to the growing crypto movement, I had gone to work for Arianna Huffington at the Huffington Post. Huffington and her co-founders had pioneered a new, digitally native approach to producing and monetizing online content through advertising revenue. Instead of investing heavily in expensive investigative journalism reporters (though it would invest in this later), HuffPost’s in-house writers would mostly summarize stories broken by other news outlets. They would hyperlink to the original sources and give them credit but, ultimately, if HuffPost created a more social media–friendly headline for the story and attached a more visually stimulating image to it that would appear on social media feeds, then it would draw as many – if not more – eyeballs from Facebook and Twitter to the story on its web domain than the original story, which it could monetize against advertising sales. With this model, called aggregation, they achieved higher return for lower upfront investment.  At the time there were few web-native media outlets. Print-based publications were just figuring out their digital strategies as they realized they could get wider distribution by publishing online and socializing content through Facebook and Twitter. The Drudge Report was probably one of the first web-native media outlets and likely the original inventor of the aggregation model but it was HuffPost, coming only slightly later, that was able to achieve this model at scale.  My first employer also innovated in the field of user-generated content with the HuffPost blogging platform. There was an air of exclusivity to being accepted to blog on the Huffington Post, and yet, bloggers were not paid for their contributions, even if they achieved massive distribution. Bloggers willingly signed up for this deal, believing the platform would remunerate them with a different type of value: exposure. Appearing on HuffPost, the bloggers believed, would help them build personal audiences among whom they could promote a business, advance a social cause, or achieve otherwise beneficial notoriety. Although the vast majority of blog posts were read by few, a small minority of blog posts would earn the most traffic of all the articles on the HuffPost website. With many bloggers on the platform and therefore many at-bats, a few blogs would produce extraordinary wins in terms of traffic and the blog was nearly 100% monetizable upside with almost no up-front costs.  There was no template for marketing in Web3.  This was perhaps the site’s most efficient moneymaker. In 2012, when AOL bought the Huffington Post for $315 million in one of the first and still one of the largest digital media exits, unpaid bloggers brought a lawsuit against AOL demanding their share, arguing they had contributed a great deal of the value. The courts summarily dismissed their lawsuit. This was the confirmation digital media outlets and social media networks needed: that it was legally permissible to collect content and data from individuals and monetize it without distributing any of that value flow back to the original creators – one of the core pillars of Web2 business models. Though this approach was deemed legal, Web3 would eventually revolt against it, not in the courts but by designing alternative incentive systems that would better compensate creators.  As a special projects editor working for Huffington, I witnessed the machine for producing online journalism in a digital environment and saw the inner workings of both editorial and the blog. Though some in Web3 are justifiably upset by the shortcomings of Web2 businesses, I’m less interested in criticizing them and more interested in capitalizing on their weakness to outcompete the old models with more creator-friendly alternative solutions. Far from moralizing about uncompensated bloggers, I was filled with admiration for the founder, who was and is genuinely a pioneer and an innovator. It was by watching and learning from her that I first realized that I, too, could perhaps someday start a company.  After a couple of years, I identified an opportunity to further innovate on the media business model by offering creators the chance to be compensated for their work, and I co-founded a news platform called Slant. We invited college journalists, and journalism graduate students in particular, to blog on our platform and would compensate them with 70% of revenue from the advertising we served across their content, taking home 30% for the company. Far from an agnostic platform such as Medium, where writers can publish pieces exactly as they write them, we worked closely with our writers to help them edit and package their content for maximum distribution online, teaching and learning the art of content marketing.  At the time, readers and news outlets were fascinated by first-person reports from college campuses as the topic of sexual assault in college and the burgeoning Black Lives Matter movement gained traction in the popular narrative. As a result of this timing and excellent work by a number of emerging writers, a small minority of top-performing articles were able to achieve significant traffic, sometimes earning a contributor thousands of dollars for a single story. However, the vast majority of pieces earned very little attention and often, to meet our commitment to pay out a writer 70% of advertising revenue on a given piece, we would find ourselves splitting the dollar, or even splitting the cent. At Slant, we depended on third-party payment processors to facilitate the transactions and because of the fees they charged on each transaction, we would lose money on low- paying content. Although our business model worked in theory and we were able to achieve the impressive benchmark of over 4 million page views per month shortly after launch, it did not work in practice because of payment processing. Designing an incentive system to draw in creators with better remuneration, we had innovated a somewhat decentralized micropayment-based business model for media even before the start of Web3 but we were stymied by the intermediated Web2 style of sending payments.  Out of concern for the company’s viability, I became obsessed with payments. In New York, where I lived, there were a number of technology meetups, and as a co-founder of a small but growing platform, I was able to meet and socialize with other founders. In 2015, I met several members of the early Ethereum team, including Joseph Lubin, Sam Cassatt, Andrew Keys and Christian Lundquist. Despite the code base being public, it was difficult for me to understand the inner workings of the Ethereum Virtual Machine without a computer science degree. However, it was clear the individuals being attracted to Ethereum were some of the smartest people I had ever encountered. Although I was unable with my media and marketing skill set to perform my own independent diligence on the technology they were building, it was easy to diligence the people. I recognized that they were brilliant.  See also: What Is Web3? Understanding What Web3 Is... and Isn't / Learn  Not only did Ethereum theoretically solve the problem I encountered in my small business, it also unlocked countless business models and modes of value creation that made logical sense but not practical sense, impeded by the limitations of Web2. Wading through a sea of unfamiliar jargon, I was able to extract the idea that they were building what some called an ""Internet of Value"" that would evolve the ""Internet of Communications"" that Web1 had built. Where Web1 facilitated the global movement and exchange of information at a scale previously unimagined, Web3 had the potential to do the same for value. (It should be noted value is not the same as money, though money is a common way value is expressed.)  At the time we referred to the movement as ""crypto"" but occasionally would use the term Web3 to refer to the larger construct of a web where all kinds of value can be captured and interact frictionlessly, beyond the financial use case of cryptocurrency or blockchain-based tokens such as bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH]. Crypto today can be considered a subcategory of Web3 focused on the financial use case. As my interest in crypto grew and the perils of media business models reliant on advertising became even clearer, in summer 2016 I decided to exit my startup and join ConsenSys full time as chief marketing officer. There I would become the first Web3 marketer.  Most were unfazed by ConsenSys making its first official marketing hire. They were focused on writing code, contributing to what they believed could become one of the most important undertakings in software history and likely their careers. The atmosphere was one of barely contained excitement. We knew we were onto something big.  Others expressed concerns about ConsenSys starting to do marketing. The whole point of designing incentive-aligned economic models in Web3 was that they should be self-marketing. Plus the concept of “marketing” had a veneer of inauthenticity, especially from its context in Web2. The word reminded them of annoying ads on Facebook that no one clicks on, Instagram influencers hawking vitamin waters, exaggerated headlines and articles about the Kardashians. To these thoughtful technologists, marketing seemed more like an evil than a good, the art of using simple and deceptive language to manipulate consumers into buying products they don’t need. No one likes the feeling of being marketed to; many are happy to pay subscription fees to avoid seeing advertisements. Software developers especially, who were the target users for many of the first Web3 tools such as MetaMask, Infura and Truffle, particularly disdain ads. They would rather just inspect an open-source code base themselves and draw their own conclusions. Web2-style marketing was culturally incongruous with this group of hackers and academics.  At ConsenSys in 2016 our goal was to build the fundamental tools and dapps [decentralized applications] that would enable more developers to build using Ethereum. Making Ethereum easier to use would unlock the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling developers to innovate with the Web3 substrate and build any application they imagined. ConsenSys brought teams together under one roof with shared funding, legal and back office infrastructure to help them get to market faster and more efficiently. Because these teams were housed in one incentive-aligned company, they could specialize to deliver the most critical applications rather than compete with each other to solve the same problems. It was a clever solution to avoid redundant work.  Early ConsenSys was also fruitful ground for collaboration. There were relatively few decentralized blockchain technology experts in the world and almost all of them worked at ConsenSys or the Ethereum Foundation. These experts often contributed wherever they were needed and would work on many different projects at once without official roles or titles, motivated by their desire to grow Ethereum.  Thanks to its critical mass of talent, culture of cooperation and an electric energy where anything felt possible, early ConsenSys was able to build foundational Ethereum standards, tools and dapps, many of which are widely popular today. These include Truffle, the original development framework for building Ethereum applications; Infura, the Ethereum infrastructure developers use to deploy dapps; MetaMask, the widely used self-sovereign Web3 wallet; and contributing to the ERC-20 token standard.  ConsenSys brought together teams to build dapps on top of these core tools, aimed at a wide variety of use cases and industries. Among these were Ujo, a Web3 music dapp that would pioneer a novel use of NFTs and inspire others; SingularDTV, a platform to decentralize film and movie production; Gnosis, a prediction market platform whose contracts are now widely used in other dapps; and Grid+, a system that promised to make energy use cheaper and more efficient.  Some of these projects would succeed, while others would disband and send their contributors to work elsewhere within the ConsenSys “mesh,” the name for the morphing collection of people and projects associated with the company. If the saying is true that 90% of startups fail, ConsenSys certainly achieved a far better than average track record. But the success of any individual project was only part of the point. My job as a marketer was to help these fledgling startups gain whatever traction they could, while also showcasing each startup as a possible use case for Ethereum. This would inspire others to build on Ethereum and drive ecosystem growth, even when an individual startup failed by other metrics like user acquisition or volume. Obviously, we wanted all our projects to succeed but our larger mandate was Ethereum.  There was no template for marketing in Web3. As the first official marketing hire at ConsenSys, I learned quickly from my colleagues, especially the few who reacted strongly to the idea of ConsenSys starting a marketing department, that the Web2 approach wouldn’t work. Luckily, I didn’t have a traditional marketing background and wasn’t set in my ways. I’d absorbed important lessons from my time at HuffPost and Slant about how content was distributed online and how that engine worked to capture attention, shape perception and convert audiences to taking the actions that matter to a company. I was no stranger to social media and influencer marketing and I recognized the importance of gathering people together for physical events. And perhaps most relevant, as a previous startup co-founder, I knew how to think about starting a business and shaping it over time to fit its customers’ emerging preferences.  What I didn’t know was very much about Web3. It was immediately clear it would be impossible to design a formula for Web3 marketing without understanding the substrate that is Web3. I needed to get to know the product before I could sell it. I read everything I could get my hands on about Ethereum and lured my busy colleagues out to lunch or happy hour, where I would mine them for information. Reassured of my intention to market Ethereum thoughtfully, free from hype and clickbait, they were cautiously optimistic that my unusual skill set could be deployed to help Ethereum achieve its vision and were mostly happy to spend time with me.  But my goal was to commercialize Ethereum and bring Web3 to a retail audience. In my first interview with Joe Lubin, I told the Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys founder and CEO point-blank that I wanted to make Ethereum a household name like Starbucks and Major League Baseball. This was Earth-shaking technology – not flying cars but the most exciting thing I’d ever encountered in the world of bits. If we presented it the right way, everyone would care about it. The idea of commercializing Ethereum was controversial among the quiet academics and anti-establishment hackers of early ConsenSys, but Joe nonetheless offered me the position. After all, he had founded ConsenSys to grow Ethereum and bring it to more people. Despite the fact that I was only 25 years old, Joe gave me the benefit of the doubt. I was obviously passionate about Ethereum, and it wasn’t like the world’s best marketers were flocking to an obscure project whose only reputation was for being inscrutably complicated and getting hacked that one time. Hiring me was an experiment and I think Joe was curious to see what, if anything, I could do. But I would be given no resources: no new hires and no budget until I proved marketing mattered.  I spotted the first opportunity to do so almost immediately thanks to Andrew Keys, an early Ethereum evangelist and master salesman who was leading business development. Warm and gregarious, Andrew invited me out for dumplings in Shanghai, where we were attending the second annual DevCon, the yearly meeting of Ethereum developers and enthusiasts hosted by the Ethereum Foundation. Talking a mile a minute, Andrew effused about a project he and others were working on: launching the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). Months previous andrew had cold-called Microsoft to tell them about Ethereum. Two executives, Marley Gray and Yorke Rhodes III, had listened carefully. They were excited about its capabilities and curious to explore use cases for their business. Encouraged by the reception from Microsoft andrew worked tirelessly to rally the blue-chip companies that wanted to experiment with Ethereum.  See also: How Are Institutions and Companies Investing in Crypto? / Learn  Microsoft, Intel, JPMorgan Chase, Santander, BNY Mellon and Accenture were among the long list of firms that agreed to launch an intercompany working group in partnership with ConsenSys, several other startups and academic groups. Its goal would be to set standards for enterprise implementations of Ethereum that could be used by all. This was novel, not only because of Ethereum. These were companies that would otherwise compete, or at least disclose minimal information to each other, suddenly agreeing to band together to build a shared resource. Web3 economic models often incentivize collaboration and here, in the unlikeliest of places – the cutthroat worlds of finance, enterprise software and management consulting – the spirit was already taking hold.  By the time Peking duck was served Andrew had me convinced this was a remarkable opportunity for marketing. At that point during summer 2016, when people googled Ethereum, the results would mostly show them its teenage inventor, Vitalik Buterin. While Buterin and the rest of the early Ethereum technology team were impressive to computer scientists, Ethereum was still a hard sell for enterprise business executives who didn’t recognize any familiar names on the masthead. Most of the Ethereum presale investors had been private individuals and small funds. There weren’t big brands or many famous investors putting their weight behind the project, which made Ethereum seem niche and unreliable.  Blue-chip companies rigorously vet their choices of software and partnerships and at the time, Ethereum had no third parties validating its merits that would appear trustworthy to decision-makers who, to make matters worse, inherently distrusted crypto. Ever since the Silk Road case, Bitcoin, the best known blockchain network, had been associated with drugs and violence in the internet underworld. But Ethereum wasn’t offering an easy way for dealers to sell pot; it was a new web architecture for creating an Internet of Value. If only a group of trustworthy companies endorsed the Ethereum blockchain, businesses of all sorts would recognize its advantages, overcome their skepticism and indifference and join the movement.  I would continue the conversation with Andrew and other colleagues over the coming months. We recognized this was an important chance to tell the story of Ethereum in the press, which could help reset the narrative that was established with The DAO hack. Serious companies needed reassurance that Ethereum was structurally sound and wouldn’t be exploited again. With household name brands involved in the EEA, we could tell the story of what Ethereum is and why people should care and have it featured prominently in every major media outlet. Millions would discover Ethereum for the first time in this new context.  The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Reuters and thousands of smaller outlets all published the story at the end of February 2017. Andrew and I had pounded the pavement securing coverage from journalists, explaining Ethereum and the EEA and coordinating press releases and interviews among the member companies, no mean feat with so many corporate communications departments involved. But the plan worked. After that fateful day, anyone who googled ""Ethereum"" learned about Buterin but also Gray and Rhodes from Microsoft, Julio Faura from Santander and Amber Baldet from JPMorgan. ConsenSys was widely credited with assembling the group and featured in many of the stories, exploding the name recognition for our business, which was still relatively new.  Investors read the financial press and, sure enough, headlines about Ethereum rubbing shoulders with the most prominent firms in technology and finance brought capital pouring into its token, ether. Ironically, the enterprise standards originally imagined for Ethereum didn’t even use ether; they called for private instances of the Ethereum blockchain that wouldn’t require a crypto token. It was simply the publicity Ethereum was getting in association with top firms that built investor confidence, sending ether surging above $20 quickly after the announcement. By the first Ethereal Summit in May 2017, ether prices would cross $100, one of the fastest price runups in crypto history.  Joe was pleased with his one-woman marketing department. I had ridden in on Andrew’s coattails and proved that marketing mattered. What was exciting to Joe wasn’t just brand recognition for ConsenSys or investors pouring into ether – of which he owned a significant stake – it was how the story stimulated network effects that would help Ethereum grow. More investors meant more funding for Ethereum projects, more entrepreneurs raising capital to build on the platform and more developers hired by those projects to contribute to their code bases.  See also: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance | Opinion  Our metric for success wasn’t the ETH price; it was the number of developers building on Ethereum, in languages such as Solidity and LLL. With more developers building on Ethereum came more at bats to build the “killer dapp” that would drive massive adoption. Almost no developers who started working in Web3 in 2017 would credit their career decision to the EEA launch. To the contrary, many would be motivated by a desire to disrupt the banking industry and disintermediate large corporations. But the EEA launch story began spinning a flywheel of growth whose secondary effects would draw countless developers to Ethereum. (The flywheel is a useful image: A heavy wheel on an axis that at first takes a lot of effort to push but after a while, picks up tremendous speed – the energy from previous pushes now working with the mass of the wheel such that the wheel accelerates, seemingly turning itself. We’ll return to the image of the flywheel when discussing certain momentum-generating aspects of Web3 businesses.)  I made my first hires for the ConsenSys marketing team. The first were Matthew Iles and Elise Ransom. Matthew had a traditional Web2 marketing background and had co-founded a marketing agency with his wife that had successfully marketed well-known retail brands including M. Gemi and Web2 companies such as General Assembly. Matthew and his wife had designed the General Assembly course on digital marketing. Coming from the media world with my nontraditional marketing background, I wanted to partner with a leading expert, and Matthew had codified digital marketing best practices and taught them to thousands of students. Matthew was flexible and creative. Far from resting on his laurels, he didn’t assume that Web2 marketing would work in Web3 but brought structure, process and a wealth of knowledge.  Elise, too, was a remarkable addition to the team. She had worked in fintech (short for financial technology, refers not only or even principally to Web3 applications but more broadly to technological innovation transforming or disrupting financial services) marketing for a real estate-focused startup. Though only a few years out of college, like me, Elise was obviously passionate about Ethereum. For months she persistently contacted ConsenSys employees looking for a job. I recognized when we met that she was an extraordinary communicator, with a talent for distilling complex ideas from the world of fintech into clear messages. During her interview, Matthew and I asked her one of our favorite questions: Explain something complex that you understand really well but that confuses other people. Elise flawlessly explained the 2008 financial crisis and the role of mortgage-backed securities, charting the course of the collapse that had inspired Satoshi Nakamoto on the whiteboard of our tiny meeting room at 49 Bogart Street.  Together, Matthew, Elise and I began laying the groundwork for the first-ever Web3 marketing team, a department that by the end of my nearly four years at ConsenSys would include more than 80 people on teams specializing in public relations, content marketing, social media, community marketing, growth marketing, visual design and product marketing. As a team of non-engineers, we learned voraciously from our technical peers at ConsenSys, always conscious that we needed to understand the constantly evolving Web3 substrate in order to mold it. Our team would choose the best marketing practices to adapt from Web2 and also derive new, natively Web3 marketing practices from first principles. The technology we were bringing to the world shifted economic control away from discretionary decision-making by groups of people and toward transparent governance by algorithm.  And yet, the process of bringing it to market was all about people. We were successful insofar as we brought in the best talent from Web2 and trained ourselves together on Web3. These included Kara Miley and James Beck, who joined soon after to run public relations; Avery Erwin and Everett Muzzy on content marketing; Kanwal Jehan leading community; David Wu and Dean Ramadan in growth marketing; Elaine Zelby, Brett Li and Camilla McFarland on product marketing and so many more. After ConsenSys, they would go on to illustrious careers, mostly in Web3. Camilla, Elise, Kara and Everett would join me at Serotonin, the Web3 marketing agency and product studio Matthew and I co-founded in 2020.  Web3 projects can eventually become self-governing and self-marketing.  After years training ourselves as the first Web3 marketing team, bringing many of the most successful early dapps and tokens to market, we hung out our own shingle to bring our best practices to the next generation of Web3 projects: layer 1s, layer 2s, Web3 utilities, DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations], DeFi [decentralized finance] protocols, NFTs [non-fungible tokens] and metaverse worlds. At Serotonin, we have further refined Web3 marketing and continued to evolve alongside the industry, developing a new specialty in Web3 transformation and coining the term ""Web2.5"" to refer to traditional and Web2 companies gradually adapting their business models to Web3.  As other marketing practitioners enter Web3, we at Serotonin continue to enjoy the advantage of being Web3 natives, deeply familiar with the Web3 substrate and the Web3 community’s history and unique character. That being said, we cheerfully welcome new marketers into the space, because unlike Web2, with its finite pool of business to be competed for by rival agencies and practitioners, Web3 is growing at a breakneck pace, and thanks to Web3 economics, the rising tide of growth truly lifts all boats, stimulating network effects to drive more investment, developers and users. It behooves us to share our best practices with others in the hope they continue to grow our still-fledgling industry and also to continue to learn from those newcomers, perhaps the readers of this book, who innovate in molding the Web3 substrate and set new standards for all of us.  Marketing in Web3 is simply the practice of connecting potential users with products or services they want, starting by making potential users aware of them. To be successful, marketers must learn how to stimulate demand for a new product, often starting from zero. They must deeply understand their product as well as their target audience.  This information enables them to construct a marketing funnel that takes potential users through the steps of discovery, engagement, use and retention. In many cases, a Web3 marketer seeks to convert new potential users from discovery into engagement with an invitation to join a community.  “Community” in Web3 usually refers to an incentive-aligned group of people, typically gathered on a communications channel, such as Discord or Telegram. This group often includes the team working on the project, investors who hold tokens or equity in the project and users of the dapp or protocol. These categories blend fluidly; for example, a user in the community might contribute to the project’s open source code base and receive financial rewards for doing so. Members of the full-time team may come to see this contributor as a regular teammate. A token or equity holder in the community might start using the product and a user could decide to invest. Communities typically share sets of values and interests beyond the mission of the project. A vibrant community can look like a digital social club where members work and play together.  See also: How to Use a DAO to Build a Web3 Community | Opinion  For a marketer, communities offer a pool of potential users to continuously reengage and convert to using new products and features. Ultimately, though, as a community grows, the distinction between the role of the hired marketer and the community member with a marketing skill set can vanish. Just as projects invite their developer communities to contribute to code, they can recruit and reward members with marketing skill sets for contributing to community moderation, content creation, visual design, social media management, hosting IRL (in real life) meetups or events and ambassador or referral programs. It’s efficient for Web3 projects to implement high-quality incentive systems to draw out talent from their communities. Correctly designed, these systems lead to more and better ideation and execution with fewer employees and less back office overhead, while remunerating contributors with valuable rewards.  Web3 projects can eventually become self-governing and self-marketing. With a sufficiently strong community, a Web3 project can progress along its path toward decentralization and dispense with formal employment or even disband its legal entity, because these are no longer necessary. Marketers should consider the design for a self-marketing system from their first day working on a Web3 project but they also need to know that the road to implementing it may be long. Before a community can grasp onto an incentive structure to take over essential functions, projects need to solve the zero-to-one problem of driving discovery for their product and attracting members in the first place. The following sections will cover the steps required to generate initial traction, stewarding that traction into a self-marketing system and specific strategies shown to work along the way.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Amanda Cassatt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/03/wondering-what-web3-means-listen-to-ethereums-first-marketer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de6b79117df865e050e26cc3d5340bf7192a5f37-1446x813.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
11389040,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525440,1680552026,"Green Support At $27,000: Bitcoin’s Key Level As Retrace Looms","Bitcoin (BTC) remains in consolidation mode, trading within a fully formed range between $27,500 and $28,000. While the cryptocurrency has been unable to break through its toughest resistance wall, it has found solid support at the $27,000 level. While the support level at $27,000 has given bullish traders hope for another attempt to reach the $30,000 mark, the potential for a retrace to find bullish momentum and strength to breach the higher high resistance still looms. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Could Break Above $0.5 Very Soon, Here’s Why A Matter Of Time Before Bitcoin Sweeps The Lower Levels? Bitcoin may face a potential pullback and test support levels at $27,000, the previously gained support of $25,200, or even lower. However, there is still a bullish scenario for the cryptocurrency despite these short-term fluctuations. The $25,000 support region aligns with the 50-day moving average (MA). This provides a significant threshold to prevent further declines and could serve as a bounce-back point for Bitcoin to reach new highs. On the other hand, crypto analyst Justin Bennett believes that Bitcoin will eventually retest the $20,000 price level, regardless of whether it makes another push toward $30,000 in the short term. Bennett suggests that is simply the nature of Bitcoin, which is known for its high volatility. The chart above shows that there is currently a significant amount of liquidity available below the $20,000 mark, specifically within the range of $18,000 to $19,500. While this liquidity could fuel Bitcoin if it retraces to those levels, it poses a potential risk for the cryptocurrency. BTC At A Critical Moment According to crypto analysis firm Material Indicator, Bitcoin’s current price range is marked by a “ladder” of ask liquidity, descending from the $29,000 to $30,000 range to the active trading range. This suggests significant selling pressure at the higher end of the range, preventing Bitcoin from breaking above the $30,000 resistance level. On the other hand, Material Indicators have identified new bids appearing around the $27,600 level, indicating support to maintain the current range and make another attempt at reaching $30,000. This suggests that there is still a bullish sentiment in the market, despite the current range-bound price movements. According to the analyst team at Material Indicators, Bitcoin has made three failed attempts to surpass the higher high resistance level. However, despite these attempts, there has not been a confirmed breakout or breakdown from the current price range. The price has been rejected at various points, resulting in choppy price movements within the range. Overall, the appearance of new bids at this level indicates that some investors are willing to buy Bitcoin at this price, which can help provide support and potentially drive the price higher, which will confirm the new trend of Bitcoin and further confidence in BTC.

The fundraise will help Li.Fi execute its long-term strategy, which aims to bring more users to Web3 by enabling tokens and orders to trade across any chain in a seamless way, Philipp Zentner, CEO at LI.FI told CoinDesk in an interview.  The importance of decentralized finance (DeFi) has reemerged as a trending topic in crypto after the collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX. Investment firm Bernstein published a research note last month that said a decentralize finance (DeFi) revival was in the works, which is “far more sustainable, scalable, transparent and with improving token economics.”  Berlin-based Li.Fi helps developers navigate the increasingly fragmented collection of layer 1, layer 2 and layer 3 blockchains, the bridges that connect them and the decentralized exchanges that all exist in decentralized finance (DeFi). The firm offers an application programming interface (API) that developers can build on to create prototypes and go to market faster.  “For anyone who wants to build on that front-end infrastructure – and the also fragmented liquidity – it's a lot of integration overhead,” explained Zentner. “And that's a huge fallacy of sunk costs. You don’t know what is still up and running or what systems are getting breached or hacked. Systems can be out of liquidity. There might be a strategic change and you have to adopt the new ecosystem.”  “There's a lot of integration maintenance involved, and we take on that part by aggregating the most crucial DeFi infrastructure,” he continued.  Other participants in the round included Bloccelerate, L1 Digital, Circle, Factor, Perridon, Theta Capital, Three Point Capital, and Abra, among others.

Polygon, which began as a blockchain project in 2017, has been garnering mass-market attention as early as last year. The platform has already been tapped by some big brands, including Starbucks, Salesforce and Disney.  “There has always been this urge between people who are actually building in the Web3 space that there is no large-scale adoption for Web3 as of yet,” Nailwal said.  With Polygon, he said, consumer-facing companies can expand the ways in which they “interact and engage with their customers.” He pointed to Reddit as an example of a company that has already tapped Polygon as it looks to continue expanding its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.  Nailwal said that reaching mass adoption will ultimately come down to the benefits that Web3 applications can provide, such as self-custody and the ownership of digital collectibles. Starbucks’ Odyssey program, for instance, combines customer loyalty rewards with NFTs, as well as gamified elements.  Mass adoption could also lead to friendlier regulation, Nailwal suggested.  “If there are large-scale usage of these apps and people see that there is actual value being created with Web3 applications, the regulators will come along and they will see that this is a legitimate industry,” he said.

42421272,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmQ9,1680543940,Sen. Warren’s ‘Anti-Crypto Army’ Is Just the Beginning of Crypto’s Politicization,"We’re heading into an election year and crypto’s moment on the campaign circuit seems imminent.  On March 20, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who will likely seek the GOP nomination for president, announced legislation to prohibit the use of a federally controlled central bank digital currency, or CBDC, in the state. Soon after, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) introduced legislation to prohibit the Federal Reserve from developing a direct-to-consumer CBDC that could be used as a financial surveillance tool by the federal government with two other Republican co-sponsors.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Then, last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted from her campaign account that she was building an “Anti-crypto Army.”  So if you were under any suspicion that crypto wasn’t political, then I’m sure that suspicion is now shattered. Crypto is politicized.  DeSantis made it about political parties with his office announcing that the legislation is an attempt to protect “Floridians from the Biden administration’s weaponization of the financial sector through a CBDC.” He said that “a centralized bank digital currency is about surveillance and control.”  Cruz didn’t make it about political parties and instead leaned into the importance of financial privacy and the global dominance of the U.S. dollar as a matter of national security. This itself is interesting because that’s exactly the point at the center of Warren’s anti-crypto stance, which includes new anti-money-laundering bills and tamping down on sanctions evasion.  Hence the perceived effectiveness of Warren’s anti-crypto army. She has allies across the aisle like Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) making her anti-crypto campaign less of a left-leaning campaign and more of a this-is-for-the-good-of-the-country-leaning campaign.  See also: 4 Reasons Why US Lawmakers Shouldn't Back Sen. Warren's Latest Crypto Bill | Opinion  Warren will likely get other Republicans on board with this type of campaign because it is being touted as a measure to prevent money laundering and it’s probably pretty difficult to be a member of Congress and appear to support money laundering.  Where crypto’s politicization will get more interesting is specifically on the topic of CBDCs and Bitcoin in the shadow of the current banking crisis.  CBDCs and invasion of privacy  Warren is pro-CBDC, saying last year in an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd:  “Instead of bitcoin, we could be talking about digital currency, that’s something totally different, because that’s a government-backed electronic transfer … but that has something that backs it up.” She added later, “If you think: We can improve that in a digital world? The answer is, sure you could, but in that case, let’s do a CBDC.”  If history is a guide, if CBDCs enter the political discourse this coming election cycle, it will become a red-blue issue. Conservatives have already begun coming out as anti-CBDC because its introduction could allow the government to surveille and potentially censor regular, law-abiding Americans. Liberals could then align as pro-CBDC because private (meaning non-government) cryptocurrencies enable money laundering and don’t offer the same government-assured backstop a CBDC would.  Of course, the conversation around CBDCs should be bipartisan: If a CBDC enables unfettered surveillance of financial transactions, then all Americans should make it a priority to block that. Privacy is incredibly important.  Bitcoin and crypto in the shadow of bank failures  When it comes to bitcoin and crypto in the context of the current trouble in the banking industry, there is another battle line forming, although it’s a bit more hazy than the CBDC line. As banks have failed, Bitcoin has emerged as a potential avenue to opt out of the current system, which was spurred on by the Federal Reserve’s mismanagement of the economy.  What’s more, Cruz himself likes Bitcoin (and thinks the Left hates it) because it cannot be controlled by the long arm of a liberal government. But if Bitcoin is a means to opt out of the banking system and out of the U.S. dollar system, that could be viewed as anti-American. What a bind!  Really, the crypto question politicians will answer on the campaign trail is: “What do we use digital currencies for?”  See also: Elizabeth Warren's New Financial Surveillance Bill Is a Disaster | Opinion  The moment a Democrat talks about a CBDC or some sort of U.S. government digital currency the Republicans will call Democrats anti-American because they want to surveille regular Americans.  The moment a Republican says something positive about bitcoin the Democrats will say that it is un-American since it threatens U.S. dollar hegemony and dominance and existence.

42412441,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4wqO,1680543307,"Arbitrum Airdrop Shows Interest in DeFi, Researcher Says","Banking jitters in traditional markets and the crackdown by regulators on centralized exchanges may be prompting users to turn to decentralized-finance apps, said Pedro Herrera, head of research at DappRadar, an online store for decentralized applications, or dapps.  “If you start to see how these use cases for DeFi start fitting and give you more autonomy to basically manage your own assets and investments, it’s the answer to why DeFi is [being] highly used,” Herrera told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday.  A new report by DappRadar found that the total value locked for DeFi during the first quarter rose by 37% to $83.3 billion from $60 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.  Part of the increase was due to layer 2 network Arbitrum's airdrop of its ARB token last month. The airdrop also marked Arbitrum’s shift to a decentralized autonomous organization structure that gives token holders more input in securing a network, something that's becoming more popular in the wake of bank failures in the U.S. and regulatory actions against centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.  Projects like Arbitrum “are creating a sense of loyalty and engagement within their community,” Herrera said, which can then in turn “engage developers to build better products,” and ultimately, draw more users into the project.

11383986,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525428,1680543010,"Bitcoin SOPR Plunges, Why This Could Be Bullish","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has plunged recently; here’s why this may be bullish for the price. Bitcoin SOPR Observed A Deep Plunge In Recent Days As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, many investors have sold at a loss recently. The “SOPR” is an indicator that tells us whether investors are currently selling at a loss or a profit. This metric looks at the on-chain history of each coin being sold or moved to see the price at which it was previously transferred. If this last selling price for any coin was less than the price it’s being sold, then the investor realizes a profit with the sale. Similarly, the coin’s being sold at a loss in the opposite scenario. When the value of this indicator is greater than 1, it means the number of profits being realized is greater than the losses right now. This suggests that the average investor is moving coins at a profit. On the other hand, the metric having a value below this threshold implies loss realization is more dominant in the market. Naturally, the SOPR being equal to 1 suggests the holders break even on their selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Over? This Historic On-Chain Signal Suggests So Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have dipped quite low recently | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR has been above 1 for much of the year 2023 so far. This means that the average investor has been selling at a profit during this period. This trend makes sense, as the asset’s price has observed some strong bullish momentum in the last few months. Rallies like these naturally entice investors to harvest their gains, hence why profit selling spikes during such price surges. However, the indicator saw a sharp plunge a couple of days back, and its value dipped below the 1 level. This suggests that some holders have just realized a large number of losses. In the chart, the quant has marked the points where similar downward spikes in the metric were observed during the last few years. Interestingly, whenever the indicator has sharply plummeted, the price has bottomed out and followed up with a rise. Such spikes in the Bitcoin SOPR are usually a sign of capitulation from the loss holders. When these investors finally sell, coins move toward holders with stronger convictions, and the selling pressure starts getting exhausted. This is likely why the price bottoms out close to such capitulation events. Earlier in the current rally, when BTC had also plunged below the $20,000 mark, the SOPR saw such a spike. The latest stretch in the rally, which has taken the price above $28,000, followed it. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought 1.47 Billion DOGE In Q1 2023: Santiment If this same pattern that has been seen time and time again repeats for the latest SOPR plunge as well, then Bitcoin could feel a bullish effect from it. However, something different about the recent loss selling is that it has come while the price has already been at a relatively high levels of $28,000. All the previous instances of this trend came when the price had been facing a bearish wind overall. It remains to be seen whether this difference may lead to a different outcome for the price this time. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,100, up 4% in the last week.

Bitcoin Addresses With At Least 1 BTC Stand At Near 1 Million According to Look Into Bitcoin data, the number of holders with at least 1 BTC has steadily increased. This could suggest that despite price volatility, the coin has been finding traction and being adopted by supporters, including entities and governments. Parallel data from BitInfoCharts reveals that of all the circulating supply, individuals with more than 1 BTC comprise less than 3% of all addresses. As an illustration, addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC stood at 14,004, representing 0.03%. Only four addresses held between 100,000 and 1 million BTC. The tracker revealed that most BTC addresses had between 0.0001 and 0.001 BTC. Bitcoin whales were mostly exchanges, with one wallet associated with Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange holding 248,597 BTC. Another by Bitfinex, one of the earliest crypto exchanges, held 178,010 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back Above $28,000, But DXY Spoils Short-Term Outlook In late October 2010, less than 60,000 unique addresses held 1 BTC. However, this has increased by almost 15X in the last 12 years, signaling acceptance. A noteworthy observation, in this case, is that the number of holders with at least 1 BTC has been steadily rising despite a sharp increment in price. Throughout 2020 and 2021, BTC holders kept accumulating, unfazed by rapidly increasing prices following governments’ intervention to mitigate the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, dropping prices catalyzed demand and accumulation for proponents during the last crypto winter. There was a noticeable increase in BTC addresses last year when prices tanked to as low as $15,000 in Q4 2022, triggered by the collapse of several CeFi platforms, like Voyager and Three Arrow Capital (3AC). The bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX broke Bitcoin, forcing it to a 2022 low of around $15,000. Since that time, the cryptocurrency has bounced to its current levels. Network Resilience And BTC Adoption Bitcoin is a public network enabling users to move value, even across borders, without needing a third party. All BTC transactions are bundled into a block, confirmed, and sent to a different address at any time. In this way, users can send funds fir a low fee without the intervention of a third party, such as a bank or money transfer agency. The Bitcoin network remains one of the most resilient, with an uptime close to 100%. The network has been continuously operating since launching in early 2009.

The platform will allow companies to raise capital by issuing digital bonds on a blockchain network with the aim of improving “efficiency and enabling real-time data synchronization,” according to a statement received by email. Users will be able to manage securities and raise capital through smart contracts.  The project joins others applying similar technology to conventional markets.

42421078,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRgr,1680536636,Cassandra Rosenthal: Web3 and AI Is the Next Chapter in Storytelling,"When it comes to next-generation storytelling, Cassandra Rosenthal has a pretty good idea of how far we’ve come on the road to Web3.  A film and television producer, she is one of the creatives behind the popular Web3 entertainment firm Kaliedoco, where she is redefining storytelling with the use of augmented reality. For her, the world is now in a crucial transition between Web2 to Web3. Or as she calls it, Web 2.5.  Cassandra Rosenthal is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus Festival.  “A lot of times when we talk about the web, Web1 one is about broadcasting, Web2 is about subscription and services and Web3 is about ownership,” she says. “And so for me the whole thing about being able to have a voice. It's being able to as a community make decisions together.”  With Kaleidoco, Rosenthal and her partner Jennifer Tuft are bringing users to the footsteps of metaverse by providing opportunities to explore AR blockchain gaming, mixed reality storyliving and interactive NFTs. Their aim is simple: Move people into the Web3 world through great stories.  “In general we have been changing as a society in the way we actually digest content,” she says. “I think that Web3 is just the next chapter in that. We're now utilizing new technology like mixed reality and augmented reality to bring people into the story and have that sensorial effect with it.”  As cool as that sounds, Web3 storytelling comes with its fair share of troubles. Many have even criticized AI for lacking human autonomy, the ability to choose for oneself. But this is not enough to shake Rosenthal’s confidence in it.  “What we do is we're utilizing AI to actually give our characters an understanding of the real world. We're enabling the characters to have contextual awareness of their environment.”  With an argument that strong, we’re sure storytellers (and the rest of us) can use Cassandra’s secret to dominating the entertainment industry, supporting creative visions and most importantly, to not be afraid of taking risks.  This interview has been lightly edited.  Let’s start with Helena. What piqued your interest in it?  I come from a film and TV producing background and all my life I've always been very passionate about human issues and environmental issues. For me, storytelling was a way to help bring a larger audience to these issues. And so when I met Henry Elkus [Helena’s CEO] and Sam Feinburg [Helena’s chief operating officer] for the first time, I was super inspired by what they were doing, and I thought it was incredible work. I actually met them when they first started the organization and I said look, I'd love to help you guys because I really believe in what you're putting together here. I think it has a chance to not only bring great minds all over the world together, but to actually solve problems.  What was that nudge to move to Web3 and try something completely new?  For me, Web3 also touches on the ethos of community. How do you have ownership of your own identity? What does that mean? You know, we've been living in a world where in the typical kind of Web2 scenario, you're a product, and they decide how they're going to and what they're going to advertise. A lot of times when we talk about the web, where Web1 one is about broadcasting, Web2 is about subscription and services and then Web3 is about ownership. And so for me the whole thing about being able to have a voice. It's being able to as a community make decisions together, and more ideally it is about how do we work together and inspire each other in a positive way. And I feel like Web3 has a lot of opportunities for that.  We're in a transition between Web2 and Web3 and we can go one direction or the other. So what better time than now than to have a voice where we can say no. To say that we as a community want to actually build something different to what we've learned from our past. And now as we enter into the new Web3 we are able to make better choices, right. That's been a big driving force as to why I entered Web3.  Could you or would you ever go “Full Web3,” as in does Web3 have all the same social/content creation/distribution channels you need to sustain yourself?  It is a new learning curve, and especially now with phones and computers people are digesting content in much smaller form format. Like it's rare to see somebody sitting and reading a newspaper these days. People like short-form content and they like things at their fingertips. So in general we have been changing as a society in the way we actually digest content. I think that Web3 is just the next chapter in that. We're now utilizing new technology like mixed reality and augmented reality to bring people into the story and have that sensorial effect with it. I think there's great ways to utilize Web3 and the way that you secure and validate certain content. But what I do like to say is we're not quite there yet. We're not quite in Web3, we are in Web 2.5.  How do you feel about AI lacking human autonomy? How do you see this problem solving?  AI is such a wonderful subject. I love it. And I think there's a lot of wonderful positive uses of AI. I think that a lot of people are seeing right now with GPT how quickly AI can grow. And that's just touching the surface of what AI can provide for us. There are a lot of wonderful uses of AI like health care diagnoses and being able to access information faster so that we can be more productive.  As for storytellers, we’re thinking, how can our stories come alive? How do we interact with our stories? And what we do is we're utilizing AI to actually give our characters an understanding of the real world. We're enabling the characters to have contextual awareness of their environment. When you have a digital character that comes alive in augmented reality and in your own world. You're like, oh, wow, I can actually feel this! This character is utilizing AI to have an understanding of me and my life.  Especially the younger generation, they get so excited about the idea of having, like, their digital sidekick or their digital best friends. They're, like, Oh my god, it's so much fun! And there's also beautiful things like mental health, right? Mental health is a big issue and one we don't talk about enough. You know, to have to be able to have a digital character that understands you in that way that potentially you can have this interaction with ... It can also be very helpful for people who are maybe suffering from depression or dealing with certain things. So it really brings those characters to life.  Your work has touched on a lot of subjects – human rights campaigns, energy crises. Where do you find inspiration?  I am very drawn towards hard subjects and I had the fortunate experience of growing up in Indonesia as an American woman. As a little girl I was exposed to many different cultures, and I was not sheltered by any means. My parents were very much about spending time with local people and spending time with different types of families.  Because I was able to have that at a very young age, I was also able to see what people were going through, and for me it was always about not ignoring it. It was about how do we help? How do we build things that help the community build a better life for everyone? Obviously I'm very passionate about womens’ subjects. And it's not just about women. It's also about how men support women, right? My business partner is also the same. She's very passionate in the same way and that makes us like a really great team.  The vision was to understand how we blend technology and entertainment. If you're going to reach a large audience, how do you do that in a way that they understand and can respond and can feel something? Right now, the audience is very overwhelmed by everything that's going on around them. It's like, they don't know which way to turn in. And, frankly, I've also had that feeling when I started to get into Web3. It was a whole world out there and you don't know where to start. It can be very overwhelming for the general consumer. So for me, it is an inspiration of being able to be able to tell these stories and to bring people into the Web3 world through these great stories.  Do you have advice specifically for women creators?  Don't be afraid. Women often are fearful of utilizing their voice because of how they might be judged. Just be authentic. Be true. And, do not let judgment get in the way.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | AR,Prachi Vashisht,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/03/web3-cassandra-storytelling,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df652d30a353c9761484afc781612bae4238cdb7-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11381992,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525394,1680535834,"Cardano (ADA) Could Break Above $0.5 Very Soon, Here’s Why","Cardano (ADA) is one of the cryptocurrencies that is still holding quite well despite the current crypto market climate. The digital asset has seen an incredible run since 2023 started and has not let up since then. As ADA continues to trend in the green, bullish indicators are piling up for the cryptocurrency, suggesting that its run is far from over. The Last Piece Of The Cardano Puzzle Is Here One thing that has always been associated with Cardano is the constant development that has been going on with the blockchain. Now, the network has been the butt of many jokes in the crypto industry with some calling it a ‘ghost chain’ or a ‘zombie chain’ but that has not deterred its development team from keeping up with its roadmap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Remain Greedy Despite Low Momentum, Why? The next stage in Cardano’s roadmap which is the Voltaire upgrade is scheduled to take place later this year. Now, with Voltaire, Cardano plans to become a fully decentralized blockchain. This means that, unlike other proof of stake networks, the blockchain will no longer be dependent on Input Output Global (IOG), the developer behind Cardano. The roadmap describes the ‘Age Of Voltaire’ as “the final pieces required for the Cardano network to become a self-sustaining system.” With Voltaire will come governance for the network, meaning that ADA holders will now be able to vote on proposals, as well as a treasury system that will be implemented. Developers of the network plan to put Cardano’s future in the hands of the community. This way, stakers will vote on important developments, effectively driving and controlling the future of the blockchain. ADA stuck in a tug-of-war for the $0.4 level | Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com Why ADA Could Continue To Rally Over the years, whenever there was a new development for Cardano, the price of ADA has always rallied. In the case of the Alonzo Upgrade which brought smart contracts capabilities to the blockchain, the price of ADA had risen to a new all-time high of $3.10. Related Reading: Here Are The Altcoins That Are Outperforming Bitcoin Given this, the expectation is that ADA is going to rise as the upgrade draws closer, which has been the case so far. The coin is now battling bears at the $0.4 level, making this the important resistance to beat. If the bulls succeed, then ADA is primed for a rally toward $0.5. However, if the digital asset were to fall below $0.35 once more, it would be devastating for it as it would trigger a quick descent back to $0.3. ADA is currently moving against the crypto bear trend with 3.46% gains in the last 24 hours that have brought its price to $0.4. Its trading volume is also up significantly, rising 59% to approximately $450 million in one day.

42421275,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmTF,1680532576,The Crypto Industry Needs to Fix Itself Before It Can Progress,"Crypto is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place, and there’s a lot of blame to go around.  Choose the culprits: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and their panoply of lawsuits, the U.S. Congress’ inability to pass any significant blockchain law, a lackluster Biden administration ""Economic Report of the President"" with 30 pages bashing the industry, the closure of two of the most crypto-friendly U.S. banks (Signature and Silicon Valley Bank), the Terra implosion and its ripple effects, the FTX failure and its ripple effects, the ongoing flurry of decentralized finance (DeFi) exploits in vulnerabilities, blockchain bridges failures, token prices tanking, increased negative public opinion, decreased institutional holdings – just to name major ailments facing the blockchain industry today.  William Mougayar is a venture capitalist and author of ""The Business Blockchain.""  While some of these can be classified as “they did this to us,” others are clearly in the “we did this to ourselves” bucket.  One could easily argue the increased heat coming from external sources is the result of the internal mess for which the industry itself was responsible. Judging by the timing between the internally originated issues and the rise of external pressures, there is reason to believe in a strong cause and effect relationship between these types of factors.  The crypto/blockchain industry didn’t intend to create spectacular failures as part of its evolution, but it happened. Although no one expected the industry to grow flawlessly (as no revolution is orderly), the scope of hiccups and frequent meandering have been excessively distracting and damaging, despite the fact that, fundamentally, the blockchain’s promise was un-dented.  Read more: CoinDesk Editorial: It Sure Looks Like the U.S. Is Trying to Kill Crypto  As I look around to take some perspective, I see three reasons why the industry is in the doldrums.  The first one is the SEC’s onslaught on the industry. The second is Congress’ inability to pass any laws that might set the industry in a significantly new direction, or even slow down the SEC rampage. These are well-known reasons, but they are a prelude to the third one.  There is no point re-hashing details around these two factors except for a couple of observations.  Pertaining to the SEC, then-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s donation bread crumbs pointed to the Democratic Party, and that was a vexing situation which SEC Chair Gary Gensler saw as an opportunity to vindicate his party by turning up the volume on enforcement actions, therefore erasing the belief that Democrats were not strong enough on crypto regulation.  Ironically, the SEC acronym might as well stand for Sue Everyone in Crypto.  As for the U.S. Congress, the blockchain has been uncharted territory. Its members are not well informed on crypto. Perhaps 95% of Congress continues to be challenged by the blockchain and they still have a steep learning curve about it, despite some efforts to cram knowledge.  Both the SEC and U.S. Congress are the crypto rainmakers today. But if there was a race for change, the SEC wins hands down because it has been much more nimble than the Congress. While the Congress sees one bill after another pass through the two chambers like a revolving door (over 50 bills have been proposed in the past two years), the SEC already has a playbook on which it can act. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress continues proposing bills by throwing darts on a board.  Mirror, mirror on the wall  This brings us to the third factor, and it is related to us, the industry.  So, let’s look at ourselves in the mirror because we are also part of the problem.  Let’s stop giving pundits, regulators or politicians free ammunition to mount attack after attack on crypto. Those critics have been feasting on crypto’s mishaps of the past year, to the point where they want to define us by our failures and not by our successes, potentials or benefits.  We have already seen the blueprints and patterns of failures. Can we identify them earlier and squish them before they can be systemically damaging? Can we call out bad actors early and often?  Can we improve by a factor of 10 on smart contract vulnerabilities and not leave one hole unplugged?  Read more: Michael J Casey - The Biden Administration Is Politicizing Crypto  Can we stop the creation and pumping of useless tokens that have no future but to scam uninformed consumers?  Can we intelligently discriminate between good projects and bad ones? At least, could we leave the early parts of their journey in the domain of private investors and shield consumers from the extreme risks that accompany any startup project?  Can we raise the compliance and transparency standards for token projects such that there is consistency and relevancy across their disclosures, similar to how public companies report their progress?  Can we work on real industry interoperability standards such that a user doesn’t need to choose which blockchain layer to send their transaction on? (Imagine if you had to choose an internet subnet each time you connect the internet.)  Maybe there is too much ""finance"" in crypto and blockchain, which make it an easy target for regulators and legislators because that's all they see and all they pick on. Could we go back to working on, and highlighting, user-based use cases in mobile apps and websites?  Could we place a moratorium on new tokens for a year? It might help shift the conversation away from regulation and lawsuits and more towards Web3 adoption.  Can the media do more investigative journalism to dig up the more interesting projects instead of being an echo chamber that regurgitates and rewrites the same news day in and day out?  Could we build killer use cases with mainstream user experiences so we can stop being on the defensive and start showcasing the real potentials of the blockchain beyond just price speculations and stock market-like activity?  Could there be more “build with no code” solutions so that nontechnologists are empowered to create blockchain-based features and integrate capabilities into their own businesses, as easily as it is to build a website, add a Wordpress plugin or a Shopify widget to launch a new capability?  We can point to regulators and government all we want, but we also need to start fixing a few things ourselves.

WNDR shares have surged following the announcement, currently up 43.75% at 23 Canadian cents in early trading. Kevin O'Leary is a strategic investor in WonderFi.  The merger would be the affirmation of separate plans among the three firms in recent months. In January, it was reported that WonderFi and Coinsquare were in advanced talks to combine. This came only days after Coinsquare terminated a previous agreement to acquire CoinSmart.  As one combined company, the exchanges believe they ""have the scale to be the market leader in Canada, a strong balance sheet that will allow for expansion, and a clear path to profitability,"" WonderFi President Dean Skurka said.

The crypto market experienced a large pullback from the hype during 2021. Overall the market has still seen a large increase. Coinbase is my pick for cryptocurrency going forward. If you think crypto currency is sticking around the Coinbase makes a good buy. The stock price has risen significantly this year but I think there are still good opportunities to buy. I am a long term holder of Coinbase ( COIN ). I will say I typically lean towards fundamental analysis and value stock when buying stocks. The last handful of years of investing have taught me to also not overlook the growth plays and especially some of the longer term growth plays. I am a long term holder of Coinbase and my reasons are not necessarily grounded in their current financials. More so in the potential that I see in the company. Although I think the company has made the appropriate moves to improve their financial position. I prefer a growth stock that is either making a profit or at least showing the signs of reaching that point. So why am I a long term holder of Coinbase? The reason is simple. The future growth potential of the company. I think crypto is here to stay. It is still in the early stages of adoption. There are lots of potential future revenue channels for the company. I guess the real question is are you a believer in crypto as a whole. I am not saying a believer in Bitcoin or Ethereum, but in crypto itself. If so then I think Coinbase is the stock to buy. I will discuss some of the reasons why I choose Coinbase and the potential I see. Why Coinbase over Competition Coinbase is not the cheapest route when it comes to purchasing crypto currencies. There are lots of other platforms that are much cheaper to buy and sell crypto. In my opinion, the biggest advantage that Coinbase has is their user interface. It is far superior for the average buyer vs the competition. I know this is merely an opinion and many might disagree. I have used multiple platforms to buy crypto. Some are better than Coinbase if you are an active trader (although Coinbase offers a pro version for traders as well). But in terms of making it easy for the average investor to go on and buy crypto there is not a better platform. It is simple to navigate and they make the buying process as easy as possible. You simply put the amount of dollars you want to convert to whichever crypto you choose and they do the math to purchase the equivalent amount of crypto. While this seems simple, many platforms do not make this so easy. You have to choose how much of the crypto you want to buy and do the math as to how many dollars. I think user interface and ease of use is often underestimated. If a consumer has a good experience then they are much more likely to use and recommend your product. Quick note, Coinbase has a pro version which is built for traders. It offers more analytics and lower fees for those trading more frequently. Another advantage they have is that they are reputable. The FTC noted that there were $680 million reported cryptocurrency fraud losses in 2021. You should definitely research a crypto before purchasing. From the beginning Coinbase has helped in this process. The cryptos that are available to purchase on Coinbase have been vetted to help mitigate issues with scams. This frustrates some users as the hot new crypto may not be available to purchase. It has not gone through the vetting process or does not meet the standards and is therefore unavailable to purchase. This is lost money to the company as many would purchase the hot new trend but in the long run I think it pays itself off. Coinbase Pro does offer a wider selection of cryptos to trade. Everyone should research a crypto before purchasing. If we are being honest, we know many are not researching before purchasing. Coinbase is able to provide a layer of protection against scams. This will build long term trust with many investors and help grow their platform. Crypto Lumps and Bumps The crypto market as a whole is still in the early stages. 2021 was a momentum year for the industry as a whole. The retail trading frenzy really took hold in the crypto market. There was more than $14 trillion in trading volume through centralized crypto exchanges in 2021. That is a 689% increase in trading volume compared to 2020. The numbers looked even better for decentralized exchanges, seeing an increase of 858 percent in trading volume from the prior year. Trading rose from $115 billion in 2020 to $1 trillion in 2021. Then along came 2022 and everything changed. The market as a whole entered a risk-off mode. High growth and loss making companies saw a steep sell off. Crypto currency fell in with that bucket. As they say we entered the “crypto winter”. It has been a long winter for that matter. Many in the industry are wondering if spring is ever going to come or not. Trading volume dropped off from 2021. The trough bottomed in December of 2022 hitting the lowest volume in 2 years. This bottom can be directly related to the collapse of FTX. FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. FTX was one of the fastest growing crypto currency exchanges. It was also one of the largest. For the USD support exchange, FTX went from a market share of 2.72% in June of 2020 to a nearly 29% market share just two years later in June 2022. The collapse of FTX sent waves through the crypto market. Being one of the largest players in the space it caused a lot of doubt about the crypto market as a whole. This helped drive trading volume to the lowest level it had seen in two years. The graph below shows this bumpy ride experienced in the crypto market. Also you can see the steady decline over the last year. Cryptocompare.com ( Crypto exchanges finish 2022 with the lowest volumes in two years ) The trend does not look favorable. Trading volume has been on a decline for the whole of 2022. Now not all is bad in the chart. When you compare 2022 to 2020 you can see a massive increase. The frenzy that occurred in 2021 may have died down but the market is now substantially larger than it was in 2020. The growth trend has also turned from negative to positive to start 2023. December of 2022 had trading volume of 467.86b, it has since steadily increased over the last three months, climbing to 797.23b, 878.42b, and 983.42b in the months of January, February, and March, respectively. I think we are going to continue to experience a more steady growth rate for the crypto market. The crypto craze of 2021, and really the market as a whole, was something else to witness. Many of those who jumped in on the hype have been washed out of the market or are choosing to merely hold rather than try and buy each and every new crypto that enters the market. I think it makes for a much more stable market going forward. The drop off in trading volume is obviously going to have an effect on Coinbase. They make most of their money when people buy and sell crypto. So if the volume is down so will be their income. We will review through the effects on Coinbase directly in a later section of the analysis. Crypto Ownership It is hard to nail down the exact estimate on the percentage of people trading crypto. Pew Research estimated that 16% of Americans had invested or traded crypto. NBC News estimated that 21% of Americans owned crypto currency at the end of 2022. There are differences in the results based upon who performed the study. One thing is for sure, there has been strong user growth. Regardless of the data point you choose, there is still a lot of room for growth. In comparison, 56% of American adults own stock. There are also some strong demographic benefits to crypto markets growing. Young adults are the most likely to own crypto. Their incomes are growing. Also the younger generation is also much more likely to own crypto. As they begin their careers and investing then they are more likely to invest than the older generation. Pew Research also notes that 42% of men from the ages 18-29 have used cryptocurrency. Data from The Finder notes that 44% of crypto is held by millennials, 28.6% by Gen X, and 17.8% by Gen Z. Millennials own 44% of cryptos yet only make up 5% of the nation’s wealth. Data from Bankrate is also skewed towards the younger generation: 13% held by Gen Z, 58% by millennials, 20% by GenX, and 10% by baby boomers. I believe this bodes well for the trajectory of crypto. Assuming that wealth will pass down to the next generations (which seems like a safe assumption to me). Another interesting data point is that crypto is picking up many of the individuals that are not investing in the stock market. 35% of crypto accounts have annual household incomes of under $60k. It is estimated that only 12% of middle class families directly own stock. Profitable to Not So Profitable We can take a look at some of the metrics for Coinbase to get a better understanding of where the company is on a financial basis. During the periods of high trading volume in 2021 Coinbase was making money hand over fist. Then once the market began its rapid decline the company found itself overstaffed and falling into a position of steep losses. We can first look at the revenue drop that the company experienced. This is mostly due to the drop off in trading volume as that is where Coinbase generates the majority of its revenue. The table below outlines the revenues by quarter over the last 2 years. (Financial information taken from quarterly and annual filings) Quarter 2021 Revenue (thousands) 2022 Revenue (thousands) Q1 $1,596,981 $1,164,891 Q2 $2,033,011 $802,603 Q3 $1,234,736 $576,375 Q4 $2,498,462 $629,108 Revenues dropped rapidly. The company was not prepared for that drop off in revenue. Their expenses were still way too high for their revenue and naturally that means the company started to lose money. The table below outlines the EPS for the company over the past 2 years. Quarter Ending EPS 03/31/2021 $3.05 06/30/2021 $6.42 09/31/2021 $1.62 12/31/2021 $3.41 03/31/2022 -$1.98 6/30/2022 -$4.98 09/30/2022 -$2.43 12/31/2022 -$2.44 The company was extremely profitable during 2021. They were not prepared for the slowdown in the market and entered a period of steep losses. Coinbase Rightsizing Coinbase has made different moves to help mitigate these losses. As losses peaked the company realized they were way overstaffed. They cut 1,100 people, or approximately 18% of its workforce, in June of 2022. They then announced in January 2023 that they would cut another 20% of their workforce , or approximately 950 people. This comes following the announcement from the CEO that they were planning to reduce operating expenses by 25%. This is an important step in right sizing the ship. They had overhired for growth that did not only continue but rather the opposite happened and things slowed down. This will bring costs down drastically and help return the company to profitability. How would reducing operating expenses by 25% look? Their operating expenses at the end of 2022 were $5,904,416 thousand. If they were to reduce operating expenses by 25% that would equal savings of $1,476,104 thousand and leave operating expenses for the year at $4,428,312. If the company does not see any growth in revenues (2022 revenues $3,194,208) then even with the 25% reduction in operating expenses they are going to operate at a loss. Coinbase has not provided revenue estimates for the year as revenues have seen such large swings. I think it is likely that Coinbase will see a loss in 2023. Analysts following the company seem to agree with that. Although the company is expected to operate at a loss again this year things seem to have turned in the right direction. The other part to consider is the strength of the balance sheet. Coinbase had $4,425,021 thousand in cash on the books to end the year. It only has $3,393,448 thousand of debt on the books. Free cash flow for 2022 was -$1,649,390 thousand. I do not think the company will experience that large of a loss again as they have taken measures discussed to reduce the losses. Even if it did experience a similar loss for 2023, the company has plenty of runway to operate at a loss without having to dilute or take more debt. Its balance sheet is in a strong position and gives the company time to grow revenues and regain profitability. Unexpected Revenue Gains Another positive is that the company’s revenue sources have been increasing in areas other than transaction revenues. The company saw their subscription and services revenue increase from $517,487 thousand in 2021 to $792,571 thousand in 2022. That is good for a 53% year over year increase. Also with the drop in transaction revenues it has become a much more significant part of revenue. In 2022 the subscription and services revenue made up almost 25% of revenues. That 25% of revenues is seeing growth of 50% year over year. That is a big part of the business growing at a fast rate. Even if transaction revenues stay flat then Coinbase is going to see a solid growth in revenues from the growth in the subscription and services business. Now there has been a lot made about the subscription and services revenue. Mostly concerning the SEC crackdown on “staking”. Coinbase could lose their revenue from staking. In February, “crypto exchange Kraken agreed to shut down its US cryptocurrency staking service and pay $30 million in penalties to settle US Securities and Exchange Commission charges”. On March 22, 2023 Coinbase received a Wells notice from the SEC. Directly from Coinbase’s website: “Today, we are disappointed to share that the SEC gave us a “Wells notice” regarding an unspecified portion of our listed digital assets, our staking service Coinbase Earn , Coinbase Prime, and Coinbase Wallet after a cursory investigation. A Wells notice is the way that SEC staff tells a company that they are recommending that the SEC take enforcement action for possible violations of securities laws. It is not a formal charge or lawsuit, but it can lead to one. Rest assured, Coinbase products and services continue to operate as usual - today’s news does not require any changes to our current products or services.” If you want a good read on what occurs between government agencies and companies go and see the full write up by Coinbase. We could go down a whole rabbit hole on government “oversight”. What gains come from that oversight or what negatives? Who are these government agencies accountable to, since they are not elected? Are they even competent experts in the field? We will leave all that for a political discussion, not here and now. The only politics we want to discuss is how it affects the stock. In this case politics could affect the company revenues directly. A lot of people have banked that Coinbase will lose its staking revenues just like Kraken. This is not a given to start out. It is a possible scenario and the likelihood increased with the Wells notice. The only thing is that staking, referred to in the financial statements as “blockchain rewards”, makes up only a portion of the subscription and services revenue. In 2022 it made up 35% of the subscription and services revenue. While this is not a small percentage, it is not the majority of revenue nor the fastest growing portion. Revenues from staking in 2021 were $223,055 in 2022 they were $275,507; that is growth of 23.5%, whereas the overall growth rate was over 50%. The largest growth driver in the subscription and services revenue was “Interest Income”. It turns out the rising interest rates are helping Coinbase. I did not expect that to be a revenue driver for Coinbase. Rising interest rates are also the main cause of the drastic drop in trading in crypto as many have taken more conservative investments. I guess it was a double edged sword. Rising rates drove transaction revenue down but they have at least provided some form of relief by providing a large increase in interest income. Interest income rose from $25,835 in 2021 to $326,956 in 2022. That is over 10x growth in revenue. That part of the business is not at risk from the SEC like the staking business. Interest income makes up the largest portion of the subscription and services revenue, is the fastest growing, and is much less at risk. If interest rates go down again then the transaction revenue is likely to increase again as well. I believe these two help counteract each other. Lower interest rates help drive the risk on trades. The loss in revenues from staking would for sure be a blow to Coinbase, but I don’t think it would be as dramatic as many have made it out to be. We will have to wait and see how it shakes out with regulators on the staking front. For the time being Coinbase is continuing operations as is, hopefully that is able to continue. Path to Profitability There are some positives coming into the next year. Transaction volume for crypto has started to climb from the lows seen in December 2022. Revenue and losses at the company have also turned a corner and started to recover. I expect to see continued growth within the crypto market and within Coinbase itself. I do not think it will jump right back to the levels that we saw in 2021 or even early 2022, but expect a steady growth from current levels. The price action in Bitcoin provides us with a good indicator. While Bitcoin is not the only crypto it is still the largest and most well known cryptocurrency. The price started the year right around $16,000 and has since increased to right around $28,500, an increase of approximately 78%. I think this is a good indication of the increasing demand for crypto to start the year. I think Coinbase itself will continue to gain market share in the crypto industry as well. We saw this occur with the implosion of FTX. Many of those users may have left the market entirely but many went to another exchange. The chart below shows the increase in market share that Coinbase has been able to achieve following the collapse of FTX. Binance has also found itself in some hot water with regulators. It could push some additional users to Coinbase. The Block I discussed previously why I thought Coinbase would capture market share. I think as more uncertainty enters the market people will gravitate to the more trustworthy platform. I believe that will be Coinbase. Payment Processing There is one thing I have not seen discussed when reading about Coinbase. I think it is one of the largest potential revenue generators for companies in the crypto market. It could bring another revenue source and move Coinbase to the mainstream, as well as crypto. That would be payment processing. I run an online company and we have looked to integrate crypto payments onto our platform. There is no easy clean way to make this happen. There are some options on the market but they are not good systems. There is a lot of money to be made in payment processing. There are two pieces, one is business to business, the other would be business to consumer. As a business owner I can tell you both parts are a hassle and need upending. Business to business payments are still often done by check to avoid the high processing fees that are charged by payment processors. There are other options such as ACH but that system is not without its flaws and there is not a clean platform to use to make this happen. I feel there is a huge business opportunity for companies to jump in on this. I don’t think it is without reason to think crypto could get into it as the transfer fees are minimal. The business to consumer side is mostly a problem due to the fees involved. Most companies still take approximately 3% for each transaction made. That adds up for a retailer and kills margins. If there was a way to perform these payments at lower cost then I think many would be looking to adopt it. The online payment processing market is massive. There are a few different numbers I have seen but they are all very large. Statista estimates that digital payments have a total transaction value of $9.46 trillion in 2022 and projects that number to reach $14.78 trillion by 2027. IR estimates that global digital payments will reach $10.72 trillion by 2025. The market is obviously massive. Stripe, which is still private, is one of the leaders in backend payment processing. In March 2023 it announced a new round of funding with a valuation at $50 billion , that is down from its previous valuation of $95 billion. To give you an idea, Coinbase is currently valued at $17.7 billion. I think this is a massive opportunity for crypto. I think a company like Coinbase would be a likely candidate to make it come to fruition. If they could even capture a small niche part of the market it could provide large revenues. I am not proclaiming to be an expert on blockchain, settlements, and the backend for crypto currencies. I do think it is a matter of time before companies are able to build a clean solid platform for crypto payments. Whoever does is bound to make some money. Risks There are definitely risks with Coinbase. I think the largest risk of all would be government intervention. The SEC seems keen on cracking down on the crypto industry. I think a big part of that is due to FTX. People want oversight and regulation. I don’t know what that regulation will look like but it will most likely not be a positive. I think Coinbase has been ahead of the game on this front and have been very transparent and upfront with regulation and regulators. It is one of the reasons I prefer it over other crypto companies. Regardless, if the government starts to intervene in the crypto market it could cause some problems for Coinbase. Another risk coming from the government is competition in the form of central bank digital currency ((CBDC)). We have already seen this play out in China. I personally do not agree with CBDC and have 0 intention of adopting this form of payment. I think it goes against the whole nature of crypto in the sense that it is not centrally controlled by a government. I think many who use crypto would agree. That being said, it poses a potential risk and threat to individual cryptos and companies that operate in that space. The other large risk is the continued fall of the crypto industry. Coinbase is only successful if the crypto industry is successful. If the market drops again or if there is more pullback in the space then Coinbase will feel the effects. I personally do not think crypto is going anywhere, unless government attempts to intervene. But that is not to say there is not a risk of it happening. Conclusion I think the crypto market is here to stay. The crypto space took a hit during 2022 but it still saw significant growth compared to a few years ago. I think the crypto market will see a more steady growth pattern going forward. The demographics support crypto growth moving forward. Coinbase took its hits just like the crypto market. It has made appropriate moves to remedy the situation. Coinbase comes across as a professional and trustworthy source for crypto. I think that will help it to grow its market share. I expect the company to continue to grow and return to profitability. I also think there are some potentially large revenue sources that the company could help capture. I think the stock price was overvalued during the manic crypto days. It fell too far and has now seen a solid rebound, increasing by approximately 85% to start the year. Some might say that it has risen too high in the last 3 months, but I think it went down too far and has recovered to a more reasonable price. I am an opportunistic buyer of the stock. There are large price swings in Coinbase. Look for a good entry point and pull the trigger if you want to jump into the crypto sphere.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4591917-coinbase-invest-if-you-believe-in-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11380085.jpeg

Since the local high of around $0.000016 on February 4, all attempts to generate new upward momentum have failed. Now SHIB may be facing a turning point. Fundamentals Support The Shiba Inu Bulls At least the underlying fundamentals provide some hope for the Shiba Inu bulls. As analyst Ali Martinez pointed out via Twitter, Shiba Inu recorded its largest increase in daily active addresses in a year at the end of March. In one day, 35,788 unique SHIB addresses interacted with the network. Generally, network activity is seen as a bullish metric that precedes price increases. Also showing a favorable bias are the SHIB burns. As reported by Shibburn, 6.78 billion SHIB tokens were burned with 540 transactions in the entire month of March. Both the absolute number of SHIB destroyed and the transaction count thus show a significant increase compared to the previous month of February.

In fact, the SHIB price has failed to break the series of lower lows. The April 1 high at $0.00001152 was lower than the March 14 local high. The 1-day chart of SHIB reveals a similar pattern. At the beginning of February 2023, SHIB managed to break out of a downward trend that had lasted since August 2022. However, the price couldn’t maintain its trajectory and fell back below the trend line a few weeks later. The breakout seen in recent days also looks rather weak. SHIB bounced off the key resistance at $0.00001122 and is retesting the trendline today. For SHIB bulls, it is of utmost importance to defend this trend breakout. Otherwise, a retest of the local low at $0.0000965 from March 10 could be imminent.

True to Deaton’s words, the digital asset has proven resilient amid challenges, including regulatory attacks and backlash from crypto industry players. While responding to Coindesk’s tweet, Deaton touted XRP as the most resilient coin in the crypto industry that would survive even a nuclear war as it has been topping charts over the past weeks with impressive gains. The Surge In Dominance Deaton’s latest comments come as XRP records massive rallies with over 60% price increase in two weeks, according to Coindesk’s TV platform reports. This has happened despite XRP facing attacks and criticism from top industry leaders like Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson and Vitalik Buterin. On December 17, 2022, Charles Hoskinson stated that the XRP community is toxic, and petty and will no longer comment on anything concerning the token. His statement came after Buterin labeled the cryptocurrency a shitcoin while responding to Ripple’s Wells submission amid other criticisms. In addition, some Bitcoin maximalists supported the SEC’s move against XRP, calling it a banker’s coin. Related Reading: These Top 5 Meme Coins Are Bleeding As March 2023 Ends – Here’s Why Deaton, who represents thousands of XRP holders as amicus curiae in the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit, made his remarks in light of these criticisms. XRP showed incredible performances in South Korea recently, surpassing Bitcoin in trading volume on top exchanges. Coindesk’s TV platform, featuring its executive director, Emily Parker, highlighted these during the recent broadcast. Parker attributed the asset’s dominance to the increasing demand for the token by South Korean traders. She further noted that the renewed optimism about the expected outcome of the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit also contributed to XRP’s performance. The community, including Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse, are optimistic about the court’s ruling on the lawsuit. This expectation has boosted their confidence in the coin while sparking bullish sentiment among investors. XRP Price Performance Outlook XRP’s price moves started on March 15 when the assets scored some gains, though very slight. The rally became notable when it added 11%, in a day, on March 21 when other coins’ prices were down. These rallies pushed XRP’s price from $0.3606 on March 15 to $0.5454 on March 29, a 60% increase within two weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Loses $28,000 Handle – Is A Retreat In The Offing For BTC? Although XRP experienced a slight pullback, the token still holds more than 15% gains over the past week. Not only that, XRP has recorded a 36.69% price gain over the past 30 days. These moves place XRP ahead of most coins in performance and the highest gainer among the top 20 cryptocurrency assets. XRP is trading at $0.5147, with a 0.54% price increase over the past 24 hours. The asset might climb above the current price level should it maintain its bullish momentum. More so, the token could rally even higher if Ripple emerges victorious in the ongoing SEC lawsuit.

42412431,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4wkm,1680527718,"Internet Computer Issues ‘Liquid Bitcoin,’ for Faster, Cheaper BTC Transactions","The Dfinity Foundation, a significant contributor to the development of the Internet Computer network, on Monday issued ckBTC – a liquid and cost-efficient “twin” token that is backed on a 1:1 basis with bitcoin (BTC).  The development brings layer-2 capabilities to Bitcoin, making it faster and cheaper to transact without compromising security. Layer 2s refer to a secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system.  By integrating directly with the Bitcoin network, ckBTC can be used on decentralized-finance applications on supported networks without relying on centralized bridging services, which are a major security concern.  “ckBTC means low transaction fees, speed, and, most importantly, no bridges,” Dominic Williams, founder of Dfinity, said in a note to CoinDesk. “This is a milestone in the Bitcoin journey, and the Dfinity Foundation is excited to see how projects building on the Internet Computer blockchain implement ckBTC and explore novel use cases.”  But while bitcoin integration unlocks opportunities, it also inherits the slow and expensive transaction times associated with the Bitcoin network. To combat that, Internet Computer has set fees on Liquid Bitcoin to just 0.0000001 ckBTC, or a few cents, at a value significantly lower than Bitcoin network fees.  Unlike wrapped tokens controlled by a centralized entity, ckBTC uses canisters – smart contracts for asset transfers – and doesn't require intermediaries or risky cross-chain bridges. Users deposit real bitcoin to their deposit address and receive an equal amount of ckBTC. Similarly, users can return ckBTC tokens to receive an equal amount of real bitcoin at a specified bitcoin address.  In February, Bitcoin network activity surged to a two-year high thanks to the popularity of the recently deployed Ordinals protocol – which allows non-fungible tokens to be stored on-chain.

11379040,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4591899-bitcoin-thesis-that-no-one-is-talking-about?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1680527289,The Bitcoin Thesis That No One Is Talking About,"Summary BTC is a buy and we don't need the monetary use case to address or justify Bitcoin's value. Its features as a special database are enough. To use Bitcoin, one needs BTC. Only BTC transactions can be used to write to the database. The result is that BTC gains value through its velocity as necessitated by Bitcoin's utility as a special database. We can estimate the value of the database by comparing it to other tech enterprises. This can then be extrapolated to value BTC the cryptocurrency. I explain how this thesis can be wrong. It all hinges on the first point: that the special database is actually useful. People own Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for various reasons. One obvious reason is ""greater fool"" speculation. Another reason is they need a pseudonymous way of transferring value. Another is a belief in its monetary properties or in the value of decentralized self-custody. This article presents something entirely different-where Bitcoin the innovation is the primary subject of discussion. One way of looking at it is that this reason enables the others to manifest, yet it is so often overlooked that even Bitcoin bulls cannot or do not articulate it. I will refer to the Bitcoin network/ blockchain/ database/ technology as ""Bitcoin"" and the individual units of account within the network as ""BTC"" or ""satoshis"" (which is the indivisible unit in Bitcoin's architecture and 1/100,000,000 of a BTC). This differentiation is important because it cuts to some root misunderstandings about Bitcoin. The thesis is simple: Bitcoin is a unique database that beats all other database in each of these features: Public and Accessible - Anyone can access the database at any time. Anyone can add to it provided they follow the rules for doing so. Transparent - The procedure for updating the database is known. Anyone can verify that the procedure is being and has been followed. Secure and Immutable - Once a record is added, it cannot be changed. Also, unless an action comes from the authorized personnel, it literally cannot be added. Uptime and Reliability - 100% uptime for the last 10 years and over 99.98% uptime since inception. Updates are made every 10 minutes on average: predictable and reliable. A remarkable fact is that Bitcoin accomplishes this through a network effect. It gains most of these features by being public in the first place, which attracts more activity and self-reinforces Bitcoin's value proposition. At this point, Bitcoin has too strong of a network effect for competitors to overcome without making a tradeoff that sacrifices some of those qualities. As a result there is a fifth, critical benefit which Bitcoin enjoys-it has an exceedingly strong monopoly over the market for public, accessible, transparent, secure, immutable, reliable, 100% uptime databases. Bitcoin is like an enterprise with a high barrier to entry. The question now becomes: what is the value of such an enterprise? Technical Overview Before we get into valuation, let's see how it actually creates these effects and whether the process is sustainable. Bitcoin accomplishes these features by adding two new innovations- proof-of-work (PoW) and difficulty adjustment (DA)-to two pre-existing inventions: asymmetric cryptography and the Internet. By doing so, Bitcoin forces cooperation between people who do not trust or even know each other. The product of this cooperation is the maintenance and continued existence of the very special database. I'll go into each of the four innovations, in order of general familiarity. The Internet requires no introduction. It allows Bitcoin users to communicate with each other. It is the foundational communication layer of Bitcoin. Asymmetric cryptography ensures people communicating over the Internet are actually who they say they are and that only the intended recipient of messages can read a message. Notably, asymmetric cryptography involves a public key and a private key which are used to encrypt and/or decrypt messages. An individual's private key is known only to him. His public key is known to everyone. The private key can be used to encrypt messages that only the public key can decrypt and vice versa. When you successfully decrypt a message from a person using their public key, you know that it came from that person because only a message encrypted by his private key can be decrypted with his public key. Also, when you want to send a message to someone, you encrypt the message with her public key. No one except her can read the message because only her private key can be used to decrypt the message. The asymmetric design of this kind of cryptography enables convenient security and verifiability because anyone can generate a private and public key pair, keep the private key, publicize the public key, and trust that all future communication using those keys will be secure. From this mechanism, we begin to see an origin of Bitcoin's security. PoW is a twofold concept. First, verifiable work in the form of mathematical computations is a requirement to append to the database. The nature of this work contributes to Bitcoin's immutability and security. The only way to add a new block is through a time-consuming, iterative trial-and-error process that requires referencing all previous blocks while including new transactions. On the other hand, verifying that the work was done correctly is exceedingly simple. Since each new block refers to the existing blocks, once a block is added it cannot be changed after a number of new blocks have been added afterwards. This contributes to immutability. Second, the version of the database that required the most work to create is regarded as the correct version of the database. Since the database at any moment is a chain of blocks, each of which requires a lot of work to append but very little work to check for correctness, the database's current existence represents a statement of verifiable performed work. The only way to change the database after something is recorded is to perform more work than what the entire network has already performed from the moment that something was first recorded to create another version of the database that would then be regarded as correct. It is a catch-up game that has a nearly zero chance of success . Furthermore, anyone can do the work to append to the database. The database incentivizes this behavior because users will pay fees to the person who adds their transactions to the database. This allows Bitcoin to be public and accessible. Also, 100% uptime is maintained because people are always working on it. DA is an undermentioned Bitcoin concept, even among bulls. DA gives Bitcoin its reliability and predictability by adjusting the work required to add blocks such that on average it takes about 10 minutes of work by the entire network to generate a block. DA arguably contributes to efficiency because it gives the entire network plenty of time to process each new block. Because work is performed all over the world, there is a chance that two valid blocks are appended at the same time. This is called a fork in the blockchain-another version of the database. At this point everyone else must decide which block to accept as valid so they can reference that block (and not the other) as they make subsequent blocks. 10 minutes gives the network plenty of time to verify accuracy and make this decision. Without DA, more people doing work will lead to blocks being created more quickly, which raises the possibility of more forks and in the long run brings down the overall efficiency of the network. Also, since security is embedded within the cumulative work performed in a version, creating more forks diminishes the cumulative work within each database version, so it reduces security as well. All of these rules are written into Bitcoin's fully open-source code . Everyone can know exactly how the procedure works and everyone can check that it worked as intended. There is no hidden information anywhere. This is unparalleled transparency. It is important to note that Bitcoin has many shortcomings when compared to other databases. For instance, it is very slow because it only processes about 7 transactions per second and updates the database, in the form of appending blocks of transactions to the blockchain, at a rate of about 10 minutes per block. Also, each block cannot exceed a certain size, which clearly limits the amount of data that can be appended per update. In this respect, OneDrive is much better. Also, Bitcoin cannot process complicated computations or logic based on the data. Cloud computing is better for that. One cannot even ""free up space"" on Bitcoin by deleting stuff so in this regard even a USB from 2003 serves as data storage with more flexibility. But none of these are the market Bitcoin is competing in. Again, it is involved only with public, accessible, transparent, secure, immutable, reliable, 100% uptime databases-a super specific product market fit. So what is that market size and what is Bitcoin's value? The Database's TAM The heart of this thesis lies in what the investor believes is the total addressable market ((TAM)) for a database like Bitcoin. At face value and based upon the database's description, this should be a big market. Many people can derive some benefit from something like this and there are accelerating tailwinds which promote openness and accessibility in public systems. Also, Bitcoin's use of asymmetric cryptography as the ultimate arbiter of ownership has seen increased interest from those living under unfavorable monetary or political regimes. This use case will only increase as more people become aware of Bitcoin's solutions to these issues. Bitcoin can also be used to store data that has nothing to do with financial value transfers. All data are simply 1s and 0s, and they can be inscribed into a Bitcoin transaction and inherit the immutability and security of the database. The recent and highly publicized Ordinals NFTs puts this use case on full display. Metadata, images, and even videos have been inscribed into single satoshis which will remain on the blockchain forever. Current NFT use cases are admittedly fickle. However, the potential for a public, verifiable, and secure ownership record of real-world items-the true value proposition of NFTs-has barely been explored. What's most impressive is that this is only base-layer Bitcoin. The potential to scale via higher layers makes the TAM truly enormous. Higher layers may bundle many different actions into a single addition to the Bitcoin base layer. They can process updates much faster and regularly publish the results of these updates to Bitcoin to create a more secure and permanent record. It is also in these higher layers that users can enjoy greater privacy. In a more extreme bull case, one could imagine Bitcoin as the underlying reference point for a good portion of the Web. There is a market for accessible (or, more suggestively, censorship-resistant) online spaces and a market for immutable online records. Only a database which can guarantee these qualities is well-placed to address these issues. The portions of the Web where users demand such qualities can eventually evolve to route much of its operations, even the ones requiring extremely high throughput, ultimately through the Bitcoin database using a combination of higher layer scaling solutions and the base layer. In this case, the TAM would constitute a significant chunk of the Internet itself, which is absolutely enormous and nearly infinitely scalable. Valuation as a Tech Enterprise (Of Sorts) Bitcoin is clearly not a company or legal entity. It is simply software that anyone can run. The cumulative effect of a lot of people doing so is the unique database. A lot of people have done so, such that what has been bootstrapped from this activity is an enterprise monopolizing a special database service. This is a bit like what tech firms currently provide-a special anti-competitive technology service. The profits of this enterprise do not accrue to BTC owners the way AAPL shareholders receive value through dividends and buybacks. Instead, value accrues to BTC owners within the velocity of BTC . Note that value also accrues to the miners who perform the PoW. However, in the long run the marginal value accruing to miners should equal the depreciated capital expenditures and energy costs consumed by PoW mining. This is the concept of marginal cost equaling marginal benefit in a perfectly competitive market. Since mining is something anyone with a computer and power can do, the market is pretty competitive and this value accrual is largely negligible. The velocity of BTC refers to the fact one needs BTC to do anything on the database. Miners select transactions with higher BTC fees when they create blocks. The only actions that the database accepts are transactions of BTC from one address to another. Data can then be inscribed within the transacted BTC. The only way to write to the database is to make a transaction that involves BTC. So, the purpose of a transaction is not necessarily sending BTC for the sake of doing so-there is the exogenous use case of being able to write to the database. (Note that this exogenous use-case also single-handedly answers the often-asked question of ""what backs BTC?"") This generates demand for BTC because there is (or theoretically will be) significant demand to use the kind of database that Bitcoin happens to be. Thus, there is a natural velocity in BTC. To do anything besides simply reading the database, you need to spend BTC. People who receive the spent BTC will eventually spend their earned BTC to do something else on the database, and so forth. Everything being done is presumably valuable for the doers, or they wouldn't do it. Those who passively hold BTC are afforded the option to participate in this activity at any time. The velocity of BTC transactions gives BTC owners value because it means useful activity is occurring and the only way to participate in the activity is through the BTC. All this talk of velocity and spending and earning makes BTC sound a bit like money. But that point isn't required . We need only think of BTC as a quasi-security or commodity and the actual money as fiat currencies, like the US Dollar. USD is used to buy the security ((BTC)) and one can gain ""yield"" from their investment by selling fractions of BTC as more people use Bitcoin (and therefore require BTC). Clearly, the more valuable Bitcoin's service is to people, the greater the cash flows one can receive from making that initial purchase of BTC and amortizing their stock over time. Unlike normal securities, the owned amount will gradually decrease. But this is functionally like selling off parts of an appreciated equity holding so one can earn intermittent cash flows in the form of realized capital gains. Therefore, I postulate that while the network's economic value to people (an unknowable number) might not be the market cap of BTC, the two should be related and close. At the very least, the two should move together. Also, because BTC has an unalterable fixed supply , it should command a premium because the enterprise is short the option of diluting existing ""shareholders."" This is a benefit publicly-traded equity cannot supersede. There is also a very real possibility that the effective supply of BTC will diminish over time as private keys are lost forever and the BTC controlled by those keys can never again have velocity. Again, this should confer a premium to all BTC. Though there is no buyback or dividends, there is velocity and useful activity, there is a guarantee of no future dilutions to the stock of potential velocity, and there is a (near) guarantee of diminishing ""share"" count-which is kind of like a buyback. Therefore, w hile BTC are not shares of Bitcoin, they might as well be . I estimate that the value of Bitcoin as simply the special database should be around what cloud computing is today. The reason is that Bitcoin neatly fits into a technology archetype like that of cloud computing-something that people have found to be useful despite initial ignorance of its utility and mechanism. Yet, Bitcoin is not in competition with cloud computing. If anything, it complements cloud computing by adding unique guarantees to Internet-based data. Cloud computing was estimated to have earned $545 billion in 2022 revenue and experience 17.9% CAGR over the next 5 years. Assuming a price to sales multiple below 4x, the cumulative cloud computing capitalization is worth over $2 trillion. At this point we can think whether it makes sense to have BTC adopt a similar market cap. I say yes, and that we are probably being conservative, because of the fixed (but likely decreasing) BTC supply. Again, this must be given a higher multiple because of the short dilution option. Cloud computing is also only a good comparison for now . Eventually, I expect even more use cases for the database such that more and more of the Web is routed to Bitcoin to inherit its benefits. This would cause it to contribute well beyond what cloud computing can offer. Lastly, it must be pointed out that the economic cost of Bitcoin is absolutely the energy consumption of PoW but that this cost does not accrue to BTC owners the way Apple's electric costs are paid by AAPL shareholders. That is an additional benefit of accruing value via velocity rather than cash distributions. There will only ever be 21 million BTC. Currently, there are 19.3 million BTC and 1.7 million BTC remains to be mined. If the market cap was $2 trillion, then 1 BTC today should be worth a little over $100,000-the price target of the thesis based on the aforementioned assumptions. This is nearly a fourfold increase from the current price and over 50% above the all-time high at the time of writing. But keep in mind this makes the obviously conservative assumption that none of the 19.3 million BTC today are lost and all owners are happy to expose their holdings to velocity (spend them on something). Where This Thesis Could Be Wrong Again, the thesis hinges on the supposed TAM of the database. It could be possible that such a database is not nearly as useful as it is presented here. It could be possible that there is some unknown flaw in the code that alters Bitcoin's ability to preserve those qualities. This would render the database itself pointless, as it is practically useless for anything else. It could be that people just don't like it for some reason, so the service never catches on even though it works. Also, it is possible that the velocity argument is flawed and there isn't a mechanism where BTC owners gain value from people using Bitcoin. In this case, the thesis could be right about the technological and cultural trends but wrong about the investment decision. The final elephant in the room is of course the monetary utility argument, which I have consistently dismissed as unimportant for this thesis. Indeed, reflexive tendencies of asset markets often create unpredictable and unstable equilibria. Technology and the Internet will only exacerbate the unpredictability by increasing variance and decreasing reaction times. I view BTC's monetary status as this: it has genuine potential, mostly because of what's mentioned here, but it is not even close to money right now. But that can change and if it does, this thesis can only be relegated to an afterthought that may be regarded in hindsight as a contributing factor but not the meat of the phenomenon, whichever way the result of the money question goes.

There has been a notable outflow of stablecoin assets from Binance's proof of reserve wallets. However, Coinglass shows a BTC inflow to Binance since the CFTC news. We simply don't know enough about how much BNB Binance truly controls and what the liabilities portion of the company's balance sheet looks like. It seems like each week in 2023 has provided a fresh set of bombs lobbed at the cryptocurrency industry from US regulators, and this week was no different. A new battlefront has emerged, and this one involves Binance ( BNB-USD ), the company's founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, and the Commodity and Futures Trade Commission. On Monday, the CFTC sued Binance and claimed eight infractions according to the Commodity Exchange Act: The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, Illinois, alleged that Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, solicited U.S. users via unregistered crypto derivatives offerings despite having no authority to conduct business in the country. The lawsuit alleges Binance employees nudged US users to utilize VPN services to obfuscate location to enable usage of Binance's off-shore full site rather than the more slimmed-down US front-end application. Binance is the top global crypto exchange by trade volume and also offers DeFi optionality through its Binance Smart Chain, the native token of which is BNB. The BNB token is different from Binance USD ( BUSD-USD ), which I've covered for Seeking Alpha in the past. Binance Exchange Flows Unlike the FTX ( FTT-USD ) situation from November, we don't have a leak of Binance's internal balance sheet. Because of that, it's difficult (if not impossible) to assess what the solvency situation is for Binance as an exchange from the outside looking in. The Wall Street Journal recently reported over $2 billion in Ethereum-based ( ETH-USD ) outflows in response to the CFTC lawsuit. The overwhelming majority of that outflow has been in the stablecoins. And it's really just a continuation of what we've been seeing for months already: Binance Exchange Balance (Dune Analytics/KARTOD) On November 10th, Binance had a total stablecoin reserve balance of $26.2 billion. This would have been during the time the FTX drama really started to intensify. Since then, stables on Binance have fallen 60% down to $10.5 billion as of Thursday. Millions of $ 3/26/23 3/29/23 Change BUSD 7,308.9 6,970.6 -4.63% DAI 119.5 106.4 -10.96% PAX 82.3 64.1 -22.11% TUSD 294.2 264.1 -10.23% USDC 1,090.4 968.0 -11.23% USDT 2,661.6 2,109.7 -20.74% Source: Dune Analytics/KARTOD While BUSD has certainly been a part of that outflow, as a percentage of total funds pre-CFTC allegations, BUSD actually hasn't been leaving Binance exchange as much as other stables have over the last week. BUSD Circulating MC (CoinMarketCap) However, it's also important to note that BUSD is issued by Paxos Trust. So even though there has been a significant spike in BUSD redemptions over the last several weeks, it is a different entity that is handling those redemptions. So far, there hasn't been any break in the BUSD peg like we witnessed in USDC earlier this month . But I will reiterate that I don't personally advocate holding any of these centrally issued fiat-collateralized stablecoins if you're even slightly worried about third-party risk.

A Different Animal Than FTX? Aside from the fact that FTX customer funds made their way to Alameda Research balance sheets, what made FTT such an important instrument in the demise of both Alameda and FTX was that it was so tantamount to Alameda's solvency. This isn't explicitly the case with Binance because BNB is a much smaller portion of Binance's known wallet holdings according to this Nansen proof of reserves balance sheet: Binance Balance Allocation (Nansen) Just 5.3% of the $65 billion in known Binance-controlled wallets are made up of BNB, according to Nansen. This would seem to indicate BNB will not be as detrimental to Binance solvency if the CFTC lawsuit somehow leads to a dramatic BNB token price decline. Importantly, Binance's proof of reserves shows a BNB position only totaling about 10% of the BNB in circulation. However, utilizing on-chain wallet tracking it has been estimated by independent analysts that Binance actually controls far more BNB than its proof of reserves here indicates; possibly as much as 80% of BNB's circulating supply is under Binance control either directly or indirectly through employee holdings. Furthermore, we don't have the full scope on Binance's financial position because we only know what Binance's claimed assets are, we don't have clarity on the liabilities. That's a huge missing piece. And Binance's BNB position could be dramatically understated, according to chain sleuths. Summary There is a market expectation that Binance will settle with CFTC and pay a fine. It remains to be seen if that will happen and if so how big the settlement would be. But Binance could be in a tough position if this situation drags out for a long time. From where I sit, Binance does not have a reputation for being a leader in transparency and the blockchain itself is generally one of the more centralized chains in crypto by total validators. As investors, we can only make assessments based off what we know and what we can reasonably assume. Personally, I think the risk probably outweighs the reward in BNB.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4591896-binance-could-cftc-lead-to-bigger-problems?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11379039.jpeg

The crypto, now changing hands at just $0.08, reached an all-time high of $0.64 in May 2021. “There is nothing unlawful about tweeting words of support for, or funny pictures about, a legitimate cryptocurrency that continues to hold a market cap of nearly $10 billion,” Musk's lawyers said in the filing . “This court should put a stop to plaintiffs’ fantasy and dismiss the complaint.” Doge ( DOGE-USD ) spiked 9% on June 19, 2022, after Musk said he's buying the crypto and will ""keep supporting"" it.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3953585-elon-musk-asks-us-judge-to-cease-258b-dogecoin-lawsuit-report?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11378942.jpeg

11378337,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525318,1680524425,Dogecoin Whales Bought 1.47 Billion DOGE In Q1 2023: Santiment,"On-chain data from Santiment shows the Dogecoin whales have added another 1.47 billion DOGE to their holdings in the year 2023 so far. Dogecoin Whales Been Accumulating In 2023 So Far According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Dogecoin whales have added DOGE worth $123.1 million to their treasuries since 1 January 2023. The relevant indicator here is the “DOGE Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total percentage of the Dogecoin supply that each wallet group in the market is holding right now. Addresses are divided into these “wallet groups” based on the total number of coins that they are carrying currently. For instance, the 1-10 coins cohort includes all addresses that are holding a balance of between 1 and 10 DOGE. If the Supply Distribution is applied to this particular cohort, it would combine the amounts all such wallets are holding at the moment and calculate the percentage of the total supply that this sum is equal to. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Over? This Historic On-Chain Signal Suggests So In the context of the current discussion, the groups of interest are those with balances of at least 10 million DOGE. Below is a chart that shows the Dogecoin Supply Distribution for these cohorts over the last year: Looks like the value of the metric seems to have observed some rise in recent months | Source: Santiment on Twitter To be more precise, three groups fall in this range (10 million to 100 million, 100 million to 10 billion, and 10 billion to infinity), so their Supply Distribution data is displayed after merging them into one group. Since the range’s lower bound is worth almost $800,000, the investors that these addresses would belong to are likely to be the whales. This holder group can hold immense importance in the market due to the sheer size of the holdings of its investors. Movements from the whales can hold the power to move the market, as can also be seen in the above graph. When these humongous investors were selling during the past year (the red zones in the chart), the price overall moved downwards. Related Reading: Dogecoin Inches Closer To $0.08 After Burger King Tweets ‘Need DOGE’ On the other hand, buying from this cohort (the green zone) has looked to have led to the price climbing higher. In the three months since the start of the year 2023, the whales have once again been busy expanding their holdings. Overall, these holders have accumulated about 1.47 billion DOGE in this period, and their combined wallet balances now contain almost 82% of the entire circulating supply of the meme coin. While this new accumulation streak has occurred, Dogecoin’s price has felt some bullish momentum. The year-to-date returns, however, haven’t still been too impressive as the coin is just 12% in the green during the period. The reason behind it is that the asset has slowed down in recent weeks as the whale supply has also been moving sideways. Nonetheless, as long as the whales don’t sell, the price may at least be able to maintain around the current levels, or even be able to build up some fresh upwards momentum. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.0785, up 7% in the last week.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin has been testing the $30,000 mark, as it traded between $27,500 and $28,900 over the weekend. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value was flat on Monday, while ether was down slightly. Simon Peters, an analyst at investment firm eToro, wrote in a morning note that as stock markets move back toward ""bull territory,"" the crypto market appears to be moving in a similar direction. “While bitcoin will continue to test the $30K line, we might need a stronger push to see it higher,” he wrote. “Important labor market updates from the U.S. are inbound this week, which could influence prices in the short term.”  The U.S. government has a “substantial case on the merits” in its bid to quash a $1 billion deal by Binance.USto buy the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital, a New York judge said Friday. District Judge Jennifer Rearden said she would try to move quickly to settle a dispute, given that delays could cost as much as $10 million per month for the estate. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles approved the sale early last month, but last week, Rearden said she would put that on hold while she considered objections from the government that the contract effectively rendered Voyager immune by exculpating it from breaches of tax or securities law.  Japan's Financial Services Agency said in a warning letter published on Friday that foreign crypto exchanges Bybit, BitForex, MEXC Global and Bitget are operatingin the country without proper registration and thus violating the country's fund settlement laws. The regulator also said the list of unregistered traders ""does not necessarily indicate the current state of unregistered business.""  Chart of the Day  The chart shows oil prices lead the U.S. Consumer Price Index by six months.  Oil prices need to stay low for central banks to pivot away from liquidity tightening that roiled asset markets, including cryptocurrencies, last year.  Oil, however, surged early Monday on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' unexpected decision to cut output by 1.16 million barrels per day.

42412424,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4wfA,1680523200,PancakeSwap DEX Launches Version 3 on BNB Chain and Ethereum,"PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange, or DEX, with more than 1.5 million unique users, introduced Version 3 on the Ethereum and BNB Chain networks on Monday.  The upgraded platform will offer the cheapest fees for on-chain trades among counterparts such as SushiSwap and Uniswap and increased returns for liquidity providers, the exchange's developers told CoinDesk on Sunday.  PancakeSwap V3 also introduces features that enhance the platform's capital efficiency. These include allowing liquidity providers to concentrate their capital on smaller price ranges, a feature that results in higher fee earnings from the same amount of deposits, the developers said.  V3 will introduce four different trading fee tiers: 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25% and 1%. V2 offered a single tier of 0.25%. Each token pair can have a liquidity pool for each fee tier, with asset pairs gravitating toward the tier where incentives for both liquidity providers and traders are most rewarding.  This approach is designed to ensure a balance between traders paying the lowest fee tier while still incentivizing the highest possible liquidity from LPs.  In the future, PancakeSwap V3 will introduce two new features: A V3 “VIP” trading rewards program and a position manager feature.  The VIP program is a tiered system that rewards traders for their trading volume with exclusive benefits such as a chance to get up to a 5% trading fee rebate – which may incentivize more platform activity and improve PancakeSwap’s revenue.  The ""position panager"" feature will allow traders to easily deposit liquidity and optimize that position, based on fees and rewards, over time. The tool eliminates the need for manual calculations for third-party integrations, allowing users to automatically adjust their positions and earn fee rewards while staying within range.  Both these features are in development now and are expected to be introduced soon.  PancakeSwap V3 is also compatible with all tools built for the version 3 of Uniswap, which is the largest DEX by daily users and trading volume.

Speaking highlights include keynotes delivered at TED, the Vatican, the G20 Summit and the UN. If you are not disrupting your business or industry, someone else is. Salim Ismail This week we take the deepest of dives into some grand concepts and truths, as we look back on the conversation that VESA had with Salim Ismail on his podcast. The over two-hour conversation ranged from art, NFTs and creativity to spirituality, the phenomenon of growth in different contexts and the possibilities of Web3. What are the parameters that determine the fate of a movement, of a person, of a nation? How much decentralized and centralized elements do we need to thrive optimally? You don’t want to miss this chat, the type of which is not often heard in the space or elsewhere. Listen to the episode on YOUTUBE All other platforms from Google, Spotify, Amazon etc For those wanting a bit more of a text summary first: There is a certain vulnerability in pursuing art as a career. The cerebral, mundane self often protests in front of the unknown and unpredictable. Salim wanted to know what are some of the underlying factors that drive VESA’s process and the reason he became an artist. ‘There is always a catalyst or a facilitator in everything worthwhile, so for digital art it really is the NFT technology that proves scarcity, but even way before, when I started to bodypaint on people it was NLP that was the facilitator, the technology that made the process possible’. The oldest forms of art are likely cave painting and bodypainting, so I took it back all the way to the roots. The two men talk for a moment about self authoring, which is a notion that has a strong, forward propelling nature that trusts in depicting a more favourable future as a part of your journey as a human. VESA poses the question, why art couldn’t be the mediator of a more self-authored society, where its role is not only to critique society but to give valuable insights and help individual people imagine an elevated way of living and thinking. Flower of Life from the Veena Malik Project. The great embrace The conversation turns into the business of art. VESA relays how Web3 is truly a blessing, a liberation of a whole creative class of people, but at the same time there is a real possibility of us fumbling the ball, relinquishing the opportunity we have at this time. Much like their Renaissance Italy counterpart, the Web3 Medici family has the possibility of funding the arts, sciences and cross-disciplinary projects that improve our way of thinking. For this to happen, there needs to be a higher taste that opts for the Da Vinci way, the universal human that excels at multiple arenas of life. This is where the essence of the topic starts to form; how much structure and governance we need to guide us? From natural phenomena to business, we can observe how growth must always be followed by a period of consolidation, otherwise the growth starts to decay quickly. Embracing decentralized ideals and working in new technologies, VESA and his contemporaries arguably are standing on the side of free flowing, decentralized model, but he says he understands the need for some structure even from an archetypal point of view. Portrait of Cosimo Medici On Purpose ‘I had this identity once too, where I didn’t like structure, but it was only after I was shown that I use structures all the time in my work that I understood that they are a necessary tool’ Both VESA and Salim agree that structure is the firm piping around purpose that keeps the enterprise heading in the correct direction. Speaking of purpose, Salim asks what gets VESA excited in the Web3 space these days, and VESA tells of one of his projects that he began with Brittaney Kaiser, the famous Cambridge Analytica whistle blower, whose life story VESA is turning into multi-layered NFT art with a complex concept around the production. Brittaney’s story is of course iconic when it comes to data ownership, but even when we think about digital identity and the leaps Web3 has seen on that front, it is incredible to think what lies ahead. VESA points out that as long as humans are the ones using Web3 spaces, human psychology will be the motivator behind our choices, like the motivation to purchase digital sneakers for metaverse use will be motivated by similar factors that purchasing designer brands in the real world is. Salim agrees on the gravitas of digital identity and tells a story from when he was the Creative Director at Yahoo! and how he understood the power of the blockchain and digital identity. Promo image of the coming Brittany Kaiser Project Mass adoption ‘They say most significant innovations take around 20 years for mass adoption, and so that means that Bitcoin is a pre-teen still that needs a lot of guidance actually’. A lot of what is possible is predicated on the axis of scarcity and abundance, and Salim makes the observation that technology is often very good at distributing scarce goods abundantly, like for example Uber, and that this is the female archetype that distributes rather than hoards. VESA makes the poignant observation that in our western societies, it is women that own most of the consumer debt and most consumer choices are made by women. Perhaps these statistics speak of a changed society, where women swipe right on dating apps only 5% of the time and give their attention to a very narrow sector of the male population. The natural structure, the geographical location, has been muted in the era of the internet. What is happening in America? The conversation returns to the concept of growth needing consolidation, when the two touch upon what is happening in America recently. ‘It is the fulfilment of abundance without enough consolidation’, Salim says. They talk about the structures and institutions that historically have provided that consolidation, and he adds ‘perhaps it is the spiritual and religious institutions that have done that in the past, and largely still today’. He makes an interesting parallel between Star Wars with its more religiously inspired themes and Star Trek that could be categorized as the more free thinking, blossoming creativity type of world view, and the general opposition of centralized and decentralized. VESA finds these two forces to have a uniquely different outlook on life altogether; the discovering and the engineering type. The discovering type, typically, believes in some universal natural laws as opposed to the engineering type, which believes that most things are how we make them to be, with little underlying principles. ‘Making art is unique in a sense that it can bridge the gap between those two types of people, but at the same time it is important to avoid the messiah complex and to just keep facilitating awe’, he says. As the first adopters of Web3, we live in an extraordinary time in history. We have more opportunities than any other people in the history of the Earth. It is incredible to think that a small team of tech enthusiasts went ahead with their plans against all the doubters and created Ethereum, a coin that is in the center vortex of creating the new creative economy. Salim tells an example of impoverished people creating a 3D printed sports car in Sri Lanka, and how the heads of German auto giants could not cope with this reality, where the power wasn’t tightly gatekept and regulated. A 3D model of the VESA art car project ‘I think that’s what art can do so beautifully- easy people into these new paradigms without intimidating them so much’ There was a resounding agreement to sit down for vol. 2 soon, as most of these topics were just scratched on the surface.

After the release of its mobile wallet last month, the token’s rebound from $5.8 is inevitable. Investors should also watch the charts of UNI as it moves to a narrower trading range. If the token manages to regain $6.2, UNI should have enough momentum for a bigger upside. Bored Ape Yacht Club. Image: TheStreet APE Despite showing weakness after the January market rally, APE has recently shown promise for investors due to strong on-chain developments from Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. At the time of writing, the token has risen nearly 5% within the weekly timeframe, going against the current crypto market momentum. APE is currently trading above $4, which is expected to support the bulls in the coming days. Furthermore, the narrow trading range in which the token finds itself adds to the bullishness. If the token breaks through $4.5, the potential upside for investors will grow significantly. TRX Despite the recent controversy about Justin Sun surrounding Huobi Global, the Tron ecosystem continues to thrive. TRX, the native token of the ecosystem, is up nearly 2% in the weekly timeframe. The token’s price movement follows the crypto market’s broader movement in the past few days. TRX is seen below the $0.065 resistance as it follows the current market slippage. If the bears capitalize on this downward pressure, TRX can drop toward $0.062 support. If the bulls can defend the drop to this support, the token can rebound toward $0.071. Ethereum Classic. Image: Getty ETC Ethereum Classic is Ethereum’s fork that retains ETH’s old characteristics. The altcoin certainly has a place in the portfolios of investors and traders. However, ETC has been struggling in the past few days. CoinGecko reveals that the altcoin is down more than 4% in the daily timeframe. For ETC, the altcoin’s price movement has stagnated above $20. Ethereum Classic is also trading at a narrow trading range which may lead to an explosive upside toward $23. If ETC bulls strengthen the current support, a retest or a possible breakthrough above this level is inevitable.

The attack happened all within one Ethereum block, with blockchain auditor OtterSec saying a validator appeared to force a series of transactions into the block to steal funds the bot had planned to gain by front-running.

This makes Unbound V2 among the first protocols to offer collateralization of Uniswap V3 positions, making it easier for LPs to earn more from their capital. As of Monday, billions of dollars are supplied as liquidity to Uniswap from DeFi users, according the on-chain data.  With Unbound, Uniswap V3 LPs can borrow Unbound’s stablecoin, UND, interest-free, secured against their concentrated liquidity positions. This feature allows users to continually earn rewards from Uniswap while being able to take out loans – which can be used for other DeFi applications.  Unbound version 2 has been running successfully on the Ethereum Goerli network test network since last October.  In addition to Uniswap V3 positions, Unbound is also expanding collateral support to LP tokens of relatively volatile asset pools, such as WETH-DAI. The version 2, however, will introduce price stability mechanisms that automatically liquidate or redeem loaned positions to ensure UND’s value remains stable and closely aligned with its intended $1 peg.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MINING | TRADING | UNI | ARB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/03/unbound-finance-will-soon-allow-stablecoin-borrowing-against-uniswap-lp-positions-on-arbitrum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/183bfe59f68de08aee8f2ff5ce53d9ee5826c86d-3085x1735.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Charles Hoskinson Boasts About Cardano In a tweet on April 3, Hoskinson, who has never shied from expressing his thoughts on Cardano, often heaping praises on blockchain design, also said the network’s staking model is “excellent” and well-executed. Cardano is pretty special. It's almost like a lot of people thought about how to build an excellent staking protocol years ago and made it happen pic.twitter.com/SydlMTYyy1 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 3, 2023 His comment comes after ADA, the platform’s native cryptocurrency, recovered from 2022 lows, rallying roughly 70% in Q1 2023. Related Reading: Cardano Stands Out In Robinhood’s Top Movers List For The Week When writing on April 3, ADA was trading at $0.40, steady in the last 24 hours, rising 14% in the previous trading week. It is perched at the 7th position on the market capitalization leaderboard. Still, it trails Ethereum, which is the second most valuable coin after Bitcoin. The founder expressly compared Cardano with Ethereum, a parallel smart contracting platform, and cited the huge difference between the two networks’ staking wallets. Like Cardano, Ethereum is a proof-of-stake platform. It relies on a community of Validators to approve transactions and keep the network decentralized. However, while Cardano was launched from the beginning as a staking platform, Ethereum recently shifted to a proof-of-stake consensus model after operating for years a proof-of-work blockchain reliant on miners for network security. A key difference between Ethereum and Cardano is that the latter also relies on a different architecture. In Cardano, stakers can still participate in activities such as initial stake pool offerings (ISPOs) while concurrently earning rewards from staking. This non-custodial nature of ADA staking, coupled with the first mover advantage, places Cardano ahead in the number of staked wallets compared to Ethereum. By April 3, 2023, there are over 2,900 stake pool operators, that is, validators with stakes, according to ADASTAT. Out of this, there were 1,271,709 unique delegators. It is a statistic that Hoskinson has regularly cited in recent months, pointing to the network’s superior community engagement and decentralization, even after Ethereum shifted to a proof-of-stake system. Ethereum Planning For Shanghai In Q1 2023, the network has over 66,900 new validators, staking at least 32 ETH, on Ethereum, on-chain data shows. Ethereum plans to activate the Shanghai upgrade in mid-April 2023 with the objective of the Shanghai upgrade being to allow ETH stakers to withdraw their coins from the Beacon Chain more than two years after they first locked their coins. This upgrade might disrupt ETH prices and the number of Ethereum validators. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Faces Key Resistance Level At 0.385, Will It Break Through? Still, whether this would also impact Ethereum’s decentralization is yet to be seen. Ahead of this upgrade, liquidity staking protocols like Lido DAO have been increasingly managing billions of dollars worth of assets, as DeFiLlama data shows.

Coinbase noted that bitcoin has outperformed other assets since the middle of February, with the cryptocurrency’s dominance as a percentage of total crypto market cap increasing to 47.7% from 43.9% during March. The outperformance accelerated early in the month, which coincided with the onset of the U.S. banking system turmoil, Coinbase said.  “Part of the reason is that the stress in the banking system reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value properties,” the report stated, and because BTC mainly exists outside of the traditional financial system “it offers a hedge against current conditions.”  It has also benefited from investor concerns about the regulatory status of other cryptocurrencies, analysts David Duong and Brian Cubellis wrote.  Bitcoin’s correlation to the S&P 500 stock index dropped to 25% at the end of March from a peak of 70% in May last year, the analysts wrote. They didn't give the timespan for the correlation calculation.  The cryptocurrency’s relative outperformance versus other digital coins and tokens also reflects investor concerns about the regulatory status of other digital assets, and thinner liquidity specific to some BTC versus stablecoin trading pairs, the report added.

A fully-diluted token count of 1B brings us to a valuation price of $16.05 per token, assuming a 1B supply. We believe dYdX token, supporting a high-revenue-generating decentralized exchange is undervalued and has immense growth potential; Cosmos migration boosts demand and revenue. Please note that VanEck has a position(s) in the dYdX token described below. We believe dYdX token is undervalued relative to its growth potential as it backs an essential product that generates substantial revenue amid a favorable industry backdrop. dYdX has established a strong product market fit while cementing a dominant market position. We observe improving tokenomics and see the planned migration to dYdX’s own blockchain in the Cosmos unlocking new revenue lines and greater demand for the native token. dYdX ( DYDX-USD ) is a decentralized exchange for on-chain derivatives trading. It is currently hosted on an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain built by StarkWare. dYdX facilitates trading specialized financial derivatives, called perpetual futures, on crypto assets such as ETH ( ETH-USD ) and BTC ( BTC-USD ). Perps, as they are called, are similar to traditional futures as both tie their prices to the spot prices of underlying assets. But, unlike traditional futures, perps have no expiry date. As a result, all perpetual futures contracts are cash-settled, and perp prices are tied to spot prices by an interest rate mechanism that charges the in-the-loss parties a penalty interest rate. Conversely, the in-the-profit parties receive these payments. This interest rate adjusts further away that the perpetuals prices drift from spot prices. Price convergence happens as the underwater parties liquidate their positions or as market participants step in to move the prices back to spot. dYdX’s business model involves matching buyers and sellers of perpetual futures using the same central limit order book matching engine that is common across the financial industry. Traders onboard onto dYdX by depositing their USDC funds into a smart contract vault that acts as a margin account which mirrors the function of a traditional margin account such as one on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Margin is drawn to back trades based on a desired leverage ratio of up to 30x. dYdX accrues revenues from fees on trading. Currently, fees are tiered by both a participant’s trading volume as well as the amount of dYdX tokens they hold - the higher the trading volume and/or the more tokens held, the lower the trading fees. The dYdX smart contract also dispenses tokens as a reward mechanism to rebate those who trade on the platform. Before there was a token, early users of the exchange received substantial value through an airdrop (7.5% of all tokens, worth $800M at the time) to reward their patronage of dYdX. Most importantly, dYdX is used as a tally-marker in governance voting decisions that affect the application. These voting rights allow holders to vote on important governance decisions like token inflation, community treasury spend, and future dYdX direction. Similar to Uniswap ( UNI-USD ), the fees from trading do not currently accrue directly to the token's value in any form. However, unlike Uniswap, fees are collected by the team behind dYdX - the dYdX foundation. To date, over $400M in fees have been generated on dYdX, and all of them have gone to the dYdX foundation. Using the governance voting rights afforded to the token, some sort of value transfer mechanism is expected to be implemented to give token holders more value eventually. This may take the form of token buybacks or remittances of fees to token holders. Thesis: In summary, we like the dYdX token for the following reasons: Consistent Revenue Generation Dominant Market Position with Room to Grow Strong Product Market Fit with Expansionary TAM Migration to Sovereign Blockchain With New Token Sinks and Revenue Possibilities Improving Tokenomics Consistent Revenue Generation dYdX Market Share Sources: dYdX, GMX, Dune as of 3/19/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Dominant Market Position with Room to Grow dYdX is a mature crypto application with a customer base of consistent, high-value users who generate substantial fees for the platform. In 2022, dYdX generated $137M in fees based upon $466.3B in volume from over 33,900 unique traders. By trading volume, dYdX is the clear market leader among on-chain perpetual futures platforms with over 70% market share. While its share of on-chain perps volume is high, when centralized exchange trading volume is added, dYdX retains only 2.96% of ETH and 1.23% of BTC perp market shares. Although the centralized market lead may appear intimidating, it presents a tremendous opportunity that dYdX has already been effectively seizing. This is because centralized crypto exchanges are closed-loop entities whose lack of transparency regarding order execution has led some - including the CFTC in a recent suit against Binance ( BNB-USD ) - to contend that exchanges are trading against customers or advantaging certain customers over others. These fears were partially confirmed amid the fallout of FTX. It was revealed that FTX trading affiliate, Alameda was afforded trading advantages over other customers when it was exposed that FTX gambled with customer deposits. dYdX, by contrast, offers a more transparent product where fair ordering can be confirmed by confirmable on-chain data and customer funds are protected by verifiable code rather than trust placed in exchange operators. As a result, dYdX perp volume market share grew directly after the collapse of FTX. Perp volume market share grew from 0.9% and 1.8% to 1.23% and 2.96%, for BTC and ETH respectively. Strong Product Market Fit with Expansionary TAM This competitive positioning and product offering must also be viewed against favorable volume growth in crypto and broader financial derivatives. Perpetual futures monthly volume on BTC and ETH alone have grown from $377B in January 2020 to $1254B in January 2023. Meanwhile, the volume of all types of exchange-traded derivatives has grown from 18B contracts in 2019 to 61.6B contracts in 2022. Additionally, the use case of crypto derivatives, like perpetual futures, has massively expanded with the growth of Proof of Stake networks and DeFi, where stakers are rewarded with yield in volatile tokens. An increasing number of staking participants will seek hedging mechanisms to enable users to lock in the value of these awards. With the upgrade of Ethereum to a PoS network in September of 2022 and the coming Shanghai upgrade in April 2023, hundreds of billions of dollars can be potentially hedged. dYdX Profitability Sources: dYdX, DeFillama, Dune as of 3/23/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Migration to Sovereign Blockchain with New Token Sinks and Revenue Possibilities Going forward, our bull thesis on dYdX is supported by the anticipated migration of dYdX to its own Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ) blockchain alongside continued improvements in tokenomics. The creation of the dYdX chain will not only lead to an improvement in trading throughput by as much as 100x but also new use cases for the token. As the dYdX blockchain will be based upon Proof of Stake, the dYdX token will become more useful as its value can be used to stake the network’s validators. Staking rates in similar proof-of-stake networks typically range between 40% and 70%. Likewise, the migration of dYdX to its own Cosmos blockchain enables dYdX to monetize its exchange better, using the data provision and colocation practices of traditional finance exchanges. In practice, this may mean charging for faster order execution, the deployment of trading servers closest to dYdX’s order router, or very fine real-time trading data. Building its chain will make it easier for dYdX stakeholders to host or build new applications offering related services - lending, spot trading, fiat-off ramps - with DyDx token holders getting a cut of the action. We observe strong commitments by both the team and the community to improve the tokenomics of dYdX. During the bear market, on-chain governance has reduced dYdX token emissions by decreasing trading rebates that are paid using dYdX tokens. On two separate occasions, governance approved a drop in rebates from 3.83M tokens every epoch (28 days) to 1.58M tokens per epoch. Likewise, the founders and investors of dYdX also agreed to push back their token unlocks further into the future to significantly diminish near-term dilution. Most notably for token value accrual, the dYdX team has informed the community that it plans to “ decentralize fees, ” which should tie more systematically the token’s value to the production of fees of the decentralized exchange. Improving Tokenomics Finally, we have a favorable outlook on dYdX because the team has effectively iterated on an intuitional grade product that has attracted usage from crypto’s most prolific market makers. To entice high-tier users, dYdX changed its fee structure by increasing price taker fees and decreasing market maker fees with an aim to reduce toxic order flow. This tailors its product to institutional market makers to ensure they are not being “picked off” by aggressive traders with better information. This contributes to a platform with higher order book liquidity. Thus, while other applications may charge higher fees or employ novel mechanisms that appeal to retail users and naïve, yield-seeking market markets, dYdX has created an institutional-grade product with the highest capital efficiency among its peers. In this respect, dYdX is set on competing with centralized crypto exchanges, and we believe it has the plan to accomplish it. Capital Efficiency: TVL ($) vs. Turnover of TVL (Tx Volume/TVL) Sources: CME, dYdX, Dune, GMX as of 3/25/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Risks: The risks to our thesis include the following: Transparency Issues Product Delays and Issues Competition Regulation Transparency Issues While we are bullish on dYdX’s ability to gain market share due to better capital efficiency, we find that the most significant risks to our thesis revolve around the opacity of the dYdX Foundation. Practically, this is best exemplified by the dYdX Foundation’s secrecy on the utilization of past trading fees, which have amounted to over $400M. The foundation also holds 22.3% of current and future dYdX tokens. Likewise, many in the community are uncertain about the structure of the dYdX foundation, which, while touted as a non-profit, appears to have investors with significant influence over the direction of the application as early investors hold 27.7% of dYdX tokens. We are also not certain of the relationship between the exchange and its major market makers. These transparency issues include exchange practices and statistics. While the future roadmap promises more openness, trade execution ordering is still a bit of a black box, and there is speculation that trading activity statistics are unreliable due to wash trading on the application. Product Delays and Issues Beyond issues of openness, dYdX has experienced significant product launch delays. Initially, the v4 migration was scheduled by year-end 2022 and has since been pushed back further from 2Q 2023 to the end of 3Q 2023. Further delays would call into question the execution abilities of the team, their ability to scale throughput of trading volume, and their commitment to transparency. Most importantly, any inability to effectively scale dYdX would see its market makers quickly leave for better trading venues. Additionally, there is some question about the effectiveness of the dYdX liquidation system. This is because dYdX eliminated its Safety Module which effectively backstopped liquidations by providing liquidity in extreme cases where market makers pull orders due to market volatility. In these extreme circumstances, an underwater trader being forced out of a trade could cause a series of cascading liquidations that untethers dYdX derivative prices from spot. This could bankrupt market makers on the platform and lead to a substantial loss of principally important users. In effect, dYdX reduced inflation but may have introduced additional instability in the process. Finally, it is important to note that dYdX’s migration to the Cosmos is far from certain. The consensus mechanism that powers Cosmos, Tendermint, will have to undergo profound upgrades to ensure it can handle the demands of dYdX’s order book and scaling requirements. Likewise, dYdX must ensure it does not lose users wedded to the Ethereum system when it leaves for the Cosmos. Competition Because of the competitive landscape taking market share and the consequent move to lower fees, we see greater-than-expected fee deterioration as a potential issue for dYdX. Competition is ample, and on-chain exchanges such as GMX have found product-market fit among naïve market makers (and the traders seeking to take advantage of them). While we expect dYdX’s fees to converge from an approximate take rate today of around 2.90bps to the CME approximate take rate of 0.03bps over the next 7 years, dramatic moves by competitors to win market share through low fees or massive subsidies could quickly deteriorate dYdX’s business. This may extend to better, cheaper competing products from centralized spot exchanges like Coinbase ( COIN ) or traditional finance venues like Nasdaq . While it is important to note that dYdX’s customer base cares about issues beyond price, the competition to become the crypto derivatives price discovery epicenter is intense and crypto derivatives trading is likely a Pareto-type industry. Regulation Finally, and most importantly, immense regulatory pressures have recently become prominent in the space. The SEC regulates crypto by an exceptionally broad interpretation of existing laws and aggressive enforcement proceedings. Recent enforcement and obstruction action against Binance , Justin Sun , and Kraken ( KRAK-USD ) demonstrate an agency committed to asserting its control over the industry, increasingly at the expense of the businesses in crypto. As a result, despite a strong “geo-fence” to prevent US citizens from accessing dYdX, given that most of the team is based in the US, we believe regulatory action may come at any time. Valuation * We base our valuation on a DCF model that estimates cash flow in the year 2030, assigns it an FCF multiple, and discounts back to the present day. In our base case, we estimate FCF to be $1.94B. We apply a terminal multiple of 40x to arrive at a valuation of $77.6B. We discount it back to present at 20% to arrive at a $16.05B valuation. A fully-diluted token count of 1B brings us to a valuation price of $16.05 per token, assuming a 1B supply. In our valuation model, we estimate revenue by ballparking the total value of the digital asset market - both off-chain and on-chain assets. We then apply an expected crypto asset trading turnover rate of 250% per annum by comparing current tradfi and crypto assets; we also calculate a ratio of expected perpetual futures volume to spot volume to derive perp trading volume. We then factor a take rate on that volume, 0.03 bps, which roughly corresponds to the take rate of the CME. With that volume, we estimate a breakdown between DEX trading and CEX trading, 25/75, respectively, and then approximate the on-chain derivatives market share of dYdX: 75%. We then deduct expenses, taxes, and security fees to arrive at an approximate free cash flow to the token holder. Thereafter, we add an additional 15% of revenue we believe will be derived from data monetization vectors such as colocation, data services, and MEV to the bottom line. dYdX Model Flow Chart: Source: VanEck Research as of 3/27/2023. * The above is not intended as financial advice or any call to action, a recommendation to buy or sell dydx, or as a projection of how dydx will perform in the future.

11373105,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525317,1680513026,"Bitcoin Back Above $28,000, But DXY Spoils Short-Term Outlook","The Bitcoin price plunged 2.2% at the beginning of the trading session in Asia, but managed to hold the important support at $27,700. However, a breakout of the US Dollar Index (DXY) could mean another pullback for the Bitcoin price in the short-term if the inverse correlation remains high. Triggering the sudden rise in the DXY (and the fall in the BTC price) was the surprise news from OPEC+ on Sunday that members of the oil alliance announced a 1 million barrel cut in oil production. Saudi Arabia, which plans to produce 500,000 barrels per day less, is leading the voluntary initiative. Brent Crude jumped from $75.65 to over $81 earlier today, and is currently trading at $79.71 (as of press time). As a result, the DXY jumped to over 103.0, causing the index to confirm a break out of the downtrend that has been in place since February 7. The reason for this was provided by macro analyst Alex Krueger, who pointed to a quote from Jerome Powell in March 2022. According to this, the rule of thumb is that a $10 increase in oil prices leads to a 0.2% increase in inflation. The rise in oil prices comes at a bad time: the core inflation rate (PCE) proved “sticky” last week, despite falling slightly. In addition, the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is at an all-time low, the banking crisis is far from over, and many experts are predicting a recession later this year based on the inverted yield curve, among other factors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Points To New Uptrend, Here’s Why A look at the 4-hour chart shows the explosive move of the DXY, analogous to the oil price. Like the latter, the DXY has risen rapidly, but was initially rejected at the key resistance level of 103.05. However, if the DXY regains strength at the start of the US session, it is likely to be bad for the broader financial market and Bitcoin. Bitcoin Pullback Before $35,000? Glassnode co-founders, Yann Alleman and Jan Happel write in their latest analysis that if the DXY rises to 107-108 by early April, then Bitcoin can be expected to drop lower. This would also fit Bitcoin’s current setup and Elliott Wave count, which recently broke out of a cup & handle pattern to the upside. Related Reading: USD Losing Its Reserve Status? What It Means For Bitcoin According to the two Glassnode co-founders, a pullback to $25,200 would in no way hurt the very bullish setup for Bitcoin. By contrast, Alleman and Happel expect Bitcoin to continue climbing toward $35,000 and “later rise toward $45,000.” First, however, they say a setback is to be expected: It would be normal and expected, following a break of the neckline around $25.2k to the upside, that bitcoin retests that level. This will likely be a wave 2 pullback, which may dip as deep (or even deeper) as $24k. The reasoning behind this is that the DXY has started a smaller-degree c-wave of the B-wave in the correction since the correction began on March 23. “A bounce in DXY seems to be coming and it may take DXY to 106.8 or even 108.2,” the analysts write, expecting a local high in DXY in mid-April. At press time, the Bitcoin price showed strong resilience after the Opec news influenced price drop, climbing above $28,000 again.

42412464,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4yyI,1680512321,Locked Value on zkSync Era Climbs Past $100M,"The newly launched zkSync Era blockchain is seeing brisk activity as value locked on the network crossed $100 million this past weekend amid a flurry of new token releases.  Data from L2Beat, a website that tracks activity on layer 2 networks built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, shows over $69 million worth of ether (ETH) and nearly $30 million in USD coin (USDC) stablecoins have been locked on zkSync. The amount is likely distributed among several zkSync-based projects for purchasing ecosystem tokens or providing liquidity to exchanges on the network.  More than 3.3 million transactions have been conducted on the network since it went live on March 24. The network can process 4.4 transactions per second.  The network supports ""ZK rollups,"" which are a type of blockchain scaling system based on cryptography known as zero-knowledge proofs.  These features are seen as a key advance in speeding up blockchain transactions and reducing the cost of network activity.  Populating the zkSync ecosystem are decentralized-finance tokens, which power lending, trading and borrowing services, and meme coins fashioned after the popular Shiba Inu dog breed.  DefiLlama data shows that decentralized exchanges SyncSwap and Mute hold over $30 million in locked tokens. Mute’s native MUTE tokens have a market capitalization of $47 million. SyncSwap hasn't issued tokens as of early April.  Over $19 million is locked on SyncSwap’s liquidity pool for USDC and ether – which is paying annualized yields of 46%, or one of the highest figures in the crypto market as of Monday.  As such, meme coins are making a mark as well. DEXScreener data shows tokens such as ZKDoge, ZKInu and ZkSync SHIB have attracted millions of dollars in trading volumes since their recent launches.  Traction on these meme-coin tokens has been tepid so far, with highly volatile prices and market capitalizations of under $5 million.  Some say the zkSync launch has been muted relative to the hype, however.  “The recently launched zkSync Era mainnet is a sign that the evolutionary trend in the overall blockchain ecosystem is unimpeded; however, the low number of projects building on it is a sign that the Web3.0 world isn’t fully prepared to welcome this innovation for now,” Maia Benzimra, head of institutional marketing at SpoolDAO, said in a Telegram message.  Benzimra added that adoption may surge quickly as and when more innovative projects are built for users.  “The trend can change within the twinkling of an eye when innovative products building solutions that address the core needs of users are designed and launched. zkSync is notably a major upgrade for addressing the scalability of the Ethereum protocol, and in no time, it is bound to find its rhythm and carve out a functional niche for itself in the ecosystem,” Benzimra said.",POSITIVE,ETH | SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/03/defi-tokens-shiba-inu-clones-populate-zksync-as-locked-value-climbs-to-100m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d7923e3bc2b91d459e1ffc9fe6ef709b7a2f66e-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The decline has sparked concerns among investors and analysts that the digital asset may be headed for a correction, leaving them to wonder whether it’s time to sell or hold on to their investments. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is $27,560, according to CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency has lost 2.5% of its value in the last 24 hours and has been on a 14-day decline of 1.5%. Despite this, Bitcoin has enjoyed a remarkable 30-day rally of 24.1%. In this article, we’ll explore the factors that may be driving the retreat and assess where Bitcoin is likely to go from here. Bitcoin Crosses $28,000 Mark, But Backtracks Bitcoin had crossed the $28,000 mark earlier in the day, but the excitement was short-lived as the cryptocurrency retreated. The retreat may be attributed to a combination of factors, including profit-taking by investors who had bought Bitcoin at lower levels and a general sentiment of uncertainty among traders. Related Reading: This Little-Known Crypto Is Shooting Up Nearly 90% – Here’s Why Reasons For The Retreat Bitcoin’s retreat may be attributed to several factors. For one, the cryptocurrency has been on an upward trend for the past few months, and a correction was overdue. Regulatory pressures on cryptocurrency trading and the U.S. banking crisis may also be causing jitters among investors. Lastly, Bitcoin liquidity remains low, despite its eye-catching upsurge this year. Conor Ryder at Kaiko has revealed that the liquidity of Bitcoin remains low, a clear indication that the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a downturn in trading activity. This lack of liquidity has resulted in slippage, which is the disparity between the intended transaction price and the actual price at which it’s executed, and it’s become increasingly problematic for investors. As slippage rises, investors face the possibility of sudden, dramatic fluctuations in the market, creating additional risks that could further destabilize the cryptocurrency economy.

Despite the retreat, many analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The cryptocurrency has come a long way from its humble beginnings and has gained widespread acceptance as a legitimate investment asset. Many investors believe that Bitcoin’s value will continue to rise in the coming years, driven by increasing adoption and limited supply. However, in the short term, Bitcoin’s price may remain volatile, with occasional corrections and dips.

42412463,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4yxM,1680487200,Alchemy Pay Raises $10M at $400M Valuation to Push South Korean Expansion Plans,"Alchemy Pay, a payments provider based in Singapore, has received $10 million in investment from market maker DWF Labs at a $400 million valuation as it eyes expanding its business in South Korea.  The company, which provides a way for crypto companies to access the fiat payment system, aims to capitalize on South Korea's ""high level of crypto acceptance"" and assist local firms in achieving greater internationalization, according to a statement shared with CoinDesk. It has previously worked with the likes of Visa, Mastercard, Google Pay and Apple Pay to this end.  Last week, crypto exchange OKX plugged Alchemy Pay into its platform to make it easier for customers to purchase cryptocurrency using their local currencies.  The $10 million injection into Alchemy Pay continues DWF Labs' prolific investment streak of recent weeks. The market maker has now put its name to eight investments or funding rounds of at least $10 million into crypto and Web3 projects in the past six weeks. The combined total reaches $165 million.  The current bearish market is ""the best time to join the investment space,” DWF's managing partner Andrei Grachev recently told CoinDesk. “We accumulated enough funds from our profits to invest in projects now.""  Alchemy Pay's native token, ACHP, has a market cap of just over $180 million.

42412466,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4z0A,1680485782,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Holds Above $28K as Investors Await Fresh Productivity, Jobs Data","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: What turmoil? Bitcoin holds its perch above $28K. Other major cryptos mostly fall in weekend trading.  Insights: Decentralized-focused tokens soared during the quarter. Their gains came as U.S. regulators zeroed in on centralized exchanges.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,208 −13.8 ▼ 1.1% Bitcoin (BTC) $28,045 −377.2 ▼ 1.3% Ethereum (ETH) $1,788 −28.9 ▼ 1.6% S&P 500  4,109.31 +58.5 ▲ 1.4% Gold  $1,979 +9.6 ▲ 0.5% Nikkei 225  28,041.48 +258.5 ▲ 0.9% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin Investors Continue Their Watchful Waiting  Will April bring showers or more sunshine for bitcoin?  The weekend offered few clues as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization kicked off the new month holding at late March levels as investors weighed recent events – bank failures, inflation and crypto-focused regulatory actions – that could push prices higher or drag them down.  BTC was recently trading at $28,045, down 1.3% over the past 24 hours. It rose roughly 21% in March, despite a turbulent last two weeks in which markets teetered at times but always seemed to snap back above the $28,000 threshold.  ""Bitcoin has remained resilient over the last week or so, resulting in a general improvement in market sentiment,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  DiPasquale noted that bitcoin was trading above its 200-day moving average, ""historically a strong indicator of bullish price action.""  But he also reflected uncertainty about BTC's path forward, calling ""the $32K to $36K range ... an area of interest on the upside while $18K to $20K ... a strong range on the downside.""  Ether was also slightly up from the previous day to change hands at $1,788, down 1.6% but well within its range of the past two weeks. Ethereum developers now await the Shanghai upgrade, which is scheduled to occur April 12 and will mark Ethereum’s full transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, enabling staked ETH withdrawals. Other cryptos in the top 25 by market value were largely in the red.  ARB, the token of layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum, recently fell 7.4% to trade at $1.19. The decline came amid an uproar in the Arbitrum community over how the Arbitrum Foundation – a centralized company charged with promoting Arbitrum's claimed decentralized ecosystem – held a ""ratification"" vote over decisions it had already implemented, including sending nearly $1 billion in tokens to itself. On Sunday, the foundation said would break up its controversial governance package into a series of separate votes, bending to community pressure.  Popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB were recently off 5.5% and 4.8%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets overall performance was recently down 1.2%.  Equity markets closed an eventful, largely upbeat first quarter on a high with the tech-focused Nasdaq climbing 1.7% and the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rising 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively.  This week, investors will have a fresh set of employment and productivity data to gauge whether the U.S. economy is continuing to contract as recent signs have suggested or powering forward. The U.S. Census Bureau will release February durable goods orders on Tuesday, with expectations for a 1% month-over-month decline, and on Friday the U.S. Labor Department will announce March's nonfarm payrolls, with expectations for a 225,000-job spike, and the monthly unemployment rate, which is expected to remain at its current 3.6%. A hot jobs market has figured prominently in central bankers' contemplations about the ongoing strength of the economy, which historically leads to higher inflation readings.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV, Marc Chandler, Bannockburn Global Forex managing director and chief market strategist, said that ""the financial stress that we saw earlier this month is receding.""  ""This is allowing the market to focus on two things, which was before the banking stress,"" he said, adding a note of caution. ""One is that the labor market remains fairly robust. And inflation is too high for the Federal Reserve.""  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector XRP XRP +3.0% Currency Decentraland MANA +1.9% Entertainment  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Dogecoin DOGE −6.6% Currency Loopring LRC −6.3% Smart Contract Platform Shiba Inu SHIB −5.4% Currency  Insights  A Banner Quarter for Decentralized-Focused Tokens  A growing fear that centralized crypto infrastructure will be the target of U.S. regulators has driven tokens that provide decentralized alternatives to be some of the best performers this past quarter.  CoinMarketCap data shows that tokens for protocols LidoDAO (LDO), dYdX (DYDX), and GMX (GMX) were some of the best performers over the last 90 days.  LDO surged in February when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered Kraken to shut down its staking service and continued to rally when Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong said a blanket staking ban was coming alongside a securities classification – a scarlet letter for any sort of crypto with U.S. exposure.  As for DYDX and GMX, the demise of FTX gave the market a renewed interest in decentralized derivatives exchanges.  “FTX and [sister company] Alameda, as far as we know, were incredibly centralized, controlled by a single person. These things metastasize because of human error,” Dan Gunsberg, creator of Solana-based derivatives exchange Hxro, said to CoinDesk in December.  Like staking, there’s also significant regulatory interest in derivatives. Binance was recently sued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and its derivatives trading desk was front-and-center in the suit. Traders are looking for decentralized alternatives, which they feel are beyond the big-guns of American regulators and outside the crypto war conflict zone.  But decentralized derivative exchanges also have their problems too. As CoinDesk recently reported, many are struggling with liquidity and a lack of available open interest means that they cannot sustain big orders. While not all decentralized derivative exchanges suffer from this problem, it does cast some doubt on how well the idea scales.  While decentralization was a theme for the quarter’s best performers, the actual token that took first place was Conflux (CFX), up a whopping 1,622%, according to CoinMarketCap data.  It’s not entirely clear what’s driving such an outsized gain. Sure, Conflux’s Blockchain SIM card has attracted some interest from investors, but right now its all theoretical and still in a trial phase. On-chain data shows that the number of transactions on the CFX chain are lower than what they were a year ago.  But, this is crypto. And sometimes there’s not discernable data behind a token that pumps.
