42387544,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOG6A8,1642030558,First Mover Asia: Crypto Prices Rise on Better-Than-Expected US Inflation News,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin rose to its highest point in a week; most of the leading altcoins also saw increases.  Technician’s take: BTC'ssell-off appears exhausted as buyers attempt to reverse a short-term downtrend.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,907 +2.5%  Ether (ETH): $3,369 +3.7%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,726 +0.2%  DJIA: $36,290 +0.1%  Nasdaq: $15,188 +0.2%  Gold: $1,826 0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin (BTC) rose to its highest price in a week, recovering somewhat after last week's abysmal start to the year.  At the time of publication, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $43,900, after dipping a few days ago below $40,000 for the first time since September. The bitcoin price is still down 5.2% so far in 2022.  The bitcoin market may have gotten a boost from a U.S. Labor Department report Wednesday showing that the Consumer Price Index, a key inflation gauge, rose to an annual clip of 7% in December, the highest since the early 1980s.  But there had been fears in the market that prices might have climbed even faster, which would have put additional pressure on the Federal Reserve to move more aggressively to tighten monetary conditions and cool down the economy.  Bitcoin is viewed by a growing number of investors as a hedge against fast inflation, and the price has climbed since the Fed started printing money – more than $4 trillion so far – and pursuing ultra-loose monetary policies since the coronavirus hit in March 2020, roiling markets and the economy.  ""The market reaction to this new data might be a bit confusing as we see the crypto markets taking a victory lap,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics, wrote Wednesday in his newsletter. ""This time however investors seem a lot more relaxed about the Fed.""  U.S. stocks closed higher, also due to cooling concerns that the Fed might get more aggressive in tackling inflation, according to Reuters.  In cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin, the Near Protocol's NEAR token rose Wednesday to an all-time high, on signs the up-and-coming blockchain might be undervalued as it attracts more activity.  Some analysts warned that NEAR might be looking frothy on some metrics, and that bullish bets on another popular blockchain token, Fantom's FTM, have become a ""crowded"" trade.  Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-largest overall, rose 4.2% over the past 24 hours to about $3,370, based on CoinDesk pricing.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Rises Above $43K; Resistance at $45K-$48K  Bitcoin (BTC) buyers held support around $40,000 as oversold signals appeared on the charts.  The recent bounce suggests the cryptocurrency is starting to recover after a near-30% decline from its all-time high around $69,000 in November.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is approaching overbought levels, similar to what occurred in late December, which preceded a brief pullback. The RSI on the daily chart, however, continues to rise from oversold levels, which means buyers could remain active on price dips.  Still, given the short-term downtrend, upside appears limited toward the $45,000-$48,000 resistance zone. And on weekly and monthly charts, momentum signals remain negative, which means price rises could be limited for now.  Important events  2 p.m. HKT/SGT (6 a.m. UTC) Japan machine tool orders (Dec.

42387521,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOG60w,1642025563,House and Senate Agriculture Committees Issue Bipartisan Call for CFTC Guidance on Crypto,"A group of bipartisan lawmakers tasked with overseeing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have asked newly confirmed Chairman Rostin Behnam to provide guidance on cryptocurrencies and the agency’s role in regulating them.  In a letter Tuesday, the lawmakers asked Behnam to answer a series of questions about the size and scope of crypto markets, crypto crime and how it differs from crime in traditional financial markets, and the CFTC’s authority to “protect customers and ensure market integrity.”  The leaders of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture – Chair Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), ranking member Sen. John Boozman (R-Arkansas), Chair Rep. David Scott (D-Georgia) and ranking member Rep. GT Thompson (R-Pa.) – signed the letter.  The letter follows Behnam’s statement during his nomination hearing before the Senate Ag Committee in October that the CFTC’s enforcement actions against crypto criminals was just the “tip of the iceberg,” and his suggestion at the time to expand the CFTC's authority and make it the “primary cop on the beat” for crypto.  It also represents the latest volley in an ongoing tug-of-war between the CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over which agency will become the top-dog crypto regulator.  Much of that debate has considered whether cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities. In their letter, the lawmakers wrote that “the two largest digital assets by market capitalization, bitcoin and ether, are commodities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has agreed that bitcoin is a commodity, although he has kept mum about his position on ether.  Matthew Kluchenek, a partner at Chicago-based law firm Mayer Brown whose practice focuses on CFTC enforcement actions, told CoinDesk the letter is likely a signal the committees are ready for the CFTC to do something about crypto.  Kluchenek noted the letter specifically addresses the rise in decentralized finance (DeFi), which has recently drawn the CFTC’s attention.  “What I'm sensing from the committee's letter is that they are importuning, if you will, the CFTC to take a closer look at the DeFi sector,” Kluchenek told CoinDesk. “And, part and parcel with that, to better educate the committee on that and related issues.”  Kluchenek said that he doesn’t see the letter as a sign of impending efforts by lawmakers to expand the CFTC’s authority over crypto, but wouldn’t discount it in the future.  “I would say it's within play.

42387542,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOG69W,1642023510,Market Wrap: Altcoins Rally as Bitcoin Buyers Return,"Bitcoin rose above $43,000 on Wednesday, suggesting that a recovery from a two month-long downtrend is underway.  Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as FTM, XLM and the popular dog-themed shiba inu (SHIB) token led the way higher, all up more than 10% over the past 24 hours. The rally in altcoins, which typically outperform bitcoin in a rising market, reflects a greater appetite for risk among traders.  Still, there are signs that the rally in highly speculative altcoins is due for a pullback. ""In the layer 1 scene, both FTM and NEAR see an open interest-to-market capitalization ratio substantially above the large-cap tokens,"" Arcane Research wrote in a report.  ""FTM’s open interest growth has been accompanied by strong price action and substantially positive funding – at current levels, the FTM trade seems relatively crowded,"" Arcane wrote.  Meanwhile, option traders appear to be less bearish on bitcoin. The one-week put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts – or bearish bets – relative to calls, has fallen from 17% to nearly 0% since late Monday, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,905.25, +2.6%  Ether (ETH): $3381.68, +4.4%  S&P 500: $4762.35, 0.28%  Gold: $1827, +0.47%  10-year Treasury yield daily close: $1.735  Some analysts maintain a long-term bullish outlook for BTC, suggesting the current sell-off is a mere dip in broader upcycle. For example, StackFunds, a Singapore-based crypto investment firm, has a price target of $120,000 BTC this year.  Still, investors will still have to brace themselves for volatility. ""We are expecting crypto markets to be extremely disjointed the next few months, inducing choppiness that overflow from equities, as investors navigate a new era of inflation,"" Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, wrote in a report.  Is bitcoin entering a recovery phase?  ""A byproduct of consistent downtrends in price are the liquidation of confident long traders trying to catch a falling knife,"" crypto data firm Glassnode wrote in a blog post. That could mean BTC is approaching a short-term bottom, especially given the recent downtrend in price and the subsequent rise in liquidations.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading.  The chart below suggests short traders, or those positioned for a price drop, could soon face liquidations if BTC enters a recovery phase, similar to what occurred last July.  Altcoin roundup  Near and other FOAN tokens are reaching all-time high: ​​While all major cryptocurrencies saw prices spike higher on Wednesday, a few popular tokens stood out. Fantom (FTM), harmony (ONE), cosmos (ATOM) and near (NEAR) surged as high as 21%. Traders in crypto circles colloquially refer to a basket of those tokens as “FOAN,” a set of tokens associated with layer 1 blockchains primed for decentralized finance (DeFi) activity with their cheap and fast networks. Fundamentals for the FOAN basket shows promise for traders, Shaurya Malwa and Lyllah Ledesma reported. Read more here.  Ethereum reaches a staking milestone: The top four staking entities on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain now cumulatively account for 47.5% of total deposits, with Lido making a significant jump. Over time, decentralized staking providers like Lido and RocketPool have closely aligned with the health of Ethereum, allowing the protocols to choose a variety of node operators that run different clients and diversify concentration risk, according to CoinDesk’s Edward Oosterbaan.

The move could open the door for Coinbase to offer crypto derivatives products in the U.S. At present, only a handful of exchanges allow U.S. investors to trade bitcoin and ether futures, with cash-settled products being both the most popular and the longest-available products. FTX.US acquired LedgerX last August with a similar aim.  Crypto.com, which recently launched an ad campaign starring Matt Damon that airs in movie theaters and football games, also acquired retail derivatives platform Nadex late last year.  “The development of a transparent derivatives market is a critical inflection point for any asset class and we believe it will unlock further participation in the cryptoeconomy for retail and institutional investors alike,” Coinbase said in a blog post Wednesday.  Read more: FTX Crypto Exchange Finalizes LedgerX Acquisition  FairX is a designated contract market (DCM) registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), meaning it is allowed to offer futures products in the U.S.  Coinbase is also an applicant to the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory organization overseeing derivatives platforms in the U.S.  FairX is a relatively young futures platform that launched its exchange in May 2021 after receiving regulatory approvals in late 2020. However, FairX has relationships with major brokerages including TD Ameritrade, E*Trade, ABN AMRO, Wedbush, Virtu Financial and a handful of others, which offered FairX’s futures products or provided clearing services, according to the company’s announcement at the time.

42422882,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qZJh,1642016425,NBA Top Shot Bans User ‘FreeHongKong’,"Dapper Labs’ popular NBA Top Shot non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace froze the account of a user whose handle is a reference to the professional basketball league’s fraught history with China.  After submitting a photo of their passport in an attempt to cash out the account’s balance, a user with the name “FreeHongKong” was banned by Dapper’s support team for “providing false or misleading information during the verification process,” according to a Dec. 30 email seen by CoinDesk.  “This activity breaches one or both of the Top Shot Terms of Use and/or the Dapper Service Terms of Use,” the rest of the email read. “As a result, we have decided to terminate your account with us, and permanently suspend your ability to access that account.”  CoinDesk was in touch with a Dapper Labs spokesperson on Wednesday morning but the firm did not provide a comment by press time. Hours later, FreeHongKong told CoinDesk their identity check had been verified though the account was still locked.  The user, who revealed their real name to CoinDesk, said the username is a reference to the National Basketball Association (NBA) and its controversial history over Hong Kong-related activism, dating back to a 2019 tweet by one of the league’s general managers, Daryl Morey.  The tweet expressed support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters. NBA officials attempted to strike a diplomatic tone in an effort to maintain Chinese viewership, and Morey, whose job managing the Houston Rockets was reportedly in jeopardy, later deleted the tweet and apologized. (An NBA spokesperson denied Morey was compelled to do so.) The episode upset many fans and activists who felt freedom of speech was being stifled.  Not your keys, not your Moments  The user remains in an ongoing battle to reclaim their account, but Dapper Labs hasn’t paused the sales of the account’s collectibles.  In the days following FreeHongKong’s ban, the user received a message that one of the NFT “Moments” they had listed for sale had been purchased, though they were still unable to access the account.  While the reasoning behind the ban remains unconfirmed and could be unrelated to the username entirely, the ability for closed platforms like NBA Top Shot to ban users seems to undermine the value proposition of digital ownership. What good are NFTs if their native platforms can restrict access at any moment?  The extent to which companies like Dapper Labs can be pressured by the corporate interests of its business partners remains unclear, but freedom from this type of censorship, which has long proliferated in the Web 2 era, remains at the heart of the vision many have for Web 3.  As mainstream users rush in, NFTs have become a lightning rod for censorship controversy. Leading NFT marketplace OpenSea faced blowback in November for censoring a political cartoonist, whose artwork was also pulled from the popular marketplace Rarible. Censorship resistance has long been a core tenet of Bitcoin and Ethereum developers.  Being a crypto middleman remains a lucrative business, however. OpenSea was valued at $13.3 billion in a recent funding round. Dapper Labs snagged a $7.6 billion valuation in its latest raise. Coinbase went public last April and currently boasts a $51 billion market cap.  UPDATE (Jan. 13, 17:30 UTC): Seven hours after this article was published, a Dapper Labs spokesperson said: ""The user's account was deactivated after their ID was mistakenly flagged; having nothing to do with their username. After the user raised their concerns, our team investigated the matter, apologized to the user, and took action to resolve the issue and reinstate the account."" FreeHongKong confirmed to CoinDesk their access was restored.  CORRECTION (Jan. 13, 17:30 UTC): An earlier version of this article said the NBA compelled Daryl Morey to delete and apologize for his tweet. A spokesperson for the league later denied this.

42411567,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOseQ,1642015348,Crypto Firms Can't Outrun the Travel Rule,"Virtual assets are expanding to almost every corner of the globe, introducing new opportunities and risks for investors, businesses and entrepreneurs. From the start, the crypto industry set out to challenge the rules of finance. By cutting out the middlemen, such as banks or credit card companies, blockchain technology offered the potential for users to quickly transfer value across the world.  Marcus Pleyer, deputy director general in Germany’s Federal Ministry of Finance of Germany, assumed the position of president of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in July 2020.  Its innovative features – and huge shifts in price – have led to massive financial speculation and to criminals using crypto assets to receive ransoms and launder their proceeds. But firms have often ignored the reality of their products being used for illicit purposes. That is why the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing watchdog, needs everyone to take responsibility and effectively implement anti-money laundering regulations.  Concerns About Regulations  Many in the virtual assets industry have raised concerns about regulation. Regulation could cause more harm than good, some claim. It will damage the industry, restrict job creation and stifle innovation and growth are common remarks.  None of that has turned out to be true. In contrast, the onset of regulation is strengthening trust to the industry and is promising to be a great boon to the industry. Since Bitcoin emerged 12 years, entrepreneurs have created thousands of types of virtual assets, including stablecoins. Bitcoin and ether both hit new all-time highs in 2021 amid a wider rally in crypto markets, which are now estimated to have surpassed $3 trillion. Rather than smothering development, regulation has helped ease concerns about crypto being the “Wild West” of finance and encouraged a broader range of investors. As it matures, the industry should not fear regulation, it should embrace it.  Read more: Is the Travel Rule Good or Bad for Crypto? Both - Malcolm Campbell-Verduyn and Moritz Hutten  The FATF released updated guidance in October outlining how governments and companies can effectively implement the FATF’s global anti-money laundering rules for virtual assets and their service providers. Money laundering fuels serious crime, and so it is vital that all players in the crypto sphere take their responsibilities seriously. No company should give a free pass to ransomware creators, drug traffickers or human smugglers to launder their illicit profits, or to terrorists to finance their activities.  Hundreds of cases of criminal misuse demonstrate the need for proper controls. Those include last year’s ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline , which shut down major fuel pipelines across the eastern part of the U.S.. While the ransomware payment of 75 bitcoin may seem small, the attack significantly damaged critical infrastructure and caused significant economic disruption.  No one, in good conscience, can see those cases and just shrug their shoulders. Clinging to aspirations of total independence and anonymity in the face of crypto being misused is fundamentally irresponsible.  It is important for everyone to focus on the basics of regulation first. It is the responsibility of all governments to ensure virtual assets are regulated properly. This includes licensing or registering the virtual asset service providers and supervising the sector to ensure that they do customer due diligence, keep records, report suspicious transactions and implement the so-called “Travel Rule.” There has been progress, but an FATF review highlighted how only 58 out of 128 jurisdictions reported that they have the necessary rules in place for virtual assets and their providers.  This is not good enough. All countries need to put the basic rules in place for crypto companies to understand their obligations so that they can ensure they effectively implement the rules. Consistent and fair rules that leave room for innovation while protecting against misuse by criminals will create a level playing field and regulatory certainty for everyone to work with.”  The Travel Rule  The FATF “Travel Rule” is at the heart of that approach, alongside a commitment to take a risk-based approach to regulation. The Travel Rule means that providers of virtual assets need to collect and share customer data for transactions over a certain threshold. This is not a radical idea. It simply means crypto providers must stick to international rules that ensure the protection of legitimate finance and prevent illicit finance. That involves the handling of data with care, the need for privacy and the use of due diligence measures.  The FATF will not proscribe a one-size-fits-all compliance solution to the industry. It is up to businesses to use technology that they find most effective to record and share sender and recipient information. It is heartening to see in recent years how the crypto sphere has evolved with an understanding that growth in this marketplace requires regulation.  Addressing DeFi  The trend toward decentralized finance, or “DeFi,” has been an area of concern. The idea of making traditional financial products, such as loans, available through blockchain technology potentially has numerous benefits, in particular to those without access to traditional financial products, such as the unbanked. However, the widely publicized hacks and scams that have plagued the sector highlight the risks of criminal exploitation.  Governments need to engage with the DeFi community, while DeFi developers need to take money laundering risks seriously. Authorities should identify the individuals with control or sufficient influence over DeFi protocols and hold them responsible for implementing anti-money laundering measures. The FATF has been clear that although providers of so-called DeFi services market themselves as decentralized, that is not necessarily the case. Authorities need to focus on what a business does, not the terminology or technology it uses. As this is a rapidly changing area, the FATF is monitoring how systems evolve and any emerging risks.  Read more: FATF Says Majority of Countries Still Haven’t Implemented Watchdog’s Crypto Guidance  So-called stablecoins, governance tokens and initial coin offerings are also discussed in the updated guidance. If you are a business that operates in these areas, you should recognize that criminals and terrorists will try to take advantage of the financial services you provide. It is because of those risks that the crypto ecosystem cannot remain unregulated. It is the responsibility of governments and law enforcement to take these issues seriously, and it is the responsibility of businesses offering these financial services to follow the regulations  As new technologies develop, new services will emerge. Some will potentially promise total anonymity and no centralized control. However, ultimately, if a business provides financial services, then it needs to apply anti-money laundering rules. At the risk of repeating myself, this is not to stifle innovation. This is not about big government versus private firms. It is simply about preventing serious crime and terrorism.  Ultimately, everyone has to decide. The crypto world has legitimate and legal uses, but just like the international banking sector, it can be exploited to cause immense harm. Do you want to help the corrupt, the criminal gangs and sanctions evaders to launder their illicit profits and further fund their activities? Or, do you want to help prevent serious crime and terrorism by ensuring national authorities can trace the money that fuels organized crime?  You have to choose a side. I know which side I am on.

Crypto Fear And Greed Index Shows Lowest Value In Six Months As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the fear and greed index reached the lowest values this week since July. The &apos;fear and greed index&apos; is an indicator that measures the general sentiment around the Bitcoin and wider crypto market. The metric uses a numeric scale that goes from zero to hundred for representing the sentiment. When the values are below fifty, it means the market is currently fearful. On the other hand, values above fifty imply that the market has become greedy. Extreme values of below 25 and above 75 signify sentiments of extreme fear and extreme greed, respectively. Such extreme values usually occur around bottoms and tops. Hence, some traders believe it&apos;s best to sell during extreme greed and buy more crypto like Bitcoin while the sentiment is that of extreme fear.

According to a joint announcement published Wednesday, digital identity proofing refers to the process of collecting, validating and verifying information about a person. This information is often used by financial institutions to establish proof of identity when customers are attempting to access services online.  As the financial services industry moves increasingly online, fraudsters and scammers have found new and inventive ways to commit financial crime. According to the FDIC and FinCEN, leaks and hacks of personally identifiable information (PII) and the rise in “synthetic identities” (a type of fraud in which someone creates a new identity from a mix of real and fake information) have made establishing a person’s true identity increasingly challenging.  In the upcoming tech sprint, which doesn't yet have a specific start date, participants will be asked to come up with a “scalable, cost-efficient, risk-based solution to measure the effectiveness of digital identity proofing to ensure that individuals who remotely (i.e., not in person) present themselves for financial activities are who they claim to be.”  FDIC and FinCEN’s goal is to increase the security of online financial services, reduce fraud and identity theft, cut down on money laundering and terrorist financing and improve customer confidence in the online financial services industry – something that has been challenged by the ongoing proliferation of scams.

42411581,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOtBU,1642011863,"Bitcoin, Inflation and the Expectations Game","The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics published new monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) data Wednesday, and as far as the state of the macro-economy is concerned, the numbers seem about as good as could have been expected. The rate of inflation declined in December, down to a 0.5% monthly rise in the standard CPI measure, compared to 0.8% rise in November. The main driver of the month-to-month change was a broad decline in energy prices in December. In particular, fuel oil used for winter heating dropped 2.4% month to month.  Make no mistake: The December numbers are still abnormally high and would be worrying in a vacuum. On an annual basis, 2021 inflation was 7%, which is the highest annual rate since 1982. But the 37% month-over-month decline in CPI growth, hopefully, means we’re headed back to more normal territory – “more normal” here meaning 3%-4% yearly inflationhttps://news.yahoo.com/white-house-braces-brutal-inflation-012747187.html in 2022, not the 2% target inflation rate set by the Federal Reserve, which was maintained or even undershot for years before the coronavirus pandemic.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     The new CPI numbers had a noticeable effect on bitcoin, the price of which bounced about 1.6% on the announcement before retreating slightly. The effect on the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was milder, with small pops that have now been mostly given back.  Those numbers make for an interesting contrast. A naïve reading would suggest bitcoin is reinforcing its inflation-hedge thesis, but the stock performance might seem more confusing. In a vacuum, this morning’s numbers were still quite high, which in a different year would have sent stocks tumbling over fears of a Fed interest rate hike.  Stocks didn’t crash for a reason so simple it can be easily overlooked by market newbies: the role of expectations. The professional traders who dominate equity markets are not, by and large, frantically trading in response to CPI numbers the morning they’re released. Instead, they’ve been trying to predict the CPI numbers for weeks and trading on those projections ahead of the actual numbers. By the same token, the Fed has already announced its plans to raise interest rates and cut its bond balance sheet this year, tightening the money supply and likely hurting stock performance.  As it happens, actual CPI growth came in just barely higher than Wall Street’s “consensus expectation,” which was for a 0.4% rise, according to Barron’s. So in the simplest terms, equities didn’t move much this morning because the actual CPI number was “priced in” based on trading before the announcement. That’s why tech and other “growth” stocks in particular, which are generally more dependent on cheap capital, have been slumping for months. We might have seen big equity swings today if inflation had instead come in well above or below the consensus.  See also: Money Reimagined: Inflation Is Here? Always Has Been  Understanding how these sorts of expectations work is key to parsing asset markets. While they’re suddenly gaining significance in the CPI discourse, they’ve been central to the stock market for decades in the form of analysts’ quarterly revenue projections for publicly traded companies. Weirdly, and for reasons I still don’t understand after nearly a decade of finance reporting, the business press isn’t in the habit of citing its sources for various “consensus projections,” so they can seem like they’re just pulled out of thin air. But they generally come from surveys of analysts or an average of their published projections, and are one of the pieces of data that are still easiest to find through an old-fashioned Bloomberg terminal.  (Crypto assets are notable here for lacking the regular reporting structure that makes professional projections so acutely significant, though crypto-linked stocks like Coinbase are subject to the same dynamic.)  So now we turn to bitcoin, where the expectations game appears to be played much differently. It should be noted first that overall, inflation still has less influence on bitcoin’s price than many other speculative factors – the idea that bitcoin is an “inflation hedge” is still at least somewhat theoretical. After a sharp drawdown over the last two months, bitcoin is currently seeing a short-term rebound that’s arguably mostly about bargain hunters buying the dip.  See also: The Breakdown: The Great Monetary Inflation... Paul Tudor Jones' Complete Case for Bitcoin (Podcast)  But in the shorter term, inflation is clearly guiding investor behavior. BTC trading volumes surged immediately after the 8:30 a.m. ET (13:30 UTC) CPI drop, meaning a significant number of people are trading bitcoin as if it were a functional inflation hedge. If you bet heavily on a slight inflation beat by buying bitcoin at 8:29 a.m. this morning, you made money by 9 a.m. That’s a risky trade analogous to what stock traders do frequently.  But the contrast with stocks is revealing. In bitcoin, for reasons that would be too complicated to dive into here even if I fully understood them, it appears inflation projections are not smoothly “priced in” ahead of monthly announcements. You could have bought BTC on the actual CPI print at 8:31 a.m. and made nearly the same amount of money by 9 a.m. as the guy who was taking a risk on unknown numbers at 8:29 a.m.  Assuming the inflation-hedge narrative holds up, this trade is basically an inefficiency that won’t last as the bitcoin market matures. A lot of pros and serious traders are clearly taking advantage of it, but at least for the time being it’s also still available to the little guy.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42375506,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8dSn,1642010302,Wikipedia Faces Pressure to Stop Accepting Crypto Donations on Environmental Grounds,"Wikimedia, the non-profit foundation that runs Wikipedia, is facing internal opposition to its policy of accepting cryptocurrency as a form of donation, primarily for environmental reasons.  A proposal to the foundation from contributor Molly White, who goes by the user name GorillaWarfare, argues that accepting donations in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether signals endorsement of digital coins, which are “inherently predatory” as investments and don’t align with the foundation's commitment to environmental sustainability. The contributor argues that Wikipedia risks damaging its reputation by accepting crypto donations, citing the recent decision by non-profit peer, Mozilla, to pause accepting donations in crypto.  Wikimedia currently accepts bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and ether via BitPay. White singled out bitcoin and ether’s need for enormous amounts of energy, while noting that there are other “eco-friendlier” cryptocurrencies, although they are less widely-used.  Bitcoin’s energy consumption is no secret and its “Proof of Work (PoW)” consensus model has long been debated for its impact on the environment. Crypto miners, which use tremendous amounts of computing power to validate transactions using PoW, have been criticized for damaging the environment. Most recently, a report by the U.S. Congress preparing a hearing to examine the impact of crypto mining, especially the Bitcoin network, has reignited the discussions.  However, miners have been actively countering such criticism by using more sustainable energy sources for their mining operations. Furthermore, bitcoin supporters argue that miners can help drive a change to clean energy.  Meanwhile, the Ethereum network has been working towards transitioning to a “Proof of Stake” model for validating transactions, which uses less energy, although the switch has faced prolonged delays.  The Wikipedia proposal has sparked online discussions among Wiki users and contributors, most of whom have so far expressed support for banning crypto donations. However, the foundation noted that “this is not a majority vote, but instead a discussion among Wikimedia contributors. Agreement is gauged based on the merits of the arguments, not by counting votes.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | ETH | MINING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/12/wikipedia-faces-pressure-to-stop-accepting-crypto-donations-on-environmental-grounds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d4c2f34757b6e6b875b8902aa2ffc9bd8eb2e11-1024x715.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411564,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOsb7,1642009885,Why 2022 Should Be the Year of the Govcoin,"In true form, Western governments have suffered from decision paralysis in relation to cryptocurrencies. Meaningful regulation of the cryptocurrency market remains a pipe dream whilst average investors continue to suffer at the hands of the crypto Wild West.  It’s time for our leaders to do what they were elected to do: lead. The market cap of the cryptocurrency market is not in the billions, it's in the trillions, soaring above $3 trillion in the bull run last year. The crypto genie cannot be put back into the bottle, people clearly want digital finance that is fit for the digital age.  James Caan, the founder of the Hamilton Bradshaw private equity firm, is one of the U.K.’s most successful entrepreneurs. From 2007 to 2010, he was an investor on ""Dragons Den,"" the British version of ""Shark Tank.""  That’s why it’s time for government-backed digital currencies to reign supreme. The days of endless money printing must end; governments must finally deliver a currency that their populations can use and trust.  I can empathize with the crypto vision. Simple mathematics will tell you that fiat currency is flawed; artificially creating money with reckless abandon will inevitably devalue the currency. As currency became untethered from the real value of gold, I understand why many feel that fiat is only worth the paper it is printed on.  Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper is a logical conclusion of widespread disillusionment with the financial status quo. After all, currencies are the building blocks of our economy; they should not be subject to the whims of a handful of the government’s fiscal fiddlers.  Yet we can’t have a clean break with the past financial system without a robust alternative to fill the void; bitcoin is not it. Any bitcoin believer will tell you that its scarcity, like gold, makes it an inherently deflationary store of value.  Yet bitcoin, and the host of cryptocurrencies biting at its heels, are leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. In a dot-com era style gold rush, many civilians are seeing their life savings being wiped out overnight. The wild lack of regulation is an obvious open door for scammers like Ruja Ignatova of the infamous OneCoin to rush through.  When approximately 1,000 people own a 40% share of all bitcoin, average retail investors are merely krill to the “pump and dump” schemes of a handful of bitcoin whales. When Elon Musk moves entire markets with single tweets, it becomes clear that the cryptocurrency market in its current form is a dangerous beast that Western governments have no idea how to contain.  Cryptocurrency opportunists exploit a stunning lack of governance. The American regulatory framework has been trying to understand and regulate cryptocurrencies for years, with nothing to show for it. Legislation of cryptocurrency remains blocked in Congress, whilst many industry leaders have predictably described the most prominent proposal to date, the STABLE Act, as a disaster.  The U.K., where I’m from, isn’t doing much better. The Bank of England’s backed “Britcoin” is only set to launch in 2025, a lifetime away in crypto years. The government has issued piecemeal regulations on exchanges, while our regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), continues to issue confusing and often contradictory ""warnings"" on the volatility of the crypto market. In the U.K., cryptocurrencies remain largely unregulated financial instruments to this day.  Western governments need to stop sitting on the fence. They need to choose a path and stick to it. While crypto innovators continue to baffle government employees in endless hearings, our populations remain prey to the wild crypto volatility.  This decision-making vacuum has not been echoed everywhere. In true form, China flexed its top-down force and exerted a muscular crackdown on bitcoin, and issued their own digital yuan to run in parallel. On the other end of the spectrum, El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender. Regardless of the strength of these two opposing positions, what they have in common is decisive leadership; that is precisely what both the U.S. and the U.K. are missing.  I don’t suggest we follow either the Chinese or Salvadoran route. Rather, the Bank of England and U.S. Federal Reserve should marry the benefits of the cryptocurrency revolution with the strength, trust and security of the central banks.  That’s why they should issue their own, blockchain-based digital currency that has its own, fixed quantity. Such a digital currency, if instigated correctly, should relegate the irresponsible practice of money printing to the history books.  Read more: Charles d’Haussy - What CBDCs Mean for the Future of DeFi and Stablecoins  We might ask whether governments or central banks are best placed to create their own cryptocurrency. Yet we must remember, they are not being asked to re-invent the wheel. There are more than 8,000 cryptocurrencies, most of which are open source. This should serve as an exhaustive recipe book for any government coder.  Of course, government-issued digital currencies will never win over the crypto diehards. However for those who simply want to transfer fees instantly across borders, a government-backed digital currency is long overdue.  Dither and delay won’t cut it anymore. It’s time for our governments to accept that people want the benefits of digital finance, without the volatility and financial risk that is built into bitcoin and its contemporaries.

42375522,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8dmv,1642009598,NEAR Hits All-Time High as Upstart Blockchains Win With 'FOAN Trade',"Near Protocol's NEAR token reached an all-time high Wednesday on signs the up-and-coming blockchain might be undervalued as it attracts more activity.  The token has risen in the current bear market for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, bucking the trend to increase in price over 18% in the last seven days and doubling over the past month. As of press time the NEAR price was $18.70.  Near Protocol is a layer 1 blockchain that aims to overcome some of the limitations of its competitors such as slow transaction rates, limited throughput and poor cross-compatibility.  Why is the NEAR price going up?  There are a few reasons contributing to NEAR’s recent surge, according to analysts, ranging from some thinking the token has been undervalued to others pointing to new developments on the protocol.  Transaction volumes for NEAR have been on the rise recently, demonstrating increased activity across the network, according to Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds' chief operating officer and co-founder.  “We’ve seen a resurgence of undervalued [layer 1s] in the last few days with NEAR gaining attention of traders, particularly from a technical point of view,” said Dibb.     Most of the layer 1 focus has primarily been on Solana, Avalanche and Luna and is now shifting, according to Dibb.  “Speculators are now beginning to place bets on other contenders that haven’t had as much engagement in recent months,” Dibb said.  Undervalued layer 1  Juan Pellicer, analyst at IntoTheBlock, attributes NEAR’s recent rally to the fact the protocol has been worked on for over two years with interesting technological innovations behind it. He said the market has treated it as an undervalued project compared with other layer 1s, which are platforms that can support products and services built atop their networks.  “From the infrastructure point of view, it is a blockchain with a working fast-sharded proof-of-stake mechanism,"" Pellicer said. ""From the application layer point of view, its wallet has accessibility improvements.”  Recently, according to Pellicer, several protocols launched on Near Protocol’s chain and many users like the experience.  “This user positivity is helping the token increase its valuation, which could be argued was previously undervalued compared to other layer 1s such as Solana, Avalanche or Luna,” said Pellicer.  Near Protocol's development  The Near Protocol has undergone aggressive “building” recently, contributing to its success, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Corinthian Digital.  Vinokourov points to the developer report released by Electric Capital, a Web 3 and blockchain early-stage venture firm, highlighting the aggressive nature of building that is being carried out on the protocol.  “In 2021, NEAR moved up to the sixth-largest ecosystem with 4x+ growth,” said the report. “Polkadot, Solana, NEAR, BSC, Avalanche and Terra are growing faster than Ethereum at the same point in its history.”  Vinokourov said that “this growth, alongside mammoth-sized development funds and the total value locked (TVL), which is significantly below to its peers, is continuing to drive capital into the network.”  So far, there hasn’t been a lot of projects launching on NEAR compared with other layer 1s, according to Vinokourov.  “The excitement and hot money flow that was aplenty when it came to Solana last year might just repeat itself on the Near protocol,"" Vinokourov said. ""It has room to grow.”  The strong start to the year by the likes of NEAR was seemingly undeterred by the lackluster start by bitcoin. Bitcoin is trading 6.2% down on the month and NEAR is trading 98% up according to data from Messari.  “This shows that market participants are looking for creative ways to generate alpha and also get a broader exposure to the market,” added Vinokourov.  The 'FOAN trade'  Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at the investment-research firm Fundstrat, expects the outperformance of NEAR and other smart contract platforms to persist. Unlike the larger coins such as bitcoin and ether that have been affected by macro headwinds recently, there are certain pockets of crypto that have performed well, according to Farrell.  “This is due to the amount of crypto-native capital that exists within the system and has no interest in exiting said system,” Farrell said. “Regardless of macro trends, I’d be surprised if this sort of isolated outperformance from certain sectors within crypto doesn’t persist for the foreseeable future.”  It appears there is a new cohort of smart contract platforms including Fantom (FTM), Harmony (ONE), Atom (ATOM) and Near – some quick-thinkers are calling it the ""FOAN trade"" – that are scooping up a lot of the excess crypto-native liquidity looking for a home, said Farrell.",POSITIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | NEAR,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/12/near-hits-all-time-high-as-upstart-blockchains-win-with-foan-trade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b97ffceaf6c961f279f539c2469736cc7795e38e-8164x6123.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) announced Wednesday that Xapo ""surrendered"" its virtual currency license the day before. It did not say why the exchange did so, but the surrendering of the license was Xapo's decision. Xapo received its BitLicense in 2018.  The exchange announced in December 2020 that it would cease offering services to U.S. customers. At the time, the company also announced it would focus on offering digital banking services, as opposed to the crypto wallet and custody platform it originally launched with.  ""Serving the U.S. market would require quite a lot of effort, time and investment, it would require a separate organization within Xapo to support it and it would still yield a worse product than what we can offer internationally,"" Xapo founder Wences Cesares said at the time.  This marks the second time an issued virtual currency license has been given up in New York, after Tagomi surrendered its license following its acquisition by crypto exchange Coinbase.  ""New York customers of Xapo who may have unclaimed funds associated with a Xapo account may wish to refer to the Unclaimed Funds website of the Office of the New York State Comptroller,"" the statement from NYDFS said.

On Wednesday, governance markets platform Bribe announced the close of a $4 million seed round to help build what it refers to as a Voter Extractable Value (VEV) protocol. Spartan Group led the round, with participation from Dragonfly and Rarestone Capital, among others.  Bribe joins a growing number of projects attempting to build on top of decentralized finance (DeFi) governance processes, routing value to governance token holders by enabling “bribes” – payments in exchange for voting on proposals in a certain way.  As unseemly as it may sound, it’s a flourishing tech stack spurred on by the success of Convex, a protocol effectively designed to maximize the value other projects can extract from decentralized exchange Curve Finance’s governance. The “Curve Wars” refer to an escalating battle for other protocols to accumulate and control Curve’s CRV governance tokens, which can incentivize user deposits into specific trading pools.  Read more: CRV Extends Rally as ‘Curve Wars’ Intensify  Bribe is conceptually similar to Votium, a protocol in turn built on Convex. On Votium users can lock Convex’s CVX, which in turn controls large sums of Curve’s CRV, and protocols bribe users to vote to boost returns to specific Curve liquidity pools.  According to a press release, Bribe will initially focus on an auction platform for bribing votes in Aave governance before expanding to market-making protocol Tokemak, and pseudonymous Bribe founder Condorcet said in an interview with CoinDesk that the project has already received interest from protocols that want to bribe their way into liquidity deposits.  Not everyone is a fan of the growing pay-to-play trend, with former Messari analyst Ryan Watkins casting doubt about the long-term viability of such a system:  However, Condorcet said the trend is likely to consolidate rather than fade away.  “Conceptually, this is exactly how governance should look here,” Condorcet said. “Let’s not have any pretensions of true democracy here – we’re working with governance tokens as votes. The world we have to [get to] before utilities can stop being built, there needs to be a clear, transparent price tag for a vote and a place where I can pay for it.”",NEUTRAL,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/12/pay-to-play-governance-builds-steam-as-bribe-raises-4m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5e6eefd7db465850fa0d072c0ddf5d6b7999c61-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Solana is optimized for consumer use cases such as micropayments and gaming, the bank said.  “Solana prioritizes scalability, but a relatively less decentralized and secure blockchain has trade-offs, illustrated by several network performance issues since inception,” Shah said. “Ethereum prioritizes decentralization and security, but at the expense of scalability, which has led to periods of network congestion and transaction fees that are occasionally larger than the value of the transaction being sent.”  Bank of America said Solana and other blockchains could grab market share from Ethereum over time, and will begin to distinguish themselves through user adoption and developer interest.

42393985,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQd4n,1642004955,Why Brazilians Are Turning to Stablecoins Like Tether,"Amid record inflation and a constant devaluation of their local currency, Brazilians are turning to cryptocurrencies and, in particular, stablecoins as never before.  According to Receita Federal, the Brazilian tax authority, between January and November 2021, locals traded $11.4 billion in stablecoins and almost tripled the total traded in 2020. Stablecoins also traded $10.8 billion in bitcoin last year.  The stablecoin boom in Brazil goes back to at least 2020, when different crypto exchanges began to notice that Brazilian stablecoin traders were quadrupling in number.  Rising inflation is one of the factors that drove the phenomenon of stablecoin purchases. In 2021, the nation’s inflation rate was 10.06%, the highest level since 2015 and the fourth-highest after the implementation of the Brazilian real (BRL), in 1994.  By acquiring stablecoins, some Brazilians also wanted to hedge against the steady depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar, which pushed the real from $0.25 in January 2020 to $0.18 this month.  “Stablecoins are worthwhile as diversification, so you are not exposed only to the real. With the conventional U.S. dollar, you have no yield and you have taxes,” Murilo, a 34-year-old Brazilian programmer, told CoinDesk.  When acquiring foreign currency, Brazilians are forced to pay a tax on financial operations – IOF is its acronym in Portuguese – that ranges between 1.1% and 6.38%. The tax does not apply to stablecoins.  “I buy through my smartphone and don’t have to worry so much about registering [at exchange companies]. It’s much easier,” said Maria, a 65-year-old retired woman.  Adilson, a 45-year-old entrepreneur, mentioned that the U.S. dollar provides liquidity, but the process to acquire the currency is slow and bureaucratic. “With a stablecoin, now I manage to move my money with less bureaucracy and much more agility,” he said.  The Brazilian Central Bank prohibits locals from saving U.S. dollars in a local bank account. However, in December 2021, the monetary authority abolished that prohibition by approving a new exchange rate framework, which has not been implemented yet.  According to Receita Federal, tether (USDT) is the preferred stablecoin for Brazilians, accounting for $9.7 billion acquired between January and November 2021. Other stablecoins bought included $1.6 billion in USDC, $12.9 million in DAI and $5.6 million in TrueUSD (TUSD)  The prevalence of USDT in Brazil contrasts with other Latin American countries such as Argentina, where Maker’s DAI became one of the leading stablecoins.  Low traditional rates  Brazil has a mature stock market, with 4.97 million individual accounts on the Brazilian stock exchange, B3. However, in the face of falling rates, stablecoins gained traction among locals.  “I find the use of stablecoins in DeFi [decentralized finance] protocols such as Curve and Anchor interesting. One gets an overall return of 15% to 20% in U.S. dollars over the year. Better than fixed income in Brazil,” Murilo told CoinDesk.  Fixed income-investment returns were historically high in Brazil but plummeted amid the Brazilian economy’s declining prime rate. The Brazilian Central Bank moved its interest rate from 14.25% in 2016 to 7% a year later and to 2% in January 2021. In order to combat inflation and calm the real’s devaluation, the monetary authority gradually raised the rate to the current 9.25%.  For its part, the Bovespa Index, which groups more than 80 stocks listed on B3, recorded a drop of 11.92% in 2021.  The fall of traditional assets’ interest rates contrasts with the strengthening of crypto exchanges in Brazil. Mercado Bitcoin, the largest crypto exchange in the country, reached 3.2 million customers in 2021 and tripled its customer base compared to 2020, the company told CoinDesk in a written statement.  Mercado Bitcoin also hit record trade volume of $7.13 billion. “It is more than our volume in all previous years combined since we launched in 2013,” Gustavo Zeno, CFO of 2TM Group, Mercado Bitcoin’s holding company, told CoinDesk.  In November 2020, Binance enabled the purchase of crypto using Brazilian reals, the company told CoinDesk in a written statement, adding that in 2021 the number of active users grew 125%.  At a regional level, several Latin American exchanges strengthened their presence in the Brazilian market.  In January 2021, Argentina’s Ripio acquired BitcoinTrade, the second-largest crypto exchange in Brazil, while Mexico-based crypto exchange Bitso strengthened its Brazilian team and plans to become the largest exchange in the country in 2022, Bitso’s vice president of marketing, José Molina, told CoinDesk.

42411833,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glga1H,1642004655,Crypto Flash Crashes: What You Need to Know,"A cryptocurrency “flash crash” is a market event in which many holders of a particular crypto asset suddenly decide to sell, overwhelming buyers and forcing the price to fall sharply within a very short time period. The event differs from a regular crash in that the price tends to rebound very quickly, often ending up with the price close to its original level.  It is often difficult or impossible to establish a thorough explanation for a flash crash. In the aftermath of such an event, the crypto media typically devolves into disputes about the culprit or catalyst.  Early in 2021, crypto exchange Kraken was the scene of a flash crash in the price of Ethereum-based tokens. Across the board, their prices fell by more than 50%, before fully recovering within an hour. While some observers said a technical glitch could have been responsible, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell denied the rumor and suggested a single major holder might have “decided to dump his life savings”.  It’s possible heavy selling activity could be the work of one large player, but it’s more likely to be many investors moving all at once. An abrupt drop in price can generate panic, with traders escaping to cryptocurrencies with more stable value or fiat.  Flash crashes can occur beyond the immediate control of human beings. They may be produced by algorithmic trading programs, triggering one another to sell in a feedback loop. When such programs are managing large volumes of assets, the consequences of such a loop can be dramatic. This can then spill over into the futures market and cause a knock-on cascade of liquidations adding further momentum to the decline. Sometimes, a flash crash can be a result of intentional market manipulation or foul play, where large investors known as “whales” employ methods such as stop hunting or creating fake buy/sell walls.  Deliberate investment strategies can contribute to the common “bounce back” observed after a flash crash. When a price falls suddenly without an obvious reason, investors smell an opportunity to profit by buying an undervalued asset and rush to take advantage of it before the chance disappears.  The term “flash crash” comes from traditional finance. One of the most famous examples struck the U.S. stock market in 2010, and a British trader was subsequently arrested for his alleged role in causing it.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/crypto-flash-crashes-what-you-need-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e0b903fc25076d453a5a12c76d7235b6fb8200f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411838,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgaL7,1642004641,What Is a Dapp? Decentralized Apps Explained,"A decentralized application – or dapp – is like a digital app found on any smartphone or laptop, with the additional feature of employing blockchain technology to keep users’ data out of the hands of the organizations behind it. Just like cryptocurrency is decentralized money, dapps are decentralized apps.  The blockchain stores copies of its expanding stack of data on a large number of participating computers, known as “nodes,” all at once. These computers are owned by users, not by the creators of the dapp. A full explanation of how blockchain technology works can be found here.  Dapps are as varied as conventional apps: They can provide social networks, games, entertainment, productivity tools and so on. Many are designed as tools to help consumers access decentralized financial services, or DeFi. This latter function is so widespread that the Ethereum network white paper categorized dapps into ""financial,"" ""semi-financial"" and ""other.""  Ethereum has been the dominant host for dapps so far. At its foundation, one of the primary goals of the network was to make dapps easier to create.  Dapp users may feel more secure in the knowledge that the creators of the application cannot control how it is used - at least, not in the conventional way. For example, the creators of a social network dapp are powerless to remove a post or exclude a user. They are also unable to sell users’ data to other entities because dapps run autonomously once they’re launched.  How is this possible? It’s all down to the use of smart contracts – computer programs deployed and on a blockchain designed to execute the rules of a contract without human involvement. For example, a smart contract could be coded to issue a loan once a user deposits a sufficient amount of collateral into it. Dapps are also commonly open source, meaning that anyone can view and use the underlying code.  Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, can be seen as a kind of dapp. They aim to use an intricate arrangement of smart contracts to achieve the functions of a traditional organization without the need for corporate executives and hierarchies. They determine policy entirely through a weighted voting system where members who lock away more tokens possess greater voting power. The idea behind this concept is that those who have committed more funds to a DAO will be more likely to participate in it honestly, for the good of the organization.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-dapp-decentralized-apps-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b1bacd254f4ecb488d78ec4e1af13a6d5afa4ac-2241x1338.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411840,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgaHo,1642004624,What Is a Governance Token?,"In the decentralized world of blockchain, projects are often looking for ways to distribute a greater amount of power and responsibility to their users. But in order for that to work, they need to employ a method that guarantees only users who are seriously committed to the success of the project participate in it.  One way to achieve that is to create a special type of collectively managed organization known as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and require participants to invest their own money in exchange for voting powers to ensure they all act honestly and the DAO prevails. Usually under this setup, those who invest more money have greater voting power over those who don’t.  A type of utility token known as a ""governance token"" is then issued to users to represent each person's stake in the DAO.  Distributing control among stakeholders in this way is called “on-chain governance.” The powers denoted by the governance tokens may include traditional management roles and the authority to change the project’s protocol, i.e. its foundation in code. Sometimes users’ votes are weighted proportionally to the size of their holdings of the governance token.  To ensure that the holders of governance tokens have an interest in the good health of the project long term, protocols often channel a share of network transaction fees into the wallets of the token holders. The tokens may also carry non-governance rights, like the right to be exchanged for certain other tokens at predefined rates.  For example, the Terra network uses a governance token called luna. Luna is traded on digital exchanges, just like a regular cryptocurrency, but one of its core functions is to enable its holders to participate in votes on the network policy. A vote by luna holders precipitated a move to ""burn"" tens of millions of luna tokens in 2021 and mint millions of new TerraUSD stablecoins. The pros and cons of the decision were hotly debated among luna holders in the run-up to the vote. A whole community can act something like an enormous committee in this way, strictly organized by the impersonal mechanism of the protocol’s smart contracts.  Governance tokens, therefore, get some of their value from the fact they confer certain powers to their holders. That may contribute to their sizable valuations: Luna ended 2021 trading at more than $80. In this way, they differ from conventional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which functions more like traditional money as a store of value and medium of exchange.  DAOs often structure their decision-making using governance tokens. These entities aim to avoid central management altogether by placing authority wholly into the hands of stakeholders.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-governance-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c7795edca907a74fbdb5796d7d9b395bf19c0fa-1916x1565.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393996,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQdzD,1641997093,"‘People Want to Work Smart, Not Hard’: Introducing ‘New Money’","How do you make money? Most of us still have traditional jobs where we work 9-5 each day. But a growing legion of social media stars, athletes and celebrities are showing that another world is possible. They’re showing you can create wealth with crypto and live independently with it.  “New Money With Spencer and Solo” is a new show devoted to people who’ve taken big risks and got rewarded for it. People like Matt James of “The Bachelor.”  ""New Money with Spencer & Solo"" premieres Jan. 12 at 1 p.m. ET. Watch on CoinDesk.com, Spotify, YouTube and social media. Learn more.  “I’ve gotten to where I’ve gotten to by doing things that other people wouldn’t do,” he tells co-hosts Spencer Dinwiddie (the National Basketball Association star) and tech entrepreneur Solo Ceesay.  James has bought into crypto the same way he bought into “The Bachelor,” with passion and a sense of adventure.  The 12-part series, which makes its debut today, features R&B singer Mario, Foye Oluokun (Atlanta Falcons), Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) and influencers with a cumulative following of 30 million-plus. Each guest has fascinating stories to tell about how they made it to the top investing in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming and by monetizing their personal brands.  We caught up with Solo and Spencer to preview “New Money” to get a sense of what we can expect. This interview has been condensed and shortened for brevity.  The lines are open: ""New Money"" has its own phone number. Send a text to 712-NEW-MNY6 to subscribe to episode updates and send questions to guests and hosts.  CoinDesk: What do you mean by “new money”?  Ceesay: New Money generally refers to a new, cutting-edge way of thinking when it comes to generating personal income and, hopefully, alpha. On the show we primarily focus on how entertainers are monetizing themselves be it through social media, endorsement deals or investing. We coined the phrase ‘new money’ as a shorthand means to refer to this new way of thinking and ultimately created the show to bring awareness about this way of thinking to both urban and discovery audiences.  Why do we need new money? Isn’t the old money sort of OK?  Dinwiddie: The world we live in today is built on the idea of convenience, and the greatest forms of innovation since the beginning of time have made all of our lives easier. That’s what new money is about. It’s about finding more efficient ways to generate asymmetric yield and beat inflation. In today’s day and age, people want to work smart, not hard. And the spirit of new money as a program is to expose viewers to things they haven’t seen before.  You’ve said you want to help bring crypto mainstream. What are the challenges and opportunities for doing that?  Ceesay: 100%. The biggest challenge when it comes to bringing crypto mainstream is the fact that most of the educational tools out there might as well be written in foreign languages. The most important thing in teaching anyone anything is that it needs to be digestible in a way that can be heard by the target audience. “New Money With Spencer and Solo” did just that by doing away with heavy technical jargon through light-hearted conversations between friends on a couch. How did you get into crypto? What’s your “down the rabbit hole” story?  We coined the phrase ‘new money’ as a shorthand means to refer to this new way of thinking and ultimately created the show to bring awareness about this way of thinking to both urban and discovery audiences.  Dinwiddie: I actually had a friend that worked on Wall Street [not Solo] that told me about it in 2014. At that point in time, I was too afraid to really dive in so I missed out on the early positive price action. That same friend mentioned it to me again in 2017 and I took a chance. It was nothing more than [Las] Vegas gambling to start, but eventually I found myself reading, listening to podcasts and researching both blockchain and crypto in my time away from the court.  Ceesay: A number of my friends had introduced crypto to me over the years but it wasn’t until Spencer brought it up to me again in 2018 or so that I really dove in. But my story was quite unique in that Spencer wanted to leverage both blockchain technology as well as my expertise in securitization to tokenize his NBA contract. After numerous conversations about the possibilities around tokenization, I quickly saw the merits of the technology and how it was undeniably the future.  Catch the commentary after the show every Wednesday after the episode. Solo Ceesay and Matt James will take your questions: Send a text to 712-NEW-MNY6 and watch them live on YouTube.  Who is your favorite guest from the first series and why?  Dinwiddie: This is tough! But I am going to have to go with my boy Chef Hoppie. He is unapologetically himself and really embodies the idea of “new money.”  Ceesay: I am going to take the conservative approach and say all the show guests on season one were amazing but I must say I am definitely looking forward to episode six that features award-winning R&B artist Mario – that conversation was a blast to record.

TransUnion is offering this facility through security firm Spring Labs' ky0x digital passport, Spring Labs announced Wednesday. The credit data will be available on public blockchain networks via the passport.  Cryptocurrency investors could now receive better interest rates when borrowing money thanks to lenders being able to judge their risk profile based on credit data.  Furthermore, lenders could now issue loans without requiring any collateral at all depending on the customer's creditworthiness. At present, investors must put up crypto assets such as bitcoin as collateral.  Users register with the digital passport to obtain anti-money laundering and know-your-customer verification that can be attached to their digital wallets.  “We believe in the growth potential of DeFi,"" or decentralized finance, said Steve Chaouki, president of U.S. Markets and Consumer Interactive at TransUnion, in a statement.

The FCF is an alternative professional sports league where fans vote on real-time decisions for their team, including play calling and roster management.  “We call the league a real-life video game,” FCF CEO Sohrob Farudi told CoinDesk in an interview. “When you look at all the elements of the league, the buying and selling of gear, team governance, community building, it just really lends itself well to a token model.”  The funding will be used to double the league’s size from four teams to eight teams, with the new teams being owned by non-fungible token (NFT) projects Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gutter Cat Gang, Knights of Degen and Team 8OKI.  NFT owners from those projects will have first dibs on minting an NFT from the FCF Ballerz collection before its public sale, which grant “team governance rights, play-to-earn game mechanics and unique IRL experiences” to its holders, according to a press release.  As of now, the “play-to-earn” mechanic of the league comes from performance-based rewards given to each team’s token holders, but the league says it has plans for an “Axie Infinity style tokenomics model” that it’s working on with Animoca Brands and Delphi Digital, a representative told CoinDesk.  The league’s pivot into NFT communities headlining its new franchises is yet another indicator of how culturally significant projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club have become, with the group now listed alongside the league’s athlete and celebrity team owners Marshawn Lynch, Quavo and Bob Menery.

The remaining 3,400 mining rigs will arrive at its data center by the end of February, the company said.  In July, it also signed a co-mining deal with Bit Digital for a 100 megawatt facility. It expects the mining machines to be deployed in Q2 2022.  The miner has also received ""all planning board permits and compliance approvals"" to ramp up the development of a 60MW power plant in New York, which it expects to be completed by mid-February. However, it is still waiting for the final approval from utilities regulator, Public Service Commission, for the acquisition of the building.  Digihost also changed its Q3 earnings statement to account for a $1,498,085 deferred tax provision as an expense, turning a reported Q3 2021 profit of $762,931, to a loss of $771,154.

42375521,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8dj9,1641994963,US Inflation Rose to Nearly Four-Decade High of 7% in December,"The U.S. Labor Department’s consumer price index (CPI), the most widely used gauge for tracking inflation, rose to an annual clip of 7%, hitting predictions made by economists, marking the highest increase since June 1982 and topping November’s 6.8% increase.  The core CPI, which excludes more volatile energy and food prices, rose by 0.6% month-over-month, exceeding economists’ forecasts. In November, the growth was 0.5%.  In the minutes after the CPI report was released by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Wednesday, bitcoin was changing hands at about $43,900, up 1.1%.  Many investors say bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation, because its supply is tightly controlled by the underlying blockchain's original programming. But a push by the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to tackle high inflation could make fixed-income assets like bonds more attractive and reduce the appeal of riskier bets on assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.  ""The trend in prices is still headed north,"" Peter C. Earle, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research, told CoinDesk. ""At this point, part of the ongoing policy debate will likely shift to whether the Fed waited, or is waiting, too long to react to rising prices.""  On Tuesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell appeared before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee for his confirmation hearing, where he said that inflation remains well above the Fed’s target. That “is telling us that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we’ve had in place,” he said.  Bitcoin is up 3.1% over the past 24 hours after the hearing.  Powell added that the Fed might raise interest if inflation persists at high levels and longer than expected. Powell's hints at increased interest rates in December were followed by a steady decline in bitcoin’s price.  “The Fed sees inflation lasting till mid-2022 and that is probably when they will let the balance sheet decline,” Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at online brokerage Oanda, said. “The path of inflation may drive quicker rate hikes and a sooner start to shrinking the balance sheet, and that could be bearish short term for risk assets such as cryptos, but equities will likely feel more pain.  “There is still significant money on the sideline waiting to buy bitcoin, but many crypto traders are having a wait-and-see approach,” Moya said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/12/us-inflation-rate-rises-to-four-decade-high-of-7-in-december,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f6b9043ec915f679c873a80b7d8cfced75ec48a-2048x1367.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375505,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8dQH,1641994493,US Banks Form Group to Offer USDF Stablecoin,"A group of U.S. banks plans to offer its own stablecoin, called USDF, in a move to tackle concerns about the reserves behind nonbank-issued equivalents.  The group – which is made up of institutions backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), one of the industry's key regulators – said the coin ""addresses the consumer protection and regulatory concerns of nonbank issued stablecoins,"" according to an announcement Wednesday.  Founding members of the USDF Consortium include Synovus (the 48th largest bank in the U.S. by assets, according to MX Technologies), New York Community Bank (No. 45), FirstBank of Nashville (No. 144) and Sterling National Bank (No, 77). The consortium wants more financial institutions to join.  While these institutions are FDIC-insured, the announcement does not spell out whether the reserves backing USDF would be. The FDIC has been considering whether stablecoin reserves should qualify for its pass-through insurance, which would cover token holders up to $250,000 if the bank holding the collateral were to fail, sources told CoinDesk last year. The agency has not made a formal announcement on the matter.  While stablecoins play a role in the broader crypto ecosystem by offering traders and investors secure entry and exit points because they are pegged to assets such as fiat currencies, there is concern about the opaque nature of some of the reserves that back up nonbank stablecoins such as Tether's USDT.  CoinDesk joined a court case earlier this month seeking access to documents received by the New York attorney general's office (NYAG) from Tether.  USDF will be a bank-minted alternative to USDT and Circle's USD coin (USDC), which account for the lion's share of the $170 billion stablecoin market. USDT has a market cap of $79 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $56.5 billion, according to CoinGecko. USDC has a market cap of $44.5 billion with a trading volume of just under $3 billion.  USDF will operate on the Provenance blockchain and will be redeemable 1:1 for cash from any of the group's members. The consortium sees the stablecoin being used for applications such as capital call financing and supply chain finance.  News of the consortium's plans emerged in November last year when Figure Technologies met with U.S. regulators to discuss issuing such a stablecoin.

This funding will also be used to grow our headcount across these new priority markets,” SEBA Bank CEO Guido Buehler told CoinDesk in an email. “In addition, funding will be used to drive institutional business growth through further investment in our product offering and technology.”  SEBA Bank currently supports over 25 markets globally. The company recently appointed an APAC CEO to solidify its presence in Hong Kong and Singapore. SEBA has also opened a dedicated office in Abu Dhabi for its Middle East push.  Buehler told CoinDesk that research and development are core features of SEBA Bank’s business, and the new funding will continue to drive the search for innovative financial services technology. Buehler cited as examples SEBA’s launch of SEBA Earn in October for earning yield on crypto, and the recent debut of Gold Token, a digital token backed by physical gold.  “Given the global regulatory trend of digital assets, we envision that regulated crypto financial institutions like Swiss-licensed SEBA Bank would become the cornerstone of the future finance,” said Altive Managing Partner Cheney Cheng in the press release.

Will this reversal change the upcoming trend direction? Gala Games is aiming to change the game industry in a new direction by giving players control over their gaming. Its mission is to create &apos;blockchain games you&apos;ll actually want to play.&apos; The initiative aims to change the way that players invest hundreds of pounds for in-game assets, as well as countless hours playing the game that could be taken from them at the click of an icon. Let us move ahead to read about GALA technical analysis. Past Performance of GALA GALA coin price shows a decline of more than 50% since last December resulting in the flag pattern formation in the daily chart. However, the recent reversal from the descending support trendline helps in a 15% price jump. But the lack of growth in the intraday trading volume decreases the chances of a bull run to the resistance trendline. Nonetheless, the price action shows reversal and if the prices sustain above $0.30, a price jump to $0.50 is possible. GALA/USD Daily Chart GALA Technical Analysis The GALA technical analysis shows a revolt in the underlying bullishness evident by the rounding reversal with lower price rejection from $0.30. Therefore, a bull run is possible with the breakout of $0.35 which remains a key horizontal level.

42410941,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtT8b,1641990600,Ethereum Reaches a Staking Milestone,"Over 9 million ETH are now deposited in the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract. At today’s price, that is nearly $30 billion in capital looking to secure the proof-of-stake network and gain further exposure to Ethereum’s native asset.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  However, those 9 million staked ETH really represent 280,000 active validators providing security, building blocks and ensuring the health of the network. It’s a number that seemingly grows around 1% each week and continues to further decentralize the network.  During August of last year, we wrote about which exchanges, staking pools and other entities were most responsible for a significant portion of validators and noted the top four staking entities on the Beacon Chain made up 36.6% of the total deposits. On Jan. 11, Nansen data shows Coinbase made its way into the list. The top four now cumulatively account for 47.5% of the staking contract, with Lido making a significant jump.  On the surface it appears that significant concentration near the top would affect the decentralization of the network. However, the rise of Lido (a decentralized and liquid alternative to staking pools) looks to be positive for the network. Staking providers give those with less than 32 ETH (over $100,000) an opportunity to earn yield through validation.  Over time, decentralized staking providers like Lido and RocketPool have closely aligned with the health of Ethereum, allowing the respective protocols to choose a variety of node operators that run different clients and diversify concentration risk.  Welcome to another issue of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Ethereum’s new proof-of-stake test network, Kintsugi, faced a chain split on Friday. BACKGROUND: Hyperledger’s Besu suffered client-related issues that led to the creation of bad blocks and a three-way chain split. The bug in Kintsugi highlights the need for test networks, as the Beacon Chain will be made more resilient without any funds needing to be at risk.  Mining giant Hive Blockchain announced it held all of its mined bitcoin and most of its mined ether during 2021. BACKGROUND: As crypto has gone mainstream and large mining organizations receive further outside capital, they lose the need to cover expenses and ongoing operations. Outside funding helps miners better align with the crypto ecosystem and bet on the future of the assets they earn for validating the network.  Over 18,000 ETH were burnt via transaction fees in a 24-hour period between Sunday and Monday. BACKGROUND: The rush for blockspace was likely due to OpenSea volume hitting new highs while crypto asset prices simultaneously dumped. For a full day, ether was deflationary and the supply was reduced by over 4,000 ETH.  On-chain users flock to Fantom as Andre Cronje and Daniele Sestagalli are set to release a new decentralized exchange.

The one-week put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts – or bearish bets – relative to calls, has come off sharply from 17% to nearly 0% since late Monday, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.  The one- and three-month put-call skews have seen a similar weakening of put bias, with some investors snapping up call options.  ""After a quiet start to the year with options open interest coming off significantly from December, volumes started to pick up last night with several large short-dated options trading overnight,"" Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Over Paradigm, we saw several large interests trading with the end of January topside [January expiry calls] in demand.""  Positive options market flows perhaps indicate that sophisticated investors foresee bitcoin withstanding U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data due at 13:30 UTC (8:30 a.m. ET), which is expected to show the cost of living rose to a four-decade high of 7.1% in December.  That's quite possible as inflation concerns and the Fed's hawkish pivot look to have done the damage already. Bitcoin has crashed nearly 40% in the past two months, with the Fed shifting focus to inflation control and signaling three rate increases this year and an end to its asset-purchase program in March.  ""Gun to my head, inflation # (830AM EST) comes in line, and the crypto reversal continues. BTC sellers re-engage around $46,000, altcoins enjoy further upside,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted. ""Too much inflation talk. Even my barber mentioned it. Only a large CPI upside surprise would see prices crash.""  Bitcoin was last trading near $42,800 alongside gains of less than 0.3% in S&P 500 futures.

42396245,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1lrL,1641984363,"Fantom, Harmony Lead Gains in Major Cryptos as DeFi Narrative Heats Up","The crypto market has surged in the past 24 hours, with bitcoin (BTC) gaining $3,000 on the back of a U.S. Federal Reserve commitment to curb the impact of inflation.  While all major cryptocurrencies saw prices spike higher, current favorites fantom (FTM), harmony (ONE), cosmos (ATOM) and near (NEAR) surged as high as 21%. Traders in crypto circles colloquially refer to a basket of these tokens as FOAN, a set of tokens associated with layer 1 blockchains, primed for decentralized finance (DeFi) activity with their cheap and fast networks.  Layer 1 blockchains are platforms such as Ethereum, Fantom and Solana that can support products and services built atop their networks. DeFi refers to blockchain-based products that rely on smart contracts instead of third parties to provide financial services to users.  Interest in FOAN comes on the back of a nearly 400% rise in solana (SOL), terra (LUNA), and avalanche (AVAX) – colloquially the SoLunAvax trade – in recent months.  FTM rose to $2.8 in European morning hours on Wednesday. The price had sunk to as low as $2.10 over the weekend before breaking through the $2.50 resistance level yesterday. FTM could be primed to reach the $3 mark should sentiment in the broader market stay intact.  Harmony's ONE token has surged more than 14% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.32 at the time of writing. The price has risen upward of 25,200% in the past two years, data show. It's still short of the $0.37 all-time high it reached in October.  Price-charts suggest ONE is currently at a resistance level and could be set to regain its record if it breaks above $0.33. A rejection from current levels could see a price drop to the $0.27 zone.  ATOM and NEAR have added 10% and 13%, respectively, in the past 24 hours. ATOM broke through a $40 resistance level, while NEAR surpassed its previous record of $17.50 to trade at $18.20 at the time of writing.  The FOAN trade outperformed as other major cryptocurrencies posted more muted gains. Bitcoin rose 2%, while SOL, cardano (ADA), and ether (ETH) saw increases of up to 5%.  DeFi premise powers FOAN bet  Fundamentals for the FOAN bet show promise for traders. DeFi activity on Cosmos and Near have grown in the past months ahead of planned upgrades on both blockchains. More than $154 million worth of assets are staked on Near-based DeFi protocols, with exchange and lending tool Ref Finance locking up over $104 million alone.  Transactional activity on Fantom has also heated up and overtook Avalanche's last week. More than 1 million transactions were processed on the Fantom network last Wednesday, with transactional activity higher than on Avalanche on both Thursday and Friday. This is despite Avalanche locking up more value than Fantom on DeFi applications – $11 billion compared with $6 billion – and hosting 127 DeFi protocols versus Fantom’s 112.  Interest in Fantom received an extra boost in the past week as Daniele Sestagalli and Andre Cronje – developers known for launching protocols on Avalanche, Ethereum and Fantom that lock billions of dollars in value – announced a collaboration on a project that will deploy on Fantom.  Harmony enjoyed much of its hype in the past month with the rise of DeFi Kingdom, an integrated game, exchange and non-fungible token (NFT) project that’s locked over $740 million worth of its native token, JEWEL, and other assets since its launch.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/12/fantom-harmony-lead-gains-in-major-cryptos-as-defi-narrative-heats-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0dc5036f840a91b7c3b876558f7f03257e6778b0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized Blockchain system that has the cryptocurrency it owns, Ether. ETH serves as a platform to support a variety of other cryptos in addition to being used to execute the decentralization of smart contracts. Ethereum was first introduced in a whitepaper from 2013 written by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, together with co-founders of the Ethereum project, obtained funding for the project through an online crowd-funding sale during the summer of 2014. Let us move ahead to read about ETH technical analysis. Past Performance of ETH ETH coin price faces a downfall of more than 20% due to the supply dump near $3850. The downfall finds support near $3000 and shows lower price rejection during the bullish reversal. The reversal shows growth of almost 10% in the past 48 hours. Source - TradingView ETH Technical Analysis The ETH coin price shows lower price rejection after the rise from the support zone at $3000. Moreover, the bullish engulfing candle breaks above $3200 and starts a bullish journey that can shortly reach above $3500.

The entity-adjusted dormancy flow, a ratio of cryptocurrency's going market value to the annualized dollar value of coin dormancy, has dropped below $250,000. Dormancy refers to the average number of days each coin transacted remained dormant or unmoved, a gauge of market's spending pattern.  The area under $250,000 has marked major price bottoms in the past, as seen in the featured image provided by data analytics firm Glassnode.  ""Entity-adjusted dormancy flow recently bottomed out, showing a full reset of the metric. These events historically print at the cyclical bottom,"" Glassnode said in a report published on Monday.  ""Low dormancy flow values indicate moments where market cap is undervalued relative to the yearly sum of realized dormancy, indicating moments where bitcoin is a value price,"" Glassnode added.  Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins mined by the price of a single coin at any given time. At press time, bitcoin's market capitalization was $809.98 billion.  Bitcoin bottomed out in July 2021 and began a new bull run with the metric falling into the green zone. The cryptocurrency hit record highs near $69,000 on Nov. 10.  While the indicator has flipped bullish again, macro factors can play spoilsport. The U.S. December consumer price index scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC may inject volatility into the market.

A little over $25 million of the losses came from bitcoin-tracked futures, according to Coinglass data. Nearly 64% of all future traders were betting on falling prices, the data shows.  A bit over $45 million worth of longs were liquidated. Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens primarily in futures trading, which only tracks asset prices, as opposed to spot trading, where traders own the actual assets.  Bitcoin rose to $43,000 during Asian hours on Wednesday, while major altcoins surged as high as 19% at the time of writing. The jump came soon after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the agency will combat the current high inflation environment, signaling that the central bank may reduce its balance sheet at a faster pace this year.  Some crypto traders and investors view bitcoin as a hedge against inflation while others consider it a risk asset like stocks, which react to tightened monetary policy resulting from high inflation, as reported.  Tuesday’s sudden move caught traders unaware. Bitcoin-linked futures on crypto exchange Binance saw traders lose $15 million in the past 24 hours, with OKEx following closely behind with $11 million in liquidations. Some 60% of all bitcoin traders were short on the two exchanges.  Losses were not limited to bitcoin futures. Ether traders saw $31 million across long and short positions, while altcoin futures linked to Near and Dogecoin saw nearly $6 million in liquidations each.

42396232,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1lfX,1641970800,Parent Company of Brazil’s Largest Crypto Exchange Enters Europe With Portuguese Acquisition,"2TM, the holding company for Mercado Bitcoin, Brazil’s largest crypto exchange by market value, has agreed to acquire a controlling stake in CriptoLoja, Portugal's first regulated crypto exchange.  The acquisition, which is step one in 2TM’s plans to expand into Europe, still needs approval from Portugal's Central Bank, 2TM told CoinDesk in a written statement, although the company expects that to occur “within the next couple of months.”  2TM did not disclose the amount of the transaction nor the exact stake acquired.  Pedro Borges and Luis Gomes, founders of CriptoLoja, will remain in charge of the company while also managing 2TM's expansion in Europe, the company added.  “Portugal is a strategic market for us, because it requires a specific license, is becoming an important hub for crypto in Europe and opens a gateway into the larger European market,” 2TM CEO Roberto Dagnoni said in a statement.  2TM will initially offer over-the-counter trading in Portugal, while it plans to include Mercado Bitcoin’s services for retail and institutional clients later.  2TM did not clarify whether CriptoLoja will be renamed Mercado Bitcoin. “We are not making any brand or naming announcements yet,” a company spokesperson told CoinDesk.  CriptoLoja launched its online crypto trading service in October 2021, Borges told CoinDesk at that time, adding that the crypto exchange allows users to buy 94 cryptocurrencies and trade them for an additional 398 other cryptos.

Dorsey wrote the proposal in an email dated Jan. 12 to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, shared on Twitter. The email was signed by Dorsey, Chaincode Labs co-founder Alex Morcos and academic Martin White as ""Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund Board.""  The main purpose of the fund is to defend developers by finding and retaining defense counsel, developing litigation strategy and paying legal bills.  According to the post, the Fund's first activity will be to run point on coordinating the defense of Craig Wright's Tulip Trading lawsuit against various bitcoin developers in relation to a ""breach of fiduciary duty"" with regards to the theft of crypto from the Mt. Gox hack.  Ontier LLP, the law firm representing Tulip Trading, has been given the green light by a London High Court to serve papers on 16 Bitcoin-related developers in a fight over funds from the defunct Mt. Gox exchange. At the same time, Wright is suing groups that hosted the Bitcoin white paper for breach of copyright.  The fund is free and voluntary for developers to use if they so choose, the email reads. It will start a corps of volunteer and part-time lawyers. The fund's board will determine which lawsuits and defendants it will help defend.  At this time, the trio says, the Fund is not looking to raise outside capital, but may do so in the future at the direction of the board  In December, Wright was found not liable for a breach of a business partnership with a former associate, deceased Florida computer forensics expert Dave Kleiman. The suit was focused on claims that Wright developed the Bitcoin protocol on his own, or if it was a partnership between Wright and Kleiman. Wright's claims that he is Satoshi were not tested in court.

Powell told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that high inflation has taken a &apos;toll&apos; on the economy and that the central bank would take steps to prevent it from &apos;becoming entrenched.&apos; However, Powell also stated that the central bank expects inflation to peak in the middle of the year, implying that a significant rate hike may not be required.
