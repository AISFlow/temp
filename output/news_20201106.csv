Meanwhile, some ether investors are moving capital out of DeFi.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $15,502 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $15,190-$15,934  BTC near its 10-day moving average but above the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price rise stalled Friday after making gains over the past 24 hours, most notably going as high as $15,934, according to CoinDesk 20 data. It was trading at $15,502 as of press time.      “BTC has been bullish for the last four weeks, incredibly rallying from $10,000 to $15,000,” noted Ian Balina, chief executive officer of analysis firm Token Metrics. “This month’s rally is similar to its previous big rally back in 2017 when BTC rallied from $6,000 to almost $20,000 over November and December.”      The last time bitcoin’s price was at these levels was back on Jan. 7, 2018, when its 24-hour low was $15,632, a descent from that day’s $16,861 high during an overall market sell-off, according to the CoinDesk 20.      “The next resistance level is between $16,000 and $17,000,” Balina added. “If it flies by that, it can retest its all-time high and possibly move above $20,000.”      Read More: As Bitcoin Surges, Google Searches Suggest Little FOMO Among Retail      A bitcoin price push higher will likely require the return of higher-than-average spot volumes. Volumes for Friday were much lower than Thursday, which at $1,569,081,137 was the highest daily average volume day since July 27. On that summer day it hit $1,579,784,44 on major USD/BTC spot exchanges. As of press time, Friday’s spot exchange volume was at $1,064,734,786.      Futures open interest for bitcoin Thursday matched a record high from Aug. 17. “Longer-term trends remain very bullish. Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest is at an all-time high at $5.7 billion and perpetual swaps funding rates are trending up,"" noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin.      ""The minor pullback today is normal and healthy,” Lau told CoinDesk. “In the past, bitcoin has experienced strong, quick moves and retracted much more. I'd look to see if BTC can settle in and establish a base before making another move upwards.”      Bitcoin’s dominance, a measure of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency’s market cap as a percentage of total crypto assets, is starting to dip. After a steady October and early November rise to 65.5%, it dropped on Friday.      Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment firm Tellurian Capital, said bitcoin might be losing some momentum after its stratospheric price rise, adding that some investors make take profits and plow them into alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins.      “BTC has already done quite a bit of work to the upside and will need to take a breather,” Bonnefous said. “At some point the rotation will occur again from BTC to these heavily sold alt tokens.”    Ether locked in DeFi drops    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Friday, trading around $442 and climbing 7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Over 642,000 ETH was moved out of DeFi as of press time, down to 8,569,000 ETH, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse.      The trend follows a rocky past 30 days for ether locked in DeFi, as about one month ago the amount of ether into DeFi was at 8,423,000 ETH. Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives venue Alpha5, says ether’s gyrations locked has to do with the ethereal nature of Ethereum’s DeFi products.      “Most of the ETH locked in DeFi is to accumulate or accrue tokens that don't have a tenable value,” Shah noted. “And as those values started to fall dramatically, the 'APY' [annual percentage yield] that served as the bait for participation in various pools naturally started dwindling.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Friday.

42385069,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmxtD,1604696665,California's Prop. 24 Could Be a 'Silver Lining' for Crypto Exchanges Looking to Comply With GDPR,"On Election Day, Californians chose not only the direction of their government but also the direction of some of the laws that government will administer. With 56% of voters approving it thus far, Proposition 24, also known as the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), is on its way to replacing key components of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), one of the more robust data privacy laws in the country.      While the CPRA is not without controversy, it raises the stakes for non-compliance and encourages businesses, including cryptocurrency exchanges, to take additional steps to respect user privacy. It also has the potential to bring those businesses closer to complying with the General Data Protection Act, the European Union privacy law that goes further than the CPRA.      “The silver lining is that an exchange that has been attempting to achieve compliance under the GDPR (e.g., employing accepted hashing techniques to effectuate data ‘deletions’) could use some of those same measures to demonstrate compliance under the CPRA,” said Steven Blickensderfer, a technology and privacy lawyer at the firm Carlton Fields. “In effect, the CPRA may force exchanges to look globally and think holistically about their privacy compliance, which may not be a bad thing after all.”    The CCPA vs. the CPRA    The CCPA was the first law of its kind in the United States. The law empowers California consumers to know when private companies collect, share or sell their data and to stop that sale if necessary. It applies to companies with annual gross revenue of more than $25 million or that possess information on 50,000 or more consumers.      The CPRA adds additional protections for sensitive data including biometric data, location data and racial data, among others. A new state agency with a budget of $10 million will enforce the law, set to go into effect in 2023. Previously, this task had fallen to the arguably understaffed California Attorney General’s office.      Cryptocurrency and Universal Basic Income advocate Andrew Yang, who ran for U.S. president in the Democratic primary, was the chair of the proposition’s advisory board. He said this could set the bar for other states.      Read more: Privacy Laws Are Only as Effective as the Companies Implementing Them      “After this becomes the law in California, I believe other states are going to look up and say, ‘Why do Californians have all these data and privacy rights that we don’t have?’” Yang told ABC7 News. “So, as usual, California could end up leading the way.”      At least one crypto company supported the passage of the law. Kosala Hemachandra, the founder and CEO of Los Angeles-based MyEtherWallet (MEW), said the company is a big proponent of initiatives like Proposition 24, as well as laws that increase data privacy and give people control over how their data is used and distributed.      “An increasingly digital world means that more and more personal data is available for companies to profit off of, and laws like this are a good step towards ensuring user privacy,” said Hemachandra in an email to CoinDesk.      “MEW doesn’t collect data on our users, and we’re against the practice of mass data collection without the proper consent. User privacy will continue to become an increasingly important issue in the days and years to come, and it’ll continue to be a right that we uphold for our users.”    Not a data privacy panacea    The law is not without controversy, however. In a statement released in mid-October, the American Civil Liberties Union and several of its California chapters opposed the proposition.      “Proposition 24 won’t strengthen privacy rights for Californians,” wrote Jacob Snow and Chris Conley of the Northern California ACLU. “Instead, it will undermine protections in current law and increase the burden on people to protect themselves – in ways that will disproportionately harm poor people and people of color.”      The CPRA allows people to manually opt out of data collection, which they would have to do for the relevant digital services they use, placing that burden on the consumer rather than the companies.      In July, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote about its concerns that the law could result in expanded “pay for privacy” schemes.      Read more: Downvoted: Security Researchers Slam Voatz Over Stance on White-Hat Hackers      “Specifically, the initiative would exempt ‘loyalty clubs’ from the CCPA’s existing limit on businesses charging different prices to consumers who exercise their privacy rights,” wrote Lee Tien, Adam Schwartz and Hayley Tsukayama.      Effectively, this means that companies could charge people more if they asserted their privacy rights. One example of this could be a media company offering a free subscription if customers chose not to exert their rights. Privacy advocates contend this would disproportionately impact low-income consumers.    The impact going forward    Criticism of the Prop. 24 deserves further consideration and action, but Blickensderfer laid out a few benefits to the law when it’s implemented.      “The creation of an agency dedicated to enforcing California’s consumer privacy laws is a potential game-changer,” he said.      One criticism of the CCPA by privacy advocates is the California Attorney General’s office is spread too thin and not in a position to enforce the law effectively, according to Blickensderfer. Having a dedicated privacy watchdog in the U.S. would change that and mirror how privacy is enforced in Europe and other parts of the world.      It also introduces another, more proactive model of enforcement aside from “private causes of action,” he said. A private right of action allows an individual to sue for relief from injuries caused by a violation of a legal requirement, but only if harm or injuries have already occured.      Also, the CPRA brings California a few steps closer to Europe’s GDPR.      “In fact, I would not be surprised if eventually we see efforts made to determine that California is an adequate jurisdiction under the GDPR for purposes of approving cross-border transfers from the European Economic Area to California,” he said.      Read more: EU Privacy Shield Ruling Is an Opportunity and Conundrum for Decentralized Tech      As CoinDesk has previously reported, in July the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) struck down a key data-sharing agreement between the United States and European Union.      The 2016 agreement, known as the Privacy Shield, let American companies self-certify they are complying with data privacy laws such as the GDPR. The ruling focused in large part on the lack of a federal privacy law in the U.S., and the ways the U.S. security agencies conduct extensive surveillance of individuals including their data.      “That could be a potential boon for business in California, as everyone is still struggling to figure out the legality of such transfers,” said Blickensderfer.      Businesses will have to likely go beyond CCPA compliance and further in the direction of the GDPR to be compliant with CPRA. With 2023 set for implementation, though, there are a couple of years to work this out. But that doesn’t mean there is any reason to delay.      “As in Europe, once enforcement starts the new regulator will likely have little compassion for businesses that have had two years to come into compliance,” said Blickensderfer",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/06/californias-prop-24-could-be-a-silver-lining-for-crypto-exchanges-looking-to-comply-with-gdpr,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dff19ad98ac6a774af6cf61af5e1621de41ae2c0-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Former SoFi executive Mike Cagney’s fintech company is seeking the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s approval to offer its home equity loans and financing services across the U.S.  Currently, Figure has 96 licenses from 49 states, and CEO Cagney says that without the national charter it could end up with 200 licenses by next year. Being regulated as a national bank would replace that expensive hodgepodge with a single overseer.  Figure's Provenance platform is the tech unicorn's claim to fame. The company says the blockchain platform is far more efficient at processing loans than traditional mechanisms.  In March, Figure conducted on-chain every step of a $150 million home equity loan securitization.  SoFi, Cagney's previous company, was approved for a national bank charter by the OCC last month. It was the online lender's second attempt; the fintech tried unsuccessfully when Cagney still ran it a few years ago.

42385062,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmxoB,1604688675,"Spot Markets, Not Leverage, Fuel Bitcoin's Price Rally Amid Mild Derivative Liquidations","Red-hot spot markets are primarily fueling bitcoin’s recent rally as the leading cryptocurrency trades at three-year highs around $15,500, suggesting the bull market may have room to continue.      Unlike previously rallies, derivatives markets are playing a markedly less prominent role, demonstrated by mild liquidation volumes.      The presence of derivatives in bitcoin’s ongoing rally is “muted in comparison to previous run-ups,” said Matt Kaye, managing partner at Santa Monica-based Blockhead Capital. Talking to CoinDesk, Kaye said, “The market is clearly spot-dominated, and it appears that most of the bidding is coming out of the U.S.,” continuing a trend CoinDesk reported in May.      On Thursday, BitMEX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange known for attracting unorthodox, high-leverage traders, reported $54 million in liquidated bitcoin futures contracts during the most recent rally, well below the still mild liquidation volume of $75 million reported on Oct. 21 when bitcoin reached then-new yearly highs, breaking above $13,000, according to Skew.      Large liquidations might not happen until the leading cryptocurrency breaks above its all-time highs just below $20,000, said Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, in a direct message with CoinDesk. “Frankly, there’s not much leverage in the market now anyways,” he said.      Significant price movements typically trigger large-scale liquidations in characteristically overleveraged cryptocurrency futures markets. But the mild liquidations throughout bitcoin’s recent rally signals that the typically prominent derivatives markets has taken a back seat and the spot market has the wheel.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Rivalry With Gold Plus Millennial Interest Gives It ‘Considerable’ Upside Potential: JPMorgan      Corroborating the quietness of derivatives markets amid bitcoin's soaring price action is that less than $500 million in bitcoin futures positions had been liquidated in the past 24 hours, as of 14:35 UTC Friday, across seven leading trading platforms as bitcoin neared $16,000. The largest reported liquidation of $5.97 million happened on BitMEX, according to derivatives data aggregator Bybt.      Regulatory troubles weathered by leading leveraged trading exchanges including BitMEX, OKEx and Huobi explain the subdued influence that derivatives markets play in bitcoin’s current rally, according to Davies.      That liquidation volumes are low relative to bitcoin’s price movements could be an encouraging sign for bitcoin bulls, according to Aditya Das, cryptocurrency market analyst at Brave New Coin.      ""The quiet funding rate and relatively low number of liquidations could be read as a positive sign that this rally may have legs and is not close to overheating because of speculators,” he told CoinDesk in a direct message.

Top shelf    Monster quarter Cash App, the mobile payment service of Square (helmed by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey), generated $1.63 billion in bitcoin revenue and $32 million in bitcoin gross profit for Square during the third quarter of 2020, according to the company’s Q3 investor letter. This is 11 times more in bitcoin revenue than Q2’s $875 million, when Square profited $17 million from selling bitcoin. Still, Square’s bitcoin business has relatively tame profits for a money services business, with profit margins shy of 2%. In an earnings call, Dorsey said, “We believe [bitcoin] will be the native currency of the internet, and help people thrive around the world and the economy.”      Buterin’s stake Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has sent 3,200 ether, worth around $1.4 million, to Ethereum 2.0's newly launched deposit contract.

Designed to give users control over personal information it also streamlines ""tedious"" form filling by automatically providing the validated data required by the requesting entity. Using the Quorum blockchain, the group said, will ensure that data has not been altered. The system could roll out in May 2021.

(The Block)  Andy Edstrom: Financial advisors, Bitcoin is the next Amazon. (CoinDesk)  Market intel    No FOMO Despite climbing to levels last seen in the 2017 bitcoin bubble, web search data suggest little crypto “FOMO” among the masses. After getting close to $16,000 yesterday, bitcoin is still trading in the mid-$15K range, nearly 120% up on a year-to-date basis. Google Trends, a barometer used to gauge general interest in trending topics, is currently returning a value of 10 for the worldwide search query ""bitcoin price"" – significantly lower than the value of 93 observed in early December 2017 following bitcoin's record break above $15,000.    At stake    Gradually, then suddenly CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, thinks crypto is still in the “gradual” phase of “gradually, then suddenly.” Reading the tea leaves of headlines – from PayPal’s crypto play to Microstrategy’s bitcoin buy – in October can create the image that mass adoption is right around the corner. The truth is, crypto is still maturing.      In the latest CoinDesk Monthly Review (available for download here), the team looks back at some key Bitcoin and Ethereum performance metrics from last month. What was found is gathering momentum, and an ever clearer sense of real use cases, albeit gradually.      Notably, Ethereum’s volatility, transaction count and fees have cooled – after a summer that saw the second-largest blockchain “flippen” Bitcoin in many of those key measures.      In September, ETH’s 30-day volatility (annualized) spiked approximately 110%. While bitcoin’s volatility flattened throughout October, ether’s declined – a signal that “the ETH market is still more immature than that of BTC,” Acheson and CoinDesk research analyst Christine Kim write.      Further, average transaction fees on Ethereum fell over 80% in October, retracing September’s sharp increase. A similar drop in miner revenues also occurred, as dapp activity cooled.      “This is a positive sign for the network, which in recent months has been pushed to its limits by the splashy debuts of new DeFi assets such as COMP, SUSHI and others,” they write.      It’s likely that many more rises and falls are in store before Ethereum “suddenly” takes hold.

42385073,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmy21,1604681313,Money Reimagined: Crypto-Informed Ideas for the Future of Government,"The good news is America is not in the midst of a full-blown civil war – not yet, at least.      But, however you feel about Joe Biden’s apparent victory in the most difficult presidential election in living memory, you’d be foolish to believe all is well in this country. Four years after Donald Trump rode a wave of white suburban discontent to a shock victory, and with the echoes of this year’s Black Lives Matter protests still resonating, the vitriol and conspiracy theories generated by a starkly divided vote suggest trust in the U.S. system of government is cratering.      Why? Well, as a starting point, the American Dream has been decimated by the disruptive forces of globalization and digitization. Huge swaths of society, many concentrated in the so-called Rust Belt of the Midwest, no longer believe the future will be brighter for them or their children.      That stirs up the same-old 20th century ideological arguments for getting the Dream back. (The left wants to tax the rich and widen the safety net for the middle class while the right says that’s socialism and that it will halt job creation.)      But there’s a more fundamental problem here: governance itself is broken. Too many people feel they have no agency, their voices aren’t heard, they have no means to shape policies that are dictated by vested interests.      We need a system designed for a globalized economy and an internet-connected society, one that favors transparency, accountability and efficiency, and which mitigates the influence of hidden, vested-interest money. We need to address the principal-agent problem.      This column is most definitely not going to say “blockchain fixes this.” But it will draw on a guiding CoinDesk maxim, one coined by Executive Editor Marc Hochstein: “Blockchain doesn’t have all the answers but it asks the right questions.”      Applying the lens of decentralization and programmable contracts to big societal issues can help expose where current thinking is wrong. It can reveal how centralized control of information and transactions enables powerful interests to influence policy and, in so doing, undermine the free market. And it helps us think creatively around how new open-information and incentive models might address those problems.      It doesn’t mean “put it on a blockchain.” (And definitely not blockchain voting – bad idea.) It means thinking outside the box.      In our weekly Money Reimagined podcast, Sheila Warren and I talked to two outside-the-box thinkers on their ideas for improving governance.    Quadratic voting and open auctions    One of our guests was Glen Weyl, the political economist and Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research New England, who co-authored the book “Radical Markets” with University of Chicago Law School professor Eric Posner. We chose to focus on just two of the many ideas that that book puts forward.      One is quadratic voting, which allows people not only to vote for or against a particular issue but to express how strongly they hold that view by buying extra votes – up to a certain limit of assigned credits. The cost in credits of each additional vote increases by a quadratic formula. It’s designed to help small groups of voters who care deeply about particular issues while still constraining them from overly skewing results.      Weyl has also worked on a variation of the concept with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin called quadratic funding, which in theory could diminish the influence of wealthy “whales” in voting systems that are based on financial holdings or contributions.      The second big idea we explored is that of perpetual open auctions. Here, every bit of property, including what we might otherwise think of as public property, is owned by private entities with the proviso that it is always up for auction and that the majority of the value created from it is shared equally among citizens as a social dividend.      Weyl and Posner argue that such an arrangement would incentivize owners to manage the property well, and that the wider distribution of wealth creation would give a greater number of people the wherewithal to start businesses. It would also be easier to develop land for infrastructure, such as high-speed rail lines, because the developer could easily acquire it.      Both of these ideas are rooted more in legal and process innovation than in software and distributed computing per se. But they intersect nicely with concepts associated with the crypto and blockchain space.      One is the potential for self-sovereign identity models to prevent people from gaming quadratic voting. Another is the potential enhancements that smart contracts, non-fungible token-based property, and decentralized finance (DeFi) concepts such as automated market-making might bring to open auctions. Also, quadratic funding might fix free-rider problems in blockchain projects, Buterin believes.    Smart taxation    Our other guest was Jeff Saviano, the global lead of tax innovation at EY. He is a member of the Prosperity Collaborative, within which organizations such as the World Bank, MIT Media Lab’s Connection Sciences lab and the New America Foundation are working with governments to improve transparency and efficiency in the collection and distribution of taxes.      Saviano talks of how blockchain-based tracing systems might not only give taxpayers a transparent view of how their taxes are being spent but also incorporate programmability.      For example, the actual, uniquely identified dollars that you contribute could be channeled directly and transparently into identifiable services that immediately benefit you and your community. Or, governments could use smart contracts to put hard constraints on those dollars, so only certain categories of expenditure, and not others, are enabled.    Restoring the social covenant    Whether these ideas work or not, policymakers must restore the social covenant between those who govern and those who are governed. And that comes down to trust.      We are the principals in this relationship. As our representatives, government leaders are supposed to be our agents. But if there is insufficient trust in them, people instead see them as competitors.      As has been seen in countless failed states, a vicious, self-fulfilling cycle can arise. People avoid paying taxes so as not to feed the kleptocracy, which starves the state of the resources it needs, encouraging more corruption and theft by police and other employees of the state.      The endgame in all that is a collapse in the most important expression of the state’s relationship with its people: its currency. The hyperinflation seen in Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela can be thought of as a manifestation of the collapse in the social covenant.      It’s worrying to think similar breakdowns may be underway in western nations, including the U.S. While there are currently no big inflation risks in the benchmark Consumer Price Index, these kinds of concerns underpin this month’s sharp rally in bitcoin, which burst through $15,000 on Thursday.      Buying bitcoin is one way for people to protect themselves from future governance failures. But it’s more important that we find solutions to prevent those failures.    Did prediction markets fail their big test?    Around 9 p.m. ET during the early vote-counting phase of the U.S. election on Tuesday evening, the value of the Trump futures contract on FTX crypto derivatives exchange dramatically surged higher. As you can see in the chart below – a five-day snapshot taken on Thursday morning from the FTX website – the value of the contract doubled from about $0.40 to $0.80 at that time. FTX was then assigning an 80% probability to President Trump winning the election. Early Wednesday morning, an even more dramatic change happened: The contract’s value plunged all the way down to around $0.12, which is more or less where it stayed.      There’s an easy explanation for this relatively short-lived spike. Early results on Tuesday showed some strong numbers for President Trump, especially in the vital battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and there was not yet any data on the shift that would later go toward Joe Biden once early-voting and mail-in ballots were counted. Suddenly, expectations had changed from what the FTX market and other prediction markets such as PredictIt had been saying in the days beforehand, when Biden was forecast to win.      All through the week, politicos had been warning about the “red mirage” effect, where the early count would favor Trump because more of his voters were expected to vote on Election Day whereas Biden vote would skew toward early or mail-in votes, which were to be counted later. We were repeatedly told to be patient, that we were in it for the long haul. All this was, in other words, predictable ahead of time. In short, neither the rally or the subsequent sell-off should have happened at all.      So much for the “wisdom of the crowd.” So much for prediction markets.      It seems all FTX did on Tuesday evening was to enable speculators to take short-run bets on people’s herd instincts during the hyperbole of election-night TV commentary.      This was supposed to be prediction markets’ coming-out moment. The most high-profile election of all time and tight polling made for a big chance to show off what the new crypto-based versions of an old idea could do. Instead, we got further evidence to back up past results showing prediction markets don’t work well.    The global town hall    BITSTRATEGY. One person no doubt pleased with bitcoin’s price surge over $15,000 is Michael Saylor. In separate transactions in August and September, the CEO of investment advisory firm MicroStrategy shifted a total of $425 million worth of the company’s cash on hand into the dominant cryptocurrency. The move turned Saylor into a rock star in crypto circles, set off some copycat measures by other companies such as fintech provider Mode Global Holdings and payments service Square, and stirred a debate on whether bitcoin is a viable treasury-management asset for companies looking to protect the purchasing value of their cash.      Veteran Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Zweig wasn’t impressed, though. An otherwise balanced analysis of Saylor’s move ended on this note:      “...MicroStrategy is no longer just a software company. Now it’s a bitcoin bet. Investors who wish to buy bitcoin could always do so themselves with the proceeds of a dividend or share buybacks. The point of buying a stock is to get a stake in a business, not to take a flier on cryptocurrency.”      It’s a clever line, but in the face of the improvement in bitcoin’s price Saylor could equally argue that he’s achieved what he needs to do. He legitimately sees a decline in the dollar’s purchasing power because even though the benchmark measure of the consumer price index is stable to low, there are rising prices in asset markets, in food and commodities. This was a hedging strategy for a time of great uncertainty and, as anyone who’s tried to run a business in the middle of a crisis will tell you, a necessary one. Sometimes the need to survive is more important than running the underlying business activity. You have to make smart decisions around cash on hand.      Yes, Saylor could have launched a share buyback to return value to stockholders, but doing so would leave less room for maneuver with cash on hand in the future (should an acquisition target come along, for example) and would continue to tie the company’s valuations to a fiat valuation he believes will be depleted in purchasing power terms. So, it really comes down to whether or not you believe there’ll be long-term inflation.      I'm looking forward to chatting with Saylor next week when he joins our “Bitcoin for Advisors” event for registered financial advisors.      GOING IT ALONE. Andrew Browne, another veteran financial journalist, also formerly of The Wall Street Journal and now at Bloomberg, took a look at China’s new policy of “self reliance.” Somewhat alarmingly, the phrase, which was inserted into Xi Jingping’s new five-year plan, stems from Mao-era rhetoric. But as Browne points out, it’s unlikely to mean China is closing its doors and may even end up making its economy more open and less isolationist. The reality is the kind of policies Xi’s government will need to pursue to give greater emphasis to its domestic economy and reduce China’s reliance on foreign export markets will require it to further open up to foreign service firms, especially in the field of finance.      Browne doesn’t mention capital controls. But any talk of liberalizing financial services to better serve domestic consumers and businesses inevitably leads to that question, because to grow such businesses with foreign help there needs to be a more free-flowing interest rate market, which in turn requires a more open flow of capital in and out of the economy.      One big question is, what does this mean for cryptocurrencies? Would looser capital controls put the yuan under pressure and favor bitcoin, or would that lower the appeal of bitcoin, which has been used by Chinese nationals to bypass those restrictions?      Another question: How does this tie into China’s new digital currency, the digital currency electronic payments (DCEP) system? Lowering capital controls might signal a path to making that currency available in offshore markets or as a payment rail in overseas supply chains such as those expected to operate over China’s One Belt One Road network. But probably more important though less obvious to observers obsessed with China’s geopolitical strategy is that “self reliance” is consistent with the heavy investment the country is making in integrating technologies such as the DCEP with its Blockchain Services Network to boost the performance of its domestic economy.      Tying those in with a host of data-driven Fourth Industrial Revolution developments could give China an advantage in its competition with the U.S.    Relevant reads    Square Reports Over $1B in Quarterly Bitcoin Revenue for First Time: Q3 Earnings. Something that’s going to be quite different about this bull run in bitcoin from the last one three years ago is it will be accompanied by upbeat earnings reports from mainstream companies with exposure to it. We discussed MicroStrategy above. This news, reported by Brady Dale, is from Square. Worth noting is that what’s good for Square shareholders isn’t necessarily good for its customers, as these revenues represent the fees they are paying for using a payments technology that, in theory, should be middleman-free.      US Seized More Than $1B in Silk Road–Linked Bitcoins, Seeks Forfeiture. It’s the bitcoin crime story that will never go away. U.S. agents seized some $1 billion worth of bitcoin they say was earned by the shuttered Silk Road drug market. The massive stash was forfeited by an unnamed hacker who had stolen the bitcoin from Silk Road. The report raises more questions than it answers – such as, what involvement did jailed Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht play in all this? Kevin Reynolds reports.      Ethereum 2.0 Countdown Begins With Release of Deposit Contract. It’s hard to keep track of all that happened in this past, busy week of news. This one would have been a much bigger story if it weren’t for the bitcoin rally and the return of Silk Road: the first big step in Ethereum’s long-awaited, highly complex migration to its new proof-of-stake architecture. CoinDesk reporter Will Foxley has been all over this. He reports on the deposit contract by which a group of market participants will lock up their existing ether funds in return for the right to own a new version of ether that will operate within a parallel proof-of-stake network.      In the CBDC Race, It’s Better to Be Last. In a contrarian take, CoinDesk columnist JP Koning – one of the first people to envisage a central bank digital currency with his “Fedcoin” idea in 2014 – is now saying the U.S. can afford to take its time. While others worry American tardiness will put it at a disadvantage to China’s fast-moving digital currency, Koning says that because, like all central banks, the Federal Reserve is a de facto monopoly, it need not worry about competition and can instead afford to wait. I disagree, but if you’re a regular consumer of Money Reimagined, you’d already know that. Koning, as always, is a good read.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Michael J.

42385064,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmxpR,1604673049,To Stake or No? That's the Eth 2.0 Question,"Now that Ethereum 2.0 is finally set to go live, people face a crucial decision: whether or not to stake. It comes down to balancing the age-old calculus of risk and reward. Ethereum 2.0 holds out the promise of steady if not “moon”-like staking returns – but the network upgrade also creates illiquidity through lockups and real risks in running infrastructure.      For a network with a market cap north of $40 billion, there is now a lot at … stake. Admittedly, we will only be at the inauspicious-sounding phase 0. But after delays and more delays, at last it’s time for crypto investors to make a decision on staking. And if you do choose to join the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon chain launch, do you run your own nodes or farm that complex, demanding work to a 24/7 service provider?    Tim Ogilvie is the CEO of Staked, which runs staking infrastructure for institutional investors, exchanges, custodians, and wallets.    Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake has seemed existential for the crypto community. It is by far the biggest network to opt for proof-of-stake (PoS) over proof-of-work (PoW). But over a year of inspections and testnets, the network seems robust, the “final final” audits are complete. This month a deposit contract opened. In a few short weeks, as early as Dec. 1, Ethereum 2.0 will ship.      In all the excitement, it’s easy to forget participants face hard choices with immense ramifications.    No going back    First of all, of course, the network needs to be secured for Ethereum to thrive. Everybody staking 32 ETH to run a node is playing their part to strengthen the blockchain’s security.      These true believers, who were in at the ground floor when Ethereum’s ICO launched, finally have an opportunity to help the network progress to the next level of security. Long-term ETH holders no doubt believe a secure network can support the health of the blockchain – and with it the price of their prized assets. All the while, they can earn some yield along the way.    What you need to consider when staking on Ethereum 2.0To Stake or not to stake? The most immediate choice will be whether or not to stake on Ethereum 2.0. Staking offers rewards including yields north of 20%. But potential stakers must balance this with the risk that staked ETH will be locked up, and therefore illiquid, for an indefinite period. On top of this, stakers face the prospect of being “slashed” if they fail to perform their duties properly.Should I use a third-party staking provider? Staking and running a node requires both infrastructure and expertise. For this reason, potential stakers must decide whether to do so themselves or delegate the task through staking providers. Those who choose this option delegate the task of staking to third parties with or without giving up their assets depending on the type of provider. These staking infrastructure services are designed to fulfill the staking function optimally to help reduce risk.Short on ETH? You can pool your resources. The 32 ETH required to stake to run a node on the network may prove prohibitive for many. However, they have the option of joining staking pools that aggregate smaller amounts of ETH.    Standing up nodes in multiples of 32 ETH and running them with barely any downtime while the assets are locked up for what could be years won’t be for everyone – and it shouldn’t be. Whether staked alone or via a pool, once an asset is put on the Beacon chain, there is no going back to the original. Stakers whose ETH will remain locked up until a later phase must be willing to be locked into a long-term commitment.      In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) with its breakneck speed of change and innovation and often eye-popping returns, speculators may well feel their assets are put to best use elsewhere. Still, the estimated yield, depending on how many stakers join the network, is 8%-15%. That will not match some of the more exciting, and risky, decentralized finance (DeFi) staking projects. But it is solid, and way better than familiar rates found in centralized finance.      See also: FTX Looking to List ‘Beacon Chain’ Ether as Deposit Contract Goes Live      There is also the likelihood that staked ETH on the Beacon chain will be tokenized. In other words, even though the ETH is locked up securing the network, a derivative of this asset will be created, used and traded given investors and developers have shown no lack of imagination in experimenting with DeFi systems.    Trustless faith    Stakers need to weigh the complexity of running nodes on a major chain with the risk of being slashed for failing to stay up persistently or for other issues such as double-signing. Ethereum 2.0 staking requires the commitment and hassle of maintaining a node for years. Those inclined to support network security and earn steady yield may still shy away from the obligations of regularly tending to their servers.      That’s where staking-as-a-service providers come in – and again people have choices to make. As with many areas of cryptocurrency, a core decision is whether to give up your asset to a provider, or to choose a non-custodial service instead. At my company, Staked, we believe investors should have help in earning yield without having to give up custody of their assets. We typically support institutions, but we know not everybody can afford the 32 ETH (about $13,000) required to run each node. Pooling options such as Rocketpool, which will allow users to stake as little as 0.01 ETH, should become available to fulfill this need.      See also: Tim Oglivie – Tokenized Staked ETH Will Replace ETH – And That’s a Good Thing      Whatever the decision participants make at this point, it is a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the blockchain community in general. As Ethereum 2.0 moves through its phases, the network should be able to achieve real scale. A blockchain with a current sluggish speed of 14 transactions per second has obvious limitations. But Ethereum 2.0, with the potential of reaching 100,000 transactions per second, could help the network realize its stated ambition of becoming a “world computer.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Tim Ogilvie,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/06/to-stake-or-no-thats-the-eth-20-question,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d29403bfe64d5b3b576a7fc0ef01bfc29d89929-2048x1416.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The recent rally left the largest cryptocurrency up 116% year to date, and some bullish digital-asset market analysts were already looking at even higher levels. Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the crypto prime broker Bequant, said in an email there's the potential for a squeeze in the options market to push up prices in the next several days.      ""This, coupled with continued uncertainty around U.S. election results and the economic fallout from the Covid pandemic's resurgence, could see us push towards $17,000,"" he said.      In traditional markets, U.S. futures were lower ahead of a closely-watched government report due out Friday on employment trends in October. Gold rose 0.3% to $1,956 an ounce.    Market Moves    As bitcoin shot above $15,000, analysts on Thursday were reaching back into the cryptocurrency's 11-year history for clues on what comes next.      Prices have already doubled this year, just as they did in 2019, and bitcoin is now being openly discussed by global banks like Deutsche Bank as the world's best-performing asset. A lot of observers say the price movements are random and not necessarily linked to broad macroeconomic trends. While the relationship remains on the weaker side, for most of this year, correlation between the cryptocurrency’s price movements and traditional markets have been increasing.      And the investment narrative that bitcoin fund marketeers are pitching looks pretty strong at the moment: Not only has the cryptocurrency been cast by many bulls as the future of money and perhaps a threat to the existing financial system, but it's also positioned as an inflation hedge at a time when the Federal Reserve and other central banks are printing trillions of dollars of money to stimulate markets and economies, with few apparent signs of any slowdown.      Now there's a belief among many traders that the fear of missing out, or FOMO, could drive faster adoption of cryptocurrencies by both retail and institutional investors – and rapidly drive prices to a new record high above $20,000.      That's where the history lesson comes in. As some analysts have been signaling this week, bitcoin prices have now entered a territory they've so rarely visited before that investors reading price-chart patterns – a widely followed practice among crypto traders known as ""technical analysis"" – see easy-to-spot stopping points between $15,000 and $20,000.      ""The technical setup has been building for a while now, and it has finally broken through,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told subscribers in an email.      The screen grab above, from the digital-asset-market analysis firm Messari, shows that bitcoin had previously traded just 20 days above the $15,000 price level, all of them in 2017.      And it was powerful indeed: Once the $15,000 level was breached, bitcoin quickly shot up to the all-time high near $20,000.      Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset firm Diginex, called it a ""price vacuum."" So the speculation now is that a repeat might be in the cards.      This all might be wishful thinking from traders who analysts and investors who really have no more insight into the future than anyone else and are just lucky enough to be in digital-asset markets at a time when the fast-growing ecosystem seems to be one of the few sectors that's truly thriving.      A slow, steady advance might be more convincing to newcomers and the ""crypto curious"" than a quick march to the top that's quickly reversed. Whatever the case, the prevailing mood in the market is pushing toward ""extreme greed"" from ""fear"" just a month ago.      ""The case for bitcoin gets stronger every day,"" according to Messari. ""Resistance is futile.""      If there even is any.    Bitcoin watch    Web search data suggests popular interest in bitcoin remains at normal levels, despite a sharp price rally to near $16,000.       The top cryptocurrency has chalked up a nearly 50% gain in the past four weeks to trade as high as $15,971 early Friday, a level last seen during the bull market frenzy between December 2017 and January 2018.      Some observers say the rally is now being driven higher by retail greed and fear of missing out, known as FOMO. However, Google data suggests otherwise.      Google Trends, a barometer used to gauge general interest in trending topics, is currently returning a value of 10 for the worldwide search query ""bitcoin price.""      That's significantly lower than the value of 93 observed in early December 2017 following bitcoin's record break above $15,000.  The current reading is also lower than the peak of 19 observed in the second week of May when bitcoin underwent its third mining reward ""halving.""      Google's data suggests that retail investors are showing calm over bitcoin's recent rally and the market is far from being in a state of bull frenzy.      With popular interest still relatively low, it seems safe to say that FOMO is yet to take hold of the market and the ongoing institutional-driven rally has legs.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: As Bitcoin Surges, Google Searches Suggest Little FOMO Among Retail Investors    What's hot    Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin sends $1.4M of ether in preparation for second-biggest blockchain network's ""2.0"" upgrade to staking system (CoinDesk)      Jack Dorsey’s Cash App generated an eye watering $1.63 billion in bitcoin revenue during Q3 of 2020 (CoinDesk)      Buggy code in this Compound Finance fork just froze $1M in Ethereum tokens (CoinDesk)      Fidelity launches engineering hiring initiative to build out crypto trade and custody services (The Block)      Bitcoin ""accumulation addresses"" rise to record high of more than 519K (CoinDesk)      South Korean crypto firms must disclose users' identities under planned law change (CoinDesk)      Lightning Network operators are bracing for the curious new users that usually come with a bull run (CoinDesk)      Bitcoin is the new Amazon (CoinDesk Opinion)      Swiss fintech firm Taurus wins Sygnum Bank as client of digital-asset custody services (CoinDesk)      Ethereum transaction fees ebb as DeFi fever subsides (CoinDesk Research):    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    U.S. October employment report expected to show gain in nonfarm payrolls of 530K, slowing from September's 661K (CNBC)      Australian regulator reduces the assets banks must hold in a central-bank committed facility by $25B, acknowledging that institutions are increasingly buying government bonds considered low-risk to meet the threshold (Reuters)      U.S. jobless claims remain elevated, at higher-than-expected 751K for most recent week (St. Louis Fed)      Federal Reserve holds rates close to zero, maintains asset purchases, argues for more fiscal support, pledges more monetary support if needed (CoinDesk)    Tweet of the Day",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/06/first-mover-resistance-is-futile-as-bitcoin-breaches-15k-crypto-gets-greedy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4960b606915b4f9435032e03d64de33357d299cd-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Buterin's ""VB2"" address sent 100 transactions for 32 ether each, all in totaling 3,200 units of the cryptocurrency, as reported by TrustedNodes. The amount is worth around $1.4 million at press time.  The transactions (visible here) were sent to Ethereum 2.0's newly launched deposit contract, which went live Wednesday as a means for network participants to move funds from the current proof-of-work blockchain to the soon-to-launch proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.  Since then, public Ethereum participants have been able to deposit the minimum 32 ether required to stake on Eth 2.0.  The deposit contract now holds 38,693 ether, worth some $17 million.  Staking is a way of supporting a PoS blockchain network by committing funds for a period of time in return for rewards. PoS networks do not rely on mining, as do the existing Ethereum network and Bitcoin.  Ethereum 2.0 is expected to launch soon, possibly in early December, after the date was brought back from Bitcoin's launch anniversary on Jan. 1.  The ""Genesis"" launch requires 16,384 validators to deposited funds equivalent to 524,288 ether into the contract. At that point the Beacon chain, the core of Ethereum 2.0, will go live.

Google's data suggests retail investors are showing calm over bitcoin's recent rally and the market is far from being in a state of bull frenzy.  Google search values typically rise following a major bull run as high street investors, who missed the early rise, often scan the internet for price information before joining the market.  Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of actual search requests made to Google and scales their searches on a range of 0 to 100, according to the company.  FOMO action is widely considered a sign of an asset nearing a major top as retailers are usually the last to join the market.  But with popular interest still relatively low, it seems safe to say that FOMO is yet to take hold of the market and the ongoing institutional-driven rally has legs.  Bitcoin peaked at a record high of $20,000 in mid-December 2017. At the same time, the worldwide search query ""Bitcoin Price"" touched 100 on Google Trends.  It's worth noting, though, that a high search value does not necessarily translate into increased buying pressure. Often investors search for information, but remain on the fence.  At press time, bitcoin is trading near $15,588, representing a 118% gain on a year-to-date basis. The figure of $15,971 reached early Friday was a 33-month high.

42421786,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXqH7t,1604656851,"Financial Advisors, Bitcoin Is the Next Amazon","This is what skeptical investors are saying:  1. ""It's a bubble.""  Andy Edstrom, CFA, CFP, is the author of the book ""Why Buy Bitcoin"", a financial advisor and Head of Institutional at Swan Bitcoin. He is a speaker at CoinDesk's Bitcoin for Advisors event, Nov. 9-10, 2020.  2. ""It's just one competitor among many in the field.""  3. ""It only has a few million users.""  4. ""It's used for crime.""  5. ""It won't be able to scale up enough to grow into its valuation.""  6. ""It doesn't generate cash flow and probably never will.""  The year is 2005, and they are talking about Amazon, which:  1. has recently suffered a bubble and bust in which its stock lost over 90% of its value,  2. still has plenty of online retail competitors,  3. has only a few million monthly active users,  4. is regularly used to evade sales tax,  5. seems unlikely to grow into its valuation, and  6. generates no cash flow.  Having recovered somewhat from its lows after the dot-com bubble burst, the stock at the time is trading at $35 per share, and there is a lively debate about how overvalued it is.  Fast forward to 2020. Amazon stock trades around $3,300 per share (over 90x its 2005 price), and it has single-handedly driven a significant portion of the total return of the S&P 500 in recent years.  Now wind back the clock again and imagine you are a wealth manager back in 2005. If you have zero investment allocation to Amazon, you are probably in the majority.  Now fast forward again and imagine you are a wealth manager in 2020. If you have zero investment allocation to Amazon, you are probably out of business.  I am a wealth manager, and in 2005 a lot of people (myself included) underestimated Amazon's total addressable market. At first we thought it was online book sales. Then it was global book sales. Then it was online purchases of stuff. Then it was global online purchases of stuff. Then it was the cloud infrastructure required to support this e-commerce edifice, then...  Wealth managers who didn't buy bitcoin for their clients will be like those wealth managers who never bought Amazon: out of business.  Amazon's success is partly due to great management. But it also comes from the creation of a well-functioning, internet-native (and therefore network-native) market for online commerce that is open to all suppliers. Amazon couldn't have become the ""everything store"" without opening up the marketplace to third-party sellers. This increased the available inventory of items for sale and cemented Amazon's position as the place that everyone visits to buy just about anything.  Thus Amazon became a major internet platform whose market capitalization exceeds $1.5 trillion, even while continuing to munch away at a total addressable market that is multiples larger. Even today, Amazon only has 7% share of the retail market – it still has ample room to grow.  These days my wealth management peers are still making the same mistake with Bitcoin they did with Amazon in 2005. (See the list above of criticisms of Amazon stock 15 years ago – bubble, competition, low usage, criminality, inability to scale and no cashflow.) But now, more than a decade after 10,000 bitcoins were exchanged for two pizzas (analogous to the first successful completion of a book order via Amazon), Bitcoin has pretty clearly ""won"" the market for digital hard money. Just like Amazon became the obvious winner of the e-commerce market years ago and yet still continues to gobble up share of this enormous potential market, Bitcoin still has very far to run.  See also: 4 Charts Showing Why Financial Advisers Should Care About Bitcoin  Gold, which is the world's preferred hard money, is roughly a $10 trillion asset. At $275 billion today, Bitcoin's share of the hard money market is therefore less than 3%. But Bitcoin's total potential includes the overall market for money and safe value storage. This overall market is multiples larger than the market for gold. This suggests that Bitcoin has captured less than 1% of its total addressable market.  Skeptics retort that Bitcoin will never be able to innovate or launch new products as effectively as Bezos & Co. Really, the opposite is true. Instead of a CEO-driven management team with a limited number of employees, Bitcoin is an open platform with thousands of brilliant, diligent software developers and entrepreneurs building on-ramps, applications, and additional useful products on top of Bitcoin. Like the third-party merchants who provide the additional inventory that made Amazon the automatic destination to buy stuff on the internet, these thousands of talented people are turning Bitcoin into the automatic place to put your internet-based wealth.  So as an investment, Bitcoin today is roughly where Amazon was 15 years ago. And Bitcoin's value is likely to grow as dramatically in the next 15 years as Amazon's did in the previous 15. As a result, there will be two kinds of investment portfolios: those of people who were wise enough to own some bitcoin and those who weren't. But there will only be one kind of wealth manager. Wealth managers who didn't buy bitcoin for their clients will be like those wealth managers who never bought Amazon: out of business.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Andy Edstrom,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/06/financial-advisors-bitcoin-is-the-next-amazon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fbb3048e3eecc59471fefb62680bd301584da45-1420x946.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385058,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAmxj9,1604655886,South Korean Crypto Firms Must Disclose Users' Identities Under Planned Law Change,"South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) is seeking legal amendments that would make it mandatory for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) within the country to report the names of their customers.      According to a press release from the financial watchdog on Wednesday, a proposed update to the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information is aimed to help guard against money laundering.      The act defines VASPs as ""business entities that engage in the purchase and sale of virtual assets, exchanges between virtual assets,"" as well as custodians, digital wallet service providers and brokerages.      The changes will mean that VASPs are required to use real-name accounts in their financial transactions with customers.      Additional measures require VASPs to open real-name accounts with financial institutions, keep customers’ deposits separate from their own and obtain a data security certification from the Korea Information Security Agency.      VASPs must have no record of fines or other penalties within the previous five years and must ""manage"" customers’ transaction records. An assessment of money-laundering risks associated with VASPs by financial institutions will also be required.      Virtual assets like cryptocurrencies aren't the only assets being targeted: Digital tokens that can't be exchanged for fiat currencies, as well as e-money, electronically registered stocks, electric notes, commodities and more, will also be in the regulator's sights.      However, prepaid cards, mobile gift cards and electronic bonds are to be excluded from the scope of virtual assets.      Per a September recommendation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental money-laundering watchdog, over 200 member regulators should profile cryptocurrency users to better identify criminal activity. It also set regulatory standards last summer, including the ""travel rule,"" stipulating that VASPs must pass on transaction information to other entities above a set value threshold.      See also: Is the Travel Rule Good or Bad for Crypto? Both      The FSC's proposal is designed to impose AML requirements on VASPs in accordance with the FATF's recommendations and are not intended to adopt virtual assets into financial regulatory regimes, the watchdog said.
