42378311,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fo0Z,1441317017,Hollywood Agency Shopping Rights to Mt Gox Movie,"The story of the rise and fall of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox and its CEO Mark Karpeles could soon find its way to the silver screen.  The Hollywood Reporter reports that a film version of David Kushner's recent Rolling Stone piece on Mark Karpeles and Mt Gox is being shopped around by Creative Artists Agency, one of Hollywood's biggest talent agencies known for representing a wide array of A-listers.  If optioned, the story would be the second involving bitcoin to enter the Hollywood pipeline, following 2013 news that the saga of online black market Silk Road had been picked up by 20th Century Fox and Chernin Entertainment.  The news that the story is being considered by Hollywood executives raises a key question: who would play Karpeles?  A review of celebrity image comparison tool FacePlusPlus using this photo of Karpeles produced intriguing – if not slightly alarming – results, suggesting that Hollywood A-lister and Scientologist Tom Cruise bears enough of a resemblance to the Mt Gox CEO to play the part.  A representative from the agency wasn't immediately available for comment.

42378322,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7foBt,1441313300,Connecticut Non-Profit Uses Blockchain for Government Project,"The Connecticut Technology Council (CTC) has partnered with blockchain startup Tierion for a trial that will find government survey data secured on the bitcoin blockchain.  As part of a drive to glean data from some 200 Connecticut technology companies, the state's Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) is seeking perspective on issues including workforce demand and tax code awareness, among other issues, in a broad survey.  As explained by Tierion CEO Wayne Vaughan, the company's blockchain technology is not essential to the survey process, but rather provides the startup with a chance to expose new entities to the potential benefits of decentralized ledgers for recordkeeping.  Bruce Carlson, president and CEO of the CTC, suggested that his non-profit organization's goal is to encourage local technology development. As such, he saw the opportunity in a partnership with Tierion for his organization to learn about unfamiliar emerging innovations.  Carlson told CoinDesk:  ""We like being on the cutting edge of what's going and we feel like this could be leading to more projects.""  The DECD survey, according to Carlson, is currently being filled out by respondents, with all data expected to be collected by 11th September. He suggested the DECD remains actively interested in the results of the survey, but that the department may not necessarily be aware of any technology providers that facilitate handling of the data.  Vaughan indicated that he had previously worked with the CTC at his former business, web development provider Fuscient, until he wound down activities at the firm in 2014.  Challenging Factom  Vaughan suggested his interest in bitcoin and the blockchain began in 2013, when he decided to build his first bitcoin miner and began trading the digital currency.  ""I got involved in trading because I felt the tech was really important. I jumped in,"" he continued, claiming that he even coined the term ""Willy"" for the bot network that was revealed to have been run by Mt Gox in the run-up to its 2014 collapse.  Eventually, this interest turned to business pursuits, with Vaughan joining decentralized recordkeeping protocol provider Factom to help with its business development. Ultimately, he said he left the project over issues with its business model, including the project's choice of a public token sale as a vehicle for fundraising.  ""The core utility of Factom, you just don't need Factom,"" Vaughan said. ""They could do a crowdsale, but it wasn't necessary for what they needed to accomplish. So in late 2014, I said, we're going to take this engine for collecting data and we're going to start anew.""  The decision led Vaughan to create Tierion, which recently published a white paper on its open-source technology, Chainpoint, in July. The paper was written by Vaughan, Tierion lead developer Jason Bukowski and Storj founder Sean Wilkinson.  Tierion is expected to launch beyond an initial group of beta users later in September.  Open technology  Vaughan believes Tierion has so far received positive feedback on its technology, citing tweets or remarks from bitcoin core developers Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd.  Described as a protocol for recording data on the blockchain, Chainpoint secures records every 10 minutes by taking a hash of each record and building a merkle tree, the root of which is placed in a transaction on the bitcoin blockchain.  ""We use the information of each path to build a blockchain receipt and that contains all the information that you need to verify that that piece of data,"" Vaughan explained.  The company contends that by taking this approach to securing records on the blockchain, it can record ""tens of millions"" of records on the ledger at a cost of 3 cents every 10 minutes.  The blockchain will only store records of the data not records directly, a function Vaughan said would be completed using Microsoft's enterprise cloud computing platform Azure.  Still, he emphasized that the intent is for the protocol to become more broadly useful other firms seeking to offer similar services.  ""We want this to become a standard for anyone who is going to be creating a record of data. Anyone who is doing that with an application, we think that Chainpoint can be adapted for a wide variety of applications,"" he said.  SaaS model  As for its business model, Vaughan indicated that Tierion will position itself as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) firm for anyone that wants to collect data and secure records against the bitcoin blockchain.  Among its early prospective customers, Vaughan said, is a private equity fund that is seeking to organize its compliance data and a tax filing software firm that could blockchain records as a way to verify its communications with the IRS.  As for a marketing strategy, Vaughan said that Tierion is seeking to partner with firms that rely on strong recordkeeping but that may not be familiar with blockchain technology and its potential benefits.  ""There are lots of companies that make legal claims, accounting software, those companies are not clamoring to integrate the blockchain,"" Vaughan said. ""We're hoping the ability to create data without needing to rely on a third party will be of interest of them and they'll start to use our API and bake it into their software.""  Vaughan indicated that Tierion took particular emphasis with its user interface, suggesting that if users can ""make a contact form on a website"" they will be able to use its software.  Tierion is currently bootstrapped with a team of two employees.

42378319,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fo9N,1441309270,UBS Sheds New Light on Blockchain Experimentation,"Researchers at a UK innovation lab operated by Swiss banking giant UBS are developing a blockchain implementation for settling transactions.  As reported by Financial News, the lab, opened earlier this year, is currently at work on a cryptocurrency that would be ""linked to real-world currencies and connected to central bank accounts"". The project is being undertaken in collaboration with blockchain startup Clearmatics.  UBS is reportedly also working with BNY Mellon on other blockchain-related initiatives. BNY Mellon disclosed earlier this year that it had been developing an internal rewards system using an in-house cryptocurrency.  UBS innovation lab chief Alex Batlin told CoinDesk last month that the lab is currently involved in a variety of blockchain-related projects, noting at the time:  ""We conduct experiments, which are different to proof-of-concepts, as we don't have a concept yet. We’re just saying, here's a hypothesis, let's figure out could it work at all.""  The bank's interest in the technology dates back to last year, when in an extensive report on bitcoin, UBS suggested that blockchain applications"" could reduce systemic costs, and provide faster, [more] secure, transfers – particularly in the international arena"".  The report further revealed UBS has an interest in blockchains that extends beyond bitcoin, as it is experimenting with smart bond applications using a private fork of Ethereum.

42398633,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAoF,1441305316,Bitcoin Network Stress Test Could Occur Next Week,"The controversial group behind several bitcoin 'stress tests' has confirmed it will push ahead with its biggest experiment to date.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CoinWallet COO James Wilson said the test – which could reportedly cause a 30-day backlog of transactions – would be executed at 10am Thursday (GMT) next week.  The mysterious group, which sees its work as a drastic but necessary demonstration of Bitcoin XT's need, has been criticised by some users for ""bullying"" a live network worth several billion dollars.  Its first test in June, which aimed to fill blocks with 105 BTC broken into thousands of small transactions, reached just 15% of its 200MB goal before its servers crashed.  Left waiting  Although Wilson did not provide any specifics on next week's test, he did take credit for yesterday's network disruption – an apparent trial run which saw unconfirmed transactions on the network pile up to 50MB.  He said the group paid five times the standard fee – 0.0005 BTC per KB – to give its transactions priority on the network and ""leave others waiting"". Not all miners took the bait however, with some disregarding CoinWallet's transactions despite their higher fees. Wilson, who framed these actions as a form of censorship, said:  ""Today miners may avoid high paying 'spam' transactions (although such a classification is ridiculous, a transaction is a transaction) but tomorrow they may start throttling gambling transactions or use similar filtering to attack competitors.""  The tests come at a highly-charged time in bitcoin's development. Following the release of Bitcoin XT, the currency's major developers and contributors have been unable to reach a consensus on how bitcoin should be scaled – and what it should sacrifice in the process – as it approaches its so-called 'capacity cliff'.  While Jeff Garzik's BIP 100 proposal has seen increased support from bitcoin's biggest miners, wallets and other consumer services are still behind BIP 101, which grants miners less decision-making power. A workshop on the issue is scheduled in Montreal next week, two days after CoinWallet's test.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/03/bitcoin-network-stress-test-could-occur-next-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ece3787971aa6b344b30e3074b8ceabba4dcae9-2560x1382.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398640,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAw7,1441279990,Election Hopeful Wants Canada to Recognise Bitcoin as Currency,"A parliamentary hopeful running in Canada's upcoming federal election says he wants to give bitcoin an equal footing with the dollar.  Alex Millar, a former maths teacher and software engineer, claims to be an independent candidate running for Vancouver East. In a post on Straight.com yesterday, the bitcoin enthusiast said he decided to run to highlight an issue the major parties were ignoring: money creation.  ""Canadians enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of religion, I’m running for for parliament because I believe we need freedom of money,"" he said.  The candidate, who does not currently appear in the official election almanachttp://www.electionalmanac.com/ea/canada-ridings-candidates-british-columbia/, thinks digital currency could be a viable alternative to Canada's current monetary system, which he claimed was ""eroding equality"" in its opacity.  The election – which covers Canada's 338 electoral districts – will take place on 19th October. Vancouver East, where Millar is running, has been a New Democratic stronghold since 1997.

42398637,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAtA,1441274526,Timeline: An Overview of Bitcoin in India,"CoinDesk recently reported that the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) governor and two of its deputy governors had discussed bitcoin during a banking conference held in August.  During his speech, the RBI's deputy governor Shri R Gandhi addressed cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding, saying both had disruptive potential, but needed to be controlled in order to avoid undesirable consequences.  As much as they were notable, Gandhi's comments were also relatively inconclusive and added to the ongoing uncertainty about bitcoin regulation in the country.  This, however, was not the first time the Indian government or RBI representatives have spoken out about bitcoin.
