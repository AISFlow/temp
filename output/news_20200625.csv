42432144,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAR7h,1593119437,Sovrin Foundation Sheds All Paid Staff in Tale of a Token Issuance Gone Wrong,"The COVID-19 crisis may have been the last straw for a non-profit digital identity organization, breaking its efforts to raise funds to pay staff and carry out a regulated token issuance.      The Sovrin Foundation, a U.S.-based umbrella organization that oversees the development of blockchain-based digital identity standards (also known as self-sovereign identity or SSI), laid off nine full-time and six part-time employees in March, officially becoming a volunteer-run operation.      “Sovrin’s transition from a permanently staffed organization to a volunteer-led one is now complete,” Paul Knowles, Sovrin’s external press representative, said in a statement emailed to CoinDesk. “We are pleased to state that the Sovrin MainNet remained stable throughout the process with new stewards and clients continuing to come on board. The internal structure of the Foundation has gone through a revamp and is now more dynamic than ever before.”      Read more: Why Project Indy is Using Hybrid DLT to Rethink Digital Identity      Nathan George, the firm’s former chief technology officer, said the Sovrin community – which is closely linked to SSI tech provider Evernym – reacted quickly and volunteers stepped up, calling the downsizing a “success story” of sorts. The Sovrin Foundation works with the likes of IBM, Cisco, T-Mobile and many other companies.      “Everybody went through kind of crazy mode with COVID. We were in the middle of fundraising which was going to keep us going through 2020. That fell apart faster than you could blink,” said George, who now works with Kiva, the microfinance and digital identity partner of the Libra Association.      “So we went from being super excited, everything was going great, to having a meeting where the CEO said she was resigning and we were all let go the next day. It was a chaotic couple of weeks,” George said.    Sovrin debt    There appears to be some difference of opinion about Sovrin’s fundraising process, which pre-dates the COVID-19 financial meltdown, particularly around procuring the funds needed to conduct a regulated token sale, known in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) parlance as a Regulation A+ (Reg A+), an amendment to the JOBS Act which came into effect in 2015.      This became a bone of contention between the Sovrin Foundation’s trustees and board, and its CEO and executive director, Heather Dahl, who resigned on March 15.      CoinDesk obtained a copy of Dahl’s resignation letter, which states: “I have made the choice to resign based on a philosophical division between myself, the Board and its business partners.”      The letter goes on to say:    “When we cater to the needs of the few, we do not serve the many. While there are many paths to a destination ... it is with great disappointment that the ones that I have chosen and brought to the Foundation no longer align with those chosen by the Board of Directors and other interested parties.”    The Sovrin Foundation mentioned the state of the funding for the proposed token issuance back in March. Launching a token under Reg A+ would require $1 million to $2 million in additional funding in order to file with the SEC, and a further $1 million to $2 million to complete the registration, according to the Sovrin Foundation update.      “Given the current market conditions, we do not anticipate a Reg A+ filing for the Sovrin token in 2020,” said the statement.      But a source at the Sovrin Foundation, who wished to remain anonymous, said that when this decision was taken, COVID-19 was a minor and limited factor. The problem stretches back over two years, said the source, when Evernym sold pre-functioning Sovrin tokens to investors.    Funding shortfall    Despite the Sovrin Foundation forming a number of alliances to facilitate additional revenue, there remained a shortfall in the funds needed for issuing a regulated token. But in October 2019, an investor with $5 million was brought to the table, according to the person speaking on the condition of anonymity.      “The Sovrin Board and Evernym then negotiated back and forth on this investment for four months while the Foundation’s finances were running out,” said the source. “The Foundation opened a Sovrin Series A raise mid-February which was already too late.”      Read more: Bank-Backed Hyperledger Is Slowly Opening to ICOs      As the financial situation became more abject, the multi-million dollar investor changed their initial terms to further dilute Evernym investors, the source said, adding that these terms were deemed unacceptable by Sovrin’s board of trustees.      “Given the climate for non-profit donations was turning grim, and the investor terms were not as good as what was offered in October, the decision was made to release the staff and move to volunteer mode,” said the source.      “If the Foundation had not focused on protecting Evernym investors from dilution they could be in a very different financial position today,” the source added.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/25/sovrin-foundation-sheds-all-paid-staff-in-tale-of-a-token-issuance-gone-wrong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79a1b428607f003a8f806c04696a3ffa970ab81a-1500x817.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432164,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNARhh,1593117522,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Tests $9K as Market Struggles With Uncertainty,"Higher-than-normal selling volume pushed bitcoin down in early trading Thursday before managing to recover.      Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,297 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping just 0.18% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Thursday (8:00 p.m. Wednesday ET), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,270 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. Three hours later, heavy selling volume sent bitcoin down 3% to as low as $8,980. Bitcoin’s price is below its 50-day moving average, but above the 10-day. Such a combination is a sideways bearish signal for market technicians.      Read More: Bitcoin Still on Track for Quarterly Gains After Drop Toward $9K      “We're still in a tight trading range; $9,000 is the key to hold,” said Rupert Douglas, heading of institutional sales for crypto asset brokerage Koine. Bitcoin’s dip to below $9,000 is the first time that threshold was crossed since June 15. When it happened 10 days ago, just as on Thursday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was able to bounce right back.      “The market seems to be taking a bit of a breather after testing $9,000 last night and bouncing pretty nicely,” said Dave Vizsolyi, head trader at Chicago-based crypto firm DV Chain. A massive amount of bitcoin options, to the tune of $1 billion, has traders thinking more volatility might be ahead. “I think the options and futures expiry tomorrow will continue to drive flows,” Vizsolyi added.      Read More: Bitcoin Options Market Faces Record $1 Billion Expiry on Friday      George Clayton, managing partner of New York-based Cryptanalysis Capital, says he is concerned with economic data for the balance of 2020. Cryptocurrencies are not immune to traditional market gyrations.      “Crypto is currently acting like a risk-on asset and the technicals look sketchy,” Clayton said. “I see both of these elements as short-term bearish.” He pointed to the Atlanta Federal Reserve GDPNow forecasting a second-quarter U.S. economic contraction of an astounding 46.6% compared to the previous year. GDPNow's estimate of GDP performance is based on its available data. It’s a significantly more bearish outlook than what most analysts are expecting.      “I'm quite bullish on bitcoin by this time next year,” said Neil Van Huis, of crypto liquidity provider Blockfills. “However, there could be a lot of whiplash in between. I guess that is the beauty of the markets.”      Although bitcoin is up over 28% this year, it hasn’t exactly been a smooth ride in 2020.      Despite being down as much as 32% on spot exchanges in March during the coronavirus-induced crash, June has had steadier bitcoin price movement. “I think there really is no real directionality in bitcoin at the moment,” said options trader Vishal Shah. “It seems $9,250-$9,300 has been a broader level of support, while $10,000 has been the top, with a few scattered breaches.” Most of crypto is ""actually more fascinated with DeFi at the moment,” added Shah.    Other markets    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was flat Thursday, trading around $233 and slipping 0.11% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The total value locked in decentralized finance, or DeFi, surpassed $1.5 billion on June 21. The total amount of crypto assets in dollar value is now at $1.6 billion, fueled by the speculative interest in lender Compound, which now dominates the DeFi world with a 37% market share, according to data aggregation site DeFi Pulse.

Europe’s FTSE 100 index was in the green, climbing 0.63%. Fears of a coronavirus resurgence sent stocks there lower in early trading, but late gains pushed the index higher.      The U.S. S&P 500 index gained 1%. A slight rally in late-day trading occurred due to optimism on the U.S. Federal Reserve releasing positive banking stress test results.

42432146,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAR9h,1593113953,Consumer Watchdog Moves to Block Canadian Bitcoin Miner From US Power Grid,"Consumer advocacy group Public Citizen is trying to stop Canadian firm DMG Blockchain from plugging its bitcoin mining rigs into the American power grid.      In a letter published Thursday, the nonprofit implored the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to scrutinize, if not outright reject, DMG Blockchain’s bid to export U.S. electricity to Canada and moved to intervene. The group’s Energy Program Director Tyson Slocum and Climate Program Director David Arkush co-wrote the letter.      DMG Blockchain has been aggressively expanding its cryptocurrency mining capacity in recent months. On May 27, the data center operator tripled its fleet of ASIC miners by adding 1,000 M30s. Two days later, it applied for permission to export U.S. electricity, writing that its 15 megawatt mining operation will grow to 60 megawatts in the next year.      “The DMG application is unique in that it represents a maiden effort by an energy-hungry cryptocurrency-mining industry to import electricity from the United States to Canada to meet its significant power demands,” Slocum and Arkush said.      Read more: US Watchdog Groups Call for Congress to Put a Freeze on Facebook’s Libra      Slocum and Arkush said power utilities in Washington state have banned crypto miners for putting too much load on the grid. Washington butts up against DMG’s home territory of British Columbia, and both locations are attractive to crypto miners because of ample hydropower.      They also suggested DMG’s application may skirt federal laws prohibiting electricity exports that undermine or impair the U.S. power supply. For this, they cited crypto mining’s “staggering” energy waste, its upward impact on energy prices, the possibility that it could interfere with local attempts to introduce renewable power sources and climate change.      “U.S. cryptocurrency miners are struggling to meet their own power demands,” they said.      They warned DOE an approval could trigger a “rush” in foreign cryptocurrency miners looking to export U.S. electricity.      But Canadian crypto miners are already buying U.S. electricity though third-party power brokers, according to DMG Blockchain COO Sheldon Bennett. He said his 33-acre blended data center – it runs bitcoin rigs alongside traditional servers – will do the same if DMG's export application is not ultimately approved.      Bennett said Public Citizen's letter demonizes cryptocurrency mining without paying much attention to the far-heavier electrical load of other transaction-focused firms, like PayPal.      Additionally, he argued that the watchdog was ignoring the fact that the Pacific Northwest's dams produce more electricity than locals can conceivably use. That glut's only grown larger during COVID-19.      “We are like little droplets in the ocean compared to the amount of electricity that's out there,” he said.

42432154,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNARNh,1593109657,Kadena Launches Blockchain App to Verify COVID-19 Tests,"Kadena said Thursday its new app can verify COVID-19 tests are the real deal by letting users track test kits.      The Brooklyn, N.Y., blockchain company said the open-source application would be available to use on its testnet immediately, and would provide a secure way for medical professionals and patients to communicate and store test results.      Helmed by former JPMorgan blockchain leads, Kadena markets itself as a high-throughput alternative to the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Its plan to ensure the authenticity of coronavirus tests is to use QR codes to track the kits from the manufacturer to the healthcare provider, making it harder to swap out the real tests for fake ones, said Kadena founder and CEO Will Martino.      “The provider then goes and registers those keys so that no one can just submit a random one,” Martino said.      He added that by keeping a picture of the test’s QR code with them, anyone who gets a test could also check the results by logging onto the app.      In a press release the company said that with added privacy protections the data gathered on its app could also help academics and government officials better understand the spread of the coronavirus.      Because it would handle protected medical information, Kadena’s platform needs to be compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the firm’s statement said its app was currently “aiming for the standards of HIPAA-compliance.”      Explaining the compliance status, Martino said the firm was following a legal process to ensure compliance, but “we're at 99.5% sure that it is” compliant.      Token trading      Kadena also announced Thursday the Bittrex Global Exchange would be the first to list its token, KDA. The tokens can be used to create and execute contracts on its blockchain.      The firm said trading for its token would begin Friday morning and the initial trading pairs for KDA tokens would be bitcoin (BTC) and tether (USDT). While the listing is only for non-U.S. traders right now, Martino said the firm has plans to make the tokens available in the U.S. with listings in the future.      “We'll have other listings this year, but they're the first,” he said.      Earlier in May, the hybrid blockchain maker said it would integrate with data provider Chainlink to help price Kadena-based assets, beginning with KDA.      According to its statement, Kadena is also moving forward with plans to upgrade its blockchain next month. The statement claimed scaling the firm’s sharded blockchain from 10 to 20 chains not only doubles the throughput, but it also proves the feasibility of Kadena’s blockchain to scale further.      “It actually gets more efficient as you make it bigger. Because you take the difficulty per block when you go from 10 to 20, and you chop the difficulty in half. It is the network difficulty that gives us security,” Martino said.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SPONSORED | TRADING | USDT,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/25/kadena-launches-blockchain-app-to-verify-covid-19-tests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1db9c161db0697327a69582ad4f296dacf97310-1024x691.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC and DOJ also charged longtime DC lobbyist Jack Abramoff on conspiracy, lobbying disclosure and deceptive practices counts, alleging he helped mislead investors in the project.      Andrade told CoinDesk late on Thursday he was not guilty of the charges, claiming the allegations were ""retaliation"" for his opposition to a previous case.      According to Bloomberg, Abramoff will plead guilty and pay more than $50,000 in disgorgement and interest.      ""In [its] White Paper, the NAC Foundation claimed AML Bitcoin cryptocurrency would include features that would allow the cryptocurrency to comply with anti-money laundering (also referred to as 'AML') and know-your-customer ('KYC') regulations and laws by using 'biometric technologies' among other methods to confirming the identities of participants in transactions using AML Bitcoin,"" the DOJ filing said.      According to a 2018 press release, NAC Foundation claimed AML Bitcoin was ""the world's only patent-pending digital currency with anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, anti-terrorism and theft-resistant properties.""      The DOJ filing was first shared by Seamus Hughes, George Washington University deputy director, Program on Extremism.      Andrade tried to raise up to $100 million during the ICO, which occurred in late 2017 and early 2018, the filing claimed. According to the SEC complaint, Andrade raised about $5.6 million from 2,400 investors.      According to the DOJ filing, Andrade and unnamed colleagues ""made public statements and statements to potential purchasers"" that ""misrepresented the state of the development"" of the project., created a fake ""rejection campaign,"" made statements indicating the NAC Foundation was close to working with government agencies and ""misappropriated money obtained through the sale of AML Bitcoin.""      The fake rejection campaign centered around the National Football League, the DOJ filing said.      ""Andrade, NAC Foundation and his associates claimed that the advertisement would have aired during the Super Bowl if the television network airing the Super Bowl and the National Football League had not rejected the advertisement as being too controversial,"" the filing alleged. ""In fact, the NAC Foundation did not have the funds to purchase the advertising time, and the advertisement was never reviewed or rejected by the network or the NFL.""      According to the DOJ, Andrade also claimed to have substantive meetings with the government of Panama and an elected official in California. The filing alleged the Panama claims were ""overstated,"" and while ""Andrade was present at a roundtable discussion and had his photograph taken with the [California] official,"" AML Bitcoin ""was not discussed.""      Close to $1 million was spent on a new home and real estate, the DOJ filing alleged.      According to a March filing, U.S. officials have also filed to seize ""one parcel of real property"" owned at least in part by Andrade and his wife.      This filing details how an individual, dubbed ""VICTIM ONE,"" invested $1 million in the AML Bitcoin project, but transferred the funds into a JPMorgan Chase account held by ""J.D.,"" an associate of Andrade. The funds were then allegedly transferred to a third party ""who acted at the direction of Andrade"" at JPMorgan; then to an account belonging to ""NAC Payroll Services Inc.""; then to an account at Wells Fargo owned by Andrade; then to a personal account at Woodforest National Bank. Andrade claims he did not personally convince the victim to invest in the project.      The March filing alleges that these funds wre then used to purchase a residence from a Texas homebuilding firm.      ""To date, Andrade and the NAC have not made any meaningful progress towards developing AtenCoin, AML Bitcoin, or ABTC,"" the filing said, referring to two other names affiliated with AML Bitcoin.      This case is ongoing, according to court records.

42432158,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNARRh,1593105759,Jack Dorsey Has Floated Decentralized Fact-Checking at Twitter. Here's What That Could Look Like,"Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, recently re-tweeted a call for fact-checking through open-source tech rather than new intermediaries like Twitter.      Dorsey’s message came at the end of May, after Twitter fact-checked tweets by President Donald Trump about mail-in voting, leading Trump to sign an executive order attacking Section 230 protections. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects platforms from civil liability for the content on them and has enabled companies such as Facebook and Twitter to thrive.      A decentralized approach to fact-checking is likely to be popular in the blockchain community, which has long championed ideas like the “verified web.”      “It shouldn’t be tech companies per se getting into fact checking,” Balaji Srinivasan, an angel investor, entrepreneur and former CTO of Coinbase, tweeted. “It should be open source technology. Free, universally available code and data for epistemology. Take a piece of text, parse it, extract assertions, compare to explicitly specified knowledge graphs and oracles.”      “Agree this should be open source and thus verifiable by everyone,” Dorsey replied.      Facts are a flashpoint on the political stage right now, and given Dorsey’s quasi-endorsement of a tech ""solutionism"" approach to fact-checking, it raises the question: What would such a system look like?      Thousands of people commented on Srinivasan's and Dorsey’s tweets, referring to projects they thought might serve as future models.    Newsblocks    One project is called Newsblocks, based in Glasgow, Scotland, and was conceived as a way to organize data for Newslines, a sister project. Newslines creates interactive news timelines about any topic. Think of it as a kind of ""Wikipedia for news.""      Here is an example for Conor McGregor, which has almost 2,000 events in it.      Mark Devlin is the CEO of Newsblocks and has been in publishing for years. He founded Metropolis, one of Japan’s top English-language magazines and Japan Today, a popular Japanese news site in English. His claim to fame: He was the first person anywhere to place reader comments directly under news stories.      Devlin realized the news he was collecting was actually data. For example, an article about Yoko Ono holding an art exhibition today will likely mention that she was married to John Lennon, who was murdered in 1980. That's three pieces of data that can be extracted from the article and then used in different ways.      See also: New Twitter Investor May Remove Bitcoin Advocate Jack Dorsey as CEO      “Once news is data then the data can be used to make all kinds of new products. You can sort the data to create timelines and newsfeeds,” said Devlin. “You can compare the meta data, like the data's sources and other factors to enable verification and fake news detection, and you can compare data with other data to do automated fact-checking by comparing pieces of data.”      As an open platform everyone can use the same data, companies can create news verification systems, such as credit agencies for news, and could be used by social media companies, like Twitter.      The idea of news-as-data led Devlin to blockchain technology, which can collect, verify, store, price, and distribute such data, in something like a news data marketplace.    Ideamarket    Ideamarket, a Los Angeles-based startup, aims to provide more objective rankings of information or ideas and move beyond traditional gatekeepers like media companies. It launched its prototype in November of 2019, and is built on Ethereum.      “Idea markets use investment to establish credibility for ideas and narratives without trusting a centralized third party,” said founder Mike Elias in a blog post. “Fundamentally, idea markets use price discovery to advance discovery.”      Ideamarket functions somewhat similarly to Reddit, in which people can upvote various media brands, including independent journalists. But instead of having no cost, upvotes cost money and increase in cost as vote count increases, meaning that people have to put their money where their mouth, or itchy retweeting trigger finger, is.    The only people who pay heed are those who are open to questioning what they hear    “It makes credibility expensive, said Elias. “For media corporations it makes it equally expensive for everybody in the same way that bitcoin makes money equally as expensive for central banks as it is for you and me. It creates true competition for credibility and incentivizes the public to do due diligence and seek undervalued ideas.”      In addition to investing in and earning interest on the sources they trust, users could also sell the ones they don’t, and earn money off that as well. Elias likened it to a stock market, but for ideas.      Elias’ plan is to launch a browser extension that would include the ranking of the news source next to articles from it on social media.      So, for example, depending on how the market shakes out, CNN might sit at 10th and Brietbart at 90th. Anyone can see how much trust a publisher has earned. Such a system could rank news sources on a platform like Twitter, without a single company having control over them and having to be the dreaded “arbiter of truth”.      “Rather than say this is true or false, which doesn't really respect the readers free will and ability to make different judgments, we're saying the market has put this at this rank,” said Elias. “And you can interpret a low ranking as fake news or an opportunity, because it's undervalued.”    Any time soon    All of these models are at the early-early stage. Ideamarket is in the middle of raising its first round of angel investment, and Devlin has been unable to find funding for Newsblocks despite seeing significant interest in it, which he finds disheartening.      See also: In Trump Versus Twitter, Decentralized Tech May Win      Another obstacle may also be the frustration of people trying to create platforms for facts in the current political environment. I reached out to Andrew Lippman, associate director of the MIT Media Lab and the senior research scientist on a project called Defacto, for this article. Defacto is a decentralized crowdsourced news verification system.      He said he wished he could help but the dilemma he faces is that Defacto is preaching to the converted. This is not a new problem, said Lippman, but is intensified by the low friction and high speed of current platforms.      “We can develop all the mechanisms in the world to check facts and propagate results, but the only people who pay heed to that are those who are open to questioning what they hear,” said Lippman.      As Jonathan Swift said 300 years ago, ""Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it, so that when men come to be undeceived, it is too late; the jest is over, and the tale hath had its effect.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/25/jack-dorsey-has-floated-decentralized-fact-checking-at-twitter-heres-what-that-could-look-like,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/daab7dc61d0b52fc21c9e1e44ecd3364c14d98c9-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432150,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNARHh,1593104425,Some Numbers That Show Why Yield Farming COMP Is So Seductive,"It's hard to figure out what the new governance token from Compound, COMP, costs.      Not its price, but its cost: How much will a user pay to earn freshly minted COMP? This is made especially complicated because the cost isn't what a user deposits or borrows, it is how much net interest they ultimately pay.      Insanely, right now, it is possible to earn COMP on extremely risky trades for effectively no cost, as we'll show below. This is not a situation that is likely to end well for many.      Compound rewards investors with COMP both for supplying capital and borrowing. To maximize returns, most users do both. They deposit and borrow against that deposit. There are even ways to spin this into loops that eke out even more yield (at higher risks).      Read more: Compound Tops MakerDAO, Now Has the Most Value Staked in DeFi      This is how Compound has suddenly become the world’s top decentralized finance (DeFi) platform in terms of total value locked (TVL), according to DeFi Pulse. With a small supply and lots of pent-up demand, crypto users are rushing in to earn a return – one that is very strong right now, but not much more likely to last than 2017's initial coin offering boom.    Let’s do the numbers    To estimate cost, a website called Predictions Exchange gives a reasonable idea of how much an investor will spend to earn new COMP, and it helps to show why this asset is so attractive at current prices. The Compound team confirmed to CoinDesk the site's estimates are accurate enough to provide useful guidelines, in a market where factors are changing all the time.      COMP currently sits at $222, according to CoinGecko. The last week has seen wild swings for the new governance token, rising to $338 on June 23 and briefly dipping below $200 on Wednesday. Total value locked (TVL) has been falling in a staggered fashion since June 21, down to about $570 million as of this writing, from a high this weekend of over $600 million.      Read more: A Coinbase Pro Listing and Other Eye-Opening Data Points on Compound’s Surge in Demand      Below, we game out three scenarios – from conservative to very risky – using Predictions Exchange, assuming everything stays the same for a year (which is a very bad assumption). All these scenarios will make the assumption of a modest investment of $10,000 in capital, with a COMP price of $200.      The point of this exercise is to give some sense of what investors will pay for each newly minted COMP under different scenarios. It's important to note these numbers change very fast and this post is only meant to explain the current frenzy.    The safe-by-crypto-standards way    The lowest-yield stablecoin that can be supplied as collateral on Compound is USDC. It earns an APY of only 0.12% as of this writing.      The safe move here is to borrow another stablecoin, so let's go with DAI. At a collateralization rate of 75% on Compound, this means the user could borrow 7,500 DAI. Then, there's nothing stopping the user from turning around and depositing that DAI again, increasing their COMP earnings on the supply side.      This earns 2.29 COMP at the end of the year, or $458 at the assumed token price of $200.      Over that time, the user would pay $107.25 in interest and earn $76.50 on the two deposits, a net loss on the deposits of $30.75. So, the cost per COMP over that time would be $13.43.      If the investor sold the COMP right away, it would net $427.25.      In fact, if an investor only put the 10,000 USDC in and did nothing else, they would earn 1.06 COMP and $12 in interest, for a net of $224.      By taking on just ever so slightly more risk, the far better move for the conservative investor is to do it with USDT. That would earn 3.21 COMP and $450 in yield on the deposit, for a net of $1,092.    The moderately risky way    This is crypto so the low-risk, low-return move above was never the one driving the action.      Just after COMP began dispensing on June 15, the optimal trade was actually on stablecoins, which meant buyers were fairly protected from swings in the underlying assets.      Users were playing with USDC and tether (USDT), two stablecoins. If someone did basically the same trade now (that is, deposit USDC, max out their borrow for USDT and then deposit it again), they’d get more COMP but it also costs more.      The trade earns 8.0 COMP in a year. The deposits earn $349.50. The loan costs $866.25, though, for a loss of $516.75.      So COMP costs $64.60 in this scenario, and if it were all sold at the end of the year for $1,600, the user would net $1,083.25.      However, yield farmers have now shifted away from trading stablecoins. We saw an unprecedented uptick on the stablecoin DEX Curve last week but there was a giant falloff in volume there Monday, dropping from $110 million on Sunday to around $30 million.    The very risky way    Since last week, Brave’s basic attention token (BAT) and 0x’s ZRX have spiked in yields on Compound, so they earn much more COMP.      Unlike playing with stablecoins, this exposes investors to enormous underlying volatility, and the free money is much too good to last.      The supply of BAT on Compound has skyrocketed. One week ago, it was $1.89 million. It has risen to $237.71 million on Thursday (dipping a little since Wednesday). That means 63.5% of BAT’s total market cap is locked into Compound as we speak, according to CoinMarketCap.      Brave, as the creator of BAT and a major holder, has confirmed to CoinDesk it did not move its reserves into Compound in order to earn a return, as some on Crypto Twitter and elsewhere have speculated.      Meanwhile, ZRX is the next most expensive token to borrow. Its supply has also spiked on the application, going from $5.63 million a week ago to $41.38 million on Thursday (again with a dip since Wednesday). That means 17.5% of the ZRX market cap is on Compound.      So, if an investor ran the same trade (deposit BAT, borrow ZRX at its 60% collateralization rate and then deposit what's borrowed), the deal looks too good to be true.      First, they would earn 33.6 COMP. Note that this is the fastest strategy listed and it's still only 0.65 COMP each week.      Then they would also earn $2,538 on the BAT deposit plus $367.20 on their ZRX deposit. Total earnings of $2,905.20, against a borrowing cost of only $978.60. Amazing! That's a profit just on the deposits of $1,926.60.      If they sold the COMP earned, that would be $6,720. Total profit: $8,646.60.      Cost of COMP? Risk. A lot.      ZRX has been as low as $0.13 this year and as high as $0.43. BAT has had similar swings, as low as $0.11 and as high as $0.31. All it takes for these coins is to move against each other for a user's collateral to get slashed by liquidators and make the price of running this trade very uncomfortable.      Robert Leshner, Compound founder, offered a note of caution on Twitter, writing:      There's already one proposal to further lower the amount of augur (REP), BAT and ZRX that can be borrowed per dollar of assets, and the stakeholders in the community have entered into a broader discussion about adding more ways to tame this boom.    COMPlexity    It's important to note all the estimates above are just that – estimates – and probably not very reliable. This is a brand-new market evolving at the speed of crypto. If nothing else, COMP returns depend heavily on participation levels.      In fact, we ran these numbers last night and again this morning, and many of them had already shifted. There's very little doubt that COMP earnings will change a lot over the course of a year.      Compound Labs made a fairly simple formula for distributing COMP tokens, but in a weird way that makes it somewhat complex to estimate what users might expect each day.      Each day, the software distributes 2,880 COMP tokens to borrowers and lenders on the platform. The amount doesn't change, so obviously the more activity there is the less each participant gets (and vice versa).      This is further complicated by the fact that COMP yield accrues the quickest to markets that have the most demand, and this can change on a dime.      As long as there is a large gap between the price of COMP and what it costs to earn it, yield farming will persist, but as there is more liquid COMP, more of it will move onto exchanges. (Coinbase promptly listed COMP last week for its Pro traders; Binance followed suit Thursday.)      As the supply grows people will sell. This is likely to bring the price down into equilibrium with the actual market demand for borrowing crypto for uses besides yield farming.      The question is how many retail investors will get caught up in the frenzy and lose their savings before that happens.",NEUTRAL,BAT | COMP | ZRX,BAT | BUSINESS | COMP | MARKET | ZRX,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/25/some-numbers-that-show-why-yield-farming-comp-is-so-seductive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae4e1bc921d8b04ec9d3830060d12d6ebcc0b976-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432160,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNARdh,1593101100,"Blockchain Bites: Rethinking Libra, Craig Wright and Something Smells Fishy in Blockchain","Top financial authorities are rethinking what a ""basket-backed"" stablecoin means for monetary sovereignty.      The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) issued a new report claiming stablecoin initiatives like Libra haven't driven central banks to explore CBDCs, Craig Wright is heading to trial and BTCPay received its largest donation to date. Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      Rethinking Libra The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) rejected the popular narrative that private-sector stablecoin proposals like Libra have been key in spurring the issuance of CBDCs in a new report. Instead, the BIS said central bankers have come around to CBDCs because the tech presents a convenient vehicle for shaping the future of payments. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve issued a report showing “basket-backed” stablecoins, like Libra, could improve consumer welfare in certain economic scenarios. (The Block)      Getting Fishy? The Norwegian Seafood Association has teamed with IBM and Atea, a technology firm focused on the internet of things (IoT), to create a blockchain-based track-and-trace system for sustainably farmed salmon in Norway. The five associated fisheries see this as a way to ensure the quality of its salmon and the national brand. Meanwhile, Braintrust launched Wednesday with a blockchain-based employment service that will cut out middlemen like ZipRecruiter and Indeed from hiring decisions. It’s a fork of the DeFi protocol Compound, backed by a $6 million seed round featuring True Ventures, Homebrew Ventures, Uprising Ventures and Galaxy Digital, among others.      Legal Review Craig Wright is heading to a jury trial in a case that involves billions of dollars in bitcoin. The move comes after the plaintiffs were denied a motion filed in May attempting to sanction Wright over his alleged misbehavior. While the judge was concerned by Wright’s behavior, she ruled in favor of Wright to dismiss the motion, saying the matter was best left “for a jury to make as fact finder at trial.” Elsewhere, in an early instance of Singapore authorities enforcing its updated digital currency regulations, a 23-year-old woman was charged with breaking the city-state’s ban on unlicensed bitcoin sales on Wednesday. The woman allegedly bought S$3,350 (about $2,400) in bitcoin in late February 2020 using funds the police say came from the proceeds of an online scam.      Cyber Crime? CipherTrace found bitcoin ATMs were frequently used to send funds to “high-risk exchanges” – trading platforms the company considers to be known for facilitating criminal activity and money laundering. “The percentage of funds sent to high-risk exchanges from U.S. BATMs [bitcoin ATMs] has seen exponential growth, doubling every year since 2017,” the report reads. Meanwhile, Australians have lost more than $14 million to crypto investment scams in 2019, according to a report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. (The Block)      Money Matters Avalanche blockchain developer AVA Labs has closed a $12 million private sale of its AVAX token. The funding round was co-led by Galaxy Digital, Bitmain, Initialized Capital, NGC Ventures and Dragonfly Capital. The sale precedes a planned public offering of the Avalanche token to U.S. accredited investors and non-U.S. citizens. Separately, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has donated $150,000 in bitcoin to BTCPay Foundation, the entity managing BTCPay, a popular open-source tool for merchants accepting bitcoin payments. This is the largest donation in BTCPay’s history, which, as a free service, relies on donations to run and to fund developers making improvements to the app. Finally, cryptocurrency exchange FTX has launched eight unique index futures and volatility markets in less than 12 months. Popular with professional algorithmic and quantitative traders, these novel indexes suffer from a lack of liquidity.    Quick bites  Bitcoin is seeing little more merchant usage than five years ago, despite the COVID bump  USDC will launch on Algorand  The Principality of Monaco will use security tokens for ""ESG"" projects  ConsenSys and AMD have pumped $20 million to triple its GPU capacity, and no one knows why  Senate Republicans entered a bill that could destroy encryption for WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram (Decrypt)  Market intel    Derivatives, Wrinkles Bitcoin’s derivatives continue to grow despite light spot trading over the past two months. The cryptocurrency’s options market is on its way to a record $1 billion monthly expiry this Friday. But there's added complexity: volumes have dropped precipitously, just as open interest has boomed. What’s going on? Options activity may have hit a high at $226 million on June 2, but activity has still gone south. Volumes came in at around $80 million June 23, down nearly 62% from its peak. Derivative trading volumes usually increase during periods of pronounced volatility, like March 12, when the bitcoin price fell by nearly 40%, daily volumes clocked a record $45 billion. A recent fall in trading volumes could, therefore, be down to the fact bitcoin has been pretty dull recently.      Nearly Quarterly Gains Bitcoin looks set to end its three-quarter losing run despite having dropped to $9,000 earlier on Thursday. At 03:35 UTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap printed a low of $9,002, extending Wednesday’s 3.5% decline, a pullback that could be associated with risk aversion in the traditional markets fueled by mounting trade tensions, renewed coronavirus fears and the International Monetary Fund’s decision to downgrade global growth forecasts. Even so, bitcoin is still up 44% from the April 1 opening price of $6,428. A quarterly gain would be confirmed if prices hold above that level through June 30.

Key investors include Polychain Capital and Lemniscap.      Read more: There’s Now a DAO for Deciding Which Blockchains to Stake On      STKR acts as both a governance token and security, with funds garnered from the protocol distributed to token holders.      “We are recognizing the governance token as something that will become profitable for the holders. The decision-making that happens through that governance is designed to drive profits back to those token holders,” StakerDAO CEO and founder Jonas Lamis said.    StakerDAO’s first asset    StakerDAO also launched its first token, Blend (BLND), which can be found on CoinList and will generate revenue for DAO members. An Ethereum ERC-20 token, BLND tracks the performance of a basket of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies. BLND is not available for U.S. investors.      Under the hood, StakerDAO has two pieces: a Cayman Island corporation and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Operating with two faces gives StakerDAO the flexibility to offer a U.S.-compliant security offering while leaning on what many see as a novel form of democratic governance with DAOs.      StakerDAO itself is led by a five-man council including Polychain’s Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase Custody’s Luke Youngblood, Lemniscap’s Shaishav Todi, DTC Capital’s Spencer Noon and StakerDAO’s Lamis.      Read more: Wrapped Bitcoin Aims to Kick-Start DeFi on Tezos Blockchain      From there, StakerDAO works just like its base layer protocol, Tezos. (Lamis was previously the general manager at Tezos Capital, a delegation service for that blockchain.) Any changes to the DAO go through a multi-tiered voting process before being implemented or rejected.      StakerDAO takes into consideration protocol proposals over a monthlong process with final results and implementations overseen by the council and StakerDAO team, Lamis said.      StakerDAO works in a similar space as the Ethereum-centric LAO, a DAO meshed with a legal wrapper. While both lean on DAOs as a governance mechanism for capital allocation, StakerDAO’s audience resides in the “early majority” who are not ready to jump into more technical protocols but would like to hold investments in those projects, Lamis said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | XTZ,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/25/tezos-based-dao-goes-live-with-launch-of-stkr-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6486461d7413b0e950db4b9250a728f72791278-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432145,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNAR5h,1593100583,Telegram Agrees to Pay $18.5M Penalty in SEC Settlement Over Failed TON Offering,"Telegram will pay $18.5 million and notify the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if it plans to issue any sort of digital currency in the next three years in a settlement with the securities regulator, a court filing revealed Thursday.      The settlement, which was reached on June 11 and effectively ends a six-month court fight with the agency, also indicates the messaging platform will be responsible for a $1.22 billion disgorgement that is offset by $1.19 billion paid as ""termination amounts"" in investors' purchase agreements and the amounts that some investors loaned to Telegram earlier this year. Telegram has 30 days to pay the SEC penalty and up to four years to pay back investors under the settlement.      Additionally, Telegram should notify the SEC if the company wants to issue “‘cryptocurrencies,’ ‘digital coins,’ ‘digital tokens,’ or any similar digital asset issued or transferred using distributed ledger technology"" at any point over the next three years. The notification – which is not a request for an approval – should come 45 days prior to the planned issuance, the settlement reads.      The settlement apparently takes into consideration Telegram’s commitment to terminate TON's development and pay back investors.      Previously, Telegram offered its non-U.S. investors an opportunity to loan their money to the company for one year, with a pledge to pay back 110% of the amount invested next April. This was as an alternative to getting back 72% of the investment this May – the amount previously agreed upon by the investors. Not everyone was happy with the deal, with some investors saying they considered suing Telegram.      U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel, who was overseeing the case, approved the settlement on June 26, according to court records and an SEC statement.    $1.7B token offering    The SEC sued Telegram in October 2019 after the company raised $1.7 billion to fund the development of its TON blockchain project. A federal court sided with the SEC when the agency asked to block Telegram from issuing any tokens as it had planned to do earlier this year. While Telegram appealed initially, it later halted this effort.    The company announced it would be ceasing work on TON on May 27, though it published some codehttps://test.ton.org/ for the project.    After adding “some almost-finished components of TON Storage, TON Payments and CPS Fift from testing branches into the main branch,” “the original TON development team is discontinuing its active involvement with the TON project,” the update said.      While Telegram ostensibly no longer plans to update its code for TON, it did write that “some minor bug fixes and Github issue answers may occasionally appear if any of the members of the original team have the spare time and inclination to contribute to the community's efforts.""      Telegram managed to release most of the TON code, including blockchain nodes, a technical paper on TON’s consensus protocol and a native crypto wallet. While Telegram itself claimed it would no longer launch TON, another entity, TON Labs, launched its own version of the network with a group of professional validators.      The SEC declined to comment on the proposed settlement, but said in a letter to the court that the proposed settlement ""is fair and reasonable and in the public interest.""      In a statement shared with CoinDesk and later published to Telegram founder Pavel Durov's Telegram channel, the company said the settlement ""reconfirms our commitment to repay the remaining funds to purchasers.""      ""Since we saw limited value in pursuing the court case further, we welcomed the opportunity to resolve it without admitting or denying our liability,"" the statement said, concluding that he hoped the U.S. becomes friendlier to blockchain in the future.

The funding round was co-led by Galaxy Digital, Bitmain, Initialized Capital, NGC Ventures and Dragonfly Capital, and included other undisclosed individual investors.      The sale precedes a planned public offering of the Avalanche token to U.S. accredited investors and non-U.S. citizens, according to a release from AVA Labs. The public sale will run for two weeks beginning July 8 with even million tokens up for grabs. Another five million will be available based on the round's success during the first week, the firm said.      Founded by Cornell Professor Emin Gun Sirer, AVA Labs completed a $6 million Series A in February 2019 and went public with its protocol based on the Avalanche consensus algorithm in May 2019. The Series A was joined by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Initialized Capital and Polychain Capital, in addition to angel investments from Balaji Srinivasan and Naval Ravikant.      Read more: Ava Labs Exits Stealth, Launches Blockchain Testnet Based on ‘Avalanche’ Protocol      Since then, AVA Labs has focused on its testnet, Denali, which the firm claims to have reached 1,000 full block-producing nodes “actively staking and participating in the consensus protocol.”      Like Ethereum, Avalanche describes itself as a blockchain for decentralized applications, particularly financial ones. The project claims its novel consensus algorithm’s transaction speeds are better suited to those applications than current blockchains.      Even with the funding, Avalanche joins a long list of projects trying to rival the second-largest blockchain by market capitalization. Other smart-contract platforms vying for Ethereum’s crown include the NEAR Protocol and Polkadot – both of which released mainnets in May – and Cardano, which has yet to deploy its Shelley upgrade.

Since BTCPay is free, it relies on donations like Kraken's to run and to fund developers making improvements to the app. BTCPay is a tool for bitcoin bookkeeping tasks that merchants need, such as managing invoices tracking how much bitcoin the merchant is owed for each product sold.      ""This is the largest donation in BTCPay Foundation’s history, speaking to the value and importance that we place on making it easy for people to acquire Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" a spokesperson for San Francisco-based Kraken said. (BTCPay Foundation confirmed that Kraken's donation was indeed its largest.)      BTCPay Foundation is also supported financially by Square Crypto, OKCoin and several other bitcoin companies.

42432163,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNARfh,1593088487,First Mover: What’s Going On With Bitcoin Derivatives?,"There's a strange trend in crypto derivatives right now: volumes have dropped precipitously, just as open interest has boomed. What's going on?      Since the May 11 halving event, trading volume in crypto futures has fallen 76%, from $35 billion to $8.5 billion by June 23, according to research firm Skew.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Futures trading activity hit an all-year low Sunday after slumping to just $5 billion.      Options activity may have hit a high at $226 million on June 2, but activity has still gone south. Volume came in at around $80 million June 23, down nearly 62% from its peak.      Derivative trading volumes usually increase during periods of pronounced volatility. On March 12, when the bitcoin price fell by nearly 40%, daily volumes clocked a record $45 billion.      A fall in trading volumes could, therefore, be down to the fact bitcoin has been pretty dull recently.      Prices have stuck to a narrow $9,000 to $10,000 range since May 11; bitcoin has so far failed to hold its own above the crucial $10,000 threshold.      Bitcoin's volatility hit an eight-month low earlier this week.      But while the number of settled contracts remains at a yearly low, open interest - the number of contracts that have yet to settle - remains high.      Open interest in futures came to $3.8 billion, on June 23, up 50% from $2.5 billion from the start of May. On CME, open interest has risen by a staggering 1,145% since the halving, hitting a record of $436 million on June 23.      In options, total open interest has consistently hit new highs almost every day for the past four weeks. At $1.1 billion on May 23, it hit $1.7 billion on Tuesday.      Investors may be adding bets to position for a big move in either direction, which is often seen following a prolonged consolidation.      In traditional markets, options traders often take “straddles,” a non-directional strategy comprises buying both calls (bullish bets) and puts (bearish bets). That could be the reason for the recent rise in the open interest in options.      While options markets are still new in crypto, it might be that the same thing is happening here. The uptick in open interest indicates that the market is betting on a breakout - whether that's up or down still hasn't been decided yet.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,226 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,421 | 24-Hr Low: $9,002      Trend: Bitcoin defended key support early Thursday, keeping the immediate neutral bias intact.      The biggest cryptocurrency by market value absorbed selling pressure around $9,000 and is now trading largely unchanged on the day near $9,270, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price.      The price bounce has saved the day for the bulls, as acceptance below $9,000 would have meant a downside break of the multi-week long trading range of $9,000 to $10,000. A range breakdown often invites stronger selling pressure, leading to deeper losses. In bitcoin's case, it would have opened the doors for a decline to the 200-day moving average (MA) at $8,300.      While the cryptocurrency has staged an impressive recovery from crucial support, the bias remains neutral, as resistance at $10,000 is intact. The cryptocurrency has failed multiple times over the past five months to establish a strong foothold above that level.      That level, however, could come into play if the global equity markets reverse losses seen on Wednesday. At press time, the futures tied to the S&P 500 are reporting a 0.40% decline.      U.S. stocks collapsed on Wednesday with Dow Jones Industrial Average losing more than 800 points as number of coronavirus cases spiked.

42432155,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNARDh,1593086440,"CBDC Issuance Is 'Not a Reaction' to Libra, Says Central Bank Body","The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the so-called bank for central banks, rejected the popular narrative that private-sector stablecoin proposals (read: Libra) have been key in spurring the issuance of central bank digital currencies (CBDC).      Instead, the BIS, in a new digital payments chapter of its annual economic report published Wednesday, said central bankers have come around to CBDCs because the tech presents a convenient vessel through which they can shape the future of payments.      “CBDC issuance is not so much a reaction to cryptocurrencies and private sector ‘stablecoin’ proposals, but rather a focused technological effort by central banks to pursue several public policy objectives at once,” the BIS said.      The analysis provides an alternative explanation for the sudden acceleration of CBDC pilots, hirings, studies and working groups since the summer of 2019, which journalists, monetary pundits and central bankers themselves widely attributed to the wake-up call of the Libra stablecoin project.      Read more: Central Banks, Stablecoins and the Looming War of Currencies      It also appears to contradict BIS officials’ own thinking about CBDC. In March 2019, three months before Facebook unveiled the Libra cryptocurrency, BIS chief Agustín Carstens said central banks “are not seeing the value” of CBDCs. By July he had changed his tune, saying CBDC issuance might come “sooner than we think.”      The report itself cites “the rise (and fall) of Bitcoin and its cryptocurrency cousins” and the Facebook-linked Libra as two factors that “propelled payment issues to the top of the policy agenda.”      But the BIS now appears to view the buzz around CBDC issuance as a product of the tech’s promise for monetary policymaking and control. By the BIS’ count, CBDC can assist in: financial inclusion, securing digital payments, increasing payment efficiency and encouraging innovation in the space.      Regardless of the origins of the ongoing CBDC craze, the BIS made clear in its Wednesday report that digital currencies are likely transformative, bringing efficiencies to the wholesale currency space and even more “far-reaching” implications to retail payments.      “CBDCs have the potential to be the next step in the evolution of money,” BIS said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/25/cbdc-issuance-is-not-a-reaction-to-libra-says-central-bank-body,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0395beb9a74e199c9a9861e6524efd7be919c4a-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432162,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNARbh,1593085713,Bitcoin Still on Track for Quarterly Gains After Drop Toward $9K,"Bitcoin looks set to end its three-quarter losing run despite having dropped to $9,000 earlier on Thursday.      At 03:35 UTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap printed a low of $9,002, extending Wednesday’s 3.5% decline, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      The pullback from Monday’s high of $9,800 to $9,000 could be associated with risk aversion in the traditional markets fueled by mounting trade tensions, renewed coronavirus fears and the International Monetary Fund’s decision to downgrade global growth forecasts.      Bitcoin has recovered a little to $9,250 at press time and is down 5% from Monday’s high.      Even so, bitcoin is still up 44% from the April 1 opening price of $6,428. A quarterly gain would be confirmed if prices hold above that level through June 30.      The cryptocurrency is on track to report its first quarterly rise since the April-June period of 2019. Back then, prices rallied by 163% to reach a high of $13,800, which remains unchallenged to date.      While bitcoin can be volatile – often adding or losing more than $1,000 in a matter of a few minutes – analysts do not see prices falling all the way back to $6,428 in the short term.      “We believe bitcoin will continue to trade sideways, albeit at a wider range with pulses of volatility scraping along time to time until it breaches the upper resistance of $10,000,"" said Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      See also: Bitcoin Options Market Faces Record $1 Billion Expiry on Friday      The cryptocurrency is lacking a clear directional bias for the fifth straight week with prices still languishing in the restricted range of $9,000 to $10,000. Sellers failed to penetrate the lower end of the trading range early Tuesday.      “While no significant spot inflows were observed around $9,000, we are seeing strong bid volumes around $8,500, which could have provided the added layer support, causing the quick rebound to $9,250,” Neo told CoinDesk. “The bounce has ratified our view that bitcoin is still consolidating, and a further steep crash to below $7k is highly unlikely.”      Meanwhile, Stack CEO Matthew Dibb said the fundamentals of bitcoin have not deviated much from the firm's bullish view and that the recent dull trading could be due to increased investor interest in ether and decentralized finance (DeFi). “Many 'crypto-native' investors have been occupied in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, hunting yield and arbitrage opportunities,"" he said.      The recent speculative frenzy surrounding the lending protocol Compound’s new digital token, COMP, is the latest example of DeFi mania. Savvy traders are now executing complex arbitrage strategies to make gains on COMP’s meteoric growth.      Bitcoin’s quarterly gain could still take a knock if global stocks remain weak ahead of the close of June. The cryptocurrency’s positive correlation with equities has strengthened over the past two weeks alongside the resurgence of COVID-19 jitters in the markets.      See also: Singapore Begins Crackdown on Unlicensed Bitcoin Sellers      The majority of the quarterly gain is the result of the strong rally seen in April. But the cryptocurrency has persistently failed to keep gains above $10,000 since early May, a sign of uptrend exhaustion.      In addition, increased miner outflows to exchanges are suggesting scope for a short-term price drop. As a result, a greater pullback cannot be ruled out.

The project aims to prove the provenance of sustainably farmed salmon in Norway.      Following a successful pilot, five high-quality fish farming operations are now ready to start running a live production version of IBM Blockchain Transparent Supply, a new offering from Big Blue that uses the same underlying technology as Food Trust, the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain protocol.      Norway produces some of the highest quality seafood in the world. The Scandinavian country exported some 2.7 million tons of seafood in 2019 with the largest customers being in the U.S., Russia and China.    Brand protection    Norway’s fishing industry sees blockchain traceability as a way to ensure the quality of the national brand and that its salmon is what it says it is. There have been incidents where fish has been fraudulently passed off as having come from farms in Norway, said Atea CEO Steinar Sønsteby.      The technology has the ability to track every aspect of the fish lifecycle, using cameras inside the pens in the sea where the salmon swim, the temperature of the water (which dictates the speed at which they grow), the transportation and whether the fish is frozen or fresh, said Sønsteby.      Atea is the contract holder with farms, he said, and IBM provides the blockchain solution and runs the system in the IBM Cloud. The business arrangement is also novel.      Read more: Dole Plans to Use Blockchain Food Tracing in All Divisions by 2025      “Both us and IBM are going to be paid, which is a revenue share, so we get a small cut of every ton of fish that is being tracked,” said Sønsteby. “It’s not like a regular IT solution where you charge for a service and get paid. We will get our money over the coming years as fish is tracked and value created.”      Participating by uploading data to the blockchain is Kvarøy Arctic, a provider of sea-farmed salmon, and BioMar, a provider of high-grade fish feed.      “Norwegian seafood is known for its quality. At the same time, we still do not have the ability to trace where the fish came from, how it was grown or how it was stored,” Robert Eriksson, CEO of the Norwegian Seafood Association, said in a statement. “Blockchain can help eliminate these problems with a transparent, accountable record of where each fish came from.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/25/ibm-spawns-blockchain-for-norwegian-salmon-fisheries,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46deebbc7685888b12481c73e49d59d73965fc1b-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move to trial comes after the legal team for the estate of David Kleiman, Wright's deceased former business partner, was denied an omnibus motion filed in May attempting to sanction Wright over his alleged misbehavior.      ""According to Plaintiffs [Ira Kleiman et al.], throughout the litigation Defendant [Craig Wright] has engaged in a sustained pattern of perjury, forged evidence, misleading filings and obstruction,” according to a court order filed Wednesday.      See also: Judge ‘Puzzled’ by Craig Wright’s Objections to Producing Evidence of Over 1.1M Bitcoin      Judge Beth Bloom of the District Court in the Southern District of Florida, while concerned by the facts of the allegations, ruled in favor of Wright to dismiss the motion, saying the matter was best left ""for a jury to make as fact finder at trial.”      ""The Court ... exercises its discretion and declines to impose Plaintiffs’ suggested alternative lesser sanctions,"" Judge Bloom said.      In response to Kleiman's omnibus motion, Wright had responded with his own motion citing an expert witness, a psychologist who had diagnosed him with autism.      ""[D]r. Ami Klin, a licensed clinical psychologist who has studied Autism Spectrum Disorder for more than 35 years, ... will testify that he has diagnosed Dr. Wright with Autism Spectrum Disorder with high intellectual skills,"" Wright's response, hosted by court listener, says.      Judge Bloom commented that ""[A]s Plaintiffs note, Defendant's testimony has been glaringly inconsistent at numerous junctures. Defendant, however, stresses that he has been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, and thus his testimony needs to be evaluated in that light.""      Citing the need to meet a ""clear and convincing evidence standard,"" Bloom said ""Plaintiffs have not carried their burden to show that default sanctions are appropriate.""      The court had previously threatened to sanction Wright if he did not produce a list of his bitcoin holdings. However, the judge said he has since ""purportedly"" done so.

42383969,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoJF,1593076563,AMD-Backed Blockchain Project Amassing 20K GPUs but Won't Say Why,"A joint data-center venture between ConsenSys and chip maker AMD has so far raised over $20 million to triple its GPU capacity, but won't say exactly what they're for.      In crypto, the term ""data center"" is usually just another way of saying mining facility. But that's not just what it means to W3BCLOUD, the ConsenSys and AMD-backed venture. Trouble is, that's as much as we could squeeze out of them on the subject.      Speaking to CoinDesk, W3BCLOUD co-founders Wael Aburida and Sami Issa, who is also CEO, said they were using $20.5 million raised in the initial part of a seed round to ramp up the GPU capacity at a data center in Washington State.      W3BCLOUD currently operates 6,000 GPUs, but the $20.5 million investment will enable it to more than triple that number to 20,000 units, with plans for even more in the future. ""We're using over 90% of our capital to deploy computer resources,"" Aburida said. ""It's going to make sure that we have the horsepower from a computer perspective to serve the needs of our customers.""      W3BCLOUD, which was established in early 2019 is based in Ireland and has a sub-entity in London. Companies House, the U.K. company registry, lists ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin and his chief of staff, Jeremy Millar, as directors.      See also: ConsenSys Muscles Into Compliance With New Regulatory Product for DeFi      Usually associated in the blockchain space with mining cryptocurrencies, GPUs are versatile and can perform a range of other functions, such as processing blockchain traffic, increasing network storage and improving latency. They could also be put to work in the emerging Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) spaces.      Broadly, the GPUs will form the backbone for a new decentralized computing infrastructure, Aburida said, and they'll be deployed initially onto Ethereum. But both co-founders refused to be drawn on the specifics, and wouldn't say what initiatives, if any, were in the pipeline.      ""In a future discussion we'll say more,"" said Issa. He was quick to emphasize the data centers could also be used to facilitate a much broader range of previously unheard of decentralized functions, such as decentralized artificial intelligence and decentralized virtual reality.      ""We see ourselves as a decentralized computer infrastructure [with] blockchain being one of the use cases,"" Issa said. ""We have access to the best computers and the best blockchain minds, we are going to build the computer infrastructure needed for the attractive use cases for the community.""      See also: Argo Buys $500K Worth of Zcash Miners as Bitcoin Revenue Shrivels      W3BCLOUD is still in the middle of its seed round and those involved hope to reach its funding target of $30 million. So far, the company has attracted investment from its main backers, ConsenSys and AMD, as well as a handful of family offices in the United Arab Emirates.      ""The point of this call, really, is we're very excited about hitting the important milestone. We've gotten [so far] to $20.5 million as part of this first round,"" Aburida said.      Some of the funding will also go towards a new data center somewhere in the European Union. ""We have a European customer, for example, who we can't name, that wants us to be in Europe,"" Issa said.      They are also receiving interest from a few sovereign wealth funds, according to Aburida. An institutional round is planned for sometime in 2021, although a fundraising target ""has not yet been defined.""      ""There are a bunch of things that we can't talk about at this stage, but I think you can see the opportunity as we see it,"" Issa said.      See also: ConsenSys Spins Up Staking Service in Anticipation of Ethereum 2.0      W3BCLOUD is also interested, initially, in working on other proof-of-work blockchains.      Many blockchains struggle, at the initial stage, to get much traction, Aburida said, and the firm's data centers could maybe act as a ""white knight,"" providing early-stage computing power to give projects a crucial leg up and shield them from so-called 51% attacks. These occur when a bad actor can take over more than half of a network's computing power and can then rewrite transactions on the blockchain.      While the plans still haven't been fully fleshed out yet, ""the important point is we're going to be a significant player in terms of numbers for GPUs,"" Aburida said.

42383973,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoPX,1593075600,Ultra-Rich Monaco Wants to Fund Social Impact Projects With Security Tokens,"The Principality of Monaco, a popular haven for the mega-rich, has begun approving security token fundraising efforts, the first step to becoming a regulated on-chain finance hub.      Announced Thursday, Monaco’s Office of Digital Affairs has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Luxembourg-based blockchain startup Tokeny, which is part-owned by European stock exchange operator Euronext N.V.      The MoU coincides with a dedicated security token offering (STO) law voted in by Monaco’s National Council last week, and the whole tokenized finance endeavor will support environmental and social governance (ESG) projects to be approved by the government.      “Monaco is moving towards its ambition to become a funding nation for progress with our STO framework,” Principality of Monaco Delegate for Digital Affairs Frédéric Genta said in a statement. “Two key milestones were achieved: a dedicated STO law was voted by the National Council and we are welcoming Tokeny to the Principality to operate our STOs.”      Given Monaco’s high concentration of wealth (one in every three people is a millionaire and the place attracts hundreds of billionaires), it’s surprising it doesn’t have much of a financial center like the comparably small Lichtenstein or Luxembourg.      “[Monaco] is not a financial place for the moment, so they took this opportunity with security tokens to prove in Europe they can do compliant, on-chain finance,” said Tokeny Solutions CEO Luc Falempin. “Most of the high-net-worth people in Monaco are buying real estate. The idea now is for investors and money in private banks in Monaco to invest in green projects.”    STO spenders    Prospective security token holders being wooed in Monaco are qualified investors, roughly the same as accredited investors in the U.S., explained Falempin, which means coming up with a minimum investment of about $100,000.      The tokens will reach investors thanks to publicity around the ESG projects Monaco approves, and also distributions channels via private banks and brokers, said Falempin. Investors benefit from a selection and approval process and the Tokeny platform makes it very easy to manage digital assets with features like a recovery process, he said.      For projects looking to issue a token, these will have to first be presented to the government of Monaco, which will assess and approve them. The token issuer also needs to obtain a visa and set up as an entity in Monaco.      “Monaco will select between five and 15 projects a year and each of these will be looking to raise between $20 million and $200 million,” said Falempin. “So, it could mean raising around $1 billion a year.”    Tokeny tech    Under the hood, the tokenizing system is based on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard and the tokens are compatible with all Ethereum wallets. If projects want to market tokens to U.S. investors, for example, they will have to comply with local rules, so a Reg D or Reg A in the case of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      Further announcements involving Euronext, which owns a 23.5% stake in Tokeny and has two seats on the startup’s board, will emerge in the coming weeks, said Falempin, adding that the firm wants to keep its powder dry on the topic of secondary markets for now.      “As a strategic investor in Tokeny Solutions, we are pleased that the Principality of Monaco has appointed the company as the tokenization platform of government-approved innovative projects,” said Pierre-Edouard Borderie, a member of Tokeny’s board of directors who represents Euronext. “We are proud that this project embeds clear ESG components and enables sustainable finance.”    Movie magic    The first environmentally focused project made public comes from Icebreaker, a production company behind “March of the Penguins” from Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Luc Jacquet.      Falempin explained the IceBreaker project is looking to raise around $50 million and plans a number of exhibitions and other projects, in addition to a movie.      “As well as ‘March of the Penguins,’ they did the hugely successful Antarctica exhibition. Now, they are planning four or five others, and token holders will get revenue shares on all of these,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/25/ultra-rich-monaco-wants-to-fund-social-impact-projects-with-security-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8d6645004eb0bd44df946bc15d21b1e5141b903-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383976,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoS3,1593072126,"The COVID-19 E-Commerce Boom Hasn't Trickled Down to Bitcoin, Despite Advantages","Despite the COVID-19 e-commerce boom, bitcoin is hardly seeing more merchant usage as a transactional currency than it was five years ago.      “We’ve been doing this for six years and it’s still very rough around the edges,” said Brian Hoffman, co-founder of OB1, maker of crypto marketplace app Haven and its desktop counterpart, OpenBazaar.      The Haven app has logged 30,000 downloads since launching in July 2019. Since there’s a fine line between open commerce and bitcoin-fueled black markets, Hoffman said compliance costs are a chief concern for his startup. Any seller can list any item using the open-source protocol, but only compliant offerings get picked up by OB1’s search engine.      “If we were taking a cut of every transaction … are we putting ourselves in a position where we’re a party in illicit activity?” Hoffman said, pondering how the firm’s business model might change in 2020. “We’re very neutral. The technology is just there. We wanted to do a different paradigm for the business.”      Although a variety of e-commerce trends are booming during the Great Lockdown, crypto payments remain exceedingly niche.      Read more: Bitcoin Usage Among Merchants Is Up, According to Data From Coinbase and BitPay      “We’ve seen about half a million dollars [spent] in the last three months for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and litecoin. The majority is definitely bitcoin,” Hoffman said, whose startup earns money through affiliate marketing and a fraction of revenue from shops that use OB1 products.      Now compare that to marketplaces like Shopify, which also allows merchants to accept bitcoin but declined to comment for this story. The e-commerce platform reported $470 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2020, a 47% increase from the previous quarter. Even if we take OB1’s smaller scale into account, the crypto startup’s modest growth doesn’t appear to reflect the broader retail shift.      Merchant adoption among merchants and shoppers is far more comparable to the tiny community of daily active users of decentralized applications (dapps) in the gaming sector. In short, Bitcoin bulls who argue bitcoin is a better retail currency than Ethereum is a developer platform are speculating on future usage rather than current analysis.    So, why bitcoin?    Since the underlying software is more decentralized than marketplaces like Amazon, OB1 can’t charge all merchants. (That’s a feature, not a bug, considering how Etsy fees gouge smaller merchants. Regardless, Etsy usage is up and the company’s stock price tripled over the past three months.) OB1 laid off 12 employees earlier this year and is now a team of five.      “It protects your privacy while doing commerce; you can’t do that on Etsy. The information is on your device (for both sellers and buyers) and doesn’t go anywhere,” Hoffman said. “Now, after the layoffs, we have a refined focus on getting OB1 to be profitable moving forward.”      Read more: E-Commerce Giant Shopify Joins Libra Association      Sergio Abi-Naked and Dirk Abinakad, founders of the men’s accessories retailer Simply Carbon Fiber, said they started accepting bitcoin a few weeks ago, using the bitcoin payment processor OpenNode. So far no one has used bitcoin during the broader “increase in sales” sparked by the coronavirus crisis.      “I see the potential for it in the future, so we wanted to be prepared,” the retail founders, Abi-Naked and Dirk Abinaka, said about bitcoin. “We think this is where payments and e-commerce is going.”      It appears the merchants earning bitcoin are often evading censorship or serving niche connoisseurs.      Generally speaking, bitcoin usage continues to rise at a modest rate over the past year. According to a spokesperson for payment processor BitPay, volumes increased 10% in Q1 2020 compared to Q4 2019, primarily for computer products and services. This included an average of 98,000 transactions per month, according to the spokesperson.      “We saw a resurgence when eBay and Amazon were blocking mask sellers and stuff,” OB1’s Hoffman said. “Now we have new Chinese sellers trying to sell [medical] equipment.”      Likewise, OpenNode’s head of growth, Julie Landrum, said the company has seen the most bitcoin payments to merchants selling “luxury, high-value sales across borders” and “high-risk merchants” selling CBD products or erotic materials.      Beyond retail, Globeair CEO Bernhard Fragner said his luxury travel company used BitPay to process four bitcoin payments worth $30,000 over the past few weeks.      “More people want to fly privately,” Fragner said of the private jets. “We expect to see more payments in bitcoin.”    Experimental e-commerce    Among smaller businesses, risky merchants are the primary sector where bitcoin is slowly gaining traction.      “It’s a little bit harder for those companies to get banking relationships, even though it’s perfectly legal,” Landrum said of high-risk merchants.      Many OpenNode customers automatically convert bitcoin to fiat until they are ready to withdraw, she said, to avoid losing value in the meantime from volatility. They can withdraw their earnings in either bitcoin or fiat. Spurred by customer demands, Landrum said OpenNode is applying for a wide range of financial services licensing beyond money transmission.      “It could be payroll, paying suppliers or gaming winnings,” Landrum said of prospective payments tools coming to the backend merchant platform. “This supports [merchant] business operations. In some cases, they send us fiat and want us to pay out in bitcoin.”      However, she added, licensing is a slow and expensive process. It takes startups months to compliantly shift their strategy to offering the services users want.      Read more: Cypherpunk Valentine: Why Shoppers Spend Bitcoin on Lingerie      Beyond bitcoin, there are plenty of experiments with natively digital shopping experiences. For example, ChromaWay co-founder Or Perelman said his startup is developing a VR shopping mall demo, where shoppers can use an integrated game wallet to purchase items with crypto in virtual stores. But it’s too soon to say whether people will actually use cryptocurrency this way.      Meanwhile, Facebook is doubling down on shopping features, potentially even with its newly rebranded crypto subsidiary, Novi.      ""I think there are a lot of opportunities with Libra to make the process of commerce and payments helpful – a lot easier,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company’s shareholders’ call last month.      OB1’s Hoffman said that as of 2020, bitcoin commerce offers an “alternative” to marketplaces like Etsy, especially for small merchants. But the commerce sector of the bitcoin economy isn’t growing at the same pace as mainstream competitors offering corporate brands – even taking the smaller scale into account.      “We’re making tons of sales using OpenBazaar,” Hoffman said of the mask and appliance sellers OB1 itself operates. “But if [shoppers] want an iPhone, we’re not there yet.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/25/the-covid-19-e-commerce-boom-hasnt-trickled-down-to-bitcoin-despite-advantages,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d4bf087d7c71dc1236f64232f850e25303f7fd1-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Known as Barca Fan Tokens, or $BAR, supporters bought either through the club's own ""Socios"" voting platform or through Chiliz, a sports-specific token platform. The team is, in part, managed by a group of paying supporters called socios.      Going on sale Monday at around 11:00 UTC, more than 600,000 tokens were sold each at €2 (~$2.26) apiece. The sale finished within the space of two hours. By Wednesday, prices shot up to just under €6 (~$6.72), the company claimed, seeing a volume of just under $2.5 million traded across 24 hours.      With over 300 million supporters globally, Barcelona is one of the most successful and popular soccer clubs in the world. It is also one of the wealthiest, overtaking rival Real Madrid after it generated a record $959.3 million in revenue in the 2018-19 season.      Soon after the sale finished, Chiliz CEO Alexandre Dreyfus tweeted to say that more than $770,000 worth of tokens had been purchased from their platform in less than two minutes.      See also: Blockchain E-Sports TV App to Ship on Samsung S20 Phones in US      Unveiled back in February, the token is designed to help promote fan engagement. Staying true to the club's unique governance structure, supporters can earn tokens from participating in surveys and polls, which can be used to purchase merchandise and various club experiences.      The first poll will give supports the opportunity to decide on the design of a new mural for the first team locker room, the club said on its website.
