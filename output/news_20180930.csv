42381287,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94VYV,1538325038,Bitcoin Price Prints Second Straight Monthly Loss in September,"Bitcoin (BTC) is reporting losses for a second straight month, but there are hints of a bullish breakout ahead in the fourth quarter.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,570 – down 6.30 percent from September's opening price of $7,014. BTC also registered a 10-percent decline in August, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  However, despite the back-to-back monthly losses, the cryptocurrency is flashing a 2 percent gain for the third quarter. Further, the quarterly gain could have been much bigger had the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) not rejected a notable application for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  July: BTC trapped bulls on the wrong side of the market  Bitcoin jumped to a two-month high of $8,507 on July 25, confirming an upside break of the four-month-long falling channel.  However, the long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change was short-lived as prices fell back below $8,000 on July 27, courtesy of the SEC's second rejection of the Winklevoss brothers' application for a bitcoin ETF.  Nevertheless, the leading cryptocurrency posted a 21 percent gain in July, snapping the longest losing streak in nearly two years.  August: Sellers dominated the first half  BTC was down for the first two weeks the ETF rejection in late July. The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $5,859 on Bitfinex on Aug. 14 before rising back to $7,000 by the month's end.  Signaling a rotation of money out of high-risk alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin, and possibly into fiat currencies, the BTC dominance rate also rose above 50 percent for the first time since Dec. 19, 2017.  It is worth noting that the SEC disapproved several other ETF proposals in the second half of August month. Yet, BTC remained well bid, possibly because the investor community had priced in the widely expected bad news.  That resilience triggered speculation that better times lie ahead for the cryptocurrency and overshadowed the 10 percent monthly decline in prices.  September: BTC carved out another lower high  BTC's rise to highs above $7,500 in the first half of the month was supplemented by the bullish turn in the weekly MACD. As a result, the cryptocurrency was looking likely to rise further toward July highs above $8,500.  Instead, prices fell sharply on Sept. 5, leaving another lower high around $7,500 on the daily chart. The rising wedge breakdown on the daily chart signaled a resumption of the sell-off from the July highs. But, once again, the area around $6,000 proved a tough nut to crack for the bears.  Looking ahead: Charts look brighter for the fourth quarter  The cryptocurrency's persistent defense of $6,000 has convinced many, including the likes of billionaire investor Novogratz and Fundstrat's Tom Lee, that the BTC market is experiencing seller fatigue and has reached a bottom around $6,000.  However, a bullish reversal would be confirmed only after BTC has found acceptance above the recent lower price high of $7,429.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, BTC has charted a narrowing price range. Interestingly, the upper edge of the range is located around that $7,429 (August high) price point.  A move above that level would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change and allow a stronger rally toward key resistances located at $8,507 (July high) and even $9,990 (May high).  Any bullish move post-breakout could be a rapid one as a prolonged period of range-bound trading is often followed by a big spike in volatility, according to technical theory.  The prospects of BTC witnessing bull breakout in the fourth quarter are high as the cryptocurrency tends to perform well in the last three months of the calendar year, seasonality analysis indicates.  As can be seen on the above performance table, the cryptocurrency scored gains in the fourth quarter in six out of the last eight years.  The pattern looks likely to repeat itself, given the cryptocurrency is down 70 percent from the record high of $20,000 clocked in December 2017 and sellers seem to have run dry around $6,000.

The still nascent community has already voted to whittle 100 choices down to the 12 original, limited run memes that will launch with the site.  ""Everyone has kind of suffered through the bear market,"" Joe Urgo, one of the founders of District0x, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Communities have dwindled in general but I'd like to think ours have held up better than most due to that level of engagement that they might not have had otherwise.""  Sure enough, District0x, announced in May it would run the community polls as a way to start educating its supporters about its community governance mechanisms and give them a sense of all the possibilities.  But the polls haven't just focused on winning memes, the company also gave DNT holders a chance to cast votes on the design of Meme Factory itself, from the basic layout of the webpage to the logo for the site's new cryptocurrency, DANK.  This second token, DANK, is being used currently to incentivize people to participate in the polls. There are one billion DANK tokens, 80 percent of which will be given to community members participating in votes.  Although, once Meme Factory goes live, DANK will be used to run its token curated registry – a way for the community to decide which memes are good enough to get sold on the site.  And as for the DNT token once the platform goes live?  Once the platform is fully built, other entrepreneurs will be able to build websites, or so-called ""districts,"" with a variety of purposes hoping to attract a community. These districts will be decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that enable posting, searching, reputation and payments, all using District0x's software. For instance, outside of Meme Factory, District0x also built Name Bazaar, which allows users to buy namespaces on ethereum (firstnamelastname.eth).  The DNT then will be used as a staking mechanism, making sure voters are putting their money where their mouth is as it relates to community decisions.  Speaking to this new way of collaborative building, Urgo said, ""We see blockchain and tokens allow all kinds of uses that were never possible before.""  The users decide  As it relates to the memes, current token holders have quite a bit of say in how those images will appear to interested buyers.  The memes resemble a trading card, except digital. So far, DNT token holders have gotten to vote on what the proportions all memes should be (users voted for 2 x 3, the proportions of a mobile phone's screen) and what the back of each meme card should look like.  Alexander Khoriaty, one of District0x's first hires and the project manager who's been running the community design process day-to-day, told CoinDesk:  ""On the one hand it's very early days for us, but on the other hand we're seeing what DNT was originally proposed to do.""  Looking back, though, Khoriaty said he wished the team had thought more about interdependencies.  For example, they have been collecting memes from interested creators for a long time, but those creators didn't know what the proportions of their memes would be before they designed them. As such, now that the proportions have been set, the creators will have to redesign some of the memes to fit the layout.  While this wasn't an issue for all the 12 best memes selected, according to Khoriaty, it wouldn't have been a problem at all should they have thought harder about the order in which they wanted the community to be able to decide different questions.  Power in tokens  But stepping back, the votes that just happened work in a clever way so as not to turn away token holders that weren't interested in locking up their tokens for less serious polls.  Later, when a user stakes their tokens, those tokens will be locked up, meaning that user then wouldn't be able to sell those tokens on an exchange immediately. This lock-up is likely a bit nerve-wracking for current token holders since the network isn't live, stable and proven, which means the token price could be subject to substantial dips.  As such, each time there is a vote on Meme Factory right now, the protocol takes a snapshot of the current distribution of DNT tokens across ethereum. It then gives every wallet a new token – a fake DNT – to use in the poll, matching the number of tokens they actually own.  This way, users can stake their current balance to vote, without locking up any real DNT.  ""We gave a lot of elementary low impact votes for people to participate in – things that don't really affect the inner workings of the app,"" Khoriaty said, although he added that he'd like to see the questions asked become more fundamental, such what a district's roadmap should entail.  Urgo agreed, saying he hopes to see decisions become ""more granular.""  They've been doing one vote per week since August 20. The results of the final vote, to pick the first 12 memes, was posted on September 25.  With a circulating supply of 600,000,000 DNT tokens, the most popular vote was for the DANK token logo, in which more than 70 million tokens voted. Normally, votes see participation from about 60 million tokens (although that doesn't mean anywhere close to 60 million users, since users have more than one token a piece). The latest poll, another round of the community's favorite memes, had the lowest turnout, with only 39 million tokens voting.  While a date hasn't been set for the live release of Meme Factory, the founders say they're learning a lot from the community, through discussions on Discord and Telegram, during the votes. A lot of this feedback helps them understand gaps in their educational materials.  ""Our users are basically challenging us to come up with details that we didn't even realize we were missing,"" Khoriarty told CoinDesk.  Urgo says the company will spin up five more districts and then they will release their ""editor,"" what the team calls its software for allowing other people to create districts that use the DNT token for governance.  Speaking to how the lessons learned now can be applied by other projects going forward, Urgo concluded:  ""It's all very much a governance experiment to see what the community wants to have a say in.""

The clarification after an investigation by Coin Crunch India comes weeks after the central bank was rumored to have set up the supposed unit to ""research and possibly draft rules"" for the emerging technologies.  In an article on the unit's supposed creation, the Economic Times had cited two anonymous sources who were ""familiar with the central bank's plans.""  However, Naimish Sanghvi, founder of Coin Crunch India, filed an Right To Information (RTI) request hoping to confirm the article's claim and gain more information about the department, such as who was heading the unit, and so on.  Sanghvi received a response on Sept. 26, denying the claimed effort.  The RBI said:  ""There is no new unit created formally in RBI for the purpose (Blockchain, Crypto and AI) mentioned in RTI query"".  So, while the RBI has formed a unit to ""study and provide guidance on the desirability and feasibility to introduce a central bank digital currency,"" it seems its stance on crypto use more generally has not softened.  In a move that shook the local crypto industry and has even caused exchange businesses to cease trading, the RBI issued a circular ordering banks to halt services to cryptocurrency businesses in April. With fiat currency withdrawals and deposits impossible as a result, exchanges have moved to survive on crypto-to-crypto trading, but volumes have suffered.  In response to the ban, various entities, including, exchanges, have filed several counter petitions with the Supreme Court (SC) in what has become a combined case.  The last hearing saw the case postponed, though it is expected to resume soon.
