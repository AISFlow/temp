Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-memecoin-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Metaplanet Inc., often referred to as the “Japanese MicroStrategy,” has announced the issuance of ¥4.5 billion (approximately $30 million) in zero-interest bonds to fund its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The firm is positioning itself as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The announcement marks Metaplanet’s fourth series of bonds, with a maturity date set for June 16, 2025. The zero-interest bonds will be released in tranches which will allow the company to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet plans to redeem these bonds through the previously issued warrants, according to reports. Metaplanet’s strategic Bitcoin acquisition plan Since April 2024, Metaplanet has made Bitcoin its treasury reserve asset and has already acquired over 1,150 BTC, worth about $122.67 million. This approach is similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin reserve. Metaplanet’s new bond issuance is to speed up its Bitcoin buying strategy specifically to purchase more Bitcoin. By issuing zero-interest bonds, Metaplanet avoids short-term financial stress while using the funds to grow its assets. Investors benefit because these bonds are sold at a discount but pay the full value at maturity. The bond issuance news resulted in a 51% surge in Metaplanet’s stock price over the past five trading sessions. Shares reached an all-time high of 4,270 JPY, increasing the company’s market capitalization beyond the $1 billion mark. Over 27.8 billion yen (~$180 million) worth of Metaplanet shares was traded, showing the company’s ability to capitalize on its Bitcoin-centric approach. Even Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet, acknowledged the market’s overwhelming response. Metaplanet plans to issue additional private placement bonds worth up to ¥5 billion to expand its Bitcoin reserves. These bonds are to be issued in partnership with EVO FUND. The proceeds from the bond issuances will also be allocated exclusively for Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing Metaplanet’s long-term vision. Shareholder rewards program in Bitcoin In addition to its bold investment moves, the company also announced a Bitcoin rewards program. The company announced a 30-million-yen ($199,500) prize pool, which will reward shareholders who own at least 100 shares as of December 31, 2024. Through a lottery system, 2,350 selected shareholders will receive varying amounts of Bitcoin. Metaplanet issued ¥4.5 billion in zero-interest bonds to increase its Bitcoin holdings, strengthening its position as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. It plans further bond issuances and Bitcoin rewards for shareholders.

However, SHIB remains in an upward trend channel, and assuming that the bulls do buy the dip, the bullish near-term thesis remains strong.

Massive pump incoming? — Whales HQ (@WhalesHQ) December 15, 2024 Whales are often deemed as “smart money” and when they start to move, that is a potential signal that the risk-reward of a crypto is good. Can the Shiba Inu Price Recover? The Shiba Inu price is currently just over 20% down from its recent highs and these losses could extend in the short term. That said, risks remain tilted towards a renewed meme coin pump at any point before the end of the year, or in early 2025. Sentiment remains bullish ahead of the arrival of the Trump administration in the White House in January. A Bitcoin strategic reserve , which seems more and more likely every day right now, could send BTC to the moon. And that could mean rotation into altcoins , including major meme coins. All the while, the incoming Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) will keep Dogecoin (DOGE) and the broader meme coin market in focus.

How High Will Shiba Inu Go? Assuming the Shiba Inu price hits new highs for the year soon, it could soon challenge its record highs in the $0.000090 area soon. Beyond that, a parabolic rally could be in store. A rally towards the 3.618 or 4.236 Fibonacci extension from the 2023 lows back to the 2021 highs suggests gains of as much as 10x from current levels are very possible. That would see Shiba Inu attain a market cap of over $150 billion. That may seem ridiculous, but if Bitcoin hits $200,000, that would see its market cap exceed $4 trillion. In this scenario, SHIB’s market cap would only amount to about 4% of Bitcoin’s, which is to unbelievable when considering its position as a leading meme coin in the market. The near-term future looks very bright for the meme coin space and Shiba Inu, though, as ever, these are incredibly volatile markets. In order to reap big gains, investors also need to be able to HODL through rapid and aggressive downturns.

37775417,https://crypto.news/?p=14320295,1734478019,Coinbase refutes ‘baseless’ BiT Global wBTC suit,"No law compels Coinbase to “compromise the integrity of its platform” by doing business with Justin Sun-tied BiT Global, the U.S. crypto exchange wrote. Coinbase asked a U.S. court to deny BiT Global’s lawsuit in Northern California, which seeks $1 billion in relief and a temporary restraining order on wrapped Bitcoin’s ( wBTC )’s delisting. The Justin Sun-affiliated BiT Global sued Coinbase on Dec. 13 for planning to remove the wrapped Bitcoin ( BTC ) asset from its U.S.-based exchange. BiT Global claimed delisting wBTC was illegal, would cause irreparable harm to the token’s economics, and was unjustified as Coinbase listed unserious cryptocurrencies like meme coins. Also, launching cbBTC breached antitrust laws and threatened to create a Coinbase-controlled monopoly in the tokenized Bitcoin marketplace. The crypto exchange argued that California’s Unfair Competition Law was inapplicable. DefiLlama confirmed that cbBTC ranked outside the top 10 tokenized BTC assets by market capitalization. Coinbase has the right to choose whom to do business with, and no law requires it to allow bad actors or suspected bad actors onto its exchange… Coinbase does not have anything approaching monopoly power, and because its decision to delist wBTC was proper and justified based on the careful review it undertook and the unacceptable risk of doing business with an entity associated with Mr. Sun. Coinbase response to BiT Global lawsuit According to the December 17 court filing, material changes to wBTC’s stewardship, particularly Justin Sun’s majority control of the Bitcoin reserves, prompted Coinbase and other entities to reconsider their support for the asset. You might also like: Sky mulls cutting support for wBTC over Justin Sun affiliations The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Sun and three of his wholly owned companies with federal violations. Additionally, the FBI reportedly opened an inquiry regarding potential terror financing involving Sun. The U.S. Department of Justice has not indicted Sun by publishing time, neither have authorities issued any arrest warrants for the Tron ( TRX ) founder. Coinbase stated that its new wBTC risk assessments, in line with company listing standards, raised red flags, primarily due to Sun’s involvement. The exchange described its decision as “common sense” and necessary to protect its customers. The company also emphasized that delisting wBTC would not impact the token’s overall on-chain activity, which largely takes place on other platforms. Nor can BiT claim harm, let alone irreparable harm, from being delisted from an exchange where less than 1% of transactions involving wBTC are made. Perhaps that is why BiT sat on its claims for nearly a month before filing suit, belying any urgency for relief. The U.S. crypto titan asked the California Court to rule against BiT Global’s TRO request and $1 billion relief package, due to the firm’s ties to an allegedly indictable individual and fabricated emergency regarding wBTC. We've filed our response to BiT Global’s effort to stop our delisting of wBTC before any discovery or even formal response to their bogus claims. We lay out why this lawsuit lacks any semblance of merit and why their request for a TRO should be denied.

Salesforce plans to hire 2,000 new salespeople to focus on selling artificial intelligence (AI) products as the company planning to expand its AI offerings. Salesforce to Hire 2,000 Salespeople for AI Expansion CEO Marc Benioff made this announcement during a company event in San Francisco on Tuesday, saying that the demand for AI tools is so high that the company is increasing its hiring plans. “We’re adding another couple of thousand salespeople to help sell these products,” Benioff said. “ We already had 9,000 referrals for the 2,000 positions we’ve opened. It’s amazing.” This announcement makes a big increase from the initial plan. A month ago, Benioff mentioned that Salesforce would hire 1,000 new salespeople for AI roles. The company is now doubling the count as it prepares to release its new AI agent software in February 2025. Salesforce aims to make AI a key part of its product lineup, with AI tools to help sales teams, marketers, and customer service agents do their jobs more efficiently. The new salespeople will help introduce and sell Salesforce’s latest AI technology, including the upcoming second version of its Agentforce platform. This software is designed to create AI-powered agents to handle complex tasks, like answering questions in Salesforce’s Slack app using all available data. The new AI agents will be able to respond to customer queries, making business operations smoother and faster. Benioff is very excited about Salesforce’s potential for AI. In a recent interview, he shared, “I’ve never been more excited about anything at Salesforce, maybe in my career.” He added that he expects the company to have over a billion AI agents within the next year. “This is the most exciting thing that’s happened to Salesforce,” he said.

37775484,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629356,1734477648,Bitcoin rally hinges on spot market activity as derivatives slow down,"The latest Bitcoin rally gathering strength since October happened with a dominance of spot trading, while derivative trading slowed down. Recent market demand showed renewed spot open interest, as BTC grew to over $108,300, a new price record. Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to its most recent price record as market sentiment shifted to increased spot demand. Analysts noted since October, market influences depended on spot trading, rather than being driven by the derivative market. During earlier bull market stages, open interest on derivative positions was higher, while spot trading and flows to exchanges were slow. In the last quarter of 2024, the BTC Fund Flow Ratio increased its baseline, suggesting a higher inflow of funds to and from exchanges. The BTC fund flow ratio suggest spot exchange activity increased in the last quarter of 2024. | Source: Cryptoquant The fund flow ratio is a metric of on-chain BTC transfers against transfers to exchanges. A more active exchange flow means the focus shifted to spot trading. In the past quarter of 2024, both derivatives and spot trading accelerated. However, as the year comes to a close, spot activity is growing more dominant. Derivative open interest for BTC on major centralized exchanges stalled at around $33B, sinking slightly from its peak. The BTC derivative market goes through cycles of accumulation and liquidation of leveraged positions. Those cycles often boost the price to a new range, causing the liquidation of short positions. With time, interest shifts to additional accumulation on the spot market. Leveraged position accumulation and liquidation cycles are happening at lower levels, without causing significant drawdown events. At the same time, BTC traders often use the spot market to realize short-term gains and reaccumulate. The behavior of short-term trader whales also goes against retail sentiment. As BTC trades above $106,000, retail is bullish, while smart money has turned bearish. Overall, trading behavior shifted the Bitcoin fear and greed index to the ‘extreme greed’ level at 87 points. Demand for actual BTC reserves is rising Demand is rising for owning and controlling BTC in the form of long-term reserves. Instead of leveraged positions, bets on the value of BTC are made by storing coins that are instantly accessible. Demand for physical coins and spot trading led to an increase in the Coinbase premium index . The index has been in the green for most of the past 30-day period. The Coinbase premium index is showing higher demand for spot BTC buying on the US dollar market. The index measures BTC prices on Coinbase against the Binance market, suggesting increased demand for direct buying. Spot trading for BTC also expanded the share of US dollar trading. More than 21% of all BTC volumes are against the US dollar, diminishing the role of stablecoins. Despite the expansion of stablecoins, the dollar-based spot market indicates a shift to direct BTC demand. BTC keeps moving into whale wallets The other major sources for BTC holding are miners, who still own 1.9M coins. ETF buying is also ongoing, retaining even more coins through Coinbase Custody. The third biggest source of demand for BTC comes from corporate buyers, who are buying BTC through new bond issues. This source is also the biggest shift from fiat to crypto ownership, betting on long-term BTC growth. Demand from Bitcoin ETF absorbs most of the physical selling pressure. As older cohorts of holders realize profits, Bitcoin ETF absorbs up to 90% of that selling pressure. Even large-scale whales have easily found liquidity on the market. Demand from MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, and other corporate buyers is also a significant drain on available coins. Demand far outpaces daily BTC production of just 450 new coins. The current conditions with actual transfers of coins to even larger whale wallets are expected to create a supply crunch. Based on the Rainbow chart , BTC is still in the accumulation zone and possibly far from the cycle top. The next potential levels see BTC test $110,000 and a peak above $125,000. At the same time, long positions in the $102,000 range suggest liquidation attacks may lead to a short-term drawdown.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024!,"The cryptocurrency market is filled with opportunities, but it’s also easy to miss out. Cardano, one of the most recognised names in crypto, delivered impressive growth for early investors. But if you’re still waiting for the next big thing, it’s time to turn your attention to Qubetics ($TICS) . With an affordable presale price and outstanding real-world applications, Qubetics is quickly becoming the best crypto to invest in 2024. Let’s dive into how Qubetics and Cardano compare and why Qubetics might be the best opportunity to watch this year. Qubetics ($TICS): A Practical Solution with Impressive Returns Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency looking to make a splash. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator , Qubetics connects real-world businesses and individuals to blockchain technology through efficient, user-friendly solutions. At its core lies an innovative approach to solve global challenges, particularly in secure digital communications and decentralised transactions. Currently, Qubetics is in its 13th presale stage, with tokens priced at just $0.0342. So far, over 350 million tokens have been sold to more than 10,300 holders, raising $6.9 million. These numbers alone make Qubetics one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024, offering massive upside potential for early investors. If you invest $8,500 in Qubetics at $0.0342 per token, analysts predict significant gains. By the end of the presale, when $TICS reaches $0.25, your investment could grow by 630.19% ROI. If the token hits $1 post-presale, that translates to a 2,820.78% ROI. Should Qubetics reach $15 after its mainnet launch, your initial investment could rise to a jaw-dropping $3.7 million. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its decentralised VPN (dVPN). The dVPN ensures privacy and security in an age where digital surveillance is rampant. For professionals like doctors, lawyers, and entrepreneurs, Qubetics’ dVPN offers a private way to manage confidential transactions and sensitive data securely. For individuals, it means safer browsing, enhanced online privacy, and greater control over personal information. With growing concerns about cybersecurity, Qubetics’ dVPN has become a game-changer for both individuals and businesses. This unique blend of practical use cases and investor potential is why Qubetics has earned its place as the best crypto to invest in 2024. By solving real-world problems and bridging the gap between Web3 and traditional industries, Qubetics offers far more than just speculation. It’s a utility-driven investment for the future. Cardano (ADA): A Steady Leader in Blockchain Cardano is one of the most respected projects in the cryptocurrency space. Known for its academic approach to blockchain development, Cardano prioritises security, scalability, and sustainability. It has created a robust ecosystem designed to handle decentralised finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and real-world enterprise solutions. In 2024, Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem. The recent updates to its smart contract platform have improved efficiency and lowered transaction fees. With increased adoption of decentralised applications (dApps), Cardano has attracted developers and businesses seeking secure blockchain solutions. Despite its steady growth, Cardano’s price has remained relatively stable, with analysts predicting modest gains for 2024. While its ecosystem remains robust, its growth rate no longer matches the potential seen in emerging projects like Qubetics. Investors looking for exponential returns may find Qubetics’ presale more appealing than Cardano’s current market position. Conclusion: Qubetics is the Best Crypto to Invest in 2024 If you missed Cardano’s early success, now is your chance to seize a new opportunity. Qubetics ($TICS) is rapidly emerging as the best crypto to invest in 2024, offering affordable entry points, real-world applications like dVPN, and extraordinary ROI potential. With its 13th presale stage still ongoing and tokens priced at $0.0342, Qubetics combines practical blockchain solutions with an investment opportunity that could deliver life-changing returns. For investors seeking the next big winner, Qubetics delivers unmatched potential to outperform established projects like Cardano.

37776046,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320516,1734477168,Bitcoin Policy Institute Drafts Executive Order for Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"The Bitcoin Policy Institute has proposed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under the U.S. Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) in the Trump administration. If adopted, this move aims to position the United States as a global leader in digital assets. It highlights Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold” and seeks to drive capital inflows, technological adoption, and financial resilience. U.S. Proposes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Under Trump to Strengthen Economy and Safeguard Dollar The proposal stresses the need for the U.S. to adapt to the growing influence of digital assets in global finance. Bitcoin is a decentralized, finite asset that can strengthen the U.S. economy and safeguard the dollar. The order aims to diversify the ESF’s holdings and secure long-term economic stability by formally designating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. JUST IN: Bitcoin Policy Institute drafts Executive Order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for President Trump pic.twitter.com/bxJHZKa8Ue — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 17, 2024 The executive order establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to manage Bitcoin as a permanent national asset. The Treasury Secretary would administer it, and strict measures would ensure transparency and accountability. Regular audits, advanced security protocols, and comprehensive reporting would be required to build public confidence. The order calls for consolidating all Bitcoin currently under federal control. Within seven days, agencies like the U.S. Marshal Service would be required to stop selling, auctioning, or transferring Bitcoin. Once legal ownership is confirmed, those holdings would move to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Additionally, the Treasury Secretary would have 60 days to implement an acquisition program to purchase and manage Bitcoin under the ESF. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan: Will Seized BTC Kickstart a New Financial Era? Bitcoin surged to a record high above $107,000 on Monday after President-elect Donald Trump reaffirmed plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, igniting enthusiasm among crypto supporters. A strategic reserve is a stockpile of critical resources to stabilize markets during crises. Examples include the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and China’s reserves of metals and grains. Analysts are divided on whether Trump could create the reserve through an executive order or if Congress must act. Trump hinted the reserve could start with 200,000 seized bitcoins, currently worth around $21 billion. Adding more would require government purchases, potentially funded through debt issuance or selling gold reserves. Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed legislation for the Treasury to purchase 200,000 BTC annually for five years , funded by Federal Reserve profits and gold holdings. Supporters argue a Bitcoin reserve could help dominate the global market, reduce deficits, and strengthen the U.S. dollar.

PENGU’s successful launch has made Pudgy Penguins very popular, making it the second most valuable NFT collection after CryptoPunks. This launch highlights the growing trend of adding native tokens to existing NFT projects to create larger ecosystems and improve community engagement. PENGU Tokens Soars Following CoinMarketCap Listing Penguiana, the penguin-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain, witnessed a 70% market valuation surge after CoinMarketCap’s June listing . This significant achievement underscores growing investor confidence. It also marked a pivotal advancement in Penguiana’s journey within the cryptocurrency landscape. $PENGU has broadened its accessibility through listings on prominent decentralized exchanges such as Raydium and Birdeye. These exchanges have facilitated the token’s swift uptake and trading. As Penguiana continues to evolve, the team remains focused on enlarging its ecosystem and deepening community engagement. Safety in the NFT Industry The NFT industry has witnessed significant growth and adoption in recent years. Some digital firms have also leveraged the platform to expand their offerings. For instance, Sony, a maker of gaming consoles, has filed a patent application to move NFTs between different games and platforms. However, with NFTs’ popularity, safety worries have surfaced, especially the safety of the platform used to produce, store, and trade NFTs. Recall that one Ethereum wallet suffered massive losses after selling 500 Moonbirds NFTs . Therefore, prioritizing safety in the NFT industry is critical to protecting users’ investments, preventing hacking or theft of valuable assets, and preserving the industry’s reputation.

42387489,162f6323-790b-4d79-9883-45aa562d4117,1734476988,The Risks of Overbuilding Crypto Infrastructure,"The Web3 ecosystem is often regarded as the next infrastructure of the internet. However, nearly 10 years after the release of the Ethereum white paper, we have very few mainstream applications running on that infrastructure. Meanwhile, we continue to see the emergence of new infrastructure building blocks everywhere: L1, L2, and L3 blockchains, rollups, ZK layers, DeFi protocols, and many others. While we might be building the future of the internet with Web3, there is little doubt that we are overbuilding the infrastructure layer. Currently, the ratio between infrastructure and applications in Web3 has no parallels in the history of technology markets.  Why is this happening? Simply because it’s profitable to build infrastructure in Web3.  Web3 defies some of the conventional market adoption patterns in tech infrastructure, creating both a rapid path to profitability and unique risks for its evolution. To explore this thesis further, we must understand how value is typically created in infrastructure technology trends, how Web3 diverges from this norm, and the risks posed by overbuilding infrastructure.  The Infrastructure-Application Value Creation Cycle in Tech Markets  Traditionally, value creation in tech markets fluctuates between the infrastructure and application layers, finding a dynamic balance between the two.  Take the Web1 era as an example. Companies such as Cisco, IBM, and Sun Microsystems powered the infrastructure layer of the internet. But, even during those early days, applications like Netscape and AOL emerged to capture significant value. The Web2 era was driven by cloud infrastructure, which then triggered SaaS and social platforms, catalyzing the creation of new cloud infrastructure.  More recently, trends like generative AI began as an infrastructure play with model builders, but applications such as ChatGPT, NotebookLM, and Perplexity quickly captured momentum. This, in turn, drove the creation of new infrastructure to support a new generation of AI applications — a cycle that is likely to continue for several iterations.  This constant value-creation balance between application and infrastructure layers has been a hallmark of technology markets, making Web3 a notable anomaly. But why is this imbalance so evident in Web3?  The Infrastructure Casino  The main difference between Web3 and its predecessors is the rapid path to capital formation and liquidity in infrastructure projects. In Web3, infrastructure projects typically launch tokens that become tradable on exchanges, providing substantial liquidity for investors, teams, and communities. This contrasts with traditional markets, where investor liquidity is typically realized through company acquisitions or public offerings, both of which usually take considerable time. Most venture capital firms operate on a ten-year investment cycle or longer. While rapid capital formation is one of the benefits of Web3, it often misaligns team incentives, discouraging long-term value creation.  This ""infrastructure casino"" is a risky pattern in Web3 because it incentivizes builders and investors to prioritize infrastructure projects over applications. After all, who needs applications when L2 tokens can achieve multibillion-dollar valuations in just a few years with minimal usage? This approach presents several challenges, and many of them are subtle and difficult to address.  The Challenges of Overbuilding Web3 Infrastructure  1) Building Without Adoption Feedback  Perhaps the most significant risk of overbuilding infrastructure in Web3 is the lack of market feedback from applications built on top of that infrastructure. Applications represent the ultimate expression of consumer and business use cases and regularly guide new use cases in infrastructure. Without application feedback, Web3 risks building infrastructure for “imaginary” use cases that are disconnected from market reality.  2) Extreme Liquidity Fragmentation  The launch of new Web3 infrastructure ecosystems is one of the main contributors to liquidity fragmentation in the space. New blockchains often require billions of dollars to bootstrap liquidity and attract tier 1 DeFi projects to their ecosystems. Over the past few months, the creation of new L1 and L2 blockchains has outpaced the influx of new capital into the market. As a result, capital in Web3 is more fragmented than ever, creating significant adoption challenges.  3) Inevitable, Increasing Complexity  Have you tried using some of the wallets, dApps, and bridges for newer blockchains? The user experience is typically difficult. Tech infrastructure naturally grows more complex and sophisticated over time. Applications built on that infrastructure typically abstract away this complexity for end users. However, in Web3 — where there is a lack of application development — users are left to interact with increasingly complex blockchains, leading to friction in adoption.  4) Limited Developer Communities  If Web3 infrastructure has outpaced capital formation, then the challenge is even greater when it comes to developer communities. dApps are built by developers, and creating new developer communities is always a challenge. Most new Web3 infrastructure projects operate with very limited developer communities because they pull talent from the same existing pool, which is simply not large enough to sustain the vast amount of infrastructure being built.  5) Widening Gap with Web2  A side effect of overbuilding infrastructure in Web3 — without app adoption — is the widening adoption gap with Web2. Trends such as generative AI are powering a new generation of Web2 apps and redefining sectors like SaaS and mobile. Instead of tapping into this momentum, the predominant trend in Web3 continues to be building more blockchains.  Ending the Vicious Circle  Launching L1 and L2 blockchains is a profitable business for investors and development teams, but that doesn't necessarily translate into long-term benefits for the Web3 ecosystem. Web3 is still in its early stages, and while more infrastructure building blocks are certainly needed, most of the industry is currently building infrastructure without market feedback.  That market feedback typically comes from applications using the infrastructure — but such applications are largely absent in Web3. Most usage of Web3 infrastructure comes from other Web3 infrastructure projects. We continue to build infrastructure, launch tokens, and raise capital, but we are effectively flying blind.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/17/the-risks-of-overbuilding-crypto-infrastructure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85007101c2dc440a7dd8afa5d8e33de7a2a82145-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37774827,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629372,1734476604,First glance at what an American strategic Bitcoin reserve could look like,"The strategic Bitcoin reserve draft document in question has been making the rounds on X (formerly Twitter) with widespread approval from crypto netizens. The draft was reportedly presented by @btcpolicyorg as an executive order focusing on making Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset within the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The two-page document addressed certain key points the institute recognized as important to cover in what many consider a preliminary draft. Recommendations to gain a competitive advantage with Bitcoin The executive order describes Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset that can bolster the US dollar’s resilience. It also demands the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to serve as a permanent national asset for economic security. According to the draft, the US policy should include: Creating the Bitcoin reserve to grow the economy and maintain the US’s financial dominance in world markets. Making Bitcoin a strategic asset stored by the government to diversify national reserves and boost economic security. Striving to make the US the number one country for digital assets in terms of attracting investment, talent, and innovation. The draft highlights the need for the United States to adapt to global trends in digital finance as this is the only way to maintain economic stability and leadership. It also tags Bitcoin as a decentralized and finite store-of-value asset, with comparisons to digital gold — a sentiment many crypto stakeholders seem to agree with. MicroStrategy ’s Michael Saylor has even gone as far as suggesting the US sell all its gold to buy BTC. It may sound over the top, but Micahel Saylor has overtly supported Bitcoin, and his BTC gamble has paid off exponentially. Establishment of the SBR and Bitcoin designation According to the draft, the SBR will be handled by the Treasury Department, which will have strict oversight, including audits and security measures. The draft also recommended that any Bitcoins held by federal agencies should be transferred to the SBR within 7 days of the order’s issuance. It also declared Bitcoin as a reserve asset suitable for holding within the ESF, with acquisition programs to begin within two months. According to the acquisition program, about $21 billion in Bitcoin will be bought within a year using funds from the ESF. The purchases will happen under the watchful eyes of protocols to reduce mismanagement risks. Within a month, secure custody frameworks are expected to be implemented and this could include partnerships with secure service providers. Meanwhile, it will be up to the Treasury to create stringent standards to promote long-term security, including cryptographic verifications and less reliance on third parties. On sales from the SBR and transparency According to the draft, long-term preservation will be a priority, which means that any BTC the SBR buys will be locked down for at least two decades to protect the country’s financial strength. The documents say that Bitcoin sales can only happen under exceptional circumstances (e.g., economic or security crises). Asset liquidation will also require detailed justification and presidential approval. The draft also proposed that when the sales happen, they will be done with transparency and minimal disruption. There will be a public proof of reserve and cryptographic receipt of Bitcoin holdings will be published quarterly to promote transparency. The Treasury will be expected to provide reports on performance, security, and strategic benefits of Bitcoin within the ESF. Coordination between the various government agencies, including the Treasury, Federal Reserve and Department of Defense, among others will be encouraged in alignment with national security and economic policies. This draft has not been approved or signed, but many who have seen it seem to believe it is good enough. David Bailey, the CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, shared screenshots of the draft. He also endorsed the document and mentioned that the president’s signature is the only step needed to fully implement the Bitcoin reserve. The general sentiment among crypto stakeholders is that the draft is sufficient as a framework to integrate Bitcoin into America’s national reserves. If properly done, it could also boost the country’s security, long-term economic growth, and leadership in the crypto world.

37774825,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629347,1734476423,North Korean crypto network in UAE hit by U.S. sanctions,"The United States has hit a North Korean-linked crypto laundering operation in the UAE with new sanctions. The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned two Chinese nationals—Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian—along with a UAE-based front company, Green Alpine Trading, LLC, for laundering millions in illicit funds. The network funneled stolen cryptocurrency back to Pyongyang to bankroll North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. The operation, masterminded by China-based North Korean agent Sim Hyon Sop, used digital assets to obscure the origin of the money. Sim, previously sanctioned by OFAC, oversaw the schemes, leveraging a complex web of crypto exchanges, money mules, and shell companies. Crypto cash-outs and the UAE connection The network’s key players operated primarily out of the United Arab Emirates. Lu Huaying, a Chinese national, allegedly began converting North Korean-obscured cryptocurrency into cash in early 2022. Between then and September 2023, Lu successfully laundered millions of dollars on behalf of Sim Hyon Sop. The scheme used money mules and crypto-to-fiat conversions to disguise the funds’ origins, allowing the DPRK to purchase goods and services essential for its missile development. Zhang Jian, another Chinese national based in the UAE, stepped in later. Between late 2022 and early 2023, Zhang facilitated fiat currency exchanges for Sim and allegedly acted as a cash courier. The funds, moved through layers of intermediaries, ultimately financed North Korea’s weapons programs. Green Alpine Trading, LLC, served as the core of the operation. Registered in the UAE, the front company was integral to the laundering process, providing Sim’s network with the infrastructure to move money seamlessly across borders. OFAC said Green Alpine attempted to provide “financial, material, and technological support” for North Korea’s illicit operations. The sanctions now freeze all U.S.-linked property and financial assets tied to Lu, Zhang, and Green Alpine Trading. Any entity controlled 50% or more by the sanctioned individuals or company is also blocked. U.S. citizens and institutions are barred from engaging with the network. North Korea’s crypto laundering tactics revealed North Korea’s strategy is simple but effective: steal crypto, launder it, and cash it out through proxies . Digital assets, with their anonymity and decentralized nature, have become critical to the DPRK’s revenue generation. The regime exploits cybercrime, fraudulent IT work, and stolen funds to bypass international sanctions. Sim Hyon Sop, the architect of the UAE-based operation, represents North Korea’s Korea Kwangson Banking Corp (KKBC). KKBC is a state-run entity already blacklisted under U.S. and United Nations sanctions for its role in funding the DPRK’s WMD programs. From China, Sim directs these schemes, setting up shell companies and managing bank accounts to obscure the origin of the funds. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has long pointed to individuals like Sim as key players. They work as agents for state-backed institutions, pulling strings behind the scenes while using intermediaries like Lu and Zhang to handle the dirty work. By relying on trusted proxies, Sim’s network operates across multiple jurisdictions with minimal direct involvement from Pyongyang. The scale of North Korea’s crypto operations is staggering. Since 2017, estimates show that Pyongyang has stolen over $3 billion in cryptocurrency. These funds directly finance its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, fueling the regime’s military ambitions while evading traditional banking systems.

How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-solana-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Cynthia Lummis","Senator Cynthia Lummis believes 2025 will be a key year for Bitcoin, with the U.S. leading in digital assets under David Sacks. She proposes a Bitcoin reserve to protect against inflation and increase the dollar value. And believes the most pro digital asset administration ever. The year 2025 is looking like a big moment for Bitcoin and digital assets, with strong administration supporting their future. Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming said that 2025 will be the year Bitcoin takes off. She believes the U.S. will become the world leader in digital assets and financial innovation. The Appointment of David Sacks as “Crypto Czar” Announcements comes with the appointment of David Sacks as the “Crypto Czar. ” David Sacks is a prominent venture capitalist and one of the early PayPal executives with deep knowledge and understanding of the tech world. Sacks has advocated for Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and many in the crypto community see him as a strong figure who can help shape policies that the growth of digital assets. Senator Lummis strongly supports Sacks’ leadership and believes that the U.S. will take a leading role in digital assets under his guidance. “ Under David Sacks’ leadership, the U.S. is primed to lead the world in digital assets and financial innovation,” said Lummis. Michael Saylor also supports this vision. He shares Lummis’ excitement, saying, “Under David Sacks’ leadership, the U.S. will not only lead the world in digital assets but also set the stage for financial innovation like we’ve never seen before.” Saylor’s endorsement of Sacks shows that many influential figures in the crypto community believe that this leadership is the key to true potential of digital assets in the U.S. Lummis’ Vision on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve One of Lummis’ bold proposals is the idea of a “strategic Bitcoin reserve” and mentions ” My Strategic Reserve.” This would involve the U.S. government acquiring and holding Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves, similar to how the country holds gold today. Lummis believes that Bitcoin can serve as a store of value that will protect the U.S. from inflation, strengthen the U.S. dollar, and improve the country’s financial health. She said, “I look forward to working closely with David Sacks to pass comprehensive digital asset legislation and my strategic Bitcoin reserve.” If adopted, this idea could change how the U.S. approaches its financial reserves and set an example for other countries to follow. The strategic Bitcoin reserve is not just a theoretical idea Lummis has suggested that the U.S. could use existing gold certificates to purchase Bitcoin without affecting the balance sheet. This could save billions of dollars and make the country’s financial system more resilient. With the right leadership and support, such a proposal could be a game changer for the global economy. The idea of the U.S. government formally adopting Bitcoin into its financial strategy would greatly increase the cryptocurrency market. Some states in the U.S., like Wisconsin and Michigan, have already begun experimenting with crypto in their investment portfolios. However, if the federal government takes action and incorporates Bitcoin into its reserves, it could open the doors for even more institutional investors and major players in the global financial markets. 2025 holds much promise for Bitcoin and digital assets. With leaders like Senator Cynthia Lummis, David Sacks, and Michael Saylor working together, the U.S. is on track to become the global leader in digital assets and financial innovation.

37774332,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99016,1734475437,"European Lawmaker Pushes For National Bitcoin Reserve, Cites El Salvador’s Resounding Success","Sarah Knafo, a French magistrate and a member of the European Parliament since June, has called on the European Union to copy President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve while rejecting the proposed adoption of the digital euro — a central bank-backed digital currency currently being developed by the European Central bank. Her push for a national Bitcoin reserve comes amid a historic market upsurge that has propelled the world’s largest crypto by market capitalization to new heights in recent weeks, with BTC today marking a new record high above $108,000. No To Digital Euro, Yes To Strategic BTC Reserve In a speech before the European parliament, Sarah Knafo urged European lawmakers to establish a strategic BTC reserve. Knafo declared, “It is time to protect our people from inflation and the poor economic choices of our states.” She then reiterated her statements in a post on X (aka Twitter). She also cautioned that the European Central Bank’s plans of launching a central bank digital currency could result in a “dystopian world” where transactions are monitored, and citizens are debunked for simple remarks on social media platforms. The lawmaker stated, “it is time to bet on freedom,” adding: “No to the digital euro, yes to a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Knafo further indicated that it’s time for the ECB to stop “totalitarian temptations” by urging a shift from regulatory overreach in crypto to adopting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. She pointed out that Europe has adopted a different approach to crypto. While the U.S. mulls a strategic, national stockpile of the top cryptocurrency, local regulators in Europe have been mostly focused on regulation, taxation, and suppressing innovation. Knafo highlighted the outstanding success of El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele made the unpopular decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in late 2021. Bukele was harshly criticized by U.S. politicians, the World Bank, and the IMF for the move. Nonetheless, the Latin American nation’s Bitcoin experiment has paid off handsomely , garnering over $300 million in unrealized profits so far. Calls To Stockpile Bitcoin Gain Traction Around The World Knafo’s speech comes as the U.S. stance toward Bitcoin undergoes massive changes following Donald Trump’s win against Kamala Harris last month. Trump and his allies have frequently voiced their support behind legislation to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve and will soon be well-positioned to make that a reality. Several U.S. lawmakers have made pushes to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Binance ex-CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently forecasted the BTC reserve policy would be imitated globally. “This also has a knock-on effect on other countries in the world. If the U.S. is doing this, then every other country will have to do this,” he posited at the Bitcoin MENA conference last week. Notably, government officials in Brazil have already submitted legislation to realize that possibility, while a Japanese lawmaker named Satoshi put forth a formal request to his nation’s legislature last week to start a discussion about developing a national Bitcoin reserve for Japan.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/european-lawmaker-pushes-for-national-bitcoin-reserve-cites-el-salvadors-resounding-success/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37774289,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629327,1734475219,"If you ask Wall Street, Tesla is the new Nvidia","Tesla is Wall Street’s latest obsession, and it’s not hard to see why. The stock’s been on a tear, climbing 40% since the U.S. presidential election. At $476.73, Tesla’s market cap now sits at a jaw-dropping $1.53 trillion. Compare that to Nvidia—last year’s golden child of growth stocks—sitting at $129.92 with a market cap of $318 billion. Analysts aren’t missing a beat. Tesla and Nvidia are two sides of the same coin: both are fueled by a tech future that seems unstoppable. Tesla has cars and autonomous tech; Nvidia has chips and AI infrastructure. One builds the machine, the other runs the software. Yet while Nvidia’s growth is starting to cool, Tesla’s numbers keep pulling investors in. Tesla’s 52-week range speaks volumes: it’s climbed from $138.80 all the way to $483.99 this year. Nvidia has moved between $47.32 and $152.89, a solid performance but far from Tesla’s high-octane climb. Why Wall Street’s watching Tesla like it watched Nvidia Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, says she sees Tesla hitting $2,600 by 2029, driven by what she calls “unmatched growth” in profits and revenues. If Wood’s predictions play out, Tesla could hit an enterprise value of $8.2 trillion in just five years. That makes Nvidia’s peak look tame by comparison. Investors are biting. The excitement is Tesla’s move toward AI-powered autonomous driving. It’s no secret Tesla isn’t just an electric car company anymore. Self-driving software and its robotaxi ambitions have Wall Street betting on a future Tesla that doesn’t just sell cars—it sells rides, powered by AI. Tesla’s strategy echoes Nvidia’s dominance during the AI boom. Nvidia’s chips became essential to generative AI development, fueling companies like OpenAI and driving profits to record highs. Tesla’s AI, on the other hand, lives on the roads. If it perfects autonomous driving, its software will become as essential as Nvidia’s chips. But there’s a catch. Tesla trades at a staggering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 162. Nvidia’s ratio? A much more palatable 51.14. That makes Tesla a high-risk, high-reward bet. Goldman Sachs recently pointed this out, cautioning that Tesla’s valuation may be running ahead of its earnings. Nvidia’s growth is slowing, Tesla’s just getting started Nvidia is still the face of AI infrastructure, but the cracks are showing. After growing revenue by over 200% in recent quarters, analysts now expect Nvidia’s growth to slow to around 70%. Still impressive, but a clear sign that the AI boom is leveling out. Nvidia’s reliance on a handful of mega clients—like cloud giants and AI startups—has some investors worried. Tesla, meanwhile, is all momentum. The market sees a company that’s just scratching the surface of its AI potential. Self-driving cars are Tesla’s big bet. The trading data backs this up. Tesla has been gaining traction as one of Wall Street’s most traded stocks. Nvidia still holds the crown, with 197 million shares traded on December 17 compared to Tesla’s 108 million. Investors go all in on US stocks The bullish sentiment on Tesla is part of a broader trend. Bank of America’s Global Fund Manager Survey shows investors are dumping cash and going all in on equities. Cash allocations hit their lowest point since 2001, falling from 4.3% to 3.9%. That’s a sign investors are chasing gains and aren’t interested in sitting on the sidelines. Michael Hartnett, a strategist at Bank of America, called the mood “super-bullish.” Tesla’s surge, fueled by its AI story, is a perfect fit for this environment. Wall Street sees a growth machine, and it’s hungry for more. Interest rate cuts are adding fuel to the fire. Traders expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, making stocks even more attractive. The S&P 500 is on track to close 2024 up more than 26%, far beyond anyone’s expectations. Analysts now predict another 10% climb next year, with growth stocks like Tesla leading the way. Nvidia played that role in 2023. Now Tesla’s taking the baton.

After reaching an all-time high (ATH) on November 22, Solana has experienced a 23% retracement, testing investor confidence. However, analysts remain optimistic, with many expecting a significant upward move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Forming A Symmetrical Pattern – Key Resistance At $4,100 Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis highlighting Solana’s strong potential. According to Jelle, the monthly chart for SOL is primed for an “absolute monster run,” indicating that the current consolidation phase may be laying the groundwork for a powerful breakout. This view aligns with the broader sentiment that Solana’s resilience above $210 could act as a springboard for the next phase of its rally. As one of the leading altcoins in the crypto market, Solana has attracted attention for its robust performance and potential to lead the next leg of the bull market. With the price now consolidating after a sharp pullback, all eyes are on SOL’s ability to maintain its critical support and reclaim momentum. Whether Solana can deliver on its bullish promise will be a key focus for traders and investors alike in the coming weeks. Solana Holds Key Demand Solana is currently trading above a critical level for this cycle—the $210 mark. This price point, which previously acted as a significant resistance, has now flipped into a vital support level, setting the stage for Solana’s next potential rally. The importance of this level cannot be overstated, as it represents a key area where buyers are stepping in to defend SOL’s bullish momentum. Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a compelling technical analysis on X, emphasizing Solana’s strong outlook. According to Jelle, Solana’s monthly chart is primed for what he described as an “absolute monster run.” His analysis highlights how SOL’s price is now testing its 2021 all-time high (ATH) as support, a critical juncture that could determine its trajectory in the weeks to come. Jelle’s simple yet powerful chart indicates that if Solana manages to push decisively above the $210 level, it will confirm the strength of this support and potentially trigger a massive bull run. This rally could result in impressive gains for SOL, positioning it as a standout performer in the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks ATH Pushing Back Into Price Discovery – BTC To $130K? For now, all eyes are on Solana’s ability to sustain its momentum and break higher. As it consolidates above this essential level, traders and investors are closely monitoring its next moves, anticipating the possibility of a historic price surge. Price Action Suggests A Big Move Soon Solana is trading at $221, maintaining its strength above the critical $210 support level. This resilience has bolstered confidence among investors, as SOL’s price action aligns bullishly across all time frames. Solana is gearing up for a major rally, but it must first overcome the $245 resistance level to confirm the uptrend. Market dynamics indicate that SOL is in a prime position for upward momentum. Unlike other assets that may show signs of hesitation or potential consolidation, Solana exhibits a well-defined price structure that strongly favors a breakout. The lack of bearish signals further solidifies this outlook, as there is little indication of an imminent correction or prolonged sideways trading.

Should the price of BTC plunge, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes the firm may not face bankruptcy, stating it will only happen “if an asteroid hits Earth.” The company continues to profit, with a 72.4% yield this year and a stock surge of 540% in 2024. Led by Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy, following a recent 15,350 BTC purchase, raised its Bitcoin treasury to a total of 439,000 BTC, which accounts for over 2% of BTC’s total supply. With the firm’s growing position, there are now rising concerns that MicroStrategy could be forced to go bankrupt and liquidate its holdings should Bitcoin suffer a major drop. Ki Young Ju’s perspective Ki Young Ju explained that MicroStrategy could only face bankruptcy if Bitcoin’s price falls to $16,500. He pointed out that the company is holding around $46 billion worth of Bitcoin, but there is only $7 billion of debt. The CryptoQuant CEO also mentioned that Bitcoin has never dropped below $30,000 for long-term holders like they never felt that way unless there would be an unexpected drop. He stated, “MicroStrategy only goes bankrupt if an asteroid hits Earth,” not bothering about a Bitcoin crash to $16,000. MicroStrategy only goes bankrupt if an asteroid hits Earth.

On the other hand, critics like Peter Schiff believe MicroStrategy could go bankrupt if Bitcoin crashes, as the company’s huge Bitcoin holdings are a risky gamble. He thinks a market downturn could cause major financial problems. Despite this, MicroStrategy is still aggressively buying more Bitcoin. Recently, it bought 15,350 BTC , bringing its total holdings to 439,000 BTC, worth about $27.1 billion at an average price of $61,725 per Bitcoin.

Today, December 18, 2024, IntoTheBlock revealed that the large transaction volume of SHIB has skyrocketed by 238.58% in the past 24 hours. Source: IntoTheBlock Shiba Inu (SHIB) Bearish Outlook This notable volume appeared as SHIB began experiencing selling pressure and the formation of a bearish price action pattern near a resistance level. However, the meme coin’s bearish outlook emerged during a period when major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP witnessed notable upside rallies. SHIB Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, SHIB has formed a bearish inverted cup and handle price action pattern on the daily time frame and is currently on the verge of a breakdown. However, this is a resistance level where the meme coin has formed this price action pattern. Source: Trading View Based on historical price momentum, if SHIB breaks down from the bearish pattern and closes a daily candle below the $0.0000258 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 20% to reach the $0.0000206 level in the coming days. However, it has been more than a month since SHIB has experienced any significant price gain or drop; it seems to be in continuous price consolidation. But the recent price action indicates potential downside momentum, selling pressure, and a price decline in the coming days. On the positive side, SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 55, indicating that it is still below the overbought area. This technical indicator suggests that the asset has enough room to soar in the coming days.

While Dogwifhat (WIF) stalls after its Robinhood-fueled rise and CHEEMS bounces back on Binance Smart Chain, BTFD Coin (BTFD) steals the show. Its presale is red-hot, raising over $4.1 million, and its Beta P2E game is now live! This isn’t just another token—it’s a movement for dip-hunters looking for the ultimate comeback. Ready to jump in? Let’s break down why BTFD Coin leads the Best Meme Coins to Buy in December 2024, and why WIF and CHEEMS shouldn’t be ignored. BTFD Coin: The Dip of a Lifetime—Play Now, Earn Later Picture this: You’re riding shotgun with the Bulls Squad, stacking tokens at dip prices before the rocket takes off. That’s what BTFD Coin is all about. Forget waiting for the market to hand you an opportunity—BTFD brings the dip to your doorstep. The buzz is real. BTFD Coin is in Stage 12 of its presale, with tokens selling at $0.00013. Here’s the twist: when the presale ends, the price skyrockets to $0.0006. Do the math, and it’s obvious why investors are charging in. Over 56 billion tokens have already been scooped up by 5,700 bulls, pushing the total raised to a jaw-dropping $4.1 million. If that’s not enough to hype you up, check this out: The BTFD Beta P2E game is now live! Dive in, explore levels, and dominate challenges—this beta version is just a warm-up for what’s coming. While rewards aren’t rolling in yet, the full launch promises to turn in-game victories into real BTFD tokens. Now let’s talk money. If you throw $850 into BTFD right now, you’ll grab around 6.54 million tokens. When the coin lists at $0.0006, that investment could balloon to $3,924. A small dip, big rip. Oh, and if you’ve got friends who love crypto, BTFD’s Referral Programme is straight fire. Share your code, make the top 20 leaderboards, and pocket 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens at month’s end. You’ll earn while building the squad. Dogwifhat (WIF): A Solana Favourite Hits Pause Dogwifhat (WIF) exploded into the limelight this year, riding the Solana wave to meme coin stardom. After its Robinhood listing pushed WIF to a high of $3.65, the market’s enthusiasm started to wane. As of now, WIF has pulled back to $2.76, leaving investors wondering: Is this just a pit stop or a red flag? The Solana-based token still holds its own with a massive $2.75 billion market cap, making it a heavyweight in the meme sector. Analysts are split—some say WIF will rebound to $3.50 by the year’s end, while others see it struggling to maintain momentum. Long-term believers are even throwing around predictions of $7-$12.50 by 2030. Here’s the thing: WIF thrives on community and sentiment. If Solana’s ecosystem keeps pumping, WIF could easily reawaken. But right now, it’s less about hype and more about holding on for dear life. Cheems (CHEEMS): A Small Player Making Big Moves Cheems might not have the flash of WIF or the presale hype of BTFD, but it’s quietly carving out its niche on the BNB Smart Chain. Trading at just $0.00000092, CHEEMS has seen a healthy 8.29% uptick recently, showing it’s got a fight left in it. With a market cap of $163.25 million and a circulating supply of 187.5 trillion tokens, CHEEMS is one of those underdogs that could surprise the market. It’s cheap, accessible, and has enough traction to catch the attention of meme coin enthusiasts looking for the next micro-cap play. But let’s not sugarcoat it: CHEEMS is high risk. Like most meme tokens, its price swings can be wild, and its future depends heavily on whether its community can rally behind it. For investors with an appetite for volatility, CHEEMS might just deliver. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Don’t Miss the Dip Ready to grab your share of BTFD before the next stage price hike? Here’s how: Set up your bullish wallet: Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet and protect your private key. Load up with BNB or ETH: Fund your wallet to make your purchase. Connect your wallet: Head to the official BTFD site and connect your wallet. Buy BTFD: Choose BNB, ETH, or USDT, enter your amount, and confirm the transaction. Claim your BTFD: Tokens will be available once the presale ends. Stay in the loop: Stake tokens, play the P2E game, and ride the bull run to glory. Don’t Miss the Best Meme Coins to Buy in December 2024 If you’re hunting for meme coins with serious potential this month, BTFD Coin stands out as the clear frontrunner. Its presale has already pulled in $4.1 million, the P2E Beta game is live, and staking rewards promise massive growth for early bulls. This is a no-brainer for anyone looking to cash in on the next big meme token. Dogwifhat (WIF) remains a favourite in the Solana ecosystem, but its recent dip to $2.76 signals caution. Meanwhile, CHEEMS offers a low-risk entry for those willing to roll the dice on the Binance Smart Chain. If you’re ready to stop missing the dips and start riding the bull, BTFD Coin is your ticket. Don’t wait—head to the presale now and make your move before the price jumps! The dip’s here. Are you grabbing it?

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XYZVerse (XYZ) poised to rival XRP and Cardano (ADA) at its targeted $0.1 price. Table of Contents The all-sports meme token to star Cardano XRP Conclusion As the crypto market surges to unprecedented levels, XYZVerse (XYZ) is set to disrupt the landscape. This new contender has the potential to outpace established giants, capturing the attention of investors looking for significant returns. XYZVerse is a meme coin seeking to unite fans of football, basketball, MMA, and more. Combining meme culture with sports enthusiasm, it aims for remarkable growth by fostering community engagement, offering early adopters the chance to join from the ground up. The all-sports meme token to star XYZVerse is the first all-sports meme coin, aiming to unite fans of football, basketball, MMA, esports, and more within a single, thriving ecosystem. By blending the viral appeal of meme culture and the passion of sports fandom, XYZVerse will offer an engaging and community-driven platform that sets it apart from the competition. XYZVerse’s presale began at $0.0001 and has already surged to $0.001333 — an impressive milestone. With a listing target of $0.1, early investors still stand to gain up to 7,402% returns as the token progresses toward its final stages. This bullish projection positions XYZVerse as a strong rival to XRP and Cardano, offering a high-reward opportunity for those seeking massive gains in the current bull market. XYZVerse is built for longevity. Key features include: Robust tokenomics: 15% allocated to liquidity for market stability and 10% reserved for community rewards, including airdrops and bonuses. Deflationary model: A planned burn of 17.13% of tokens will reduce supply over time, increasing scarcity and driving long-term value. Mass adoption strategy: XYZVerse will bridge traditional sports fans with the crypto world through celebrity partnerships and referral incentives to expand its community. While XRP and Cardano remain solid players, their growth may be tempered as the market matures. XYZVerse, on the other hand, combines massive upside potential with a fresh niche approach that resonates with a broad audience of sports enthusiasts and meme coin investors. Interested investors can grab XYZ tokens via the presale. You might also like: ETH and ADA may repeat history, XYZ could be the dark horse Cardano The Cardano price has surged by 189.82% over the past six months and 56.78% in the last month. ADA is currently trading between $0.95 and $1.18. The nearest resistance level stands at $1.35, a point where selling pressure might increase. If the price breaks through this level, the next resistance is at $1.63. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.78, providing a potential floor if prices decline. The second support level sits at $0.50, which could be crucial in preventing further losses. ADA’s 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $1.08 and $1.09 respectively, suggesting a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 62.08, approaching overbought territory. The Stochastic oscillator reads 84.68, which may indicate the asset is overbought and could face a price correction. A MACD level of 0.0036 points to a modest bullish trend. XRP In the past month, XRP has surged by over 150%. Over the last six months, the cryptocurrency has skyrocketed more than 400%, showcasing robust growth. XRP remains in a strong position, trading within the $2.03 to $2.73 range. XRP is nearing its nearest resistance level at $3.02. A successful break above this point could propel the coin toward the second resistance at $3.73, representing a potential gain of around 37% from its current range. On the downside, the nearest support level sits at $1.61. Falling to this point would mean a decrease of approximately 21%, but strong support could prevent significant losses. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 69.51, and the Stochastic oscillator reads 71.62, both indicating that XRP is approaching overbought territory but still has room for growth. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days are closely aligned around $2.40, providing a solid foundation. With a MACD level of 0.0150 pointing to bullishness, XRP may continue its upward trajectory and possibly surpass key resistance levels in the near future. Conclusion While ADA and XRP show promise, XYZVerse’s unique sports meme coin aims for massive growth, potentially outperforming others in the current bull market.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-loves-bitcoin-muskbtc-solana-memecoin-to-explode-13000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37773224,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629293,1734472803,Bitcoin ETFs overtake Gold ETFs in US market with rapid 11-month growth,"US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) now have more assets under management (AUM) than Gold ETFs. Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33 Research, posted the milestone, noting the Bitcoin ETFs’ rapid growth. Lunde pointed out that the crypto products have a combined value of approximately $129.25 billion, while the precious metal investment vehicles have assets of $128 billion. Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also confirmed the development while providing more context about the milestone. According to him, the Bitcoin ETFs’ AUM cuts across all categories, including spot, futures, and leveraged ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs flip Gold ETFs (Source: K33 Research) However, the Gold ETF still has a higher AUM than the spot Bitcoin ETFs, at $125 billion to $120 billion. Still, the expert noted the small gap between the two, highlighting the performance of Bitcoin ETFs in such a short period. Compared to Gold ETFs, which have been around for more than 20 years, Bitcoin ETFs launched only 11 months ago. Over those 11 months, the year-to-date flow into spot Bitcoin ETFs has surpassed 500,000 Bitcoin, enabling the products to absorb over 2.5% of all BTC circulating supply since their launch. Unsurprisingly, the 12 US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs are now the largest holders of Bitcoin combined. They hold over 1.1 million BTC, more than the BTC in the Satoshi Nakamoto wallet. Bitcoin ETFs now account for 1% of all ETF assets Meanwhile, the performance of Bitcoin ETFs has also enabled the flagship asset to make up 1% of all US ETFs . Combined, all US ETFs have around $10 trillion in AUM. The spot Bitcoin ETFs alone have around $120 billion, meaning Bitcoin now accounts for around 1% of that AUM. This further highlights how the spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock IBIT, have shattered all the records set by every ETF launched in the past decade. According to ETF Store president Nate Geraci, BlackRock IBIT is the most successful ETF launch since 2014, emerging number one out of approximately 2,850 ETFs launched within that period. Many now expect that 2025 will be the year that spot Bitcoin ETFs will finally flip Gold ETFs in value. With the products seeing consecutive days of around half a billion in inflows, it is only a matter of time before they finally overtake gold-based investment products. Expert expects more ETFs in 2025 Meanwhile, ETF expert James Seyffart has predicted a wave of spot crypto ETFs in 2025. In his recent outlook, the Bloomberg senior analyst believes that the SEC will approve several crypto ETFs next year, starting with the Bitcoin and Ether combo ETFs. Several issuers have already filed applications for this, and it is expected to be easy to approve since both products already have spot ETFs listed. The Bloomberg senior analyst further said Litecoin ETFs might happen sooner than other digital assets because it is a fork of Bitcoin and has already been considered a commodity. In his view, ETFs for altcoins such as Solana and XRP might have to wait for some time, given the current legal issues surrounding the assets. He wrote: “Both Solana and XRP ETFs will have to wait until the new SEC administration takes control before being seriously considered. Even then, complex legal issues around these tokens and others relating to their status as securities may need to be resolved.” While acknowledging that Litecoin and HBAR, which both have pending applications for ETFs, stand a better chance of getting approval presently as the SEC has not classified any of them as securities, the expert questioned whether sufficient demand for the assets was sufficient to justify their ETFs.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI looks to outpace Solana and Polkadot with potential 5,000x returns. Table of Contents Solana: Scalability and adoption at the core Polkadot’s cross-chain technology and role in blockchain Lightchain AI: The $0.003 token with high growth potential Features to give Lightchain AI an edge over Solana and Polkadot How market trends could drive 5,000x returns Lightchain AI among the best bets for massive gains The crypto market is always on the hunt for the next big breakout token. In past cycles, coins like Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) captured the spotlight with their innovations and exponential growth, providing massive returns for early investors. Lightchain AI is emerging as a top contender for the next wave of massive gains, priced at $0.003 in its presale. Lightchain AI will combine cutting-edge blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, to offer features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). This potentially transformative technology set it apart in an increasingly competitive market. With a well-defined roadmap, including its testnet launch in January 2025 and mainnet debut in March 2025, Lightchain AI is poised for massive growth. Experts believe it could deliver 5,000x returns, outperforming top-tier projects like Solana and Polkadot. Solana: Scalability and adoption at the core Solana’s rapid rise in the blockchain space can be attributed to its emphasis on scalability and speed. Utilizing its unique Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism, Solana delivers exceptionally fast transactions and low fees, making it a top choice for developers and users alike. Its ecosystem has expanded rapidly, attracting significant projects across decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming. By addressing blockchain’s scalability challenges, Solana has secured a substantial market share. Its infrastructure supports thousands of transactions per second, enabling smooth user experiences for applications with high demand. However, Solana’s reliance on traditional blockchain architectures means it falls short in addressing the growing need for AI integration — a demand that Lightchain AI is uniquely equipped to meet. Polkadot’s cross-chain technology and role in blockchain Polkadot distinguishes itself with its approach to interoperability. Designed to connect diverse blockchain networks, Polkadot’s relay chain architecture facilitates seamless communication between independent blockchains. This cross-chain functionality is critical for fostering a unified blockchain ecosystem, positioning Polkadot as an essential solution for projects seeking to leverage interoperability. Although Polkadot excels in providing robust infrastructure for interconnecting blockchains, its focus remains on foundational architecture rather than application-specific advancements. As industries increasingly adopt AI-driven technologies, Polkadot’s lack of specialized AI capabilities may limit its attractiveness compared to platforms like Lightchain AI. You might also like: Dogecoin vs Ripple: December’s best buy, and how each compares to Lightchain AI Lightchain AI: The $0.003 token with high growth potential Lightchain AI is redefining blockchain technology by placing artificial intelligence at the forefront of its design. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism will incentivize nodes to perform meaningful AI computations, replacing traditional validation processes with tasks such as model training and optimization. This dual-purpose approach will ensure network security while driving advancements in AI innovation. The introduction of the AIVM will further amplify Lightchain AI’s functionality, offering a dedicated computational layer for executing AI tasks with exceptional efficiency. By providing a scalable, secure, and developer-friendly platform, Lightchain AI is positioned to gain widespread adoption in industries such as healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. With a presale price of $0.003, Lightchain AI represents a unique opportunity for early investors to access a high-potential asset at an entry point that is affordable and promising. Features to give Lightchain AI an edge over Solana and Polkadot While Solana and Polkadot are established players with unique strengths, Lightchain AI’s technology set it apart in the race for blockchain dominance: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Unlike Solana’s PoH and Polkadot’s Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS), PoI will reward nodes for performing AI-specific tasks, aligning network security with real-world utility. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): The AIVM will enable seamless execution of AI workloads, positioning Lightchain AI as the go-to platform for decentralized AI applications. Decentralized governance: Lightchain AI’s community-driven governance model will ensure transparency and inclusivity, empowering token holders to shape the platform’s evolution. Tokenomics and sustainability: With staking rewards, premium feature access, and deflationary mechanisms, Lightchain AI’s tokenomics will create long-term value for investors. These features make Lightchain AI a future-proof platform capable of outperforming even established blockchain projects. How market trends could drive 5,000x returns The growing intersection of blockchain and AI is a key market trend driving interest in platforms like Lightchain AI. The global AI market is expected to surpass $190 billion by 2025, and Lightchain AI’s integration of AI-specific features positions it to capture a significant share of this market. Adoption metrics also favor Lightchain AI. The platform’s incentives for developers and businesses to contribute AI workloads will foster a thriving ecosystem, while its partnerships and integrations will expand its reach across industries. As Lightchain AI progresses through its roadmap milestones, its value proposition will become increasingly evident, driving demand and potentially achieving the 5,000x returns experts predict. Lightchain AI among the best bets for massive gains While Solana and Polkadot are formidable contenders, Lightchain AI’s focus on AI integration gives it a distinct edge. Its PoI consensus mechanism and AIVM are tailor-made for addressing real-world challenges, from scalable AI computations to decentralized governance. By combining this with strong tokenomics and a transparent roadmap, Lightchain AI offers a more compelling investment case. Priced at $0.003 during its presale, Lightchain AI presents a significant opportunity for investors seeking exponential returns. As the platform moves closer to its testnet and mainnet launches in 2025, its potential to outperform established players like Solana and Polkadot becomes increasingly apparent.

This new set of rules aims to create consistent crypto regulations across the European Union (EU) and will take effect on December 30, 2024. However, some member states still need to pass their laws and fully enforce MiCA in their areas. Details of the ESMA Report ESMA’s report highlights three key areas: reverse solicitation, draft technical standards for preventing market abuse, and guidance on when crypto-assets can be a financial instrument. These guidelines aim to tackle important issues and ensure that MiCA is applied consistently across all 27 EU member countries. The section on reverse solicitation explains when service providers can connect with EU customers without actively promoting their services. This helps close regulatory gaps and protect consumers. ESMA also introduced draft technical standards to improve measures against market abuse in the crypto sector. These standards aim to stop insider trading, market manipulation, and other illegal activities that could shake investor trust. Additionally, ESMA pointed out that some crypto-assets might be classified as financial instruments based on their specific features. This classification is important because it decides if these assets are governed by MiCA or other financial rules in the EU. Meanwhile, the success of these rules depends on how ready each member state is to adopt them into their laws. ESMA and its MiCA Crypto Regulations Target The Final Report addresses several critical areas related to crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), focusing on enhancing transparency, facilitating fair competition, and safeguarding investor interests. Some critical proposals include specifications on authorization requirements, notification procedures assessment of acquisitions, and complaint handling. On authorization requirements, the ESMA listed the information required for CASP authorization. The authority aims to establish stringent criteria, ensuring the credibility and reliability of service providers in the crypto space. It also mandated that financial entities intending to offer crypto-asset services provide specific information as part of their notification process. This enables regulatory oversight and compliance with established standards. MiCA’s Stablecoin Regulation MiCA, which was passed into law in May 2023, represents a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets within the European Economic Area (EEA). Recall that MiCA stablecoin regulation came into force in June 2024. This regulation imposed stringent requirements on fiat-backed stablecoins, with reserves held in custody by a third party and segregated by other assets. The European Banking Authorities (EBA) now oversees token regulations, taking over from national authorities. Stablecoin issuers within the EU must now hold licenses as credit institutions or Electronic Money Institutions under the MiCA framework.

SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw Allegedly Not Renominated According to a December 17 X post by Terrett, a Senate aide disclosed that the Senate Banking Committee’s Wednesday meeting to re-up Crenshaw for her position at the government agency has been cancelled. BREAKING: A Senate aide has just informed me that tomorrow’s Senate Banking Committee scheduled markup vote on @SECGov Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has been canceled. She will not be renominated to her position. — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 17, 2024 According to the committee’s website, the December 18 executive session to consider nominations has officially been cancelled. News of the meeting’s cancellation comes just days after Punchbowl News reported that Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown (D-OH) had scheduled the executive session in hopes of renominating Crenshaw before Democrats officially become the minority party. Brown, who has expressed distaste over digital assets, was ousted by crypto-friendly blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno last month and is slated to leave Congress on January 3. Crenshaw’s renomination meeting was supposed to take place on December 11, though Brown delayed the executive session likely due to political gridlock between Democrats and Republicans. Crenshaw’s supposed exit from the government agency follows on the heels of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation from the regulator ahead of Trump’s upcoming presidency. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler wrote in a recent farewell press release . “It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.” Donald Trump’s Plan For Regulating The Blockchain Sector With Gensler, Crenshaw, and fellow SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga all seemingly on the outs, Trump and his incoming unified government will have more say than ever over the direction of cryptocurrency regulations in the United States. The former reality television, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has long been a proponent of the digital asset sector . In addition to firing Gensler, the New York-born businessman is slated to introduce a crypto-friendly regulatory framework . “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” Trump is expected to nominate former SEC commissioner Paul Atikins to spearhead the regulating body – though he will have to be approved by the Senate.

Table of Contents The rise of XYZVerse: Sports meets meme culture Ethereum Cardano Conclusion As the crypto market reaches new peaks, major altcoins signal the potential for significant gains, echoing past bull runs. Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) show strong momentum, capturing the attention of enthusiasts. Amidst these developments, an unexpected player emerges, intriguing investors with its unique approach. XYZVerse (XYZ) is an all-sport meme coin on a mission to unite fans across various sports within its ecosystem. Aiming to outperform previous tokens, it blends meme culture with sports enthusiasm, creating a unique, community-driven platform. The rise of XYZVerse: Sports meets meme culture XYZVerse, the first all-sport meme coin, is redefining what community-driven tokens can achieve. Seeking to unite fans across football, basketball, MMA, esports, and more, XYZ combines the viral appeal of meme coins with the passion of sports fandom. This unique approach sets it apart from typical meme tokens and positions it as a potential breakout player in the current bull market. The XYZVerse presale is already turning heads with its price movement: Launch price: $0.0001 Current stage: $0.001333 (already a 1,200% gain) Final target: $0.1 With a structured, multi-stage presale strategy, XYZ offers investors the opportunity for gains of up to 7,402% by the token generation event. Why XYZ could outperform ETH and ADA While Ethereum and Cardano remain top market players, their growth may be steady rather than sensational.

With its sports-themed approach, viral potential, and strategic presale momentum, XYZ could be the unexpected star of this market rally. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale for potentially massive gains. Ethereum Ethereum continues to demonstrate resilience and steady growth. Over the past month, ETH surged 30.57%, while its 6-month performance shows a 15.86% increase. In the past week, ETH exhibited an 8.86% upward movement, signaling relative stability. Currently, ETH trades between $3,648 and $4,100, sitting above both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $3,948.70 and $3,907.55 respectively. These metrics point to a continuation of the positive trend. However, caution is warranted as the RSI at 67.14 and Stochastic at 91.32 indicate overbought conditions, suggesting a potential short-term correction. If momentum persists, ETH could test its nearest resistance at $4,318, with a breakout paving the way for a climb to $4,807, a potential 16% increase. Should a pullback occur, support lies at $3,340 and more critically at $2,852. You might also like: Dogecoin and Shiba Inu backers look to XYZVerse for its unmatched 99x growth potential Cardano Cardano has delivered remarkable gains, with a 189.82% increase in the past six months and 50.78% over the last month. Currently, ADA is trading between $0.95 and $1.18. The next key resistance stands at $1.35, where selling pressure may emerge. A breakout above this could push ADA towards $1.64, a significant milestone. On the downside, support levels at $0.78 and $0.50 act as safety nets if the price retraces. The 10-day and 100-day SMAs are closely aligned at $1.08 and $1.09, suggesting consolidation. Meanwhile, the RSI at 62.08 and Stochastic at 84.68 signal overbought territory, indicating a possible correction. The MACD remains modestly bullish at 0.0036, hinting at continued upward momentum with caution. Conclusion While Ethereum and Cardano show strong potential to repeat history with significant breakouts, their growth may be measured and gradual. XYZVerse emerges as the dark horse, combining the viral energy of meme coins with the passionate engagement of sports fans. With a well-thought presale strategy and ambitious growth targets, XYZVerse offers investors a unique opportunity to secure early access to a project that could outperform market leaders.

Consensys is a well-known Ethereum infrastructure provider that developed Linea, a zero-knowledge rollup, in July 2023. Linea is the seventh largest rollup network, with $1 billion under its ecosystem, according to L2Beat . ENS founder and lead developer said they partnered with Linea to develop its network for two reasons. They believe that the values of both firms are aligning, and also, Linea’s speed is considerable. Rollup networks are a type of blockchain that enhances speedy transactions at an affordable cost. Rollups come in two major types: optimistic and zero-knowledge. Among them, zero-knowledge rollups are often considered superior by many due to their ability to secure proof and close transactions within minutes. Optimistic rollup, on the other hand, uses optimistic proofs, allowing transactions a seven-day period for any disputes before they finalize. It considers that proofs are optimistic, and nobody will dispute them. Other crypto players have chosen Optimism for their layer-2 networks Linea’s work for ENS won’t be its first project, but it is very significant. Linea is already developing a layer-2 network for blockchain wallet application Status . According to Nicolas Liochon , the Namechain team working on the Linea stack will ensure the Layer-2 protocol is strengthened and remains decentralized. We want to have multiple organizations contributing to Linea, and we work on having more organizations, too, as a way to make it more secure. So really, we want to have multiple teams so there’s no centralization point. ~ Nicolas Liochon The news of ENS partnering with Linea for its Layer-2 rollout follows announcements from other crypto powerhouses planning to launch their own Layer-2 networks. Notably, several major players have opted to build their networks using the Optimism OP Stack. Linea hints at releasing its token In a recent announcement, the Linea team said they plan to launch a Linea token. However, there was no clarity and concrete plans on how that token would be used in the Namechain ecosystem. ENS Web offers a simple and easily recognizable domain name service (DNS), often described as “the phone book for Web3.” ENS provides handles like parishilton.eth , which are easier to remember and type compared to numerical IP addresses. The project settled on Linea’s Zero-knowledge rollup because it needed a fast finality. The ENS name needs to be updated, and the chain reflected faster, within the smallest interval possible, ensuring the network remains decentralized and secure. This ruled out an optimistic rollup.

37772080,https://blockworks.co/news/bitwise-launches-solana-staking-etp-europe,1734471000,Bitwise launches solana staking ETP in Europe as US applications linger,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Crypto asset manager Bitwise has launched a solana staking ETP in Europe with the ticker BSOL, Lightspeed has learned exclusively. Solana staking firm Marinade will be Bitwise’s staking provider. The move comes less than a month after Bitwise signaled its plans to list a solana ETF in the US by registering a statutory trust in Delaware. Bitwise’s decision to build out its SOL staking infrastructure could also give it the capacity to offer staking rewards for its US spot SOL ETF. Current US applications all have staking rewards stripped out due to securities law concerns, but some are speculating that might change under a Paul Atkins-led SEC. Another US-based crypto asset manager made a similar move in recent months when VanEck began a SOL staking partnership with Kiln. Bitwise first offered a European solana ETP when it acquired London-based ETC Group and its ESOL product, which currently holds $24 million in assets under management, down from $27 million a month ago. Investors’ problem with ESOL is likely its lack of staking rewards, which have been quite lucrative for solana investors in recent months. BSOL has staking rewards baked in. Solana staking rewards come from SOL issuance, priority fees and MEV tips that users and the network pay out to validators who run the blockchain’s software. Validators pass these rewards onto stakers to compete for staked SOL. For stakers, the reward rate is around 8% annually, according to Solana Compass. This is more than double the average staking APY on Ethereum. To be clear, solana ETP issuers don’t pay this full amount. 21Shares’ solana staking ETP, the fifth-largest crypto ETP in Europe, pays 5.49%. Bitwise will pay 6.48%, according to a document shared with Blockworks, and it is using Marinade as its staking provider, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said. 21Shares also charges a 2.5% management fee, while BSOL will cost investors 0.85% per year. Again, none of the US solana ETFs would include staking rewards as currently constructed. But that order of things may not last. Bitwise’s staking provider Marinade hired New York-based banking executive Hadley Stern to be its chief commercial officer in September, perhaps to prepare for a rush of US institutions looking to access solana staking yield. It’s impossible to know exactly how the future might play out, but with VanEck and now Bitwise adding solana staking ETPs to their portfolios, something like this is plausible: Atkins comes to power, SOL staking rewards are deemed not to be securities, spot ETF issuers re-file with staking rewards attached, and firms use their European staking ETP infrastructure to offer the same products in the US. But I wouldn’t bank on that happening very soon. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said today he expects SOL ETFs to be approved in the US only after BTC and ETH combo, Litecoin, and HBAR products all have gotten the go-ahead. Updated Dec. 18, 2024 at 3:40 pm ET: Clarified that Solana’s staking rewards come from priority fees and MEV tips in addition to SOL issuance .

The leader of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) Christian Lindner questioned the German government for failing to adopt Bitcoin’s economic opportunities. He pointed out that key German leaders missed the chance to use Bitcoin for growth. His views were strongly supported by his party, the FDP, but some in the crypto community questioned why he spoke up so late. Germany’s FOMO Lindner’s comments criticize Germany for falling behind in crypto especially when compared to the U.S. He also criticized the leaders for failing to recognize Bitcoin as a valuable financial tool. He directly called out Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Minister of Economics Robert Habeck, and opposition leader Friedrich Merz for not acting on the opportunities of Bitcoin. “I have not heard from the Federal Chancellor, the Minister of Economics or the opposition leader that a new crypto-friendly policy is now being implemented in the United States,” Lindner stated. He highlighted that nations like the U.S. are advancing their crypto strategies, but Germany is falling behind. “The US will use the advantages that we could also have with Bitcoin, ” Lindner added, calling it a missed opportunity for the country’s economy. U.S. leads while Germany lags Lindner’s criticism comes as the U.S. takes bold steps toward embracing cryptocurrencies under Donald Trump’s leadership. Trump has promised to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” and proposed creating a national Bitcoin reserve, which supported the crypto industry on the whole. In contrast, Germany’s approach to Bitcoin has faced criticism. Earlier this year, the German government sold 50,000 BTC which was seized through legal cases, when the Bitcoin was valued at around $53,000. With Bitcoin now hitting a record of over $107,000, been said that Germany lost billions in Bitcoin profits. “Saxony sold Bitcoin worth billions at half the price,” Lindner pointed out and mentioned how wrong the decision was. Within the Free Democratic Party (FDP), Lindner’s support for Bitcoin has got strong backing. His colleague Frank Schäffler praised him on X post saying, “Christian Lindner supports Bitcoin in the Bundestag. Germany must seize this opportunity and not let the US take the lead. Finally!” Schäffler also suggested that Bitcoin should be included in the reserves of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Germany’s Bundesbank. As of the 2024 European elections, the party has pledged to support a “digital euro” while ensuring citizens’ privacy is protected. Reactions from the public Lindner’s speech received mixed responses from the German crypto community. Some praised him for bringing Bitcoin into parliamentary discussions, while others criticized him for speaking up too late. “The man had almost 4 years as finance minister to have the necessary debates, and now that there’s a fire, he notices? Bitcoin doesn’t need politicians. Politicians need Bitcoin.” someone mentioned in his tweet. Lindner warned that Germany risks falling behind like the US with crypto innovation. He urged leaders to recognize Bitcoin’s value, saying, “We cannot afford to ignore Bitcoin’s value any longer.

While Bitcoin focuses on digital gold and Monero leads in privacy, Qubetics aims to make crypto payments as simple as tapping your phone. By integrating real-world usability into a sleek, user-friendly wallet, Qubetics is solving the issues that have kept crypto from reaching its full potential. Currently priced at $0.0342 in Presale Phase 13, Qubetics has already raised $6.9 million and attracted 10,300 holders. With a projected 900% ROI post-launch, it’s the ultimate under-the-radar pick for December. Qubetics ($TICS): A Wallet That Makes Crypto Simple Again Crypto has always had a usability problem. For newcomers, it’s complicated, stressful, and full of risks. That’s where Qubetics comes in. This project is laser-focused on eliminating crypto’s friction points and making payments seamless, secure, and practical for real-world use.

If you’re searching for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Qubetics combines real-world usability with unbeatable growth potential. Bitcoin (BTC): Blue Sky Breakout as Trump Backs a Strategic Reserve Bitcoin (BTC) has been the talk of the town yet again, soaring to new heights after a powerful boost from Donald Trump. Trump’s bold statement about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve has added fuel to BTC’s upward trajectory, positioning it as a critical financial asset for the U.S. economy. Why does this matter? It’s simple: mainstream validation. As traditional institutions and governments acknowledge Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, investor confidence skyrockets. BTC isn’t just “digital gold” anymore—it’s a strategic asset that countries and corporations can no longer ignore. This rally isn’t just about politics, though. With Bitcoin’s supply capped at 21 million coins, its scarcity continues to drive demand. Combine that with growing institutional adoption and improved market sentiment, and it’s clear why BTC remains the king of crypto. Analysts predict this latest momentum could push Bitcoin past $110K in the coming months, setting it up for an even stronger 2025. Bitcoin’s dominance as the first and largest cryptocurrency ensures it’s a must-have for any portfolio. If you’re eyeing stability and long-term gains, BTC remains one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Monero (XMR): Riding the Santa Claus Rally with Privacy in Focus Monero (XMR) is making a comeback, and it’s all about privacy. As global concerns about financial surveillance grow, Monero has become the go-to cryptocurrency for users who value anonymity. Unlike Bitcoin, where transactions are traceable, Monero’s blockchain obscures transaction details, making it impossible to link payments back to users. What’s driving XMR’s surge this week? Analysts point to the ongoing Santa Claus Rally, a seasonal market trend where cryptos typically see significant price increases. Monero is riding this wave, boosted by rising demand for privacy coins in regions with heavy financial censorship or restrictions. Monero’s utility goes beyond hype. Whether it’s freelancers avoiding middlemen fees, businesses safeguarding sensitive payment data, or individuals seeking financial freedom, XMR provides a solution for anyone who wants to keep their money private. The recent surge in adoption among online merchants and privacy-conscious users has only added momentum to Monero’s rally. Analysts suggest that XMR could break through key resistance levels, solidifying its status as one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for both utility and price growth. Final Thoughts: The Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 If you’re looking for top crypto picks with strong upside potential, Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin (BTC), and Monero (XMR) are your best bets this week. Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, with Trump’s endorsement giving it a powerful boost as it enters “blue sky territory.” Monero is making waves as privacy coins gain momentum, riding the seasonal Santa Claus Rally and growing demand for anonymous payments. But Qubetics is the real dark horse here. By solving crypto’s biggest usability challenges with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet and smart payment tools, Qubetics is positioning itself as a game-changer. With $6.9 million raised, 350 million tokens sold, and a projected 900% ROI, Qubetics offers massive growth potential for early investors. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin (BTC), and Monero (XMR) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Don’t wait—these projects are primed for serious gains, and now’s your chance to get in before the market takes off.

Market observers had previously read between the lines of Coinbase's November nixing of wBTC. At the time, the exchange cited its listing standards as the reason for the move without elaborating. Last week, wBTC's issuer BiT Global filed a wide-ranging suit accusing Coinbase of improperly favoring its competing asset, cbBTC.    But in a 25-page response, Coinbase said the decision had everything to do with Justin Sun, the crypto billionaire and founder of the Tron blockchain, who is also accused of fraud and market manipulation in the United States. Sun became associated with wBTC via a partnership announced in August, according to Coinbase's filing.    ""Coinbase—like many others in the industry—had serious questions about whether BiT could be a reliable steward given Mr. Sun’s involvement,"" the exchange said.    Coinbase initiated a review of wBTC after the partnership's unveiling. It asked BiT questions about its ownership and Sun's suspected involvement, but the firm ""refused"" to answer them, Coinbase's filing said.    ""At the conclusion of its diligence, Coinbase concluded that Mr. Sun’s affiliation with—and potential control over—wBTC presented an unacceptable risk to its customers and the integrity of its exchange,"" the filing said.    Whether Sun has any involvement with BiT remains unclear. Lawyers for BiT Global did not immediately return a request for comment. Neither did representatives of Tron.    But the mere appearance of a connection was enough to spook Coinbase into cutting ties, it said.    ""No law supports BiT’s claims—and certainly none compels Coinbase to host an asset on its exchange that is now connected to an individual with a long history of alleged fraud and market manipulation,"" the filing said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/17/coinbase-says-it-nixed-w-btc-because-justin-sun-posed-unacceptable-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf3a4b498428603cbd222c483a799bcaad2f552d-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Collado cautioned that she advises her clients to only invest in crypto as much as they can afford to lose. Skepticism stems primarily from regulatory uncertainty and the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies. A Cerulli Associates survey conducted in April, when crypto prices were lower, found that 59% of financial advisors did not use crypto or planned to use it. Another 26% said they expected to use crypto in the future, while only 12% said they used crypto at the request of their clients. Less than 3% of advisors actively recommend crypto.

Advisors are warning their clients to limit crypto investments to 1% to 5% of their overall portfolio, depending on individual risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon. “Crypto can play a role, but it’s important to view it as a high-risk asset,” Lawrence said, adding: “For most investors, it should remain a small allocation within a diversified portfolio.” *This is not investment advice.

The network will distribute 10% of its supply in an event from December 19 onward. Fuel network has already taken the snapshot for its airdrop, and is preparing to distribute 10% of its supply, the team announced Tuesday. The L2 chain has opened its eligibility portal, where users can claim tokens from December 19 to January 19, 2025. The protocol will create a native FUEL token with a total supply of 10B, of which 1B will be set aside for the first airdrop event. Fuel Network has been active since July 2024, with airdrop mining activity long before the token generation announcement. The distribution will be just the first part of FUEL drops to the community. In total, 51% of the supply is set aside for the wider community and early contributors. Initiating Genesis Drop: 1 billion FUEL (10% of total supply), 200,000+ unique addresses. https://t.co/InHl5f95Io pic.twitter.com/kWZhQEiPCL — Fuel (@fuel_network) December 17, 2024 While most of the tokens will be for Fuel Network users from the months past, a part of the airdrop will be available for newcomers. The FUEL tokens can be earned by logging onto Legion, Impossible Finance, or Bitget. However, the airdrop will not be available for US residents or UK users, to avoid unfavorable regulations against the platform. The airdrop arrives at a time when several large-scale projects released and distributed their tokens. Those included Magic Eden (ME), Hyperliquid (HYPE), and PENGU, the native token of Pudgy Penguins. Fuel Network is one of the relatively late L2 chains to open up a new airdrop. The chain has lagged behind the L2 trend but may be coming just in time for a renewed bull market. Fuel Network prepares for steps to decentralized transactions Fuel Network will offer another Optimistic Rollup L2, similar to Optimism (OP), one of the leading Ethereum-scaling chains. The new network will have the cheapest possible transactions, with a capacity of over 600 transactions per second. The FUEL token will launch as an Ethereum ERC-20 token, but will also be available on the L2 chain. The chain will aim to simulate a Web2 experience with no noticeable fees. At this stage, even low-fee chains have increased their requirements, leading to a slow expansion of expenses for swaps, NFT activities, or other decentralized use cases. Fuel Network will continue to accept ETH for fees, but will also use its native FUEL token. The chain has to tackle one of the biggest problems of L2 chains, their centralized sequencer. This means that transactions are finalized by a centralized resource. Fuel Network will start by partially decentralizing proposers, while also planning to decentralize block-building. After the FUEL token genesis, Fuel Network will start staking and include validators for transactions. Fuel Network is still considered Stage 0, working toward more decentralized features. Fuel Network sets aside funds for the community The new FUEL token will start out with a relatively small free float during the airdrop event. The big question is whether FUEL would turn into another VC-backed token with long-term pressure on the market price. Fuel Network raised more than $88M over the course of several funding rounds. The bulk of the funds were raised from VC funds, including Bain Capital and Blockchain Capital. The rest were raised in a series of ICO and IDO events for the wider community. As a result, purchasers will receive more than 32% of the token supply. Early ecosystem backers will receive more than 15% of the supply. The wider circle of allocations will be relatively limited in comparison, but the community will receive more tokens over time. To mitigate the influence of the team and contributors, their tokens will remain locked for longer, while community tokens will be immediately unlocked. Additionally, locked tokens will not be available for staking, to avoid disproportionate rewards to the team. The most significant unlocks and FUEL inflows will come from the fund for ecosystem growth. FUEL arrives at a time when L2 chains have already established dominance for the top 5 networks. At the same time, a longer list of niche chains still manages to host apps and grow their own DeFi liquidity. Fuel Network already carries the Mira DEX, Swaylend lending protocol, the Griffy opinion and prediction market, as well as the Bako Safe multi-sig wallet.

In her video “Why Do I Hold XRP?”, she underlines the cryptocurrency’s potential to change finance. Many investors are watching XRP as a crypto market challenger due to Ripple’s progress and institutional involvement. Related Reading: The $589 XRP Dream: Believers Aren’t ‘Delusional’ Enough, Expert Says Ripple Institutional Adoption Expanding XRP is becoming more popular among financial institutions as a result of Ripple’s aggressive positioning of its coin as a means of facilitating faster and less expensive cross-border transactions. More than 300 major financial institutions, including banks and payment processors, have embraced the XRP Ledger (XRPL), enhancing its legitimacy and usefulness. This growing acceptance is crucial because it shows how the altcoin is being used in actual financial systems. I love this video! The best! 🙂 #XRP #Ripple https://t.co/lt3gAl0E0F — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) December 15, 2024 Jones underlines that institutional investment might be raised even more by the expected approval of a spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). If approved, this ETF might simplify the process of drawing big investors to the market, hence increasing demand for the altcoin. The recent increase in interest from institutional actors is indicative of a more general trend in which traditional finance is increasingly adopting digital assets. Legal Developments Boosting Self-Assurance Ripple’s legal triumph against the SEC earlier this year is a substantial factor contributing to the increasing popularity of XRP. This partial victory has bolstered investor confidence and mitigated some of the regulatory uncertainties that had previously afflicted the cryptocurrency. Many individuals are of the opinion that a favorable resolution could result in an even greater adoption and price appreciation as Ripple continues to navigate its legal challenges. Also, people think that better rules for cryptocurrencies will be put in place now that Donald Trump is back in the political spotlight. Trump has said that he wants to loosen the rules on digital assets, which could have a positive effect on XRP. Market experts think that if these changes are made, Ripple could see faster growth in both price and usage. Related Reading: New ATH: Bitcoin Tops $106K—Is FOMO And Strategic Reserve The Game-Changer? XRP Price Forecast At the moment, XRP is worth $2.61, which is a huge jump of over 300% since the start of 2024. Analysts think that the coin could hit between $5 and $10 by 2030, depending on how regulations change and how the market does. If things keep going the way they are, this could happen. Some optimistic predictions even say that the cryptocurrency could go above and beyond these goals if more and more institutions start to use it. Linda Jones’s endorsement of XRP alludes to a more general market view on its long-term viability. Changing rules, positive legislative developments, and strong institutional support help many investors see XRP as a basic component of the future financial system. As usual, prospective buyers should evaluate their risk tolerance and conduct extensive study before entering the crypto market.

In a new interview with Wall Street veteran Anthony Scaramucci on the Wealthion YouTube channel, Jack Mallers says that Bitcoin could hit a price of up to $1 million, a potential gain of approximately 871% from its current value. On what could drive the crypto king to reach the seven-figure price target, Mallers says, “The reality is, if America comes out and buys four million Bitcoin, I think Bitcoin ticks $1 million easily. If not, and we get interesting fiscal policy from this [incoming Trump] Administration, then $250,000 seems decently reasonable.” Bitcoin is trading at $106,994 at time of writing, a 3.6% increase during the last 24 hours. Mallers goes on to further say that the current US and global fiscal situation is also a bullish catalyst for the top crypto asset by market cap. “I think we’re going to see one of the greatest asset bubbles in human history. I think the fiscal situation is a problem… So, I think the problem is we have too much debt. And the way I would say it is that someone has to realize the loss. [US] Domestic debt-to-GDP close to 130%. Global debt-to-GDP well over 300%. And so there’s a loss that has to be realized. And the question is where are we going to realize that loss? Are we going to render all bondholders poor? Probably not. My expectation is further currency debasement, my expectation is further asset inflation. And my expectation is Bitcoin will continue to be the best performer because it’s the scarcest and the hardest to make more of.

To read full editions, subscribe . The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday decided to abandon its effort to re-confirm SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. The news, somewhat ironically, was leaked while Sen. Tim Scott, the Republican gunning to lead the Banking Committee next session, was wrapping up his remarks at the Blockchain Association event. Crenshaw’s confirmation vote, initially scheduled for last week , was postponed after Senate Republicans successfully blocked it. “Having fought ‘train Crenshaw’ for the last several months… to have a resounding victory of not having her go forward last week, I was so excited,” Scott said before learning the vote had been canceled. The vote was rescheduled for this week, but the committee “just didn’t have the votes,” a person familiar with the matter said. A spokesperson from the committee disagreed, saying they “had the support,” but “ran out of time.” A representative for Crenshaw did not immediately return a request for comment. Now that Crenshaw is out and Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, both Democrats, will be resigning in the new year , President-elect Donald Trump now has three seats to fill. In the meantime, Trump will name either Commissioner Hester Peirce or Mark Uyeda as acting chair while his pick for the top job, Republican Paul Atkins , is confirmed. So the commission is going to be small — at least for the first few weeks of 2025. This will not be the first time the SEC has operated with only two commissioners, and precedent largely supports allowing these two commissioners to vote on matters and conduct business as usual. The more provocative these actions are, though, the greater the likelihood of a legal battle. When it comes to making the agenda, the chair, or acting chair, holds all the power.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing three altcoins to buy in the US before Trump’s inauguration. Table of Contents PropiChain: Approaching RWA investment through blockchain Render: Connecting creators through GPU resources Stacks: DApps on Bitcoin Conclusion Now that Trump has been elected as the next US president, savvy investors in the US are on a quest to find the best altcoins to buy in this period of economic and political anticipation. As US investors and traders anticipate Trump’s inauguration, there has been a keen interest in altcoins with real-world use cases and disruptive technologies. Top crypto insiders also believe this is the perfect time to purchase tokens before they skyrocket. This article will discuss the three altcoins to buy in the US, their unique features, and how investors looking to capitalize on early-stage investments can position themselves before Trump’s inauguration. PropiChain: Approaching RWA investment through blockchain PropiChain is a decentralized finance platform looking to change the dynamics of RWA investment by digitizing assets on a secure blockchain. Thus, it will transform the traditional methods that are often vulnerable to fraud risks and cumbersome processes. Below are some of the features that make PropiChain one of the top three best altcoins to buy in the US: RWA tokenization and fractionalization: This feature will allow fractional ownership of assets, allowing multiple individuals to own a portion of highly valued property. Users will also be able to sell a portion of their holdings as digital assets. This process will facilitate a secure and efficient transfer of digital assets, eliminating the need for physical documentation. Thus, it will reduce the risk of fraud and streamline the transaction process. Advanced AI technologies: To be listed among the best altcoins to buy in the US, such a project must have core AI technologies that ensure optimized real estate transactions and scalability across the platform. PropiChain AI tools, through its advanced valuation model (AVM), will provide users with property filters, predictive market analysis, virtual assistance, and intelligent property recommendations. In an industry where accuracy and efficiency are paramount, these AI tools will enhance users’ experiences and ensure that complex tasks are automated and handled properly. Metaverse integrations: PropiChain Metaverse capabilities will enable users to explore tokenized properties in a digital environment without being physically present. International investors will be able to explore and experiment with different layouts and interior designs through virtual tours, stagings, and meetings, enhancing the property’s appeal. You might also like: PropiChain’s crypto presale is changing real estate investment unlocking this $300T sector Render: Connecting creators through GPU resources Render is a platform that is carving out a unique niche in connecting web3 creators and artists through its decentralized GPU network. Its high-resolution 3D graphics keep garnering attention in industries like gaming, virtual reality, and the Metaverse as its blockchain-based system streamlines the rendering process, reducing costs and improving efficiency for content creators. For US investors seeking diversification, Render presents a high-growth opportunity tied to the expanding digital market. Stacks: DApps on Bitcoin Stacks is a project that brings smart contract capabilities to Bitcoin. It allows developers to build decentralized apps on the Bitcoin blockchain, aiming to bridge the gap between legacy blockchain systems and modern dApp requirements. Its unique Proof of Transfer consensus mechanism also ensures compatibility with Bitcoin while maintaining energy efficiency, making it a strong contender among the best altcoins to buy in the US.

37771077,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313175,1734468936,"Ethereum (ETH) In for ‘Renewed Upside’ After Continued Stability, Says Crypto Analyst – Here’s His Outlook","A widely followed crypto analyst says Ethereum ( ETH ) looks primed to move higher after exhibiting price stability during the last two weeks. In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 519,700 followers on the social media platform X that ETH may be gearing up for more rallies after maintaining $4,000 as support on the weekly chart. “ETH: the post-breakout retest was successful. And indeed, it enabled a challenge into $4,000 (red). In fact, Ethereum has been holding the $4,000 (red) area as new support for the second week in a row. Continued price stability here [means] renewed upside.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Looking at his chart, the trader suggests that ETH may soon rally to $4,542. Ethereum is trading for $3,956 at time of writing, up nearly 28% in the last 30 days. However, the analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may continue to outperform altcoins now that Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) – the ratio between the market cap of BTC versus the market cap of all crypto assets combined – is rising again. At time of writing, BTC.D is at 57.80%. “Bitcoin dominance: sharp rebound to the upside for BTC.D. A reclaim of green 57.68% as support would allow for Bitcoin dominance to regain momentum in its macro uptrend. BTC.D is on the cusp of reclaiming this level as we speak to confirm ‘Bitcoin Season.'” Source: Rekt Capital/X Lastly, the analyst warns that based on historic precedence Bitcoin could soon see a sudden correction before rallying again. “It’s week seven. In 2013, Bitcoin pulled back in week seven of price discovery. In 2017, Bitcoin retraced -34% in week eight of price discovery. In 2021, Bitcoin pulled back -16% in week six. Will history repeat? Or will Bitcoin go against the grain of history?… Price discovery corrections are a normal part of the BTC cycle. And every cycle has experienced them. Especially since Bitcoin has already experienced multiple -25% pullbacks in and around the halving.” Bitcoin is trading for $106,972 at time of writing, up more than 18% in the last 30 days.

The token reached a fully diluted market cap of over $3.5 billion in just two hours following its launch today and generated $290 million in trading volume. But not every investor has been able to capitalize on this. On-chain data reveals that one unfortunate investor saw $10,000 plummet to less than $5 in just seconds due to a costly misstep involving low liquidity and price inflation. Approximately five minutes before PENGU officially launched, a trader attempted to swap 45 Solana (wSOL) for PENGU tokens via Jupiter, a popular decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator. Instead of capturing a suitable price, the swap was redirected to an unofficial liquidity pool on Raydium, resulting in the trader only receiving 78 PENGU tokens, currently valued at less than $3. Related News: Why Is Altcoins Not Moving As Anticipated? Analytics Company CEO Explains Why Ethereum, In Particular, Isn't Soaring The error occurred because PENGU’s liquidity pool was still at a minimum at the time, resulting in an artificially inflated market cap of $14 trillion. DEXs like Raydium use a bonding curve pricing mechanism where token prices rise sharply as liquidity remains low and demand increases. This mechanism, combined with slippage, made the investor’s transaction price much higher than expected. The trader, likely hoping to “grab” the PENGU token early, spotted the contract address before launch. These snipers, who typically use automated bots, aim to buy tokens at the lowest price immediately following an airdrop. But in this case, the strategy backfired spectacularly. “Somehow some of the tokens were leaked to other wallets,” said crea, a pseudonymous trader familiar with the memecoin market. “Someone created a liquidity pool early on and trading started with that.” Crea suggested that the unlucky trader was likely not using a bot, but instead assumed the token was released early, skipping important checks such as verifying market value. *This is not investment advice.

37770937,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629214,1734468042,40% of people worldwide own or have bought cryptocurrencies,"A Consensys – YouGov 2024 Global Survey on Crypto and Web3 shows that nearly half of the world’s population has interacted with cryptocurrencies. The study that sampled 18,652 adults across Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe, revealed that up to 40% of people worldwide own or have bought crypto. Additionally, developed countries are trailing the emerging markets in crypto, Web3 , and blockchain adoption. An excerpt of the findings reads: A majority of respondents in Nigeria (73%), South Africa (68%), the Philippines (54%), Vietnam (54%), and India (52%), either currently own or have owned cryptocurrencies in the past. On the other hand, less than 1 in 3 respondents in Japan, Argentina, Canada, France, Italy, and the UK own or have purchased any cryptocurrencies in the past. ~Consensys – YouGov 2024 Global Survey Africa and Asia also dominate in the number of users confident of investing in crypto in the next year. Nigeria (93%) and South Africa (77%) lead in that metric with their Asian counterparts, the Philippines (59%), India (58%), and Indonesia (54%), completing the top 5 nations. On the other hand, many European, Canadian, Japanese, and South Korean respondents expressed pessimism about investing in those assets. Meanwhile, those in the Americas and Turkey remained non-committal on the matter. Crypto adoption is still facing significant barriers The report also found that there are challenges bedeviling the sector despite the significant strides made in mainstreaming cryptocurrencies’ usage. The key ones, it says, are market volatility and scams. Sharp price swings and perceptions of aiding illicit activity characterize the crypto sector, dissuading many would-be investors from it. Another major challenge is the lack of information on digital assets. Per the survey, many potential investors have a poor grasp of concepts such as decentralization, blockchain, Web3, and where to start their crypto investment journeys. The knowledge gaps tend to increase with age and are also higher among female respondents. This reality highlights the need for more education about onboarding crypto and Web3 platforms safely. Such interventions could benefit adoption where the will to invest is high, but inadequate knowledge discourages many from the crypto markets. Crypto assets are clean This report ends on a positive note by revealing that many of the survey’s participants see cryptocurrencies as environmentally clean. That’s particularly true for Asian, African, and LATAM respondents. However, their European, Japanese, and Korean counterparts say they are bad for the environment. The crypto sector has drawn criticism from detractors who’ve for long labeled it environmentally unsound. Their anti-crypto campaigns claim crypto’s carbon footprint, water, and electricity demands are unsustainable. But it has always fought back with its statistics countering that narrative. It will be heartening therefore for the many projects dotting this space to know that its many reports give it a clean bill of health.

Balchunas stated that the most likely sequence of events is “btc + eth combo ETFs, then prob Litecoin (bc its fork of btc = commodity), then HBAR (bc not labeled security).” Seyffart noted that Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ) ETFs face legal delays .

It surged from $0.50 to $2.90, delivering substantial returns for investors and showcasing strong momentum. However, as we approach Q1 2025, XRP is showing signs of cooling off. The recent launch of Ripple's stablecoin initiative has drawn attention and profit-taking from early investors. While XRP continues to hold long-term potential, many investors are now looking to capitalize on other emerging opportunities with higher ROI potential. One such innovative project capturing the spotlight is Altura ($ALU), a cutting-edge AI and blockchain initiative. What Is Altura ($ALU)? Altura is a blockchain-based platform designed to bring smart, interactive NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and gaming assets to life. Built to cater to the growing gaming and AI sectors, Altura offers a seamless way for developers to integrate NFTs into their games and virtual ecosystems. The platform uses innovative technologies such as smart NFTs, which change dynamically based on external inputs, making it ideal for real-time gaming scenarios.

Altura ($ALU) Price Prediction As XRP takes a breather, Altura ($ALU) emerges as a potential gem in the crypto market. With a low market cap and massive room for growth, experts predict that Altura could deliver substantial returns for early investors. Bullish Potential: 8x to 20x ROI Given its combination of AI innovation and blockchain gaming utility, Altura stands out in an increasingly competitive market. Here's why analysts are optimistic about its price potential: 1. Low Market Cap: With a current market cap well below established cryptocurrencies, Altura has significant upside potential. If the project gains traction and attracts mass adoption, an 8x to 20x increase in value is plausible. 2. Innovative Solutions: By combining AI and smart NFTs, Altura is positioned at the forefront of blockchain gaming, which continues to see rapid growth. 3. Growing Adoption: As more developers and gaming studios adopt the Altura platform, demand for $ALU tokens is expected to skyrocket, driving prices higher. 4. Current Price Point: Altura's current price remains undervalued compared to its utility and potential, making it a prime entry point for investors. Altura ($ALU) Price Prediction for 2025: - Short-term Target: $0.15 to $0.20 - Mid-term Target: $0.50 to $0.70 - Long-term Potential: $1.50 and beyond If Altura follows the trajectory of other AI and gaming-related tokens, it could replicate the kind of success XRP showcased in its recent rally. Why Altura Is Bullish for 2025 Several factors make Altura ($ALU) an attractive investment option for those seeking higher returns: 1. Explosive Industry Growth: The gaming and AI sectors are expanding rapidly,and Altura's platform taps into both markets. 2. Unique Technology: Smart NFTs offer unparalleled utility, giving Altura a competitive edge. 3. Low Competition: Few projects in the blockchain space offer the same level of innovation, allowing Altura to dominate a niche market. 4. Community and Development: The project boasts an active developer community and ongoing updates, ensuring long-term growth and adoption. With a solid foundation, disruptive technology, and increasing demand for blockchain-based gaming assets, Altura is primed for a breakout year. Final Thoughts While XRP ($XRP) investors enjoy the returns of its recent rally, the token is expected to cool off in Q1 2025 due to profit-taking and market adjustments. This shift creates an opportunity for investors to explore emerging projects like Altura ($ALU), which boasts low market cap, innovative technology, and substantial upside potential. For those looking to capitalize on the next big trend, Altura offers a unique mix of blockchain gaming and AI-powered solutions that could deliver 8x to 20x returns in the coming months.

The $50 million Series B follows BVNK’s $40 million Series A funding round, which took place in May 2022 and was led by venture capital firm Tiger Global.

Justin Sun, who had recently joined the WBTC management along with BitGo, the company behind WBTC, filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and argued that WBTC was maliciously delisted after Coinbase launched its own equivalent altcoin, cbBTC. It was thought that after Justin Sun, a controversial cryptocurrency figure, joined the WBTC board, the token became risky, which is why Coinbase made the decision to delist. Coinbase defended its position by citing Sun’s alleged history of bad behavior and the need to protect its users. Coinbase outlined its reasoning for delisting WBTC in an official response: “Continuing to list WBTC could compromise the integrity of Coinbase’s platform and put customers at risk.” The company has pointed to reports of alleged financial irregularities by Sun, including ongoing investigations by U.S. authorities such as the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office. Sun also faces a fraud and market manipulation lawsuit filed by the SEC. Following BitGo’s August 2024 announcement that Justin Sun would join WBTC’s management, Coinbase launched a standard due diligence process. Coinbase alleged that BiT specifically refused to answer questions about its ownership structure to conceal Sun’s role. Based on these findings, Coinbase concluded that WBTC posed an unacceptable risk and announced its delisting on November 19, 2024. Related News: What Would Happen on Binance If Recently Listed Altcoins Were Bought on the First Listing Day? BiT claims that Coinbase’s move to delist WBTC is unfair, especially since Coinbase has launched its own cbBTC token. BiT claims that this constitutes anti-competitive behavior and has requested an urgent court order to block the delisting. But Coinbase countered that BiT’s legal arguments were “frivolous” and that there was no urgency to sue. “BiT pursued its claims for approximately a month prior to filing suit,” Coinbase said, suggesting that no real harm would come from the delisting decision. Coinbase also disputed the reputational damage and financial loss claims, arguing that WBTC’s issues were due to its relationship with Justin Sun rather than Coinbase’s decision. *This is not investment advice.

A Crypto.com spokesperson declined to comment on details. We’ve seen Trump nominate crypto-friendly people (i.e. Howard Lutnick ) to key positions and bring on a so-called crypto czar . The proposed national bitcoin reserve too remains something everyone is watching. Lawmakers in Brazil and Japan have started discussing such purchases. Trump preaches American superiority, so setting out to win a BTC buying race wouldn’t be much of a stretch. The president-elect indeed signaled a BTC reserve is being considered.

A large number of tokens, especially from the memecoin sector, have been made available for trading by Binance for users, both in the spot market and in the futures market. So how did the altcoins that usually pumped suddenly when they were listed perform afterwards? Were they able to sustain the pumps they experienced at the beginning? Here is information about the performance of the last altcoins listed since the listing date. (The data in question includes the prices of the altcoins after the listing, not the prices at the time of the listing announcement.)

The exchange will temporarily stop withdrawals between January 8th and 16th, 2025, during the transfer of unclaimed digital assets for ByBit users with matching Coinhouse accounts. The ByBit crypto exchange will no longer provide withdrawal and custody services to nationals or residents of the French Territories – ‘French users’ effective January 8th next year, the exchange Tuesday . The affected users have been requested to transfer their digital assets to the Coinhouse exchange before the deadline to avoid losing their funds or paying extra fees. ByBit users are urged to transfer digital assets before the deadline Starting Jan 8, 2025, @Bybit_Official will no longer provide withdrawal and custody services to nationals or residents of the French Territories (""French Users""). https://t.co/xE1SBGzZ9q pic.twitter.com/ISmn31Jfw9 — ICO Drops (@ICODrops) December 17, 2024 Accounts with 10 USDC or less will be charged a fee of 10 USDC and be closed permanently. Those with more than 10 USDC will incur the same fee amount, and then the difference will be forwarded to their corresponding Coinhouse accounts. Users without verified Coinhouse accounts will be required to open and verify the Coinhouse accounts through the necessary KYC process. All subsequent withdrawals will then be handled through their Coinhouse accounts. All unclaimed digital assets still held on ByBit after the deadline will be transferred automatically between January 8th and January 16th, 2025, for ByBit users with matching Coinhouse accounts. Withdrawals will be unavailable during this transfer period. Those with verified accounts will not face extra costs, but unverified users will have to pay a monthly fee of 0.16% of their holdings or 1 USDC – whichever is higher. ByBit has been under increasing scrutiny from the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers since 2022, and French users have been restricted to ‘Close-Only’ mode since August of this year. The restrictions applied to all products offered by ByBit. France continues to tighten crypto regulations for exchanges and French users According to the FSB (Financial Stability Board), trading and investment were the main use cases of crypto assets in France. Stablecoins were mostly used as a medium of exchange for crypto-to-crypto transactions. However, the use of crypto assets for payments remained limited, just like the direct links between traditional finance and the crypto market. ByBit’s exit from France emphasized the tightening regulatory environment in the country and Europe in general. Exchanges face increasing scrutiny and pressure to align with the evolving compliance frameworks in the French market. ByBit’s decision signaled the importance of users staying informed about regulatory changes and acting swiftly to secure their digital assets. The ByBit exchange is expected to focus on European markets where compliance pathways are clearer as regulators refine their crypto oversight. French authorities have made significant progress in supervising, monitoring, and regulating crypto assets. They have also managed to successfully bring a huge part of the digital assets market into the regulatory perimeter.

The meme coin market, known for its unpredictability and high reward potential, continues to defy the odds. While established cryptos fight for market dominance, meme coins bring a mix of humour, community hype, and innovation to the table—making them the best meme coins to join for 2025. This week’s shining star is BTFD Coin , an unstoppable juggernaut with a jaw-dropping $4.1M presale tally and over 5,700 eager holders. Meanwhile, Goatseus Maximus is holding its ground and looking primed for a comeback, while Cat in a Dog’s World struggles with a 2.9% decline, leaving investors scratching their heads. Let’s break it all down. BTFD Coin: Bullish, Booming, and Breaking Records The meteoric rise of BTFD Coin continues to capture headlines as its presale dominates the meme coin market. Now in Stage 12, BTFD has surpassed $4.1 million in funding, with over 56 billion coins sold and more than 5,700 holders charging forward with bullish conviction. The presale price sits at $0.00013, but with momentum like this, experts predict it could skyrocket once listed. What this means is that if you invest $4,000 at the current presale price, you’ll secure approximately 30.7 million BTFD tokens. Should BTFD hit its post-presale target of $0.0006, your $4,000 investment could swell to a whopping $18,420. That’s the kind of math that keeps the Bulls Squad hyped and the FOMO at maximum overdrive. With its mix of high-yield staking rewards, an innovative P2E game , and a community-first approach, BTFD isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a movement. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to join for 2025, BTFD Coin should top your list. Goatseus Maximus: Promising Despite Recent Volatility Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) has earned its spot among the most promising meme coins, thanks to its dedicated community and steady upward trajectory. Over the past week, GOAT has shown resilience with a 3.88% gain, but the last 24 hours saw a small pullback. Currently trading at $0.69, GOAT’s market cap hovers near $700 million, keeping it firmly in the spotlight. Analysts believe Goatseus Maximus is just getting started. Price predictions suggest that GOAT could climb to $2.10 by mid-2025, representing an impressive return for early adopters. While short-term dips might test investor patience, GOAT’s bullish long-term outlook makes it a strong contender in the meme coin race. Cat in a Dog’s World: A Scratchy Week for the Feline Favourite It hasn’t been all purrs and pounces for Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) this week, as the token struggled with a 2.9% decline. The project, which positions itself as the “feline disruptor” in a canine-dominated market, faced some selling pressure, causing investors to reassess their positions. Despite the downturn, it still boasts an engaged community and unique branding that appeals to meme coin lovers looking for something beyond the usual dog-themed tokens. Its price currently sits at $0.0075, and while its future remains uncertain, the cat has nine lives—so a comeback isn’t off the table. This exact philosophy is what propelled investors to believe it may still be one of the best memes to join for 2025. According to them, buying MEW tokens at today’s dip is a good idea since they predict a surge in the following years, namely to $0.035295 in 2025 on the upper end. That’s definitely worth taking the risk for! How to Buy BTFD Coins: Your Step-by-Step Bullish Guide If you’re ready to join the Bulls Squad and snag some BTFD tokens before prices climb, here’s your quick and easy guide to get started: Set Up Your Wallet: First, you’ll need a digital wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Download the extension or app, set up your wallet, and guard your private key like it’s gold. Your wallet is your gateway to securing BTFD tokens. Load Your Wallet with Crypto: Next, top up your wallet with BNB or ETH—these will be used to purchase BTFD tokens during the presale. Connect Your Wallet to the Presale: Head over to the official BTFD presale page, connect your wallet, and you’ll be ready to make your move. Buy BTFD Tokens: Choose your payment currency (BNB, ETH, or USDT), enter the amount you want to invest, and confirm the transaction. Boom! You’re in. Claim Your BTFD: Once the presale ends, you’ll be able to claim your BTFD tokens and start your bull run. Don’t forget to explore the staking options to maximise your rewards! Stay Updated: Keep an eye on BTFD’s official updates to claim tokens, track staking rewards, and dive into their P2E game ecosystem. The real fun is just beginning. Conclusion: BTFD Coin Leads the Meme Coin Charge for 2025 When it comes to the best meme coins to join for 2025, BTFD Coin stands out with its record-breaking presale performance, bullish price predictions, and vibrant community. Goatseus Maximus remains a promising underdog with steady momentum, while Cat in a Dog’s World is on a mission to claw its way back. That said, don’t miss your chance to join the bull run of the year— invest in BTFD Coin today and ride the wave before prices soar even higher.

37769929,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375014,1734466530,This Meme Coin Jumps by 50% Following Further Support From Binance,"TL;DR Binance expanded support for Simon’s Cat (CAT) by including it in multiple trading programs. The token reacted to the news with a rapid price increase. The Binance-Fueled Pump The world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange recently added further support for the meme coin launched on the BNB chain – Simon’s Cat (CAT). First, it included it in its HODLer Airdrops Portal. The program rewards BNB holders with token distributions based on historical snapshots of their balances. “By subscribing BNB to Simple Earn, users are automatically eligible for HODLer Airdrops (as well as Launchpool and Megadrop rewards),” Binance explained. The company said it will distribute 1,143,000,000,000 CAT (12.7% of the token’s maximum supply) to lucky users. Shortly after, Binance listed the meme coin with a seed tag. The exact trading pairs available to users are CAT/USDT, CAT/BNB, CAT/FDUSD, and CAT/TRY. It is worth noting that the seed tag category identifies newly listed and innovative cryptocurrency projects that may carry higher risk and volatility. Earlier today (December 17), the exchange doubled down on its support for Simon’s Cat, adding it to the Binance Simple Earn, “Buy Crypto,” Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures programs. Somewhat expectedly , the aforementioned efforts resulted in a massive price spike for CAT. Its valuation soared by approximately 50% on a daily scale , hitting a new all-time high of $0.00006330 (per CoinGecko’s data). In the following hours, the price slightly retraced to the current $0.00005597. CAT Price, Source: CoinGecko The Previous Support Binance initially embraced Simon’s Cat in October of this year when it introduced 1000CATUSDT perpetual contracts in its futures program. The offering allows up to 75x leverage and supports the multi-assets mode. In other words, it enables clients to use numerous margin assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) when trading the contract. Perpetual contracts let traders bet on the price movements of a certain token without directly owning it. With no expiration date, they can be held indefinitely. While such contracts offer opportunities for significant rewards, the high leverage and constant exposure to liquidation make them inherently risky, especially for inexperienced traders. Other meme coins that have recently enjoyed additional support from Binance include Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) , Pepe (PEPE), Ponke (PONKE) , and others.

37770739,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52418,1734466500,Grab The Best Meme Coins to Buy This Weekend: Investors Flock to BTFD Presale as Floki Goes Global and BONE ShibaSwap Unveils Major Airdrop,"What if you could grab a 10x crypto gem before it skyrockets? Picture this: while Floki Inu grabs courtside attention at a massive sports event and Bone ShibaSwap kicks off an exciting community airdrop, a fresh start — BTFD meme Coin (BTFD) — is taking the meme coin space by storm with its game-changing presale and a brand-new play-to-earn (P2E) game beta launch. Let’s dig into why these coins are grabbing headlines as the best meme coins to buy this weekend and which one could set your portfolio on fire. Starting with the unstoppable force that’s making crypto bulls charge: BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Presale Frenzy and P2E Game Beta Ignite Investor Hype Imagine getting in on the ground floor of a project that’s built to turn market dips into life-changing opportunities. That’s the mindset driving BTFD Coin’s explosive presale success. The P2E game’s beta version is now live, inviting early adopters to explore the gameplay—though rewards aren’t yet available. This is just the beginning of what’s shaping up to be one of the most exciting meme coin projects to date. So far, the BTFD presale is in its 12th stage, and the numbers speak for themselves. Over 56 billion BTFD tokens have been sold to more than 5,700 bullish holders, raising an impressive $4.1 million. To put it in perspective, BTFD smashed through the $1 million mark in under 10 days and hit $2.5 million in less than two weeks after its presale launch. Currently priced at $0.00013, BTFD tokens are expected to list at $0.0006 post-presale, presenting massive upside potential for early investors. Here’s a quick investment scenario: if you drop $650 into BTFD Coin right now during the 12th stage, you’ll bag roughly 5 million tokens. When the price hits $0.0006 at launch, that’s a cool $3,000 — nearly 5x your investment! The BTFD ecosystem isn’t just about numbers. It’s a movement. Built on Ethereum for security and scalability, BTFD offers: A play-to-earn game that rewards players for smashing through challenges. A robust staking system, delivering up to 90% APY for long-term holders. A thriving community (dubbed the Bulls Squad) driving the token’s success. But wait—there’s more! The BTFD Referral Programme allows users to earn 10% of the raise amount when their referral codes are used. For those who make it to the top 20 leaderboard, additional rewards await at the end of the month. It’s a win-win for investors ready to share the BTFD movement with friends. Floki Inu (FLOKI): Riding High with Global Spotlight at WTL Floki Inu continues to dominate headlines, this time with its branding set to feature prominently at the 2024 World Tennis League (WTL), held at Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Arena. This marquee event, running from December 19 to December 22, is expected to reach millions of viewers worldwide. Floki’s courtside presence next to the tramlines, digital LED displays, and big screens ensures the meme coin will resonate with fans of both tennis and crypto globally. The event’s star-studded roster includes heavyweights like Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Nick Kyrgios, and Stefanos Tsitsipas, along with live performances by Bryan Adams, Akon, and Sean Paul. This collaboration is massive for Floki Inu’s exposure, especially with last year’s WTL reaching over 46.4 million viewers globally. While FLOKI enjoys increased visibility, its community-driven focus and previous rallies have cemented it as a major player in the meme coin space. Analysts speculate that global partnerships like WTL could propel FLOKI’s value. However, market volatility remains a concern, and investors should keep an eye on its price movements post-event. Bone ShibaSwap (BONE): The Ecosystem Grows with Exciting Airdrop News Bone ShibaSwap, the governance token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, is back in the spotlight after announcing a new meme coin airdrop, Shifu (SHIFU), on December 16. Holders of BONE, alongside SHIB and LEASH tokens, will be rewarded with this new token, boosting community excitement. BONE’s integration into the Shibarium Layer-2 network earlier this year has already driven impressive user adoption, with a reported 39% increase in new holders during February 2024. Priced at approximately $0.64, BONE’s trading volume remains strong at nearly $9.83 million, although it has faced some dips recently. Long-term holders are optimistic about the project’s potential, especially with its pivotal role in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The combination of growing utility within Shibarium, lucrative staking rewards, and exciting announcements like SHIFU positions BONE as a key contender in the meme coin arena. However, short-term volatility could pose challenges for new investors entering at current price levels. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Set up your wallet: Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet, and guard your private key like a treasure map. Load your wallet with BNB or ETH: This will fuel your move to snag BTFD tokens. Connect your wallet: Visit the official BTFD website and connect your digital wallet. Buy BTFD: Choose BNB, ETH, or USDT as your payment option, enter the amount, and confirm the transaction. Receive your BTFD: Claim your tokens once the presale ends. Stay updated: Staked rewards and game earnings will follow a vesting period post-launch. With its 16-stage presale structure and prices climbing at each phase, BTFD Coin rewards early believers with the best entry points. Conclusion Based on market trends and project updates, BTFD Coin stands out as the most exciting opportunity this week. While Floki Inu secures global visibility at the WTL and Bone ShibaSwap grows its community with a SHIFU airdrop, BTFD is the token with a clear plan, explosive growth potential, and an active community rallying behind it. The beta launch of its P2E game, alongside staking rewards and a massively successful presale, signals that BTFD is not just another meme coin—it’s a full-blown movement for savvy investors. Don’t miss out. Join the BTFD Coin presale today while the price is still $0.00013 and secure your stake in one of the best meme coins to buy this weekend.

TRON’s Stablecoin Boom The figure, captured by CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, is noteworthy, considering in July 2019, the network only managed to move about $73.8 million in USDT.

CryptoQuant’s data also showed that the number of USDT receivers on TRON was also at its highest level in October, reaching 10.6 million. However, the 9.2 million senders in that month were only bettered by the 10.18 million recorded earlier in May. Some market watchers have attributed the uptick in stablecoin transfers on the network to its key advantages, including low transaction fees, fast processing times, and cost-effective remittance services. The record-breaking growth also positively impacted TRON’s native TRX token. Figures from CoinGecko show that it has surged by more than 160% over the last 12 months, possibly reflecting the blockchain’s rising importance in the crypto space. At the time of writing, TRX was trading at $0.2912, up 3.3% in the previous 24 hours, with a range of $0.2772 to $0.304 in that period. Additionally, the coin has outshined the broader crypto market, gaining 10.7% across the past week against the sector’s 9.1%. The performance is even better compared to similar smart contract platform cryptocurrencies, which gained an average of 8.80% in the last seven days. Ethereum’s Growing Competition While Justin Sun’s network leads in USDT transfer volume, Ethereum has also gained ground. Recent data shows that Tether minted $20 billion worth of the stablecoin on Ethereum, pushing it ahead of TRON as the leading platform for USDT supply. Furthermore, analysts expect Ethereum’s supply of the highest capped stablecoin to reach $1 trillion by the end of 2025, solidifying its position as a trusted institutional-grade blockchain. Elsewhere, Circle and Binance announced a strategic partnership to expand the global adoption of USDT’s closest competitor, USDC. Per the arrangement, Binance will offer the dollar-pegged cryptocurrency to its estimated 240 million user base and make it a core component of its corporate treasury.

37771166,https://thecoinrise.com/ripple-labs-launches-rlusd-stablecoin-to-revolutionize-payments/,1734466386,Ripple Labs Launches RLUSD Stablecoin To Revolutionize Payments,"Ripple Labs has finally unveiled its RLUSD stablecoin , a dollar-pegged asset. The stablecoin is now live on some major global exchanges. In a post on X, Ripple emphasized that the stablecoin built for everyone offers fiat currency stability while leveraging blockchain technology. Features and Financial Implications of RLUSD RLUSD will function on two networks simultaneously in the interim, pending further developments. These are Ethereum and Ripple’s native ledger, XRP Ledger (XRPL). All users on these two networks can officially interact with RLUSD. Some of the notable features of RLUSD include allowing users to send and receive payments globally in real time. Notably, RLUSD bypasses the limitations inherent in traditional banking hours as it operates 24/7, and there are no delays in international transactions. Other interesting features include seamless on and off-ramps and access value in real-world assets. This allows users to easily convert between RLUSD and fiat currencies or other digital assets. Overall, Ripple’s launch of RLUSD signals the actualization of its quest to integrate blockchain into mainstream finance. RLUSD will offer faster, cheaper, and more accessible transactions. RLUSD’s entry into the financial market will see it competing with established names such as Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). RLUSD’s Immediate Impact on XRP Following the launch, the stablecoin price initially experienced up to 20% fluctuations, given it pegged to the U.S. dollar, 1 to 1. It later settled at $1. David Schwartz , Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), hinted that such volatility could occur due to possible supply shortages. Meanwhile, the launch triggered a decline in the price of XRP in the broader cryptocurrency market. Notably, XRP, which has been riding a wave of renewed interest as Arkham Exchange listed the token for both spot and perpetual trading pairs, dipped. XRP dropped by over 2.2% to trade at $2.64 per token. At the time of this writing, XRP exchanges for $2.64, representing a 5.01% increase in the last 24 hours. Additionally, investors’ confidence appears to have soared as market volume climbed by 63.84% to $17.55 billion. Community and Analysts’ Reactions The launch of RLUSD has received support from members of the community. A user, XRPKickz (@JumpmanFiend) on X, welcomed it as a change from the previous process. He said, “One thing I hate is paying a bill, waiting for my bank to withdraw the funds, and then waiting for the other side to confirm the payment! I think it’s time for a change!” Analysts say the stablecoin sector of crypto has seen numerous successes and failures, and the industry will watch to see how Ripple Labs’ RLUSD performs.

37769783,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313167,1734466258,TokenBuilder Releases 2025 Forecast on AI Integration and Fair Token Offerings,"December 17, 2024 – Tortola, British Virgin Islands According to the prediction of Ransu Salovaara, CEO of TokenBuilder and a crypto veteran since 2014, the next 12 months will be pivotal in boosting transparency for token launches and integrating AI technology into new crypto projects. Salovaara, who helped raise token sales for major names in the industry, believes 2025 will be dominated by two major trends. FTOs (fair token offerings) – A push for more reasonable valuations and more equitable access for everyday investors AI tokens – A major leap forward where crypto meets advanced AI agents, opening fresh opportunities for projects and investors alike Salovaara said, “2024 was phenomenal, with Bitcoin hitting $100,000 on December 4th, CoinMarketCap confirms this milestone. “Thousands of memecoins also launched this year, many reaching secondary markets, as tracked by BDC Consulting. But 2025 is set to be even bigger. “I predict Bitcoin will push towards $150,000 to $200,000, and memecoins will hopefully adopt stricter compliance. “Even more exciting is how AI is finally converging with crypto, spawning a new generation of AI-driven utility tokens.” FTOS – L eveling the playing field While Bitcoin’s and memecoins’ rise dominated headlines in 2024, these trends also highlighted how rampant scams and rug-pulls remain. Memecoins in particular saw thousands of launches – not all created equal. Private insiders often orchestrated low-float, high-valuation tactics, leaving retail investors at a disadvantage. To counter these, TokenBuilder has pioneered an FTO rating system, providing a transparent scoring framework for new token offerings. This rating focuses on five pillars. Access – Retail investor inclusion in private rounds Appreciation – Fair token valuations with upside potential Supply – At least 20% circulating supply after token launch to avoid price manipulation Liquidity – Early secondary market trading plans (DEX or otherwise) Transparency – Public, identifiable teams rather than anonymous founders Salovaara added, “We want to end the days of anonymous projects. A legitimate project should be proud of its team, structure and open to scrutiny.” FTOcalendar.com is TokenBuilder’s curated platform listing upcoming offerings. Each token must achieve at least one star on the FTO rating scale to even be considered – raising the bar for fairness in Web 3.0 fundraising. Although the five-pillar overview remains the core, TokenBuilder continues refining the FTO rating for greater sophistication. AI tokens – The next billion-dollar crypto sector According to Salovaara, for most of 2024, AI was overshadowed by surging memecoins and the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin ETFs. Yet, behind the scenes, developers have been blending language models – OpenAI, Grog, Llama – with crypto utility. In practice, these AI tokens will do the following. Use AI-agent frameworks – like AI16Z’s ‘Eliza’ – to enable advanced, automated services Offer exclusive data and analytics functionalities Function as native payment methods for discounted or premium AI services Salovaara said, “We see AI tokens as the next wave of utility tokens – where owning them isn’t just about price speculation, but unlocking actual AI-based features. “Expect many new AI token launches by mid-2025, each aiming to monetize everything from data analytics to real-time predictions. “We will launch our first version of ‘Eliza’ in January – February 2025.” TokenBuilder’s roadmap for 2025 and beyond Building on a decade of crypto experience, TokenBuilder is developing a FTO launchpad focused on AI-driven tokens. Using on-chain sales accessible to everyone, the platform plans to offer the following. TBAI launch on Uniswap January 2, 2025 Multiple token offering methods – Fixed-price sales, LBP (liquidity bootstrapping pool) auctions and more Multi-chain support – Ethereum, Base and possibly other Ethereum layer-two networks AI-powered tools – AI-powered tokenomics analysis, compliance tracking and advanced analytics Alongside the FTO Calendar and an ‘AI-agent army’ for compliance and tokenization, TokenBuilder aims to streamline the entire process of launching new tokens in a fair, open and transparent manner. Salovaara said, “We believe the ‘AI-agent army’ will be central to many utility tokens from 2025 onward. “Imagine an AI-powered framework that automates compliance checks, optimizes liquidity and offers real-time market intelligence for both investors and founders. That’s the future we’re building.” Contacts TokenBuilder Platform – tokenbuilder.ai FTO Calendar – FTOcalendar.com Media contact Ransu Salovaara, founder and CEO Telegram – @ransu_salovaara Email – ransu@tokenbuilder.ai LinkedIn – linkedin.com/in/ransu About TokenBuilder TokenBuilder is an FTO launchpad and platform for Web 3.0 projects.

Ondo works with partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for asset custody. This enhances trust and security. Ondo sets high standards for transparency and compliance. In the current market, USDY’s mix of stability and yield may appeal to investors seeking regulated and transparent products. Polkadot: Enhancing blockchain connectivity Polkadot is a decentralized protocol that allows different blockchains to communicate securely. It enables value and data to be shared between blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without needing intermediaries. Polkadot uses parachains to increase speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking within the network. Holders can participate in the network’s development and verify transactions.

Aptos: A scalable blockchain aiming to solve network congestion Aptos (APT) is a new layer-one blockchain designed to be scalable, safe, and reliable. It aims to address the high transaction fees and network congestion found in blockchains like Ethereum. Developed by Aptos Labs, which was founded by core contributors from Diem (a project by Meta), it uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Aptos employs the Move programming language for its smart contracts, focusing on safety and flexibility. It supports a wide range of Web3 applications. Given its strong technical foundation and focus on scalability, Aptos has significant potential. In the current market cycle, it may be an attractive option for those interested in emerging blockchain technologies. Stellar Lumens: Bridging global financial systems with blockchain Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized payment network that uses blockchain technology to enable quick and low-cost money transfers. It features its own cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens, and supports all currencies equally. Since 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major companies. Unlike cryptocurrencies aiming to replace financial systems, Stellar seeks to enhance them by unifying diverse financial networks. People can transfer funds globally, and companies can use Stellar for payments and currency exchange. The Stellar Development Foundation promotes network use, including NFTs and smart contracts. In the current market cycle, Stellar’s focus on real-world applications and partnerships continues to draw attention. Conclusion While Ondo, Polkadot, Aptos, and Stellar showcase innovative advancements and long-term promise, Catzilla stands out as the boldest contender for short-term explosive growth. With a presale structure offering up to 700% ROI, starting at $0.0002 and climbing across 14 stages, Catzilla combines meme coin energy with triple utility, capturing the essence of financial freedom.

Let it snow, or so an unlucky trader thought when they tried to front run the Pudgy Penguins crypto airdrop on Dec. 17. While the Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) token surged over $3 billion in market cap just hours after debuting, one investor bought the coin at a ridiculous $14 trillion capitalization. Their initial $10,000 investment turned into less than $3 within minutes, according to on-chain data and community observers. somebody bought $PENGU @$14T mc turning his $10k to $5 in seconds lmfao pic.twitter.com/R9X9tOu2fn — bx1 (@bx1core) December 17, 2024 From $10k to $3, PENGU trader sunk by iceberg Following the on-chain data, an unknown trader appeared to have placed a large PENGU order on Jupiter shortly before the token went live. Such traders, often referred to as “snipers,” use advanced trading tools to quickly scoop up newly launched tokens. However, a glitch in Jupiter’s decentralized exchange directed this would-be PENGU sniper to a low liquidity pool. You might also like: Binance to list PENGU and CAT on Dec. 17 DEX aggregators like Jupiter calculate crypto prices using a system that autonomously adjusts price tags based on demand, known as a bonding curve. Tech-savvy bad actors sometimes manipulate this system to create highly volatile liquidity pools. Since anyone can set up a liquidity position, traders occasionally purchase tokens from incorrect contracts and suffer significant losses. In this case, the trader likely bought into one of these manipulated liquidity pools without verifying the contract address or token market cap. After swapping 45 wrapped Solana ( SOL ), the buyer received just 78 tokens valued at under $5 at the time of reporting. Unshaken by the error, the trader eventually acquired 62,585 PENGU coins worth about $2,000. Pudgy Penguins roadmap Launching a token crowned Pudgy Penguins’ recent recovery in a broad non-fungible token renaissance. The NFT collection owned by Iglo Inc. was one of the top three NFT projects by market cap. A single Pudgy NFT cost more than a Bitcoin at a point. The Penguin-themed blockchain art pieces traded for $60,000 on average after the airdrop, as a 50% correction adjusted its floor price to 15.63 Ether ( ETH ). Looking ahead, Igloo Inc.’s roadmap includes activating PENGU features on Ethereum’s blockchain. The company also plans to launch its layer-2 Abstract Chain network. Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU token has a total supply of 88.88 billion tokens, with seven million eligible addresses for the airdrop.

37769782,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629210,1734465604,"Nvidia stock tanks on FUD, competition spike","Nvidia stocks dropped over 2% in the early hours of today as investors became increasingly concerned about AI spending. Investors argue that the spending that has been instrumental in the company’s growth could diminish or extend to its competitors. The decline follows comments from Microsoft and Google that their AI expenditures will expand at a slower pace in the future. In addition, the latest Blackwell AI servers were rumored to be overheating. This has fueled concerns about additional production delays and led to a further decline in shares. Moreover, China’s competition regulator announced this week that it is looking into Nvidia’s $7 billion purchase of the networking technology company Mellanox. This made things even more complicated for the company. Source: Yahoo Finance The AI chipmaker’s shares are now down approximately 14% from their record-high closing price of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia stocks in competition According to reports , the competition is also intensifying. In early December, Amazon announced that it is constructing a supercomputer using its new servers and its own Trainium AI processors. Source: Guru Focus The company is optimistic that this will serve as a viable alternative to Nvidia. In its most recent earnings report, Broadcom announced that its custom AI chips, known as XPUs, will generate up to $90 billion in revenue over the next three years. The announcement caused Broadcom’s stock price to significantly increase and Nvidia’s to decline. This is despite analyst predictions that Broadcom’s success would not be at Nvidia’s expense. In addition, John Vinh, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, also observed that certain of Nvidia’s most significant clients, including Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, are beginning to develop their own AI processors in-house. This is aimed at diversifying their supply chains in their most critical technology. Also, there are fears that big tech businesses have yet to see a meaningful return on their AI expenditures, and their AI bills are rising. In its latest quarterly report, Microsoft’s capital expenditures nearly quadrupled to $20 billion, while Meta’s expenses jumped 36% to $9.2 billion. Google’s capital spending also rose 63% to $13 billion. According to reports, a recent Gallup poll found that only 4% of US professionals use AI daily. How, then will tech businesses get back their revenues? JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said that he expects the major hyperscalers’ AI-related infrastructure spending to climb 57% in 2024, 30% in 2025, and 25% in 2026. FUD is, therefore, the main reason the AI chipmaker’s market value has declined since its most recent closing high on Nov. 7. This has resulted in a loss of approximately $400 billion in market value and a drop to third place in the list of the world’s most valuable companies, behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia bulls still expect it to perform well The majority of Wall Street analysts are optimistic about the stock. They predict that the company’s current quarter topline will increase by billions and by many billions more in the upcoming financial year. They assert that the surge will be a result of the ongoing ramp of its Blackwell processors. These processors are anticipated to establish a significant market share in the AI-powered chip field. In the fiscal year that concluded in January 2023, Nvidia reported a net income of $4.37 billion, which encompassed the launch of ChatGPT. That figure is anticipated to increase to $102 billion by the conclusion of the upcoming fiscal year, which concludes in January 2026. According to GimmeCredit analyst Dave Novosel, Nvidia is anticipated to generate $62 billion in free cash flow in the upcoming fiscal year. Approximately $36 billion of this amount will be allocated for share buybacks. In addition, Bernstein analysts, led by Stacy Rasgon, reiterated their assessment of Nvidia as a “top pick” in the sector in a note published Monday, stating that “2025 seems likely to be an exceedingly good year.” Nvidia’s stock has stayed under pressure even though the company recently reported earnings that were better than expected. Still, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives hopes Nvidia’s market value will hit $4 trillion by 2025.

This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-memecoin-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
42389122,3b9c9271-4fbc-4e1f-817c-2a41d70b64f0,1734465167,Fed Rate Cut Guidance Will Exceed Wall Street’s Bearish Outlook,"Wall Street’s rate cut outlook is overly pessimistic.  This week brings an important update for investors everywhere. The Federal Reserve will update its interest rate policy on Wednesday Dec. 18. The consensus expectation is for a 25 basis point cut, lowering the effective rate to 4.4% from the current level of 4.7%.  The more important part of the discussion will be the outlook for the path of interest rates next year. Investors want to know whether policymakers still intend to lower rates by another 100 basis points next year, as the group endorsed in September, or if the viewpoint has grown more hawkish (i.e. less inclined to ease).  Back in September, Wall Street was certain those four rate cuts would happen by the end of 2025. But today, money managers and traders aren’t quite so certain. According to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s FedWatch tool, bond-market speculators are betting our central bank will lower interest rates by just 50 basis points next year.  I agree with some of that assessment. The Fed is likely to reduce interest-rate expectations for next year. Recent employment and inflation numbers show the pace of growth is returning to pre-pandemic levels of normal. At the same time, economic output hasn’t collapsed like some of the dire predictions earlier this year. That tells me the Federal Reserve is achieving its goals of full employment and price stability. Consequently, I think it will guide for 75 basis points worth of rate cuts in 2025 versus Wall Street’s outlook for just 50.  This is important for us as risk-asset investors because it means the cost of borrowing money will continue to drop. As the access to funds gets cheaper, more people will take out loans. Hedge funds will lever up. There will be more money available in the financial system to invest. At the same time, the payout for money market funds and bonds will decline because interest rates are falling. That means investors will seek out better returns in risk assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks, driving those prices even higher.  But don’t take my word for it, let’s look at what the data’s telling us.  For anyone unfamiliar, the Fed meets to set policy just eight times a year. Typically, those gatherings happen in the first and last month of each quarter. The second meeting of each quarter takes on an added significance. Those are the meetings when we receive policymakers’ Summary of Economic Projections (“SEP”).  At those meetings, each member of the Board of Governors and the regional Fed banks are asked to project where they see economic growth, inflation, unemployment, and interest rates heading over the coming years. The data is then compiled to find the median outlook for each of those categories. Those results don’t guarantee monetary policy will follow the same course, but they give us an idea of its direction.  Here's what the September SEP forecast looked like:  The part of the tables we care about most are the median projections on the left. By surveying those numbers, we get an idea of policymakers’ outlook for growth, inflation, unemployment, and interest rates for this year through 2027. As you can see, Fed officials predicted gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth ending this year around 2%, an unemployment rate of 4.4%, inflation at 2.3%, and borrowing costs at 4.4%. Then, in the out years, the group expects each measure to stabilize, with interest rates settling at 2.9%.  We’re unlikely to end this year in line with those September projections. Based on economists’ expectations, GDP will increase 2.2% in the fourth quarter. That would put the average rate of economic growth this year at about 2.4% – above the prior expectation.  And it’s a similar story for the other metrics. According to the November labor data, the unemployment rate sits at 4.2% while October personal consumption expenditures showed inflation growth is at 2.3% compared to a year ago. Those metrics are roughly in line with the prior expectations, supporting a 25 basis point rate cut this week.  But the rate-cut outlook will be decided by the employment and inflation trends, and both of those are headed in the right direction.  First, let’s observe the pace of nonfarm payroll gains. According to the November numbers, the economy has added an average of 180,000 jobs per month in 2024 compared to the 177,300 average from 2017-2019. That tells policymakers the labor market is stabilizing after years of hyper growth, and returning to normal.  The story isn’t much different with inflation. Take a look at the trend in personal consumption expenditures:  The above table shows us PCE growth by month over the last year. As I’ve been highlighting, price pressures appear hotter than anticipated due to high numbers from the start of this year. January through April account for 1.3% of November’s 2.3% annualized result. But, if we look at the past six months, we see the forward-looking pace shows annualized inflation growth has slowed to 1.6%. That’s well below the Fed’s 2% target and signals interest rates are still weighing on prices.  Since the Fed started raising rates in March 2022, it’s had two goals in mind: maximum employment and stable prices. Until recently, it hasn’t seen concrete signs of either scenario playing out. But, based on the numbers we just looked at, policymakers now have evidence that the labor market has steadied, and price pressures are coming back to target.  From 2000 to 2020, the real rate of interest based on PCE (effective fed funds minus inflation) has had an average rate of -0.05%. Currently, the rate sits at 2.6%. If our central bank is trying to get that number back to neutral (neither hurts nor helps the economy), a lot of easing lies ahead.  At the end of the day, the economy is still doing well. As a result, the Fed doesn’t have to be as aggressive with its guidance for rate cuts moving forward. In fact, this is exactly what it wants: economic growth that’s holding up and affords it the ability to take its time. We don’t want a central bank cutting rates rapidly because output is in a free fall.  So, like I said at the start, expect the Fed to endorse borrowing costs ending 2025 around 3.7% compared to the prior guidance for 3.4%. That will be lower than Wall Street’s current expectation for 3.9%, easing worst-case fears. And the change should support a steady, long-term rally in risk assets like bitcoin and ether.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Scott Garliss ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/17/fed-rate-cut-guidance-will-exceed-wall-street-s-bearish-outlook,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fb49f98b85979cba937d31a74d8ddbfc7825fa6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum Ethereum is a leading blockchain platform that changed the game with smart contracts and a large ecosystem of decentralized apps. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, it has become a hub for decentralized finance and more. To make transactions faster and cheaper, solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon were added. In 2022, Ethereum switched to a Proof-of-Stake system with the Merge, making it more efficient and less energy-consuming. Soon, sharding will be introduced, which will make the network even more scalable and cost-effective. Ether (ETH) is the heart of Ethereum. It’s used for transactions, rewarding those who secure the network, and can be traded or used as collateral. Based on past price movements and market trends like Bitcoin’s halving, some predict that ETH’s price could reach up to $6,580.53 next year and have a low of $2,700.31 in 2025. In the current market, Ethereum looks promising, especially with its ongoing improvements. Compared to other coins, its strong technology and active development make it stand out. As the blockchain world grows, Ethereum continues to lead and innovate. Solana Solana is making waves in the blockchain world with its focus on speed and scalability. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a robust foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). What sets Solana apart is its unique architecture designed for lightning-fast transactions and the flexibility for developers to use multiple programming languages. At the heart of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of Solana lies in its ability to handle high-capacity operations without relying on sharding or second-layer solutions. This approach aims to attract developers looking to build high-activity products and services. In the current market, where scalability and transaction speed are crucial, Solana’s technology offers a compelling alternative to other platforms. As more projects look for efficient and scalable solutions, SOL’s role in facilitating and rewarding network participation positions it as a noteworthy player in the evolving blockchain landscape. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana are solid, but XYZ, the first all-sport meme coin, aims for 7,402% growth, blending meme culture with sports to engage and benefit its community.

In a post on the social media platform X, Balchunas says that he’s anticipating a “wave” of new crypto ETFs next year, potentially in a particular order. Says Balchunas “We expect a wave of cryptocurrency ETFs next year, albeit not all at once. First out is likely the BTC + ETH combo ETFs, then prob Litecoin (bc its fork of btc = commodity), then HBAR (bc not labeled security) and then XRP/Solana (which have been labeled securities in pending lawsuits).” Balchunas shares a note from fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart speculating that Litecoin ( LTC ) and Hedera ( HBAR ) ETFs may have a better chance of approval than Solana ( SOL ) and XRP due to not being targeted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as alleged unregistered securities. Before LTC and HBAR products, Seyffart says the next ETFs will likely be Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) combos from Hashfex, Franklin Templeton and Bitwise. “Solana filings were recently rejected, and both Solana and XRP ETFs will have to wait until the new SEC administration takes control before being seriously considered. Even then, complex legal issues around these tokens and others relating to their status as securities may need to be resolved. Litecoin, on the other hand, was a fork of Bitcoin and may be viewed by the SEC as a commodity. The SEC isn’t calling Litecoin or HBAR a security anywhere. New issuer Canary is the only filer for a Litecoin or HBAR ETF. Though we think both have higher odds than others of approval, it’s unclear whether there’s investor demand.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The targeted network, led by a previously sanctioned North Korean agent, facilitated cryptocurrency conversions and money laundering to support the regime’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. US Treasury Crackdown North Korea’s Cybercrime Network, Freezing Millions in Illicit Funds On Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it dismantled a North Korean money laundering network that facilitated the conversion of cryptocurrency into cash, enabling the regime to clean millions of dollars. . @USTreasury ’s Office of Foreign Assets Control is sanctioning two individuals and one entity involved in a network that launders millions of dollars of illicit funds generated by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea IT workers and cybercrime to support the DPRK Government. — Treasury Department (@USTreasury) December 17, 2024 The network involves a front company in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and two Chinese nationals, which North Korea used as a mask to exploit crypto assets to evade sanctions. According to the Treasury, Chinese nationals Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian operated through a UAE-based front company, Green Alpine Trading, LLC, to cash out cryptocurrency generated from North Korea’s fraudulent IT operations and cybercrime activities. In response, the U.S. government added Green Alpine Trading to its sanctions blacklist, along with Chinese nationals Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian, who were key participants in the operation since 2022. According to the Treasury, the network reportedly collaborated with a North Korean agent, Sim Hyon Sop, to launder funds derived from “illicit revenue generation schemes. ” From his base in China, Sim oversees schemes that disguise illicit funds, leveraging cryptocurrency and international accomplices to move money. OFAC reports that since early 2022, Lu Huaying has played a critical role by converting cryptocurrency into fiat currency through cash-outs and money mule networks. Between 2022 and September 2023, Lu facilitated several million dollars laundering on Sim’s behalf. The funds were used to purchase goods and services that benefit North Korea. Similarly, Zhang Jian assisted in exchanging fiat currency and sometimes acted as a courier for Sim’s operations. Green Alpine Trading provided financial and logistical support to Sim’s network, enabling the movement of illicit funds. It has now been sanctioned for facilitating North Korea’s efforts to circumvent global financial restrictions. While specific details regarding the total volume of laundered funds were not disclosed, the operation is believed to have contributed to North Korea’s broader efforts to fund its nuclear weapons program.

However, the current status of the sanctioned individuals, Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian, remains unclear. North Korea has gained notoriety as one of the most aggressive state actors in crypto-related crime. U.S. officials have accused North Korean operatives of stealing billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency to support the country’s nuclear ambitions. However, to make these digital assets useful, North Korea relies on laundering mechanisms to convert the crypto into traditional fiat currency.

Alongside the deficit boost, China has locked in its economic growth target at around 5%, maintaining its steady public goals despite ongoing internal and external struggles.

The increase from the initial 3% deficit target in 2024 signals China’s need to inject more funds into the economy—funds that analysts expect to hit about 1.3 trillion yuan ($179.4 billion). The government will reportedly finance this extra spending through the issuance of off-budget special bonds. These figures, while historic, remain unofficial until the annual parliamentary meeting in March. There, Beijing is expected to formalize its deficit and growth plans. Sources cautioned that adjustments to these targets are still possible before final approval. The State Council Information Office and China’s Ministry of Finance did not respond to requests for comment. However, insiders suggest that the increased deficit is China’s pre-emptive strategy to counter Donald Trump’s plans for aggressive tariffs on Chinese imports when he retakes the White House in January. Trump’s proposals include a universal 10% import tariff and a punishing 60% levy on Chinese goods—a move that could gut Chinese exports to the U.S., valued at over $400 billion annually. China pivots to stimulus as economic struggles persist China’s economy has stumbled through a turbulent year. A spiraling property crisis has kneecapped investment. Local government debts have climbed to unsustainable levels. Consumer spending has stagnated, leaving businesses and analysts skeptical about a fast recovery. Exports have been one of the few pillars keeping China’s economy afloat. Yet, even this lifeline is now under siege. Trump’s return has re-ignited fears of tit-for-tat trade warfare. Manufacturers are scrambling to relocate production to avoid U.S. tariffs, but shifting supply chains won’t happen overnight Many exporters warn that the proposed levies will gut profits, hit jobs, and slow investments, deepening China’s economic woes. The CEWC summary released after last week’s meetings didn’t shy away from these issues. State media reaffirmed the importance of “steady economic growth” but stopped short of providing specific numbers. Beijing remains laser-focused on the 5% GDP growth target—a goal that analysts say is more about managing expectations than delivering hard results. Morgan Stanley analysts predict that alongside the expanded deficit, the quota for special bonds will rise slightly, leading to around 2 trillion yuan in total fiscal expansion. At the same time, China’s central bank has signaled its loosest stance in over a decade. After 14 years of “prudent” monetary policy, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is ready to embrace an “appropriately loose” approach. This shift has raised expectations for interest rate cuts and liquidity injections in 2025. Analysts point to the huge rise in total debt during the past decade and a half. Household, corporate, and government borrowing combined has surged more than fivefold, even as the economy itself tripled. Despite the risks, China is leaning heavily on fiscal and monetary tools to avoid a deeper slowdown.

Analytics Company Shares Its Opinion","Options traders have invested $640 million betting that Bitcoin will reach $120,000 by Dec. 27, but analysts say the chances of such a move are slim. According to research firm Kaiko, investors can instead focus on altcoins like XRP and Solana, which are poised to be real winners in the current market. “While the chances of BTC gaining another $15,000 in the next 10 days are slim, that doesn’t mean there won’t be gains in other assets,” Kaiko analysts wrote in a note today. Smaller cryptocurrencies like Solana, XRP, and Cardano have significantly outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum this year, with their momentum accelerating further following Donald Trump’s election victory, Kaiko noted. “All of these entities are poised to be big winners amid the changing regulatory landscape in the U.S.,” analysts wrote, pointing to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s expected departure on Jan. 20. Gensler, who led the agency’s aggressive crackdown on the crypto industry, has long been criticized by the crypto community and is now eagerly counting down to his own departure. Related News: BREAKING: Bloomberg Analyst Reveals Four Altcoins That Might Get ETF Approval: Also a Surprise One - “Two First, Then The Other Two May Come” Arthur Azizov, CEO of crypto payment provider B2BINPay, believes XRP has more room to grow. “It will potentially trade between $5 and $7 in the first half of 2025,” he told The Verge. Azizov also expects XRP to surpass its all-time high of $3.4 before the end of the year. Solana has fallen more than 15% since peaking at $263 in late November. Despite the decline, Solana is up 33% since the election. Analysts remain bullish on its long-term performance. Standard Chartered predicts that Solana could climb to around $700 by the end of 2025. Echoing this bullish sentiment, Philippe Bekhazi, CEO and co-founder of crypto trading firm XBTO, said: “SOL could then even surpass Ethereum in terms of total value.” Despite the focus on altcoins, analysts still predict significant growth for Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming year. Standard Chartered predicts that Bitcoin could rise to $200,000 by 2025, while Ethereum could reach $10,000. Meanwhile, 10x Research expects Bitcoin to climb to $120,000 by the time Trump takes office. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will Altcoins Revive Or Will Bitcoin Hit $120,000?

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin hits $107K, fueling altcoin and presale buzz. Discover 4 top crypto presales to watch for big 2025 gains. The crypto market is buzzing with excitement as 2024 nears its end, driven by Bitcoin setting numerous new all-time highs, most recently of $107,000. Altcoins and meme coins are reaping the benefits, while many crypto presales are receiving increased attention as investors look to capitalize on the bull market. Here are four top crypto presales to invest in for big gains in 2025. A closer look at the top 4 crypto presales to buy now Let’s now take an in-depth look at each of the four presale tokens – analyzing their utility and recent performance: Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is a new meme coin that combines Pepe-themed appeal with real-utility. The platform aims to build a strong community of like-minded investors that can compete with the Wall Street degens. All WEPE token holders will be given access to in-depth trading insights, strategies, and alpha calls. This will allow everyday investors to potentially make huge rewards in these volatile markets. To get access to all these trading insights, interested readers can purchase WEPE for just $0.0003644 per token, during the ongoing presale round. Wall Street Pepe has already raised a staggering $27 million in just a couple of weeks. From its total supply of 200 billion tokens – 40 billion are being allocated for the presale. The presale is also gaining attention due to the long-term rewards up for grabs through the staking mechanism. At press time, WEPE can be staked to generate an APY (Annual percentage yield) of 49%. So far, 16.2 billion tokens are staked on Wall Street Pepe. By the end of the presale, Wall Street Pepe aims to raise $62 million. You might also like: DOGE and PEPE prices dip as meme coin ICO raises $25M in record time Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Stars (STARS) is the world’s first unified staking mechanism for the biggest meme coins. On the platform’s MemeVault, meme coin lovers can stake their favorite digital assets, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Milady, and Pepe. In return, Crypto All-Stars will reward investors with regular passive income via STARS tokens. To incentivize the token’s growth, Crypto All-Stars will offer existing STARS token holders a 3x increase on the standard APY being provided through the MemeVault. STARS has a total supply of 42.069 billion tokens, of which 25% will be distributed as rewards from the MemeVault, and another 25% as rewards for directly staking STARS. Another 20% of the supply is being distributed for the STARS presale. So far, this successful presale has raised more than $19 million in a few months, though the presale ends in just 3 days, so there’s limited time to join before its launch. The innovative staking protocol has played an important role in making Crypto All-Stars one of the top-performing presales in 2024. Best Wallet Token The Best Wallet Token (BEST) is gaining significant attention as one of the top-performing presales of 2024. As the native token of Best Wallet, a secure, multi-chain, and non-custodial wallet, BEST combines creativity with real-world utility. Token holders benefit from reduced transaction fees, early access to new crypto presales via the wallet, governance access via voting rights, and higher staking returns through the staking aggregator. Furthermore, BEST can be staked to get up to a 553% APY on the staking mechanism. In just a couple of months, the presale has raised $4.5 million, with tokens priced at $0.0232 during the current round. The total 10 billion BEST token supply will be allocated for marketing strategies, presale, staking rewards, and exchange liquidity – showing it has the potential for widespread adoption. Flockerz Flockerz (FLOCK) has quickly emerged as one of the top meme coin presales, changing the space with its vote-to-earn platform and community-driven approach. At the heart of Flockerz is Flocktopia, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that empowers its community, ‘The Flock’. On the DAO, community members can vote on project proposals, influence key decisions, and earn STARS tokens as a reward for doing so. FLOCK can directly be staked on the ecosystem to generate an APY of 409%. Flockerz’s tokenomics allocates 25% of tokens to staking and another 25% to the DAO Vault, ensuring sustainability. Since its presale launch, FLOCK has raised an impressive $6.8 million in a few months. At press time, FLOCK is priced at $0.0064265 per token. With a vibrant community and unique rewards structure, we expect Flockerz to continue soaring on presale.

Based on these similarities, the analyst raised the possibility of the flagship crypto witnessing an 80% surge from its current level. Bitcoin Price Eyes 80% Surge If History Repeats Itself In an X post, Tony Severino suggested that the Bitcoin price could rally to $190,000 if history repeats itself. This came as the analyst drew a comparison between the 2024 and 2017 Bitcoin Elliott Wave count, which indicated that Bitcoin could replicate the price movement from the 2017 bull run. Related Reading: Time To Sell XRP? Price Completes Head And Shoulder Pattern, Suggesting Crash To $2.2 Is Imminent The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could reach $190,000 on the fifth wave, with this price target marking the peak for the flagship crypto in this cycle. This rally to $190,000 would be similar to how Bitcoin rose from $7,550 in the 2017 bull run to its market peak of $19,000. As to how this Bitcoin price rally to $190,000 will happen, the chart showed that Bitcoin could first retrace to around $104,000, then rally to around $123,000, followed by another price correction to $96,000. Once this price correction is done, Bitcoin will begin a new Elliott Wave count, which could eventually send its price to $190,000 on the Wave 5 impulsive move. In the meantime, the Bitcoin price is completing the Wave count, which began around late October, just before Donald Trump won the US presidential elections. Since then, Bitcoin has enjoyed bullish momentum and continued to reach new highs. The flagship crypto recently surged past $107,000 as optimism grows that Donald Trump’s administration will create the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. BTC Could Reach $125,000 Before The Year Ends Crypto analyst Justin Bennett predicted that the Bitcoin price could reach $125,000 before the year ends. This came as the analyst stated that Bitcoin is going “full Santa Claus” mode and isn’t showing signs of slowing down. Bennett remarked that pullbacks might be hard to come by through the end of the year. The crypto analyst added that any potential pullback is unlikely, especially given the speculation that Bitcoin will become a US reserve asset under Donald Trump. In line with this, Bennett said he won’t be surprised if the Bitcoin price hits $116,000 or even $125,000 by the end of December. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Bitcoin price continues to ascend to the moon. The analyst predicted that the flagship crypto could rise to as high as $158,000, although his accompanying chart suggested that would happen next year. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $106,559, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

In an announcement on December 17, Namada revealed that Gavin’s governance proposal aims to initiate a public goods funding campaign, which would airdrop NAM tokens to donors of the blockchain advocacy group Coin Center. The initiative is set to coincide with the holiday season. If the Namada community supports the proposal, the L1 blockchain will airdrop between 1 and 2 million NAM tokens to Coin Center. This allocation would represent approximately 2% to 4% of the PGF’s yearly budget. The team envisions a three-week campaign for the initiative. You might also like: Namada aims to pioneer new era of asset privacy on blockchain Community feedback has been largely positive, with many supporting funding for the U.S.-based Coin Center team. “So far our community likes this idea,” Gavin wrote. “Stakers, this is a signalling proposal to gauge your interest.

Coin Center’s advocacy work plays a significant role in addressing legal and regulatory issues impacting the crypto space in the United States. A recent ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals validated Coin Center’s argument that decentralized protocols and immutable smart contracts are not property and, therefore, cannot be sanctioned. This argument gained prominence following the legal case against crypto mixing service Tornado Cash . Coin Center has also shared its top policy priorities for the coming year. These include fighting against the unfair prosecution of developers of non-custodial software, protecting American crypto owners, pushing for sensible tax reforms, and achieving regulatory clarity around securities and commodities laws.

XRP: A fast, borderless cryptocurrency for secure transactions X R P is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to be fast, low-cost, open, and borderless. It operates on a decentralized system without central authority, making transactions irreversible and secure. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion, with 80 billion given to Ripple for development. Ripple uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, controlling supply through escrow. XRP aims to enable seamless payment transfers across various currencies. Its technology offers potential for quick and affordable transactions, appealing for efficient cross-border payments. Whether XRP is attractive in the current market depends on individual views of its technology and applications. ADA: Cardano’s scalable and sustainable cryptocurrency Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, enabling the development of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for storing value, making payments, and staking on the Cardano network. Cardano utilizes the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more sustainable than the traditional proof-of-work model. The blockchain is divided into 2 layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This design enhances scalability, potentially allowing up to a million transactions per second. With its focus on sustainability and scalability, ADA presents significant potential in the current market cycle. TRON: A decentralized platform for digital content and dapps TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform developed by the Tron Foundation in 2017. It aims to give content creators full ownership rights and fair rewards for their work. Originally deployed on Ethereum as ERC-20 tokens, TRX moved to its own network in 2018. TRON supports smart contracts, blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It allows developers to create dApps and users to access content without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. Transactions occur on a public ledger, similar to Bitcoin’s model. This technology could be attractive in the current market cycle as an alternative to Ethereum, offering lower transaction fees and encouraging direct interaction between creators and consumers. Solana: A Scalable blockchain for high-performance applications Solana (SOL) is a blockchain platform built for scalability, enabling high-speed transactions and decentralized applications (dapps). Competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, it focuses on rapid transaction processing without relying on sharding or second-layer solutions. Solana’s architecture supports flexible development across multiple programming languages, making it attractive for developers building high-performance dapps. The native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network supporters. With its high-capacity network, Solana aims to host products and services that require quick and efficient processing, highlighting its potential in the evolving blockchain technology landscape. Conclusion While XRP, ADA, TRX, and SOL show steady promise, DOGEN offers exceptional short-term potential. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN is expected to grow by 700% by the end of the presale, with possible thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following successes like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of alpha leaders with real benefits for early adopters.

37768654,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629201,1734463206,Geopolitics to weigh on semiconductor industry in 2025: KPMG survey,"The semiconductor industry is poised for a good 2025, but geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions are seen offsetting further growth, according to a recent KPMG study. According to a KPMG 20th annual Global Semiconductor Outlook report by the US audit, tax, and advisory firm, as well as the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA), executives in the sector are generally optimistic about achieving overall growth in 2025 . The executives are also aware of the headwinds ahead in the next two to three years, which require adaptation strategies. KPMG projects a challenging 2025 The report shows that about 92% of the semiconductor executives who were interviewed during the survey are upbeat about their 2025 prospects. Bright prospects are anchored on the prevailing strong demand for chips for the AI industry, cloud computing, data centers, wireless communication, and automotive applications according to data from the KPMG and GSA. This also comes as the KMPG Semiconductor Industry Confidence Index improved to 59 compared to 54 recorded in 2023, another indicator of optimism and confidence in the industry. According to the report , a value above 50 reflects a more positive outlook than a negative one. This also shows confidence across factors such as revenue growth, growth in profitability, workplace growth research and development spending as well as capital expenditure. “AI underpins the industry’s near-term growth and revenue expectations,” said KPMG technology media & telecommunications leader Mark Gibson, in a statement. “The upward trajectory for the industry in the short-term is clear, but the companies that can manage their supply chains and attract and retain talent will be the ones well-positioned to sustain and benefit from the AI boom.” Gibson. However, it is not going to be all rosy for the sector. The interviewed executives are also anticipating 2025 to be a challenging year due to geo-political territorialism such as tariffs and trade restrictions. US President-elect Donald Trump has revealed plans to impose tariffs on his first day in office in January. According to the report, executives in the semiconductor industry who were interviewed view armed conflicts and tariffs as the most concerning geopolitical challenges that could hamper the industry’s ecosystem in the next two years. They also highlighted government subsidies and the nationalization of semiconductor technology among the top problems expected in the next few years. The sector will require adaptive strategies: KPMG Faced with such challenges, the report suggests strengthening supply chain resilience and flexibility, together with talent development and retention will be critical as demand for chips continues to rise. According to the KPMG report, businesses in the semiconductor industry will need adaptive strategies to navigate the complex environment. In response to the anticipated challenges, the leaders in the semiconductor industry are increasing geographic diversity to enhance supply chain resiliency. These have highlighted that making the supply chain more flexible and adaptive to geopolitical changes should be a top strategic priority. The executives are also on the lookout for disruption as non-traditional semiconductor companies (tech giants platform companies, and automotive companies) shape their place in the industry. “Tech giants and established semiconductor players are starting to battle for market share, with ongoing technical developments and optimization of chips for AI aiming to enhance and provide alternatives for AI training and inferencing capabilities,” said KPMG global semiconductor leader Lincoln Clark, in a statement. “As the industry becomes more competitive, significant investments and cutting-edge strategies will be essential for companies to not only survive but thrive in this rapidly evolving landscape.” Clark. According to VB , the Global Semiconductor Industry Outlook report will be available early next year. The report captures insights from 156 semiconductor executives with more than 50% of them coming from firms with $1 billion or more in annual revenue. The survey also had mid-size companies – with an annual revenue of between $100 million to $999 million as well as small businesses that make less than $100 million in annual revenue. The executives are upbeat their businesses will grow in revenue and a third of the executives projecting revenue growth by at least 10%. Most of the executives – 86% – strongly believe their businesses will grow with almost half expecting that growth to exceed 10%. Almost all the executives (92% are positive about overall industry growth, projecting total revenue for the sector to grow by more than 10%.

As digital currencies progress, investors are eyeing opportunities that promise long-term value. With so many coins making headlines, how do you decide where to put your money? Recently, we’ve seen Litecoin’s price dip slightly despite a massive surge in its trading volume, while Hedera is making headlines with its high-profile collaboration in the luxury car marketplace. But the standout story right now is Qubetics ($TICS), a project rapidly gaining attention due to its innovative approach and presale success. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Qubetics, Litecoin, and Hedera. Qubetics: The Best Crypto to Buy and Hold Now for Web3 and Unrivalled Privacy What if you could secure your internet activities with the assurance that no central authority controlled your data? Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a project that is set to revolutionise online privacy and blockchain infrastructure. As part of its extensive Web3 framework, Qubetics will introduce a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service to give users ultimate control over their data. Unlike conventional VPN providers, which can track, restrict, or censor user activity, Qubetics’ dVPN runs on a fully decentralised peer-to-peer network, ensuring complete privacy. Blockchain technology enhances this system, providing transparency and resistance to censorship. Moreover, Qubetics is committed to rewarding users for contributing to the network. Those who provide bandwidth are compensated with TICS tokens, creating an active bandwidth-sharing marketplace. This incentivisation model ensures strong participation and a thriving, secure ecosystem. The service also prioritises privacy with end-to-end encryption and multi-hop routing, safeguarding user identities while offering a seamless, anonymous browsing experience. Recently, Qubetics held an AMA session , engaging with its growing community to answer questions and clarify concerns about the platform’s future. The excitement surrounding this new addition to the Web3 world is palpable, and it’s clear that Qubetics is preparing to impact the privacy and security space significantly. Litecoin: A Dipping Price But Soaring Demand Litecoin has seen some turbulence lately, with its price dropping almost 1% to $115. However, despite this price dip, the cryptocurrency has witnessed a surge in trading volume, rising by 25% to $933.3 million. This renewed interest indicates that investors are closely watching Litecoin’s movements. In fact, Litecoin’s hash rate has surged by over 50% in the past week, reaching an all-time high of 1.74 PH/S, signalling stronger network security and increased mining activity. At the same time, Litecoin’s Open Interest in derivatives has increased by 1%, totalling $506.07 million, further reflecting the growing interest from both institutional and retail investors. Though Litecoin’s price has seen a slight dip, its overall trajectory remains positive, with significant growth over the past month and year. Investors will be keenly watching to see if this trend continues. Hedera: A Solid 2024 with New Partnerships Hedera has certainly made its mark this year. Closing out 2024, the network is poised to continue its upward trajectory, particularly following a groundbreaking partnership with CryptoAutos, the world’s first crypto-powered luxury car marketplace. This collaboration introduces Hedera’s technology into the high-end vehicle market, revolutionising the way luxury cars are bought and sold globally. This partnership ensures fast, secure, and economical transactions, a key selling point for Hedera as it continues to build utility in the real world. Additionally, Hedera’s strong presence in the growing AI sector adds to its bullish outlook. With HBAR trading steadily around $0.30, many analysts predict a rise to $0.50 by Q1 2025, thanks to Hedera’s expanding network and increasing adoption. Qubetics Presale: The Best Crypto to Buy and Hold Now Now is the perfect time to get in on Qubetics ($TICS) as it enters Presale Phase 13. Currently priced at just $0.034, the presale has already raised over $6.9 million, with more than 10,300 holders and 350 million tokens sold. But there’s more—each phase brings a 10% price increase, with the final phase seeing a 20% jump. This unique pricing strategy has created immense excitement and anticipation, drawing investors eager to secure their positions early. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy and hold now , Qubetics presents a compelling opportunity. As demand rises, the potential for future gains becomes increasingly clear. Given the presale’s success and the dVPN, it’s easy to see why many are viewing Qubetics as one of the most exciting crypto projects. Conclusion: The Best Crypto to Buy and Hold Now As we look towards the future of cryptocurrency, it’s clear that Qubetics is leading the way, offering innovative solutions and an exciting presale that’s attracting significant investor attention. While Litecoin and Hedera continue to make their mark, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as the best crypto to buy and hold now, with its decentralised VPN and token incentives providing unmatched growth potential. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy and hold now, Qubetics presents an investment opportunity that’s hard to ignore—especially with its current presale in full swing. Don’t miss out on being part of something truly transformative in the crypto world.

Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box, Cabana predicted what he called a “hawkish rate cut” tomorrow as the central bank maneuvers to stabilize economic conditions while maintaining its resolute stance on keeping inflation under control. “The Fed believes it has been in a restrictive stance for a long time and aims to normalize monetary policy,” Cabana said. He noted signs of moderation in the labor market, including a slight increase in jobless claims and a cooling in employment data, while inflation remains persistent. The central bank likely fears that delaying a rate cut could disrupt markets and force it to ease gradually, Cabana said. Cabana said the Fed will continue to closely monitor inflation expectations, which he called the “first most important” indicator. If inflation persists or accelerates again, the Fed could be forced to reverse course and raise rates again, an outcome that is not currently in market forecasts. Related News: One of the Biggest Altcoins Announces Its Largest Update Ever - Here Are the Details “Inflation that has been above target for four or five years could push expectations even higher, forcing the Fed to tighten again,” Cabana warned. Cabana also addressed concerns about the growth of the $36 trillion-plus U.S. debt and its impact on interest rates. While the Fed remains primarily focused on inflation and employment, rising interest costs could put upward pressure on long-term rates. Bond markets are already reflecting this concern, with 30-year Treasuries trading at a significant discount to the expected path of overnight yields. Looking ahead, Cabana sees rates holding steady if inflation cools along with the labor market. But any signs that inflation is accelerating again could sharply change the outlook, especially for longer-term yields. *This is not investment advice.

According to a new Bloomberg report , Marszalek and Trump recently met at Mar-a-Lago to discuss the possibility of a national Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, among other things. The exchange’s native token Cronos ( CRO ) shot up over 25% as news of the CEO’s meeting with Trump. Says a Crypto.com representative of the meeting, “We look forward to working with the new administration to develop and advance clear regulations for the crypto industry so the US can become a global leader in digital assets and innovation.” The crypto industry, including some of the space’s largest exchanges, has reacted positively to Trump’s win, which is largely viewed as a boon to the booming cryptosphere. Said a Coinbase spokesperson to Bloomberg on the matter, “We’re gratified by the degree that the new incoming administration team has had an open door with Coinbase and the crypto community.” A Crypto.com spokesperson mirrored those sentiments while saying the firm has already withdrawn its lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “We withdrew our action against the SEC given our intent to work with the incoming administration on a regulatory framework for the industry.” CRO is trading for $0.193 at time of writing, up 12% on the day.

37768198,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629167,1734462029,Anti-crypto SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw gets kicked out,"Caroline Crenshaw is out. The SEC commissioner, famous for her anti-crypto stance, won’t be getting a second term. The Senate Banking Committee abruptly canceled tomorrow’s scheduled renomination vote. Just like that, one of crypto’s most vocal adversaries is off the field. Crenshaw’s four-year run in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) left a trail of tension, frustration, and courtroom battles. Appointed in 2020 under President Donald Trump, she quickly turned into a regulatory thorn for the crypto industry. Her opposition to Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year might’ve been the final straw. Crenshaw often said that crypto markets were “petri dishes of fraud.” Critics argue she spent her entire term proving that theory instead of helping regulate the space constructively. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wasn’t subtle about it, saying she was “worse than Gensler.” He added that: “Her policies hurt more than they helped.” Crenshaw’s crypto blockade Caroline Crenshaw made headlines in January when she voted against approving spot Bitcoin ETFs. It was a critical moment for crypto. Years of effort by major firms, court battles, and rising public demand pushed Bitcoin ETFs to the center of the financial world. Crenshaw, though, was unmoved. She voted no, citing fears of market manipulation and inadequate investor protections. She wasn’t alone, but the industry wasn’t having it. A federal court had just ruled that previous SEC rejections were “arbitrary and capricious,” a decision that made Crenshaw’s refusal look like stubbornness at best — hostility at worst. Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty was among the first to speak out. “Her position was indefensible after the courts ruled against them,” he said. Crenshaw once described crypto markets as dangerous playgrounds for fraudsters and manipulators. “Investor safety has to come first,” she said repeatedly. Crypto’s war with the SEC loses two key players Under Crenshaw’s watch, SEC enforcement actions ramped up, targeting platforms like Coinbase and Binance for alleged securities violations. The industry’s complaints were loud: regulations were unclear, inconsistent, and overly punitive. Crenshaw disagreed. She argued crypto firms were ignoring laws that had existed for decades. “The rules are clear,” she said in one meeting, “crypto needs to follow them.” Leaders like Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini, accused the SEC of losing credibility under its Democratic leadership. He pointed to Crenshaw’s role in escalating the regulatory war. “The SEC has become hostile, and it’s holding back innovation,” he said. To many, her policies raised costs and uncertainty without solving the problems she claimed to fight. Compliance requirements tightened. Lawsuits mounted. And innovation? It either slowed or moved offshore. The Senate’s decision to cancel her renomination suggests those complaints finally resonated. With crypto becoming a bigger political issue, it’s clear Crenshaw’s hardline approach didn’t age well in Washington. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, her closest ally in cracking down on crypto, recently announced he’s stepping down on January 20, 2025 — the same day President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Gensler’s resignation aligns with Trump’s goal to overhaul financial regulators and reverse “overreach.” Possibility of Crenshaw’s Renomination Caroline Crenshaw is still on the SEC commission and can continue to serve until a replacement is confirmed, or until Congress adjourns next year. According to the usual Congressional process, the minority party (Democrats in this case) would recommend nominees to fill minority seats on the commission, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported. Still, the President isn’t required to follow their advice. Although many in the crypto community are celebrating her exit, it’s possible that Democrats, possibly with the support of Elizabeth Warren, could propose Crenshaw for renomination. Ultimately, it will be up to President Trump to decide whether to re-nominate her himself. For crypto, it’s a rare win in a regulatory battle that’s felt one-sided for years. The timing is no coincidence. Industry analysts believe Trump’s incoming administration will take a softer approach to crypto. Trump himself has criticized the SEC’s aggressive enforcement strategy, calling it bad for business and innovation.

This innovative token, PropiChain , powered by blockchain and AI, promises to redefine property investment while delivering extraordinary returns. With predictions of a massive 40,000% ROI by Q1 2025, the excitement is clear. But what makes this altcoin stand out, and why is it poised for such explosive growth? Let’s dive into the details and uncover the reasons behind the hype. Solana Traders Set Their Sights on PropiChain: The Next Big Opportunity Solana has been one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency space, celebrated for its high-speed transactions and low fees. Recently, its market performance has drawn renewed interest as traders eye diversification opportunities in the broader crypto market. With PropiChain emerging as a promising real estate altcoin, many Solana traders are turning their attention to this undervalued gem. The allure of PropiChain lies in its practical use cases and potential for extraordinary growth, much like Solana during its early days. While Solana established itself as a blockchain powerhouse for decentralized apps, PropiChain is doing the same in the property investment sector. Traders see PropiChain’s unique model as a game-changer by addressing the global real estate market, bringing blockchain’s efficiency and transparency to an industry often plagued by high costs, limited access, and fraud. Solana traders, familiar with the transformative potential of technology, see PropiChain as a project poised for exponential growth, much like Solana itself during its rise. PropiChain is Transforming Real Estate Investment with Game-Changing Features PropiChain is rewriting the rules of property investment, blending blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and Metaverse to revolutionize the way we buy, sell, and manage real estate. Here’s how its standout features are making waves: Real Estate Tokenization and Fractional Ownership PropiChain’s tokenization feature allows investors to purchase digital tokens representing fractional ownership of real estate assets. For example, an investor with $500 can buy a portion of a high-value property, earning rental income proportional to their stake. This lowers the barrier to entry, making real estate accessible to a global audience, from smaller investors to seasoned portfolio builders. AI-Powered Predictive Analytics PropiChain’s AI tools provide investors with real-time insights and market trends. For instance, an investor is deciding whether to buy tokens for a luxury rental property. With PropiChain’s AI-driven analytics, they can access data on projected rental yields, occupancy rates, and market forecasts. These insights empower users to make informed decisions, minimizing risks and maximizing profitability. Metaverse and Virtual Property Exploration PropiChain integrates metaverse technology, allowing users to virtually tour properties from the comfort of their homes. This immersive feature enhances convenience and widens investment opportunities. Smart Contract Automation PropiChain eliminates the need for cumbersome paperwork and intermediaries through smart contracts. For example, when a tenant pays rent, the blockchain automatically distributes funds to property owners based on their ownership stakes. This ensures transparency, reduces administrative costs, and streamlines the entire leasing process. Enhanced Security and Fraud Prevention Traditional real estate transactions are often marred by fraud and title disputes. PropiChain’s blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable. Each tokenized property is linked to verified documentation, providing peace of mind to investors. These features aren’t just technological innovations; they solve real-world problems. PropiChain Presale: The Road to 40,000% ROI by Q1 2025 PropiChain’s presale has ignited excitement across the crypto community. In its first stage, the presale generated over $1 million, a testament to the confidence investors have in its vision. With stage 2 ongoing, tokens are priced at just $0.011, presenting another golden opportunity for early adopters. The roadmap ahead is equally thrilling. Analysts predict that PropiChain could deliver a staggering 40,000% ROI by Q1 2025. To put this into perspective, an investor who buys $1,000 worth of tokens at the current presale price could see their investment turn to $400,000 within just a few quarters. As PropiChain gears up for its official launch, the presale represents a critical moment to get in early. The token is gaining traction already with its recent listing on CoinMarketCap . Additionally, the project’s BlockAudit review shows its commitment to transparency and security. Conclusion As Solana traders and crypto enthusiasts flock to this undervalued altcoin, its potential to deliver 40,000% ROI by Q1 2025 becomes harder to ignore. PropiChain is a revolution in property investment. Its innovative features set it apart from speculative tokens. And with its presale generating over $1 million and stage 2 offering tokens at $0.011, now is the time to act. Early adopters stand to gain the most as PropiChain moves closer to launch and achieves its growth milestones.

37767920,https://blockworks.co/news/stacks-sbtc-double-dipping,1734462000,Double-dipping with sBTC on Stacks,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Bitcoin maxis, it’s time to take notice — sBTC on Stacks is here, and it’s designed to let your bitcoin work overtime, according to Andre Serrano, head of product at Stacks. “The nice thing about this is that you are eligible for this yield both by holding it as well as deploying it in DeFi,” Serrano told Blockworks. Here’s the alpha: Mint and hold sBTC — by bridging bitcoin into sBTC (a 1:1 bitcoin-backed asset secured via Stacks), users become eligible for rewards (bitcoinismore.org) paid out in bitcoin, not points or inflationary tokens. Rewards are distributed every two weeks — BTC in, BTC out — simple and clean Deploy in DeFi — The rewards don’t need to stop there. Stacks-native DeFi protocols like Zest offer additional incentives on top of the base 5%. For example, by supplying sBTC in Zest, a bitcoin liquidity protocol, users can stack another 6-7% APY in extra incentives. The kicker? Unlike other BTC-pegged solutions, sBTC stays liquid — you don’t need to stake or lock it up to earn rewards. However, there’s one caveat: Withdrawals back to the Bitcoin network will only be enabled in March 2025. So, for the most trust-minimized way to bridge back, you’ll need to wait. But sBTC is expected to soon be bridgeable to chains like Solana and Aptos via Axelar, anticipated for January. So, there could be a circuitous route back to Bitcoin via these protocols, subject to liquidity constraints. On Stacks, sBTC currently relies on a threshold signature 15-key multisig setup, where 15 signers from the community manage deposits and withdrawals. This operates under an honest majority assumption, meaning at least 11 of the 15 signers must act honestly for the system to remain secure. To bolster trust, Stacks has onboarded reputable, professional signers like Blockdaemon and Kiln, firms known for securing billions in assets across multiple chains. These signers also post collateral and earn bitcoin rewards for maintaining the protocol, aligning incentives to ensure security. Looking ahead, the plan is to gradually decentralize the system by integrating sBTC into the Stacks consensus mechanism, where all Stacks signers will eventually participate. This will further enhance security, bringing trust assumptions closer to those of Stacks itself. Updated Dec. 17, 2024 at 3 pm ET: Clarified the honest majority assumption has a 70% majority threshold — meaning 11 out of 15 signers must act honestly, rather than 8 as previously stated.

Crenshaw, known for her opposition to cryptocurrency initiatives, including her vote against Bitcoin spot ETFs, faced significant scrutiny from crypto advocates. The decision to abandon the vote is attributed to a lack of floor time, as noted by a Senate aide. This development comes as Senate control is set to shift in January, raising questions about future regulatory approaches to cryptocurrency. Crenshaw's departure is viewed as a victory for the crypto sector, which has criticized her hardline stance on digital assets.

Scientist Makes the Ultimate Conclusion,"Quantum computers, which leverage the principles of quantum mechanics for unprecedented computational power, are getting closer to posing a real threat to Bitcoin's security, according to experts. That threat became even more apparent last week when Google unveiled its latest quantum processing chip, Willow, which offers a 56% performance boost over its predecessor. If developments continue at this pace, researchers predict that quantum computers could compromise Bitcoin’s encryption within the next five years. “We are about five years away from commercial quantum computers being able to crack the elliptic curve keys that secure Bitcoin wallets,” said Pierre-Luc Dallaire-Demers, a quantum physicist and visiting scientist at the University of Calgary. Bitcoin relies on two key encryption methods: ECDSA-256 and SHA-256. ECDSA-256 encryption secures Bitcoin wallets and signs transactions using public-private key pairs. However, this encryption is vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, a quantum algorithm that can quickly factor large numbers, which could reveal the private keys behind Bitcoin wallets. Related News: BREAKING: Bloomberg Analyst Reveals Four Altcoins That Might Get ETF Approval: Also a Surprise One - “Two First, Then The Other Two May Come” “Breaking these keys is one of the easiest applications for large quantum computers,” Dallaire-Demers said. In comparison, SHA-256, the encryption used in Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining process, is less at risk. According to digital asset firm Galaxy, the hash length can be doubled to secure it against quantum attacks. But defending Bitcoin’s ECDSA encryption would require fundamental changes to its cryptographic infrastructure, which is no easy feat for the $3.8 trillion cryptocurrency industry. The most vulnerable wallets are old Pay-To-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses created before 2012, which expose public keys to direct quantum attacks. The funds in these wallets, which are estimated to contain 1.1 million Bitcoins worth over $113 billion and belong to the mysterious founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, could be among the first to go missing if quantum computing advances. *This is not investment advice.

37767860,https://crypto.news/?p=14320183,1734461886,Could Solana dethrone Ethereum? SOL eyes $350 target by 2025,"Solana and Ethereum have competed for dominance throughout Q4 2024. Ethereum secured over $850 million in institutional capital inflow to ETFs, while Solana attracted over $300 million in cross-chain inflows within the past week. Market experts and reports suggest Solana is poised to beat Ethereum and replace ETH as the largest altcoin in crypto. 2025 is therefore a pivotal year for Ether and Solana, the latter’s competitive edge lies in DEX metrics and its growth potential alongside rising capital inflows. Solana’s win could bring changes to portfolios and Ethereum beta plays could suffer a correction in the event SOL dethrones ETH. This deep-dive can prepare traders effectively for the changing dynamics in crypto. Table of Contents Solana vs. Ethereum These catalysts could bolster Solana adoption Technical analysis targets for Solana and Ethereum Solana cools down after Pump.fun pulls the plug on livestreams Solana vs. Ethereum Solana outpaced competitor Ether in several key areas in 2024. After outperforming Ethereum in October and November 2024, Solana is neck and neck with Ether in December. Data from TheBlock shows that SOL and ETH are competing in app revenue, app fees, and decentralized exchange volume. In terms of app fees, Ethereum garnered $311.1 million this month, against Solana’s $322.8 million. Ethereum vs Solana App fees | Source: TheBlock Solana outperformed Ethereum in App revenue in October and November 2024, in December Ethereum clocked $93.56 million and Solana dominated with $140.95 million. Ethereum vs Solana App revenue | Source: TheBlock In terms of DEX volume, Solana leads with $67.43 billion, Ethereum lags at $52.37 billion, per TheBlock data. Solana based DEXes have observed a large volume of token launches and trades in Q4 2024, this is likely the catalyst driving DEX volume on the SOL chain. Ethereum vs Solana DEX Volume | Source: TheBlock Solana’s growing dominance in DeFi is evident from the comparison between the two chains. SOL looks poised to outperform Ethereum in DEX metrics in December as well, extending its streak from the last two months. These catalysts could bolster Solana adoption Solana ETF approval by the U.S. Securities and exchange commission could legitimize SOL and bolster the altcoin’s adoption among crypto market participants. Ethereum’s ETF adoption supported capital inflows to the altcoin and in the last week alone, ETH garnered over $850 million from institutional investors. Solana gained over $300 million from different blockchains, of which $200 million was transferred from Ethereum, just last week. Solana-based DEXes are closing the gap with centralized exchanges in the crypto ecosystem. Advancement and scalability is slowly bolstering the utility of DEXes and driving active user count higher every week. Anmol Singh, co-founder of Zeta Markets told crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “Solana is on track to cement itself as the dominant player in DeFi and on-chain applications by 2025. With its low fees, high speed, and growing ecosystem, it’s positioned perfectly to absorb the capital flowing into DeFi. The breakthroughs in DEX performance and scalability will continue to push centralized exchanges out of the way, shifting the focus to decentralized platforms that are faster, fairer, and more transparent.” Crypto market participants are looking forward to the Petra upgrade which is expected to vastly improve Ethereum’s speed and performance. Meanwhile, Solana’s Frankendancer and Firedancer upgrades promise to transform the SOL network, boosting accessibility, uptime, and overall performance.

The cooldown in terms of on-chain activity and network revenue, experienced by SOL is likely the result of Pump.fun’s recent steps. The SOL network generated an average of nearly $5 million in fees per day, nearly 50% lower than the network’s daily average fees generated during the third week of November, where it noted the highest-ever single-day revenue at $13.3 million.

42389193,44583342-9333-40c3-989b-9ba0ed8805e0,1734461723,Next U.S. Senate Banking Chair Calls Crypto 'Next Wonder' of World,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The crypto industry got a promise for action Tuesday from the Republican U.S. lawmakers who will have the authority to move digital assets legislation, with key members of the Senate and House of Representatives saying the sector will finally get what it's awaited for years.  The incoming Republican chair of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Senator Tim Scott, and his counterpart on the House Financial Services Committee, Representative French Hill, were welcomed with enthusiasm by a Blockchain Association crowd in Washington, in sharp contrast to the uncertain tone of the same event last year. The two lawmakers said at the policy event that both chambers of Congress and the administration of President-elect Donald Trump will all be pulling in the same direction to make legislation happen.   The two starting points, they said, will be the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) — the bill to establish comprehensive crypto market guardrails that cleared the House this year by a wide bipartisan margin — and a stablecoin bill that was close to a bipartisan deal but ground to a halt over a few sticking points around the role of the federal and state governments.  ""Congress needs to do its job, find a compromise and put things right,"" Hill said, suggesting his aim is to get passage of crypto market-structure legislation — something ""like FIT21"" — in the first few months of the session.  That's a familiar message from the House side of Congress, but it's the Senate that had long been the source of resistance. Senator Scott will soon arrive in his committee chairmanship with a stark reversal of Democrat predecessor Senator Sherrod Brown's crypto suspicion.   ""In my opinion, it is the next wonder of the world,"" he said, also promising that his panel would have a crypto offshoot. ""I'm going to be the chairman that creates a digital assets subcommittee for the first time.""  Senator Brown, the current chairman, lost his Ohio Senate race in November, overcome by Republican Bernie Moreno, a blockchain businessman. Brown had been a key constraint to crypto progress in the Senate, though the new top Democrat of the committee will be Senator Elizabeth Warren, the progressive firebrand from Massachusetts, who is expected to loudly criticize crypto from the sidelines in the next couple of years.  Scott acknowledged, ""She's very good at what she does.""  But he said, ""I think the future's incredibly bright,"" and he said he's already started conversations on crypto policy.  Scott also just met with David Sacks, Trump’s incoming crypto czar, the senator announced Tuesday in a statement that praised digital assets as having the ""potential to democratize the financial world.""  Hill argued that crypto legislation can't properly happen without wide bipartisan support.  ""To win, ultimately, you need 60 votes in the Senate,"" he noted. ""You need to build consensus.""  Most Republicans have drifted into the crypto camp over the years, a trend that accelerated since last year. But some Democrats — often younger lawmakers — have joined them, culminating in 71 Democrat votes for FIT21 in the House. But the Senate will be closely divided, with 53 Republicans to 47 Democrats, so both parties must be involved in any major initiative.   SEC's role  Also at the Blockchain Association Policy Summit on Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's two Republican commissioners — Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce — spoke about the changes they expect at the agency next year.   Uyeda criticized the agency's crypto accounting standard, the controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), which he said had ""very, very wide-ranging ramifications"" for a policy that didn't go through the proper channels.  Peirce said that while the regulator awaits new digital assets laws from Congress, ""we can say some of this stuff is just outside our jurisdiction.""  ""We can certainly work closely with the CFTC,"" she said. ""We stand ready to work on things once that's a possibility. … I think there are a lot of places for us to help.""  The SEC's sister regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will likely take a larger role in crypto in the future. That agency was represented at the same event by Republican Commissioner Summer Mersinger, who told the industry audience that it can expect a different future approach to enforcement.   ""I'm not saying enforcement will go away,"" she said. ""What enforcement will focus on is fraud.""

37767594,https://finbold.com/?p=220338,1734461258,Buy signal for two strong cryptocurrencies this week,"The cryptocurrency market is once again showcasing its dynamic and volatile nature, capturing the attention of traders and investors navigating shifting trends. After a sluggish start to the month, the global market has rebounded sharply, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) surging to a new all-time high of $108,268, reigniting optimism across the digital asset space. As uncertainty continues to loom over traditional financial markets, Finbold analyzed the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) heatmap from CoinGlass on December 17 to identify emerging buy opportunities and provide investors with potential entry points during this critical phase of the market. XRP XRP has demonstrated significant bullish momentum, currently trading at $2.6374, up 7.78% over the last 12 hours, as buying pressure continues to drive the asset higher. The RSI on the 24-hour chart stands at 69.04, reflecting strong momentum while approaching the overbought zone. This signals growing investor interest and sustained demand as XRP solidifies its upward trajectory. Yet, XRP’s overbought weekly RSI (86.66) suggests caution in higher time frames. Crypto Market RSI Heatmap, 12-hour chart: XRP. Source: CoinGlass Despite short-term caution from oscillators like Momentum and MACD, which hint at possible mild corrections, the overall trend remains bullish. XRP’s 12-hour RSI of 62.52 far exceeds the broader market’s average RSI of 44.24, highlighting its outperformance relative to most cryptocurrencies. This divergence shows increasing investor confidence in XRP, even as the broader market remains neutral. Supporting the rally is a robust technical structure , with moving averages across both short- and long-term periods flashing clear buy signals. XRP remains well above critical support levels, including the 10-period and 200-period moving averages, which reinforces its position in a sustained uptrend. For traders and investors, XRP’s relative strength and strong technical confluence present a compelling case for further upside. AAVE Aave ( AAVE ) presents a promising buy opportunity for traders and investors, supported by strong technical indicators and favorable market conditions . Currently trading at $364.06, AAVE has seen a modest 1.19% decline in the past 12 hours, offering a potential entry point before its next upward move. Crypto Market RSI Heatmap, 12-hour chart: AAVE. Source: CoinGlass The 12-hour RSI at 66.4 indicates AAVE is approaching bullish territory but remains below the overbought zone, while the four-hour RSI at 49.22 reflects neutral momentum, leaving room for further upside. Moving averages signal a strong bullish outlook, with 13 out of 14 indicators suggesting a buy, reinforcing AAVE’s positive trend. The MACD level further highlights growing buying interest and upward momentum. With robust technical support and a recovering market, this short-term pullback positions AAVE as an attractive opportunity for traders and investors looking to capitalize on its potential for continued gains. However, it is important to note that RSI should not be considered the sole indicator for investment decisions. A well-rounded strategy that integrates multiple technical indicators, prevailing market conditions, and fundamental analysis will provide a more comprehensive and reliable perspective.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Holders of Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys, Rogs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs) were eligible to participate in the airdrop, which went live at 8:00 a.m. ET. The PENGU token was announced by Pudgy Penguins on December 5. The token aims to give millions of Pudgy Penguins fans and a wider audience a way to connect more directly with the brand. 88 Days Claim Period According to recent reports, more than 88 billion PENGU tokens are now circulating on the Solana blockchain. The allocation is structured to benefit multiple holder categories. The CEO of the project, Luca Netz noted that in order to claim the tokens, the users would have to link both their Ethereum and Solana wallets. The users also needed to have SOL tokens of at least $10 value in their wallets for the gas fees. The claim period will be 88 days, and any unused tokens will be burnt after that period elapses. $PENGU is now live.

Another 17.8% is designated for team members under a one-year cliff and three-year vesting period, with 11.48% retained by the company under similar conditions. Notably, the Holders of Pudgy Toys, physical plushies inspired by the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection available at Walmart and Target, are also eligible for PENGU tokens. The toys are linked to the Pudgy World metaverse and built on Igloo’s Ethereum Layer 2 Abstract Chain, which is currently in testnet. Once the mainnet is live, a PENGU bridge via LayerZero will allow toy buyers to claim their tokens. Token Price Surges 800%! Strikingly, PENGU achieving a trading volume of approximately $90 million in its first hour and within 24 hours, the token’s price surged by 870%, reaching an all time high of $0.05. Also, the token’s market capitalization reached $3 billion which placed PENGU among the 200 best cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Trader Makes $8.36 Million Profit in 20 minutes One of the most significant transactions involved a trader who made a $8.36 million profit within 20 minutes through the token’s price surge as he bought 239.6 million PENGU using 23,742 SOL and then sold the tokens for 60,726 SOL. The team said on Discord that in addition to the Pudgy Penguins community, approximately 7 million wallets are eligible to claim PENGU tokens, including users who have interacted with various protocols and members of different communities. Binance, OKX, Bybit Include PENGU Several centralized exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Bybit have included PENGU. Binance also revealed that it would enable PENGU on various products such as Binance Futures allowing for up to 75x leverage on PENGU/USDT Perpetual Contracts. OKX also added the token to its spot trading market. The release of PENGU has positively influenced the Pudgy Penguins NFT market. The floor price for the Pudgy Penguins collection increased to 34.1 ETH (approximately $136,000), marking a 2.6% rise, placing the collection as the second most expensive in the NFT market, following CryptoPunks.",POSITIVE,SOL,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pudgy-penguins-launches-pengu-on-solana-with-88-day-claim-period-price-soars-over-800/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37767644,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629147,1734460837,Why Powell and the Fed should hold off on rate cuts next year,"Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve are staring down a market that’s already counting on a rate cut this month. Investors have latched onto the latest inflation numbers like it’s a done deal — but it’s not. The Fed’s target is 2%, and the path to get there isn’t as smooth as Wall Street wants you to believe. But if Powell folds now, he risks throwing fuel on a fire that hasn’t been fully extinguished. Inflation data from November is the perfect example of why caution should rule the day. Consumer price inflation inched up to 2.7% , slightly above October’s 2.6%. Core inflation — the measure that cuts out food and energy — is still stuck at 3.3%. That’s the fourth month in a row, which tells you something: the progress we saw earlier in the year may have hit a wall. The Fed doesn’t rely on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) alone; it leans on the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. PCE inflation is running closer to 2%, but only because it gives less weight to shelter costs — rents, in particular, which have been a main culprit in pushing up CPI. Shelter costs are showing signs of slowing, and that’s good. But it’s not enough. The labor market isn’t giving the Fed room to cut Powell’s second problem is the labor market. Unemployment remains near historic lows. Real wages are climbing, up 1.3% compared to last year. That sounds like great news for workers, but it’s a problem for inflation. A tight labor market means employers are paying more, and those costs get passed along. In November, services prices — excluding housing and energy — jumped another 0.3%. That’s above what the Fed’s inflation target allows. Car prices are another headache. They’re still elevated, and so are travel costs. Flights, hotels, and rentals — none of them are showing meaningful relief. Combine that with strong wage growth, and you see why inflation hasn’t rolled over yet. Then there’s the wildcard: Mr. President Donald Trump. His policy proposals aren’t helping Powell’s case. Trump wants tariffs, and not just a little. He’s floated the idea of a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and even a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada. Economists can’t agree on what happens next. For some, the tariffs are temporary, just a way to bring trading partners to the table. Others think they’re here to stay. Either way, tariffs raise prices, and Powell knows that. Trump is also pushing for tax cuts, which could pump more money into the economy. More money means more spending, and that keeps inflation alive. A majority of economists surveyed — 56% — expect Trump’s policies to be “somewhat inflationary.” Another 11% think they’ll be “extremely inflationary.” That doesn’t leave much room for a Fed rate cut. The Fed’s own messaging is part of the problem The Fed hasn’t done itself any favors in the way it communicates. It wants two things at once: stable expectations and data-driven decisions. Those don’t always mix. On one hand, Powell talks about “forward guidance,” a fancy way of saying the Fed likes to telegraph its moves. Markets eat that up. It means fewer surprises and more stability. On the other hand, Powell says rate cuts depend on inflation data. Here’s the problem: the data doesn’t justify a cut right now. But markets are still betting on one because of earlier Fed projections. Powell needs to reset the table. He needs to remind everyone that data comes first. Wall Street doesn’t call the shots. Consumer sentiment has bounced back, but the policies driving that optimism — tariffs and tax cuts — come with strings attached. Those strings lead to higher prices. Meanwhile, stock market valuations are flashing warning signs. At nearly 25 times the price-to-earnings ratio, the S&P 500 looks bloated. Stocks are expected to rise just 3% next year and 7% by 2026. That’s not much of a cushion. Almost 70% of the economists think the market is overpriced, even in a “soft landing” scenario. And while the recession risk is down — currently sitting at 29%, its lowest level in two years — the threat of inflation remains. Holding steady is the only reasonable choice Powell has one job this week: keep rates where they are. Inflation is still running hotter than the Fed’s 2% target. The labor market is tight. Trump’s proposed tariffs and tax cuts are looming on the horizon. None of these factors point to a rate cut being necessary. If anything, they’re flashing warning signs. Wall Street’s obsession with rate cuts is understandable, but it’s not Powell’s problem. The Fed’s mandate is simple: control inflation and ensure economic stability. Cutting rates now could undo the progress already made. Powell needs to hold firm and let the data decide. Markets won’t like it. Investors are betting on a cut, and they’re likely to throw a fit if they don’t get one. That’s fine. As Powell keeps pointing out, his job isn’t to keep Wall Street happy. “It’s to do what’s right for the economy.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-powell-and-the-fed-should-hold-off-on-rate-cuts-next-year/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37767644.jpeg

This comes as the company, an early-stage investment firm dubbed “Japanese MicroStrategy,” announced a ¥4.5 billion ($30 million) program to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. The plan implies issuing zero-interest bonds, maturing on June 16, 2025. The bonds highlight the company’s continued commitment to Bitcoin as part of its growth strategy. Metaplanet shares surge | Source: Google Finance Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy The zero-interest bonds will be released in tranches, with each bond valued at 2.5 billion yen, as Metaplanet continues to double down on its cryptocurrency investments. Zero-interest bonds are debt securities issued by a company. They do not have periodic interest but are sold at a discount to their face value. Investors profit by receiving the full face value of the bonds at maturity. In this case, it will be June 16, 2025.

(@Metaplanet_JP) December 17, 2024 The Japanese investment firm has been on a fast track with its Bitcoin program, acquiring over 1,000 BTC since adopting Bitcoin as its treasury reserve asset in May 2024 . This large-scale Bitcoin accumulation has earned the company the nickname “Japanese MicroStrategy,” drawing comparisons to the American tech giant known for its heavy Bitcoin holdings. What’s Going On With Metaplanet Stock? The impact on Metaplanet’s stock has been striking. Following the bond issuance announcement, share prices surged to a new all-time high of 4,270 JPY, marking a 51% increase in five trading days. Moreover, Metaplanet’s stock has skyrocketed by 2,450% since January 2024, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s bold Bitcoin-focused strategy. Apart from soaring stock prices, Metaplanet has experienced an unprecedented spike in trading volume. Over 27.8 billion yen (approximately $180 million) worth of shares was traded, signaling strong market interest in the company’s future. This activity has pushed Metaplanet’s market capitalization beyond the $1 billion threshold. Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet CEO, noted that the record trading volume and rise in the firm’s stock price reflect the increasing market excitement surrounding its Bitcoin-driven strategy.

The terms of these bonds, including interest rates and maturity dates, are yet to be finalized. Still, the company’s strategy will focus on expanding its Bitcoin holdings and capitalizing on market interest. Just weeks before these developments, Metaplanet reported a $28 million valuation gain in its Bitcoin holdings on November 13, strengthening its reputation as one of Asia’s leading corporate Bitcoin holders. Metaplanet to Reward Shareholders with Bitcoin As Metaplanet’s stock continues to surge after its zero-interest bond issuance announcement, the company is drawing even more attention with a new initiative to reward its shareholders. On December 2, Metaplanet unveiled a unique Bitcoin reward program, offering a prize pool of 30 million yen , or roughly $199,500. The reward program will benefit shareholders who own at least 100 shares as of December 31, 2024. 2,350 shareholders will be selected through a lottery, with varying prize amounts distributed in Bitcoin. This is an exciting opportunity for Metaplanet’s investors to gain a tangible reward from its focus on Bitcoin, which has been central to its recent success. Following its partnership with SBI Holdings’ crypto division , new account holders with SBI VC Trade can also participate in the reward program.

Dogwifhat (WIF) price has shown resilience amid selling pressure, while the BONK price prediction fuels excitement for a potential breakout in the meme coin sector. Among these, BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a standout with its DAG technology and strong presale performance. With over $167 million raised, 17.2 billion coins sold, and a remarkable 2240% surge, BlockDAG is the talk of the market. Its ambitious $1 price prediction, coupled with its innovative DAG-chain technology, is sparking interest from traders worldwide. Dogwifhat Price Holds Firm Despite Whale Selling Activity Dogwifhat's price remains steady at $3.04, even as whale-driven selling pressure has caused ripples in the market. Recently, a whale deposited 1.2 million WIF tokens worth $3.47 million, raising concerns about its impact. This transaction, which netted the seller over $3 million in profit, has created speculation around its future trajectory. Key analysts note the importance of $3 as a critical support level, backed by the 100-day and 200-day EMAs. If this support holds, WIF could aim for $4.8 resistance, suggesting recovery potential. However, a failure to sustain this level might push the price closer to $2.3, testing its long-term trendline. BONK Price Prediction Hints at 2025 Breakout The BONK price prediction is generating buzz, as the meme coin sector continues to attract attention. BONK recently hit its all-time high of $0.00005825 before settling at its current price of $0.00003842. Despite the pullback, experts predict BONK could rise to a range of $0.0000543–$0.0000649 in 2025. Confidence in BONK’s trajectory is supported by growing interest in meme coins and industry figures like Elon Musk’s influence on the crypto space. Initiatives like Blockchain.com’s $500,000 trading incentives further build optimism, suggesting BONK’s growth may align with broader trends in the sector. BlockDAG's DAG-Chain Sparks Excitement with $1 Price Target BlockDAG is making waves with its innovative DAG technology and explosive presale momentum. With $167 million raised, over 17.2 billion coins sold, and a 2240% surge in returns, BlockDAG is becoming a top-rated cryptocurrency to watch. The presale, now in Batch 26, is priced at $0.0234, and the $1 price target appears increasingly achievable as its Mainnet undergoes the final audit phase. The DAG architecture allows BlockDAG to handle thousands of transactions per second with low fees, making it highly scalable. This efficiency has caught the attention of businesses looking to reduce operational costs while ensuring robust performance. A recent AMA session highlighted the platform's vision, driving renewed interest in the presale and generating over $5.9 million in miner sales. Nearly 15,000 miners have already joined the ecosystem, signaling strong community engagement. The tiered BDAG250 bonus system has further incentivized traders, bringing BlockDAG closer to its $600 million target.

37768048,https://thecoinrise.com/vancouvers-bitcoin-bid-faces-provincial-btc-mining-ban/,1734460140,Vancouver’s Bitcoin Bid Faces Provincial BTC Mining Ban,"Vancouver’s City Council recently passed a motion to position the city as a Bitcoin-friendly destination. The goal is to draw attention to the financial benefits of digital currency and its mining industry. Yet, despite the enthusiasm from local officials, British Columbia’s province-wide ban on Bitcoin mining is still in effect. This has created a significant barrier to the city’s ambitions. A Closer Look at B.C.’s Mining Ban The mining ban, implemented in December 2022, was introduced to tackle concerns about excessive energy consumption. In early 2024, the B.C. Supreme Court upheld the mining ban after Conifex Timber challenged it. The court ruled that the policy was reasonable and aligned with public utility regulations. This move reinforced the provincial government’s stance on energy management. The ban targets crypto-mining operations that consume large amounts of electricity. This is a sensitive issue given BC Hydro’s reliance on hydroelectric power. The ban, lasting until December 2025, has sparked debates on energy use, economic benefits, and the crypto industry’s role in the province. The legal outcomes may shape the province’s future approach to crypto. Vancouver’s Motion: A Push for Progress Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim’s recent proposal seeks the possibility of the city becoming a Bitcoin-friendly hub. The motion highlighted mining potential and financial benefits for the city. While the motion promotes a favorable view of crypto, it cannot affect the ongoing mining ban due to provincial control over electricity regulations. BC Hydro confirmed the ban remains in place as the province updates its energy policies, such as the Energy Statutes Amendment Act. This grants the provincial government more control over crypto mining. Legal experts and lawmakers, particularly from the Green Party, are now discussing whether similar energy rules should apply to other high-demand industries like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Liquified Natural Gas. BC Hydro has confirmed that while the province still enforces a ban on crypto mining, it is working toward a permanent mining policy. The province has passed an updated version of the Energy Statutes Amendment Act as part of this regulatory shift. This grants the provincial government more control over electricity regulations related to crypto-mining operations. Legal experts now wonder if the province could apply similar electricity rules to other industries with high energy demands. This includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Liquified Natural Gas. Some lawmakers, especially from the Green Party, believe emerging technologies like AI should be scrutinized for their environmental impact. They argued these industries should be held to the same energy standards as crypto mining. Global Perspectives on Bitcoin Mining Regulation Vancouver faces challenges similar to other regions in dealing with the balance between crypto mining and energy sustainability. In the U.S., New York has banned Bitcoin mining in 2022, except for renewable energy sources. In contrast, Arkansas and Montana are protecting miners due to the industry’s economic potential. Pennsylvania recently lifted its bitcoin mining ban, focusing on energy conservation efforts that also address the needs of the mining sector. The region has recently recognized the economic benefits of digital assets.

Analytics Company CEO Explains Why Ethereum, In Particular, Isn’t Soaring","CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti pointed to record inflows into U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs as an indication of continued investor optimism, as the cryptocurrency market continues to gain momentum following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory. Altcoins Like Ethereum and Solana Will See Demand, Especially When They Gain a Full-Stake ETF in the US, According to CoinShares CEO In an interview, Mognetti highlighted the significant inflows that Bitcoin ETFs have seen since the beginning of the year, noting that the sector has witnessed 12 consecutive weeks of cumulative net inflows. “The last time we saw this kind of streak was in 2021,” Mognetti said, referring to the 15-week period of strong net inflows during that bull market. “But this time, we have Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which adds a new layer of accessibility for investors.” Bitcoin ETFs are an important tool for both institutional and individual investors, Mognetti said, allowing exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the digital asset. “The ETF sector of the U.S. market is off to a tremendous start this year,” Mognetti said. The analyst added that hopes are high among market participants for the upcoming Trump administration, which many view as positive towards crypto. This bullish outlook is in line with broader sentiment from industry figures like MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor, who recently came out in the spotlight with his extremely bullish $13 million Bitcoin price forecast by 2045. While Mognetti shares Saylor’s optimism, CoinShares is more cautious in its forecast. “We are not in the business of giving market price advice, but we believe Bitcoin has significant upside potential from current levels,” he said. Related News: BREAKING: Date Has Been Set In A Major Development For Ripple However, Mognetti warned that the U.S. market lags behind in offering comprehensive Ethereum products, especially when compared to other regions. “The SEC’s approval of Ethereum products has been lacking,” he said, referring to the lack of staking options that are integral to ETH’s value proposition. Despite this, Mognetti remains optimistic that Ethereum and other altcoins like Solana will attract significant investment demand once regulators provide clearer frameworks for products including staking. “Once the SEC allows full-fledged products like Ethereum or Solana that include staking, we will see more activity and inflows into these markets,” he added. Looking ahead, Mognetti sees a bright future for Bitcoin and other digital assets as the U.S. regulatory landscape improves. “The U.S. market has been devoid of crypto investment products since 2014,” Mognetti said. “Now that Bitcoin ETFs are in place, there is an opportunity for Ethereum and other assets to seize that opportunity as regulatory clarity increases.” *This is not investment advice.

The sanctions target Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian, both based in the UAE, and Green Alpine Trading, LLC, a front company linked to a broader money-laundering scheme. These sanctions and actions hope to disrupt a network allegedly funneling millions of dollars to North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, according to a U.S. government release. North Korea is known to exploit digital assets and cybercrime to fund its nuclear weapons and missile development. The regime employs IT workers and hackers to generate funds, often masking their origins through complex laundering operations. The sanctioned individuals and the UAE-based company reportedly operated under the direction of Sim Hyon Sop, a representative of North Korea’s state-run Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation, who has previously been sanctioned. Sim is accused of using a combination of cryptocurrency cash-outs and money mules to launder funds. The funds were then funneled back to North Korea to finance its military programs. Both Lu and Zhang allegedly assisted in these efforts by converting cryptocurrency into traditional currency and acting as couriers.

It marks a fundamental shift in the Avalanche ecosystem by simplifying the process of launching Layer 1 blockchains, removing the complexities of the previous Subnet model. AVAX’s price remained largely unfazed despite the major overhaul. Avalanche9000: The Network Overhaul According to the official website , Etna replaces the existing Subnet model, which had been criticized for its high staking thresholds and operational costs for validators. With Avalanche9000, developers can now spin up Layer 1 blockchains more quickly and independently, benefiting from drastically reduced costs – 99.9% lower L1 deployment expenses and a 96% drop in C-Chain fees. The upgrade also introduces more flexibility, offering customizable staking mechanisms, gas fees, tokens, and compliance options, including geo-restrictions. These improvements remove significant economic and technical barriers and instead empower developers to tailor their networks to specific use cases. Additionally, Avalanche9000 integrates Interchain Messaging (ICM) and improves interoperability between chains, thereby fostering smoother communication across the ecosystem. By simplifying blockchain creation and governance, Avalanche said that the end goal is to attract more projects to its platform. Avalanche9000 was launched on the Avalanche “Fuji” testnet on November 25. Just days before the mainnet rollout, Avalanche announced a $250 million locked-token sale, which was led by prominent investors, including Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, and ParaFi Capital, with over 40 companies participating. Notable participants in the token sale included SCB Limited, Republic Capital, Lvna Capital, Hivemind, Big Brain Holdings, Morgan Creek Digital, Hypersphere, FinTech Collective, SkyBridge, and others. AVAX’s Underwhelming Performance AVAX kicked off 2024 with a strong start, subsequently hitting a yearly high of $65.39. However, the price quickly dropped and has struggled to regain those levels. Despite an attempt at recovery in November, AVAX has yet to reach its previous highs. In December, while other altcoins saw significant rallies, AVAX’s performance remained lackluster. As of the latest data, the token has posted a weekly increase of 9.28%, with its current price standing at $50.18.

However, prominent experts like Nebraskangooner have also noticed that major altcoins are seeing heavy outflows, with the capital rotating to low market cap tokens and micro-caps. Money flowing out of major altcoins and into micro caps — Nebraskangooner (@Nebraskangooner) December 16, 2024 3 Best Micro-Cap Meme Coins To Buy Micro-cap meme coins are in extremely high demand, considering they have already turned several small-scale investors into millionaires this year. In this article, we list the 3 best micro-cap meme coins that could deliver up to 100x returns in the coming months. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is one of the most-hyped frog meme coins on the market. The WEPE presale has raised over $28 million in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), thanks to the heavy whale bidding. A deep-pocketed investor recently swapped 69.1 ETH for the new meme coin, investing over $270k. Wall Street Pepe is a high-utility meme coin, with its key selling point being an exclusive “alpha calls” group for all WEPE holders. The WEPE army will receive exclusive market insights, trading strategies and perhaps the next 100x meme coins to invest in before the whales. Moreover, they can benefit from the project’s native staking pool, which is currently offering a reward rate of over 40%. WEPE is one of the most in-demand micro-cap meme coins, with some experts eyeing up to 100x returns from it. Visit Wall Street Pepe Presale Catslap (SLAP) Catslap (SLAP) stunned the market with its 8,400% rally following its fair launch. After all, the most viral memes birth the best-performing tokens and Catslap is nothing different, thanks to the popularity of the viral “slapping cat” meme. With the meme coin currently seeing a pullback as whales and early buyers take profits, SLAP currently has a valuation of just $20 million and boasts high upside potential. As such, its deflationary tokenomics, slap-to-earn game and upcoming CEX listings provide a plethora of narratives for the SLAP price to soar. The $100,000 slap-to-earn quest is also resulting in considerable hype. However, sidelined investors have a short window to position themselves for the upside move, which could start immediately after a final test of the macro-support. Prominent experts like Michael Wrubel are eyeing up to 50x returns from SLAP, owing to its sound fundamentals and strong community support. Visit Catslap Website Flockerz (FLOCK) Flockerz (FLOCK) is a new chicken-inspired meme coin that is also in high demand. The FLOCK presale has already raised over $7 million in its ICO, signalling strong upside potential following its upside launch. 🔥 The Flock is growing day by day! 🔥7M raised and this flocks here to stay! 🐦📈 pic.twitter.com/a8gFhYt4P8 — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 17, 2024 The Flockerz project became famous following Binance’s push for decentralized meme coins. Indeed, FLOCK prioritizes decentralization above all else, branding itself as “the people’s meme coin”. Its key selling point is its DAO governance, with a unique twist. All FLOCK holders will be members of the Flocktopia DAO, vote on key issues like exchange listings, new features, etc. and receive monetary rewards in exchange. Besides the vote-to-earn initiative, the FLOCK army can also benefit from the project’s staking protocol, which is currently offering a reward rate of just under 400%. Prominent experts are bullish on FLOCK’s upside potential, with some even calling it the next 100x meme coin.

SOL is now up by 2.3% in a week, and while it’s actually down by 6.5% in a month, it remains up by a very solid 200% in a year. And many analysts continue to produce bullish Solana price predictions , with Messari’s annual Crypto Theses report suggesting that “2025 may well mark the year of Solana as a fully realized ecosystem.” The report points to the growth Solana has enjoyed in most areas of the crypto landscape, and with SOL-based ETFs likely in the coming year, 2025 may very well bring some serious price gains for the alt. Messari Experts Call for 2025 Solana Surge – Is SOL on Track for $750? According to the report, Messari is “bullish on Solana for 2025, driven by its strong momentum and pioneering innovations in applications.” Rise of the memes: https://t.co/89uPBlzct6 , solana, moodeng, chillguy, GOAT. nice walkthrough from @SteimetzKinji of the major themes inside Messari's 2025 Theses https://t.co/djwrTSPbox pic.twitter.com/nqUBl3MelF — Diran Li (@diran_li) December 17, 2024 The crypto intelligence firm highlights a number of areas in which Solana is leading the market, including AI, meme coins, DEXes, DeFi and DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks). Its authors conclude that “2024 was the year of Solana” and while they note that speculation initially played a big role in its price gains, “its fundamentals began to substantiate” its early promise as the year progressed. The report doesn’t provide any specific price predictions for Solana in 2025, yet the positive mention of “Solana’s expanding footprint in areas beyond finance” would suggest that Messari expects the coin’s price to only rise next year. As for the near term, its chart shows the coin regaining some momentum after a few days of decline. Source: TradingView For example, RSI (purple) has jumped toward 60 in the past few hours and looks like it could be on its way to 70 or higher, bringing the Solana price with it. At the same time, its 30-period moving average (orange) looks it has bottomed and is ready to climb over the 200-period average (blue) again, suggesting that we may be entering a bullish phase. Indeed, with Bitcoin reaching new ATHs it seems that the market is gearing up for its semi-traditional end-of-year rally, and this will include Solana. The alt could hit $250 or $260 by the end of the year, while 2025 could see it break $400 by H1. Alternatives for Big Market-Beating Gains in 2025 Solana may end up being a big winner in 2025, but now that it’s an established alt we may see newer, smaller cap tokens outperforming it in percentage terms. This could also include presale coins, which often surge considerably when they list on exchanges for the first time, particularly if their sale was successful. One of the biggest presales happening right now belongs to Best Wallet Token (BEST) , the native ERC-20 coin of the popular software wallet.

The declaration was made at the OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Effective Exchange of Information in Tax Matters held on Dec. 13. Combating Tax Evasion with Annual Reporting The new regime will mean tax-paying residents have to annually report their crypto accounts and transactions. Based on Hong Kong’s adopted Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters since 2018, the move has been made to bring a clear view in the light of meeting global tax standards. According to a government press statement, the information gathered would be exchanged with tax authorities in partner jurisdictions for effective monitoring to ensure fair tax assessments and to prevent tax evasion. The step was heralded as important by Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: The implementation of the reporting framework is essential to uphold Hong Kong’s reputation as an international financial and business center and reflects Hong Kong’s reputation as a responsible tax jurisdiction.” Hui further said that the government will consult relevant stakeholders and the public when drafting the necessary legislative amendments. Timeline for Implementation The legislative amendments necessary to implement the reporting framework are expected to be completed by 2026. When finalized, Hong Kong regulators will start full implementation of the framework in cooperation with partner tax jurisdictions by 2028. This would give ample time for stakeholders to get accustomed to the new requirements and at the same time ensure smooth integration with international tax reporting systems. Strengthening Hong Kong’s Financial Reputation The move aligns with Hong Kong’s commitment to maintaining its status as a leading financial center and adhering to changing global regulatory expectations. The government’s proactive step is a sign that it is ready to tackle crypto taxation complexities in an increasingly digital financial ecosystem. Crypto Speeds Up Regulation As earlier reported, Hong Kong’s regulators have been actively working on how to fast-track broader crypto regulations to match the rapidly expanding digital asset industry.

37766550,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629101,1734458440,Nigeria SEC provides new guidelines for promoting crypto assets and services,"Nigeria Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has amended its Digital Assets rules to include provisions for promoting and marketing crypto assets and services. The rules are scheduled to become effective by June 30, 2025, giving sufficient time for crypto entities and influencers in this category to comply. Under the new provisions, the SEC will now regulate all promotion, marketing, and advertisement of digital assets products on social media or through traditional media. In line with this, virtual assets service providers (VASPs) must get SEC approval before publishing adverts, offers, or invitations to subscribe for their crypto products. Beyond getting this approval, the rules also emphasize the accuracy of all the information on crypto adverts and promotions, with compulsory disclosure where the individual endorsing the VASP is compensated. All adverts or marketing for digital assets are also required to avoid using misleading, future-forward, or ambiguous statements that could exaggerate asset performance or promise quick returns. The rules state : “Advertisements shall use simple, clear language and avoid unnecessary technical jargon or excessive details that could confuse or distract investors.” Given that Digital Assets rules do not define what amounts to compensation, the SEC is likely to interpret this as any benefit that any individual enjoys from promoting crypto products or services. This could include whitelists, digital assets, fiat currency, NFTs, etc. Interestingly, the rules restrict VASPs from using celebrities, influencers, fictional characters, and anyone who has not directly invested in the product or used the service in the ads. However, it allows VASPs to engage third parties to promote their products and services as long as they obtain approval from the regulator. This approval, a no-objection authorization, is compulsory regardless of whether the social media influencer is paid or unpaid. Finfluencers to disclose promotions or face prison terms Meanwhile, the SEC has now mandated celebrities and public figures with large social media followings who receive compensation to promote crypto products or services disclose this to their followers. Describing this group as “Finfluencers,” the rules state that failure to disclose such arrangements will now attract a penalty of at least 10 million naira or up to three years in prison or both. According to the regulator, these guidelines have become necessary to clamp down on the proliferation of financial influencers in the country. It said: “This is to curb the menace and address the growing popularity of financial influencers (Finfluencers) promoting digital asset products and services or sharing of any unauthorized financial investment opportunity on social media, or through any other medium of communication.” Additionally, Finfluencers are now required to perform due diligence and verify that the crypto product or platform they are promoting is registered and licensed with the SEC. They must also confirm that the VASP obtained approval from the SEC for the ads. The regulator stated that it would enforce the provisions by actively monitoring all advertisements related to crypto products and services, with violations to be strictly prosecuted and sanctioned. New digital assets rules show Nigeria’s embrace of crypto Meanwhile, several new provisions in the Digital Assets rules show that Nigerian authorities want to embrace crypto and regulate the industry. These new provisions include the functions a VASP can apply to the Commission for registration. Crypto entities can now apply to register as Digital Assets Offering Platforms, Exchanges, Custodians, and Intermediaries. According to the rules, all these functions will be standalone, which means no entity can apply to combine multiple functions. The regulator also seeks to encourage more VASPs to register through its Accelerated Regulatory Incubation Program (ARIP). Under ARIP, entities providing crypto-related services can now get approval in principle that can last for 12 months, allowing them to operate while they finalize their full registration and meet the applicable requirements in the county.

The cryptocurrency’s price action has left investors uncertain about its next move, fueling speculation about whether XRP will surpass the critical $3 mark or if the cycle top has already been set. This indecisive environment reflects a broader trend of caution among market participants, as XRP’s future remains unclear. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto analyst, recently shared insights suggesting that XRP has been trading within a bull flag pattern, a classic continuation signal in technical analysis. According to Martinez, the key to unlocking XRP’s next rally is overcoming the $2.60 resistance level. A breakout above this threshold could set the stage for XRP to push past $3 and potentially explore even higher price levels. As the market closely watches XRP’s movements, the $2.60 level has become a critical battleground for bulls and bears alike. With momentum building and the broader crypto market showing strength, XRP’s ability to break free from its consolidation phase could determine whether it sets new highs or faces a potential reversal. For now, all eyes remain on its next major move. Preparing For The Next Rally? XRP has been in a volatile consolidation phase since December 3, experiencing a 34% retrace followed by a 36% bounce, though it remains below its local high of $2.90. This price action reflects a tug-of-war between bullish momentum and market hesitation as investors speculate on XRP’s next move. Despite the back-and-forth, XRP’s structure shows promise for another significant rally. Top analyst and investor Ali Martinez recently provided insight into XRP’s price, sharing a technical X analysis highlighting the current bull flag pattern. According to Martinez, this setup indicates a potential uptrend continuation once XRP clears the critical $2.60 resistance level. If this breakout occurs, Martinez predicts XRP could “be off to the races,” targeting an ambitious $4 price level. The $2.60 resistance is key to breaking XRP out of its current range, and a successful move above this level would likely trigger bullish momentum. Furthermore, reclaiming the $2.90 local high would signal the start of price discovery, with XRP poised to surpass its next psychological milestone at $3.31. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks ATH Pushing Back Into Price Discovery – BTC To $130K? As XRP consolidates, its future hinges on overcoming these resistance levels. The current bull flag pattern and broader market sentiment suggest the potential for a breakout, but the timing and strength of the move remain uncertain. Investors continue to watch closely for signals of confirmation. XRP Price Action: Levels To Watch XRP trades at $2.57, edging closer to the critical $2.64 resistance level. This price point is pivotal for XRP’s near-term trajectory, as clearing it would open the door to testing the $2.90 local high. Breaking through these levels in the coming days could spark a massive rally, potentially driving XRP into uncharted territory above its all-time high (ATH). The $2.64 mark is a key barrier that must be surpassed to confirm bullish momentum. If XRP successfully pushes past this hurdle, it will likely attract fresh buying interest, accelerating its upward movement. A move beyond $2.90 would further validate the trend’s strength and set the stage for significant gains. Related Reading: AAVE Dominates DeFi Lending – Metrics Reveal 45% Market Share However, failure to break above $2.64 could leave XRP vulnerable to downside pressure. Maintaining support above $2.33 would be crucial in this scenario to avoid a deeper correction.

37766310,https://blockworks.co/news/scroll-announces-new-zkevm,1734458400,"Scroll announces OpenVM, a new zkVM","This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Today, Scroll, Axiom, developer Max Gillet and the Ethereum Foundation’s Privacy & Scaling Explorations (PSE) team are announcing OpenVM, an open-source zkVM framework for instant proving. OpenVM will be adopted by the Scroll L2 as its zkVM, and plans to validate mainnet blocks in coming months. This transitions Scroll from a currently Type-3 to a Type-1 zkEVM — the most fully Ethereum-equivalent zkEVM type. Scroll’s upgrade to a Stage-1 rollup with a fully functioning proof system will follow soon thereafter. According to a press release, Scroll’s decision to design a new zkVM from the ground up was driven by a belief that many existing zkVM solutions were “monolithic” and “locking developers into vertically integrated stacks.” OpenVM’s open-source and modular architecture would enable Scroll to introduce features without making changes to the underlying circuit, and developers to benefit from zkVM improvements without having to modify application code. The state of ZK OpenVM joins a market already crowded with zkVMs. Unlike traditional virtual machines, zkVMs are designed to compile and execute smart contracts into zero-knowledge proofs in a secure and private way that does not reveal underlying data. Today, the zkVM market carries at least a dozen different zkVMs, such as RISC Zero “ RISC0 ” and Succinct’s “ SP1 .” Source: Electric Capital As seen in the below chart, proofs submitted to Ethereum mainnet saw a peak in December 2023, largely coming from zk rollups like Linea, ZKsync and Scroll, rather than applications. Proof volumes saw a drop in 2024, largely due to two factors. One, proof generation has been increasingly batched using recursive proof aggregation — a technique that verifies multiple proofs within one proof — to reduce costs.

Prover networks like Risc Zero’s “Boundless” and Fermah have also helped apps and rollups to bring zk-proving costs down. These networks allow teams to outsource proof generation to specialized hardware providers with ASICs and GPUs that compete to generate zk proofs cheaply. Based on Electric Capital’s recent developer report , there are 2,054 monthly active developers working in zk. The use of zk has seen tremendous growth, with zk contract deployments growing from 40 to 639 today over the last four years.

In a new post on social media platform X, Schwartz says Ripple USD ( RLUSD ) may experience supply shortages in the early days of its debut given the pre-market demand for the stablecoin. “There actually is someone willing to pay $1,200/RLUSD for a tiny fraction of one RLUSD…Maybe someone wants the ‘honor’ of buying the first bit of RLUSD on the DEX (decentralized exchange).” Schwartz says the price of RLUSD should go back close to $1 when the supply stabilizes. “If you want to spend a lot of money to get a tiny bit of RLUSD before anyone else does, you can. But please don’t expect the price to stay over $1 once things stabilize, which I expect they will do very quickly.” The XRP co-creator says the whole point of stablecoins is to have a steady price so investors should not see these tokens as a way to gain profits. “Short-term changes in prices due to shortages of supply or demand are certainly possible, especially around launch, but they shouldn’t remain for very long as arbitragers rapidly fix the market. Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin! This is not an opportunity to get rich.” Ripple is set to launch RLUSD on Tuesday after receiving the final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) last week.

37769156,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320183,1734458004,Hyperliquid’s ‘HYPE’ Airdrop Soars to New Highs as Crypto All-Stars Smashes $19M,"Decentralized derivatives trading platform Hyperliquid is making waves this week as HYPE soars to a new all-time high. Following its recent airdrop, HYPE has entered the top 30 cryptocurrencies, but what’s next for its price? Let’s take a look. This article dives into Hyperliquid’s seismic genesis event on November 29, which saw market excitement erupt after the platform airdropped 31% of its native HYPE layer-1 tokens, valued at $4.8 billion at the time. Now surging aggressively to the upside, HYPE is positioned as one of December 2024’s top gainers. Over the past 14 days, the token has climbed 209% , boasting a current market cap of $9.1 billion, supported by $3.25 billion in total value locked (TVL) and $332 million in 24-hour trading volume. Why is Hyperliquid and HYPE Crypto Surging So Aggressively? People are bridging from Solana to Arbitrum en masse. $HYPE is replacing $SOL as the shiny new L1. $SOL is fine, it is now one of three assets in crypto that you buy without a price target. But you’re fooling yourself if you don’t think this hurts in the short term. pic.twitter.com/5KjNmV3QWG — MONK (@defi_monk) December 16, 2024 The dramatic growth has been fuelled by post-airdrop retail interest in the Hyperliquid Layer-1 blockchain, which is fuelling rapid adoption of Arbitrum – reminiscent of Base season in the Summer or the quick-fire trend for Tron meme coins . Indeed, eagle-eyed market analysts have clocked huge cross-chain flows from Solana to Arbitrum – fuelled by Hyperliquid – suggesting that retail traders are flocking to the latest market trend . The only question remains: how long can Hyperliquid keep this up? Let’s take a look. HYPE Price Analysis: Can HYPE Crypto Sustain Sensational Hyperliquid Price Rally? As Hyperliquid continues to maintain its ascendent trading channel, HYPE crypto is currently trading at a market price of $26.65 (representing a 24-hour change of -2.4%). This comes amid an impressive +99% climb over the past week, which has seen Hyperliquid skyrocket up to hit a new all-time high at $29.62. The upside move has been sustained for days by the close support of an equally aggressively ascending 20DMA, which has provided a local foothold continually throughout the increase in value. However, following the new all-time high, which comes just below the $30 psychological price level, HYPE crypto is in a local price retreat, with the chart suggesting an imminent retest of $25.625 is on the cards. This is best explained by the RSI, which has remained severely overheated for much of the past 48 hours and now seeks to cool off as holders consolidate the newfound gains and build market confidence for a break above $30. Yet, while consolidation or even retracement seems to dominate the short-time frame outlook for HYPE, especially as the lower trendline at $23.38 hasn’t been re-tested in 4-days – and this is driving smart money to now rotate into a soon-to-launch viral meme coin. Don’t Miss Crypto All-Stars: This New DeFi Protocol is Set to Skyrocket After Near $20M Raise Crypto All-Stars is hitting viral momentum ahead of the highly anticipated STARS DEX launch next week, with late-stage whale buys rocking the presale as it surges towards $20M raised.

Bill Morgan Reacts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News RLUSD went officially live today on global exchanges, which combines the stability of fiat with the efficiency of blockchain technology. Ripple has described RLUSD as an ‘enterprise-grade stablecoin built on trust, utility, and compliance.’ Backed by US dollar deposits, US government bonds, and other cash equivalents, RLUSD will undergo third-party audits to ensure transparency. Ripple aims to build stronger ties between fiat and crypto while enhancing cross-border payments. Ripple President Monica Long highlighted the significance of the launch, stating, “The release of RLUSD marks a new chapter, both for the XRP Ledger as well as Ripple for use in our $70B+ payments flows.” Looming Regulatory Uncertainty The Tuesday’s launch follows a period of uncertainty surrounding the SEC’s take on the stablecoin. In April 2024, the SEC filed its remedies-related reply brief in the Ripple case, labeling RLUSD an issuance of a new unregistered crypto asset. A recent X user pointed out that in April, the SEC labeled RLUSD the issuance of a new unregistered crypto asset in its remedies-related reply brief. “While the NYDFS approval is one thing, but could the SEC (Gensler) say Ripple failed to register it?” he questioned. That is correct, but like a lot of statements made by the SEC about crypto it is incorrect. Obviously, Ripple does not care about the statement. If it was meant to be a warning or a threat it has been disregarded or worked around and quite frankly neither the market nor anybody… https://t.co/7FabxZvAzr — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) December 17, 2024 To this, Bill Morgan reacted “That is correct.” However, he added that the SEC made many incorrect statements about crypto and the regulator was wrong here too. Notably, this also includes the term ‘crypto asset securities’ for which the SEC expressed regrets to the court. But “Ripple Does Not Care” “Ripple does not care about the statement,” he underscored. “If it was meant to be a warning or a threat, it has been disregarded or worked around, and quite frankly, neither the market nor anybody else cares because RLUSD is now regulated,” he remarked. The post raises doubts on whether the SEC or outgoing Chair Gary Gensler can cause problems for Ripple on RLUSD stablecoin. However, the SEC has remained silent on the approval from the NFDFS. Ripple President Monica Long earlier addressed concerns about RLUSD stablecoin impacting XRP. she clarified that the Ripple USD and XRP will serve different purposes within the ecosystem. XRP is used as a bridge asset for cross-border transactions. Notably, the stablecoin launch fueled the XRP price to surge 12% today and 22% in a week. It is currently trading at $2.64, up over 4% in the past day. With Gensler stepping down on January 20, 2025, regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ripple remains elevated.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

Reduced transaction fees for buying, selling, and swapping crypto. Higher staking rewards within the platform. 8% cashback on all Best Card transactions (launching soon). Community Governance participation, allowing holders to vote on key project decisions like marketing, features, and exchange listings. These perks have led experts to predict $BEST’s substantial upside. As a microcap token with strong utility, it has attracted bullish sentiment from smart money investors eyeing 10x to even 100x returns. However, time is limited. High demand for $BEST means presale stages are quickly selling out, pushing its price upward. To avoid missing out, interested buyers need to act quickly.

42389547,63c944b8-c277-488f-8ae7-b41a06216dee,1734456617,How MicroStrategy and Others Are Taking on Billions in Debt to Buy More Bitcoin,"The analyst who co-wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Semler Scientific (SMLR).   Have Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy (MSTR) stumbled onto an infinite money glitch?  It would be hard to blame anyone for thinking so. While the Saylor-led company began buying bitcoin (BTC) more than four years ago, over the past 10 months MicroStrategy has used a unique strategy to raise over $6 billion for the express purpose of adding more bitcoin to its balance sheet, which as of Dec. 15 footed to 439,000 tokens worth $46 billion at the current price of about $106,000.  MicroStrategy did not raise these funds by taking out loans or by issuing more company shares (though it has separately issued billions of dollars worth of equity). Rather, the firm sold convertible notes — debt securities which can be converted into equity on specified dates or under special conditions. And it's not done yet: Saylor and company intend to raise at least another $18 billion through such bonds over the course of the next three years, according to a plan laid out in October.  Demand for this convertible paper has been so high that other companies, bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) among them, have adopted a similar playbook to raise billions to add to their own stacks.  But that raises a question: Could issuing so much debt eventually become dangerous for these firms, and for the crypto market at large?  ""If bitcoin faces a prolonged period of low/declining prices, [the companies] could have to issue more equity and dilute shareholders at an inopportune time … [or] sell the bitcoin for less than they bought,"" Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, told CoinDesk. Thompson added, though, that he doesn't expect the companies to become insolvent.  How convertible notes work  Convertible notes are a financial tool that allows companies to quickly raise funds without needing to provide collateral (as they would for a loan) or to immediately dilute their stock. These bonds are priced based on the interest rate baked into them, the firm’s underlying stock, the volatility of that stock and the firm’s credit worthiness.  For example, in November bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer (BTDR) raised $360 million by issuing convertible notes with an interest rate of 5.25%. These will mature on Dec. 1, 2029 at a price of $15.95 per share — which is approximately 42.5% higher than what these shares were trading for on Nov. 21 when the convertible notes were priced.  In other words, instead of simply buying the company’s shares on the open market, investors can earn a solid yield by holding these notes while also benefitting if the stock surges. Even better, convertible notes come with downside protection. On specific dates, such bonds can be redeemed in cash for an amount equal to the original investment plus interest payments. Put differently, investors are almost guaranteed to get their money back even if the stock plunges before the note matures.  But MicroStrategy’s situation is rather unheard of in that the firm has found demand for convertible bonds at a 0% interest rate even though benchmark U.S. interest rates are closer to 5%. Why? Volatility. Being essentially a leveraged play on bitcoin, MicroStrategy common stock most recently has been trading with a 30-day average implied volatility of 106 and prior to that even higher. For comparison, the S&P 500 usually trades at roughly 15 in implied volatility, and bitcoin at 60.  The stock volatility affects price action in MSTR's convertible bonds and sophisticated market participants are able to score sizable profits by trading that volatility in a market neutral fashion. “I was on the phone with a convertible note [arbitrage] trader… just to sort of understand what he’s going through with all of this,” Richard Byworth, a convertible bond expert and managing partner at asset management firm Syz Capital, told the On The Margin podcast. “He said ‘Rich, I’ve become a degen crypto trader. … It’s insane. I go to the bathroom, if I haven’t tightened up all my deltas and at least left some limits, I can come back and have millions of dollars of exposure.’ This stuff is whipping around like crazy.”  There’s thus a huge demand for MicroStrategy’s convertible notes, and that has allowed the firm to sell a ton of them — five issuances in a year, which is unprecedented. At press time, the company had six outstanding convertible notes, with maturations between 2027 and 2032. Two of these have 0% interest rates, while two others yield 0.625%, a fifth 0.875% and the last one 2.25%. Because these rates are so low, MicroStrategy is managing to sell equity at a massive premium compared to its current stock price, while only paying a blended 0.811% interest rate on its debt, or $35 million annually, an amount easily covered by the firm’s revenue.  “Should implied volatility remain high, I bet MSTR sells more and more convertible bonds… meaning they buy more and more bitcoin,” Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data firm Amberdata, told CoinDesk. “To me the first sign of a bitcoin rally “TOP” will coincide with a drop in MSTR implied volatility.”  Convertible notes mania  In addition to the above-mentioned bitcoin miners, there's medical device company Semler Scientific (SMLR), which made public its bitcoin treasury strategy in late May. While the firm to date has only purchased bitcoin with cash already on its balance sheet and capital raised through share sales, its stock was granted an options market on Tuesday, which will make note offerings much more attractive to investors and traders looking to profit in similar fashion to that of MicroStrategy's debt.  Bitcoin miners took on roughly $5.2 billion in debt from June to Dec. 5 alone, according to the MinerMag. Some of these convertible notes have been issued with 0% interest in the case of MARA and Core Scientific, while others like Bitdeer, IREN (IREN) and TeraWulf (WULF) have issued them at rates ranging from 2.75% to 8.5%.  Not every company is employing the strategy for the same reasons, however. MARA and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are walking in MicroStrategy’s footsteps by using the proceeds from the convertible notes to add more bitcoin to their balance sheet, but Core Scientific, for example, wants the funds for operating expenses, capital expenditures, and potential acquisitions. Bitdeer, meanwhile, said it aimed to further develop its mining rig manufacturing business.  Bill eventually comes due  Convertible notes, however, are not free money. As mentioned previously, once the notes reach full maturity, holders can decide to convert them for equity at an agreed-upon price per share, or redeem them for cash if the stock has underperformed expectations.  The danger, then, is that the stock prices of these various firms could drop significantly over a long period of time, incentivizing holders to redeem their notes for cash instead of shares. In MicroStrategy’s case, that could compel the company to sell some of its bitcoin holdings to pay investors back, while bitcoin mining firms could be forced to sell off various mining assets. In a worst case scenario, firms could end up facing bankruptcy.  Forced selling of bitcoin isn't necessarily the end of the world, at least as long as the company’s average purchase price is lower than the price it sells at. MicroStrategy’s stash, for instance, was acquired for $61,725 per bitcoin on average, which gives the firm a certain amount of breathing space. The trouble is bitcoin is well known for plunging 80% every few years. Just this year — in the middle of a bull market — the price declined nearly 40% at one point, so there's no guarantee the top cryptocurrency won’t ever sink lower than MicroStrategy’s average purchase price.  Even so, MicroStrategy’s bonds are staggered, meaning that they all have different maturation years. That reduces the company’s risk because it won’t need to repay all of that debt all at once. In other words, bitcoin and MSTR would need to stay down for a significant number of years for the firm’s situation to get really dicey. The fact that most of MicroStrategy’s notes already meet the requirements for conversion is another point in the company’s favor, and it always has the option of rolling over its debt by issuing new convertible bonds, even if they wouldn't be on such favorable terms.  In a sense, MicroStrategy is a grizzled veteran of this strategy. It's possible the newcomers like the bitcoin miners and maybe Semler (if it does choose to issue debt) — whose average bitcoin purchase prices will be far higher — could find themselves far more exposed, having taken on large liabilities closer to a potential cycle top.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Tom Carreras, James Van Straten",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/17/how-micro-strategy-and-others-are-taking-on-billions-in-debt-to-buy-more-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87dfe2d495991d8077db6abdb6ce4e72115c4f8e-4496x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Compared to peers, CRPT has outperformed with a 115% total return year-to-date. Most similar funds have returned less than 80% over the same time. The out-performance is likely derived from two main differences; CRPT has a sky-high 215% turnover ratio and a high reliance on Bitcoin ETFs and mining stocks. Despite beating peer 'digital economy' ETFs and having significant exposure to BTC and BTC-proxies, CRPT is still trailing the ProShares Bitcoin ETF year-to-date. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rallying past $100k per coin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) back above $4k, enthusiasm has returned to the digital asset space. With that enthusiasm, comes even more capital. As of December 14th, capital flows into digital asset products have been surging in the month of December, even after already strong flows for the entirety of November: CoinShares So far through just two weeks in December, the market has seen over $2.2 billion in month-to-date ETH flows, $4.6 billion in month-to-date BTC flows, and another $280 million in XRP ( XRP-USD ) flows. This brings total net flows into digital asset products for 2024 up to $44.5 billion. With investors likely thinking about portfolio positioning for 2025, some may find a more 'diversified' approach to digital asset investing to be the desired path. Beyond that, the volatility in digital assets can often be difficult to stomach. For some, investing in companies that benefit from digital asset sales and adoption may be the best option. In this article, we'll explore the First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF ( CRPT ) to determine if it's a good ETF for more traditional investors who might be 'crypto-interested' in 2025. Fund Details & Objective Fund Details CRPT Issuer First Trust Advisors L.P. Inception 09/20/2021 Expense Ratio 0.85% AUM $106.54M Fund Strategy Active Source: Seeking Alpha After coming to market right before the top of the crypto market back in Fall 2021, it has been an interesting journey for CRPT shareholders, to say the least. Data by YCharts Anyone who has been holding shares of the fund since late 2021 has likely been hugely disappointed. After topping in November 2021, inception day, CRPT shareholders have a total return of just 11.5% over the last three years. Of course, those who bought the bottom of 'crypto winter' in December 2022 have been handsomely rewarded with over 500% in just two years. The objective of the fund is straightforward. The fund manager aims to provide shareholders with capital appreciation derived from at least 80% of net assets in common stocks and ADRs of crypto industry economies or Bitcoin exchange-traded assets. Performance Against Peers There are a handful of similar funds that give investors several products to choose from if they want broad exposure to crypto, blockchain, or digital assets as thematic ideas. For the sake of comparison to CRPT, I've chosen four other products that I view to be similar. Each of which has at least $100 million in assets under management but less than $250 million in AUM. So from where I sit, these funds are similar both in size and objective: Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF ( STCE ) VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ) Global X Blockchain ETF ( BKCH ) Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF ( FDIG ) Of the peer group, CRPT has the largest expense ratio by far at 0.85%. That said, the fund also pays shareholders a 1.5% dividend - matched only by BKCH, which has a similar payout and a lower expense ratio: Comps CRPT STCE DAPP BKCH FDIG Issuer First Trust Advisors L.P. Schwab ETFs VanEck Global X Funds Fidelity Investments Inception 09/20/2021 08/03/2022 04/12/2021 07/12/2021 04/19/2022 Expense Ratio 0.85% 0.30% 0.51% 0.50% 0.40% AUM $106.5m $109.1m $210.2m $216.7m $182.2m Dividend Yield (TTM) 1.50% 0.54% - 1.51% - Number of Holdings 28 42 22 26 40 Turnover 215% 58% 57% 39.8% 53% Source: Seeking Alpha The metric that jumps off the page for CRPT is the 215% turnover ratio. The indication being CRPT is far more actively managed. As we'll see in the next section, it's also highly concentrated on top holdings. So how has that approach to asset management worked out for shareholders? Turns out, the year-to-date return for CRPT shareholders has actually been phenomenal: Data by YCharts At a 115% total return year-to-date, CRPT has vastly outperformed each of the other funds shown, with none of them even eclipsing 80% year-to-date. At least to some degree, the active management and concentration of the fund are a big reason behind the outperformance for CRPT. The holdings themselves also require exploration. Top 10 Holdings Security Name Market Value Weighting Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) $18,851,895.42 17.43% MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) $16,517,215.39 15.27% Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd.

The allocation to the top ten holdings is 82%. The bottom 16 holdings account for roughly 3% of AUM combined, and most of those holdings are well-known companies that have more loose associations with digital assets. For instance, Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) and Visa ( V ) each have a 0.09% weighting in CRPT. Bitcoin ETFs account for 22% of fund assets. After 44% combined allocation to Coinbase, Galaxy, and MicroStrategy, the remaining fund assets are generally held in Bitcoin mining stocks like MARA, IREN, CIFR, CleanSpark ( CLSK ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), and TeraWulf ( WULF ) - each of which has over 2% allocations. Risks While the fund has performed quite well over the last 12 months and even out-performed similar peers by a wide margin, there are numerous risks in going long a fund like CRPT. First, for a fund that has the words 'digital economy' in its name, there is an enormous reliance on Bitcoin for shareholder returns. Between Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin miners, and MicroStrategy, the overwhelming majority of the fund's assets are held in Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies. Coinbase and Galaxy Digital are perfectly justifiable holdings for a fund like this. But that's about where the allocation logic ends for me personally. Robinhood ( HOOD ) would figure to have top 10 exposure in a digital economy fund, yet HOOD shares make up just 0.1% of CRPT AUM. Bitcoin Hash Price (HashRateIndex) Furthermore, 31% of AUM is allocated to Bitcoin mining stocks. These are companies that are generally facing a dubious long-term investment outlook due to declining BTC issuance from the asset's fixed supply and block reward halvings. As of the article submission, the hash price from mining BTC is about $63 per PHS/Day. To put this into perspective, the hash price was over $100 for most of April before the halving. The point is, even with Bitcoin well above $100k per coin, miners are still earning less than they were in April when Bitcoin was closer to $60k. Closing Summary The First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF is fast-moving. This is a high-risk, high-reward fund that has significant concentration risk to top holdings, a very high turnover ratio, and a high reliance on Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies. While it is true that CRPT has outperformed similar funds on a year-to-date total return, consider CRPT against the total return of something like the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ): Data by YCharts Year-to-date, the total return of CRPT is trailing that of BITO by about 900 bps. The question I have is why allocate to a fund that is highly reliant on Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies for a total return that is likely to ultimately lag Bitcoin? In my view, it makes sense to not overthink it during trends like the one we're currently seeing in Bitcoin. There is perhaps a time and a place to go long a fund like CRPT. For instance, when Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining stocks are totally bombed out, like they were at the end of 2022. But that's not the setup we have today.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744775-crpt-overly-reliant-on-bitcoin-for-returns?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37765489.jpeg

42389680,6def3171-d513-4370-bff8-8310cab7abf7,1734456000,Telegram's Tap-to-Earn Games Will Drive Web3 Gaming's Success in 2025,"Telegram's gaming ecosystem is thriving, with tap-to-earn and clicker games leveraging the platform’s established base of over 950 million users. According to the Q3 2024 Telegram Games Report, top games like Hamster Kombat and Catizan pulled in hundreds of thousands of active users within weeks, underscoring the appeal of the “mini-app” approach originally pioneered by WeChat.    Yet, the rise and fall of clunky blockchain-based games like Axie Infinity that struggled with user retention are a reminder that Web3 games haven’t always been a roaring success. If the segment is to reach its full potential as a catalyst for blockchain adoption, it could learn a thing or two from Telegram’s successful approach. I predict that Telegram's mini app model will be the biggest driver of Web3 gaming's growth in 2025.    How the Telegram gaming ecosystem attracts users    Web3 gaming’s market value surpassed $3 billion in 2023 and could reach as much as $90 billion by 2030. With over 950 million users, Telegram’s clicker games entice players from all backgrounds with basic rules and fun gameplay that enable them to earn in-game currency and other items, and airdropped tokens for new games. Unlike the traditionally high cost of user acquisition for exchanges and other companies—estimated by Notcoin founder Sasha Plotvinov at upward of $10 to $15—Telegram onboards players for less than $1 per user.    This cost-effective approach has enabled small development teams to amass millions of users in weeks, with over three million active wallets recorded across just nine games in September 2024 alone, a pace rarely seen in the traditional gaming industry. Telegram's vast, crypto-friendly audience and ease of developing quick, feedback-driven HTML5 mini-games are the key drivers behind this remarkable surge.    By allowing players to earn rewards, own tokenized assets and trade valuable in-game items like skins and weapons, the platform introduces players to the world of blockchain in an accessible and engaging manner. Users can start playing immediately without downloading any additional apps or tooling as the games are directly integrated into the platform, reducing the usual points of friction onboarding non-crypto-native users to Web3 games. Integrating popular gaming IPs such as Delabs' Ragnarok further enhances the appeal of Telegram's Web3 gaming ecosystem, bringing beloved, high-traction games to the platform.    The ongoing challenge of user retention    Telegram’s Web3 gaming ecosystem is impressive, with clicker games earning the platform an additional 50 million users this year. However, user retention remains an ongoing challenge. While clicker games are capable of onboarding a large number of users quickly, the attention of those users often wanes due to limited diversity, simple game mechanics that lack the depth and complexity of traditional games, and market saturation.    For the Telegram gaming ecosystem to flourish, it must move beyond tap games and airdrops to something more engaging and sustainable in the long run, making games complicated and diverse enough to maintain the interest in repetitive games with limited functionality. To avoid users dropping off in droves after the initial excitement fades, Telegram games must employ user retention strategies such as the below that encourage engagement and foster a greater sense of purpose with the game.    1. Setting up daily challenges and streaks    Over 40% of web3 gamers spend over 10 hours a week playing Web3 games, highlighting the appetite for blockchain-based games that provide rewards and incentives. Players who engage with daily challenges have higher retention rates than those limited to one-time quests. Daily engagement promotes habit formation and keeps players returning, building a routine that allows games to build deeper player relationships.    Providing regular challenges maintains user interest through small but consistent rewards that help to convert casual users into long-term participants. Hamster Kombat’s engaging tactics have seen its MAUs grow to 110 million, while TG Tap Miner enables players to increase their crypto holdings.    2. Utilizing personalization and segmentation    Continuous interaction benefits significantly from personalized experiences. For example, segmenting players into categories such as “whales,” “dolphins” and “fish,” allows games to tailor content and rewards according to engagement level, making gameplay more satisfying and individualized.    Web3 players are already accustomed to ownership of digital assets and NFTs. Targeted interaction, such as TON Racing League’s high-octane game that enables players to own, upgrade and trade unique racing vehicles as NFTs, can deepen players’ connection, offering them content and rewards that resonate more deeply than standard quests.    3. Building community-driven economies  Web3 enables community-driven economies where players can buy, trade or sell in-game items and assets freely. These interactions create a feedback loop of engagement unique to the blockchain space, where player involvement is essential to the game's economy and community. Games that leverage community trading and real-time, player-driven content updates encourage organic interactions that enhance player loyalty and satisfaction.  4. Merging with more traditional gaming models  29 out of 40 of the world’s largest video game companies are investing in blockchain gaming, including Microsoft, Tencent, Sony, and Nintendo. With the next crypto bull market upon us, these numbers will likely continue to rise in 2025 and beyond. The future of Web3 gaming will inevitably merge with more traditional models, combining richer user experiences with more sophisticated play, and drawing on the success of Telegram’s mini-app model.",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | NOT,Anton Umnov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/16/telegram-s-ecosystem-will-lead-growth-in-web3-gaming-in-2025,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c0a076754874c5e3b1c1407f2e1f2c8749575ae-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has surged by nearly 150% this year, driven by rising demand and decreasing supply growth. The unwinding of high interest rates by the Federal Reserve and other central banks has also contributed to this upward momentum. Data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $36 billion in assets, bringing their combined total to more than $120 billion. This growth indicates that Bitcoin is increasingly competing with gold for investor attention. People asking me about this. Answer is YES, if you include all bitcoin ETFs (spot, futures, levered) they have $130b vs $128b for gold ETFs. That said, if you just look at spot, btc is $120b vs $125b for gold.

Data by CoinGlass shows that the amount of Bitcoin remaining in exchanges has continued to fall this year. You might also like: Ethereum price stalls at key price but on-chain metrics point to a surge These supply and demand dynamics will likely push Bitcoin prices higher in the long term. This demand will likely come from governments and corporations, which have seen Microstrategy move from a tiny company into a $90 billion firm. The next key catalyst that could have an impact on Bitcoin is the Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday. Economists expect that the bank will cut rates by 0.25%, bringing the year-to-date cuts to 1%. Bitcoin and other risky assets do well when the Fed is cutting rates because investors often move from low-yielding money market funds. The Fed may, therefore, disrupt the Bitcoin price surge by having a hawkish tone because of the sticky inflation. Its main concern is that Donald Trump’s policies of deportation, tax cuts, and tariffs will stir inflation. Data released last week showed that inflation is still a big challenge as the headline Consumer Price Index rose to 2.7%. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy price, remained at 2.2%. As such, while the Fed will likely cut rates this week, it might deliver a hawkish outlook. Bitcoin price analysis BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that BTC has maintained a strong bullish trend over the past few weeks. The price remains above all major moving averages, signaling that bulls are still in control. Additionally, BTC has formed a cup and handle pattern , pointing to more gains. However, the chart also reveals a rising wedge pattern, a common reversal signal. The MACD and Relative Strength Index have both formed bearish divergence patterns. As a result, there is a possibility of a brief pullback, potentially to $103,000, following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday.

Recruits were selected based on computer proficiency and typing skills. After a two-week induction, the recruits impersonated foreign individuals to lure victims. Once the targets were engaged, the foreign operators would take over the fraud, cutting off the Nigerian participants to conceal the transactions. Payments to Nigerian accomplices were made in cash or through personal accounts, bypassing corporate systems. Recovered items included computers, mobile phones, and vehicles. The EFCC stated that the suspects would face charges once the investigations are concluded.

37765588,https://nulltx.com/?p=135882,1734455705,Qubetics Presale Thrives While Filecoin Expands FVM and Fantom Boosts Speed: Best Cryptos to Watch Now,"Qubetics Presale Gains Momentum as Filecoin Expands FVM and Fantom Enhances Speed: Best Cryptos Updates to Keep an Eye on Now Filecoin (FIL) is making headlines with its FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine) update, a move that unlocks smart contracts and decentralized apps on its storage network. Meanwhile, Fantom (FTM) is gaining traction with its latest EVM-compatible upgrades, promising faster transactions and near-zero fees—music to developers’ ears. These aren’t just small wins; they’re upgrades that could reshape their ecosystems and grab major market share heading into 2025. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS), a rising star tackling some of the biggest headaches in crypto. Managing digital assets and making payments has been, well, a mess—until now. Qubetics introduces a non-custodial multi-chain wallet designed to simplify crypto payments and asset management for regular folks. Whether you’re sending money overseas, running a business, or just shopping online, Qubetics makes crypto work like the payment apps you already know and love. Qubetics ($TICS): Simplifying Payments for Real-World Use Crypto has always had a reputation for being complex. Between volatile prices, confusing wallets, and clunky transactions, it’s no wonder mainstream adoption has been slow. Qubetics is here to change that. Their multi-chain wallet doesn’t just support multiple blockchains—it also integrates seamlessly with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and traditional payment systems. For the average user, that means using crypto feels as simple as swiping your card or tapping your phone. Picture this: you’re a freelancer with clients spread across the globe. Instead of waiting days for wire transfers or getting hit with absurd bank fees, you send an invoice, get paid in crypto, and Qubetics converts it into fiat instantly. For small business owners, this could mean expanding their customer base globally without the headaches of cross-border payments. Another standout feature is Qubetics’ smart contract conversion mechanism, which automatically converts crypto to fiat at the point of sale. Whether you’re buying a coffee in New York or booking a hotel in Tokyo, Qubetics ensures stable, instant transactions without worrying about market swings. Currently in Presale Phase 13, Qubetics has already secured over 10,300 holders and sold 347 million tokens, raising $6.9 million. The presale price sits at $0.0342, but weekly 10% hikes make this phase particularly attractive for early investors. By launch, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, offering a potential 900% ROI. Don’t sleep on this—Qubetics is making crypto simple, accessible, and practical for everyday life. Filecoin (FIL): Unlocking Innovation with FVM Filecoin has been a leader in decentralized storage for years, but its latest upgrade—the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)—takes things to a whole new level. What’s the big deal? The FVM now allows developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) directly on the Filecoin network. Think of it as combining the security of Filecoin’s storage with the programmability of Ethereum. Here’s where it gets interesting. The FVM makes Filecoin a top choice for applications that require both secure storage and smart contracts. For example, imagine decentralized video streaming platforms or NFT marketplaces where all the data is stored securely on Filecoin’s blockchain. It’s efficient, tamper-proof, and way cheaper than relying on centralized servers. Since launching the FVM, Filecoin has seen an uptick in developer activity, signaling growing adoption. Analysts are particularly bullish on FIL’s price potential as this new feature drives real-world use cases. In a market where utility matters, Filecoin is positioned to shine. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Filecoin deserves a spot on your radar. The combination of decentralized storage and smart contracts makes it a powerful contender in the Web3 space. Fantom (FTM): Speed, Efficiency, and Developer Appeal Fantom (FTM) is carving out its space as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains in the game. Its latest upgrades focus on enhancing EVM compatibility, which is a huge win for developers looking to migrate their Ethereum-based projects. Why does this matter? It means Ethereum’s massive developer community can easily bring their apps to Fantom, taking advantage of its low fees and lightning-fast speeds. Here’s a real-world example: on Ethereum, high network congestion can make simple transactions painfully slow and expensive. Fantom fixes that with near-instant confirmations and fees so small they’re practically invisible. For dApp developers, this makes Fantom an obvious choice for projects like DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and even gaming applications. Recent data shows Fantom’s daily transaction volume surging, and the network is attracting more developers than ever. Analysts predict that FTM is poised for significant price growth as adoption continues to climb. If you’re on the hunt for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Fantom offers the perfect mix of utility, speed, and developer support. With the blockchain space getting increasingly competitive, Fantom’s focus on scalability and affordability gives it a strong edge. Could this be the network that steals Ethereum’s spotlight? It’s looking more likely every day. Conclusion: When it comes to this week’s top investment picks, Qubetics ($TICS), Filecoin (FIL), and Fantom (FTM) are the clear winners. Qubetics is revolutionizing the way we use crypto for real-world payments, combining simplicity with cutting-edge features like smart contract conversions and multi-chain support. Filecoin’s FVM upgrade is opening the door for decentralized apps, adding layers of utility to its secure storage platform. Meanwhile, Fantom’s focus on speed and low fees is attracting developers in droves, positioning it as one of the most scalable blockchains on the market. If you’re serious about locking in gains this month, these three projects deserve your attention. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Filecoin (FIL), and Fantom (FTM) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. The clock is ticking—don’t miss out on these opportunities while they’re still under the radar.

The launch of the Ripple USD ( RLUSD ) stablecoin follows the official announcement of its highly anticipated unveiling on December 16. In that communication, Ripple stated that RLUSD would go live on December 17 with key launch partners, including some of the world’s leading crypto exchanges and platforms. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the stablecoin’s launch on several exchanges in a post on X. These include Uphold, MoonPay, CoinMENA, ArchaxEx, and Bitso. Garlinghouse also noted that Bullish, Mercado Bitcoin, Bitstamp, Zero Hash, and Independent Reserve are set to follow. RLUSD is natively live on both Ethereum and Ripple’s XRP Ledger. Read more: Ripple CTO warns of RLUSD launch volatility, says “don’t FOMO into a stablecoin” Following a delay caused by regulatory hurdles, the launch of the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin marks a significant milestone for Ripple. The company secured regulatory approval for RLUSD from the New York State Department of Financial Services earlier this month. This development positions Ripple as a potential challenger to the dominance of stablecoin giants Tether ( USDT ) and Circle ( USDC ), the two largest USD-pegged stablecoins by market cap. Like its competitors, RLUSD aims to deliver an enterprise-grade solution that combines the stability of fiat currency with the efficiency of blockchain technology. Users can leverage RLUSD for global payments, crypto on/off ramping, and participation in the rapidly growing tokenized real-world assets market. Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoins at Ripple, described RLUSD as “mile 1 of the marathon.” In addition to instant settlements and on/off ramps, the stablecoin will support collateralization and decentralized finance integrations. XRP ( XRP ),which has rallied hard in recent months, was up 4% after the official RLUSD drop. The cryptocurrency has jumped 27% in the past week and 141% in the past month.

37765102,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24565,1734455342,"Bitfinex Alpha | Triển vọng năm 2025: Chờ đón những đỉnh cao mới, nhưng cũng đầy biến động!","Tải FUll Báo cáo Bitcoin đã đạt được những thành tựu đáng kinh ngạc, vượt qua mốc vốn hóa $2 nghìn tỷ đô và đạt giá $100.000 đô! Hiện tại, 94,25% tổng số 21 triệu Bitcoin đã được khai thác, đưa Bitcoin trở thành tài sản lớn thứ bảy thế giới, vượt mặt cả bạc và Công ty dầu mỏ & khí đốt Saudi Aramco. Đặc biệt, các quỹ ETF đã trở thành các ông lớn thống trị thị trường Bitcoin trong năm 2024, nắm giữ hơn 1,13 triệu BTC, với tổng dòng vốn đầu tư vào ETF giao ngay tại Mỹ đạt $35,5 tỷ đô. Bitfinex Alpha 135 là ấn bản cuối cùng về năm 2024, nhìn chung, các nhà phân tích có cái nhìn lạc quan về năm 2025 phía trước. Kể từ mức thấp nhất của thị trường gấu là $15.487 đô vào tháng 11/2022, Bitcoin đã tăng vọt hơn 573%, với mức tăng 130% từ đầu năm đến nay. Thị trường tăng giá hiện tại cho thấy nhu cầu rất lớn từ các tổ chức, đặc biệt là thông qua ETF và giao dịch giao ngay. Dữ liệu lịch sử cho thấy chúng ta đang ở giữa chu kỳ tăng trưởng, sau sự kiện halving tháng 4/2024. Thị trường có thể sẽ đạt đỉnh vào khoảng quý 3 – quý 4 năm 2025, tức là khoảng 450 ngày sau halving. Các chỉ báo chu kỳ Các chỉ số như MVRV , NUPL , và Chỉ báo chu kỳ thị trường tăng-giảm cho thấy thị trường vẫn đang tăng trưởng, nhưng chưa đến mức quá nóng. Các mô hình dự đoán đỉnh chu kỳ cho thấy giá Bitcoin có thể đạt từ $145.000 đến $189.000 đô. So với các chu kỳ trước, mức tăng trưởng của Bitcoin lần này có vẻ bình tĩnh hơn. Xu hướng chính và triển vọng tương lai Chúng tôi dự đoán rằng bất kỳ sự điều chỉnh giá nào trong năm 2025 cũng sẽ không quá mạnh , nhờ vào dòng vốn từ các tổ chức. Hiệu ứng năm Halving: Theo lịch sử, những năm sau halving thường chứng kiến ​​những đợt tăng giá mạnh mẽ nhất . Mục tiêu chu kỳ: Giá Bitcoin tối thiểu có thể đạt $145.000 đô vào giữa năm 2025 , và thậm chí có thể lên đến $200.000 đô nếu điều kiện thuận lợi. Mặc dù giá Bitcoin có thể biến động trong quý 1/2025, nhưng nhìn chung, xu hướng vẫn là tăng trưởng, nhờ vào ETF, sự chấp nhận của các tổ chức và vị thế ngày càng quan trọng của Bitcoin trên thị trường tài chính toàn cầu. Tuy nhiên, các nhà đầu tư cần cẩn trọng với các dấu hiệu mua quá mức khi Bitcoin tiến gần đến đỉnh chu kỳ. Bối cảnh kinh tế Mỹ : Hiệu suất giá Bitcoin năm 2025 cũng phụ thuộc vào bối cảnh kinh tế Mỹ. Hiện tại, nền kinh tế Mỹ đang dần ổn định trên các lĩnh vực chính. Thị trường lao động đang điều chỉnh ổn định , với tỷ lệ thất nghiệp tăng nhẹ lên 4,2% do nguồn cung lao động tăng chứ không phải do mất việc làm. Tăng trưởng tiền lương vẫn ở mức tốt (4% mỗi năm), hỗ trợ chi tiêu tiêu dùng. Các lĩnh vực như chăm sóc sức khỏe và giải trí cũng cho thấy sự phục hồi của nền kinh tế. Fed dự kiến ​​sẽ thận trọng trong việc cắt giảm lãi suất để cân bằng giữa thị trường việc làm đang hạ nhiệt và áp lực lạm phát. Thị trường nhà ở có nhu cầu ổn định, dự kiến giá nhà sẽ tăng 2,4% bất chấp lãi suất thế chấp cao. Tuy nhiên, khả năng chi trả vẫn là một thách thức, đặc biệt là với những người mua nhà lần đầu. Lạm phát vẫn là vấn đề đáng quan tâm, với CPI lõi ổn định ở mức 3,3%, phản ánh áp lực liên tục về giá xe cộ và hàng hóa lâu bền. Fed đang gặp khó khăn trong việc đạt được mục tiêu lạm phát 2%. Tăng trưởng kinh tế mạnh mẽ (dự kiến 3,8% trong quý 4) hỗ trợ việc Fed nới lỏng tiền tệ, nhưng cần điều chỉnh nếu lạm phát tiếp tục tăng. Triển vọng thị trường chứng khoán: Triển vọng thị trường chứng khoán dưới thời tân Tổng thống Mỹ – Donald Trump được thúc đẩy bởi các chính sách hỗ trợ tăng trưởng kinh tế , bao gồm cắt giảm thuế và nới lỏng quy định. Điều này có lợi cho các ngành công nghiệp, tài chính và hàng tiêu dùng tùy ý. Thị trường nhà đất đang tăng trưởng vừa phải và nguồn cung nhà ở đang được cải thiện, điều này có thể hỗ trợ cho các cổ phiếu liên quan đến bất động sản. Tuy nhiên, lãi suất vay mua nhà vẫn còn cao nên những người mua nhà có thể gặp khó khăn, và điều này có thể hạn chế lợi nhuận của các công ty trong lĩnh vực này. Lịch sử cho thấy thị trường chứng khoán thường tăng điểm sau khi Fed giảm lãi suất. S&P 500 và Dow Jones đã tăng trưởng tốt sau những lần cắt giảm lãi suất gần đây . Tuy nhiên, những rủi ro như lạm phát, căng thẳng chính trị quốc tế và các hạn chế về tài chính có thể ảnh hưởng tiêu cực đến thị trường chứng khoán trong dài hạn. Tóm lại: Năm 2025 được dự báo là một năm lạc quan nhưng cần thận trọng, với tăng trưởng kinh tế ổn định, những thách thức về cấu trúc và điều chỉnh chính sách. Mặc dù sự ổn định trên các lĩnh vực mang lại sự lạc quan, nhưng rủi ro bên ngoài và áp lực lạm phát vẫn là những yếu tố cần theo dõi.

The firm has recently invested in StablR, a rising stablecoin provider. This partnership shows Tether’s dedication to promoting regulated digital assets in Europe. It comes as the region prepares to implement the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation later this month. Tether’s Push Into Europe’s Digital Finance Infrastructure Tether’s investment in StablR is pivotal for Europe’s crypto landscape. MiCA’s incoming comprehensive regulatory framework is set to reshape how stablecoins operate. The new law emphasizes transparency, compliance, and security. Recognizing the opportunity, Tether is aligning itself with StablR. This provider has two stablecoins, the euro-pegged EURR and the dollar-pegged USDR. Notably, these assets are already fully MiCAR-compliant and backed by full reserves. This investment follows Coinbase’s recent delisting of major stablecoins , including Tether’s USDT, from its platform. Many believe this move is part of Tether’s strategy to maintain a strong foothold in the European market. StablR’s Rising Influence in the Stablecoin Ecosystem StablR, a European pioneer in stablecoin technology, has rapidly gained traction. It focuses on improving liquidity management, reducing transaction costs, and ensuring strict compliance. These strengths have helped it stand out in the competitive stablecoin market. The global stablecoin market recently surpassed $200 billion in market capitalization. Meanwhile, euro-pegged stablecoins alone have reached nearly $400 million. StablR’s innovative stablecoins could benefit from its significant momentum. Also, its integration with Tether’s Hadron tokenization platform could further boost its potential. Hadron, launched by Tether, makes it easier to convert real-world assets like stocks and bonds into digital tokens. Also, it ensures compliance with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) regulations. StablR’s partnership with Hadron will help expand its stablecoins to more blockchains. This includes Ethereum and Solana, which could improve user accessibility and liquidity. Europe’s Regulatory Clarity Spurs Innovation The impending enforcement of MiCA on December 30 promises to create fair rules for crypto businesses in Europe. Notably, StablR, including Circle’s USDC and EURC stablecoins, have complied early with MiCA regulations and are preparing for the upcoming changes. In addition, StablR has also secured an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license from the Malta Financial Services Authority. These steps position StablR to benefit from a clearer regulatory environment. Tether’s investment in StablR signals a shift in the future of digital finance in Europe. Stablecoins are becoming a key part of the global financial system. Partnerships like this show the growing maturity of the sector.

Sarah Knafo also believes that it’s time for the European Union to develop the mining industry because the French hold the cards with their nuclear assets. The politician urged the parliament to stop taxing cryptocurrency holders more and more. She said that it is their intelligence, risks and sleepless nights that have built up their savings. Knafo wants cryptocurrency holders to be able to protect themselves from the crazy cycle that the state has created. The Member of Parliament also revealed that the public deficit that pushes towards monetary creation also creates inflation, which leads to chaos. She urged the parliament to dare to be free and stop being afraid of their shadows. “Let us remain faithful to the ambition of our civilization,” she added.

The cryptocurrency is trading at $108,223 , marking a 2% increase over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s price has surged nearly 60% since the U.S. elections, driven by growing confidence in President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Trump has pledged to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and nominated crypto supporter Paul Atkins to replace current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has been criticized for his anti-crypto policies. Institutional interest has been a major factor in Bitcoin’s rise. More than 70 public companies now hold Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. Michael Saylor , chairman of MicroStrategy, described Bitcoin as the “ Cyber Manhattan ” of this digital age, comparing its value to real estate in Manhattan—always worth owning. MicroStrategy, a leader in corporate Bitcoin holdings, now owns 439,000 BTC, valued at around $46 billion. Corporate rules are also shifting in Bitcoin’s favor. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has updated regulations, allowing companies to include Bitcoin on their balance sheets without negative accounting impacts. James Lavish, from the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, noted that this change is further legitimizing Bitcoin as a corporate asset. Investor confidence has soared since Trump’s election win. The number of “whales”— large Bitcoin holders —has skyrocketed. According to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin whales have purchased over 70,000 BTC worth $7.28 billion in just 48 hours, fueling the recent price rally. Optimism is also rising due to MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, set for December 23. Analysts expect Bitcoin to maintain its upward momentum, predicting prices could reach between $150,000 and $200,000 by the end of 2025. As corporate adoption expands and regulatory support strengthens, Bitcoin continues to set new milestones. Many investors now view the cryptocurrency as a critical long-term asset.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-hits-108k-new-record-as-confidence-grows,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37764436.jpeg

Ross also noted that the new regime would not suffice to eliminate the inherent uncertainty and volatility in the crypto-assets market. She added that investors should fully understand the risks before engaging in this space. Framework Addresses Market Abuse MiCA provides a framework for crypto-asset markets to address concerns related to market abuse, investor protection, and operational resilience. The regulator said over the past 18 months, ESMA, in collaboration with the European Banking Authority (EBA), has developed over 30 technical standards and guidelines to ensure smooth implementation. The updated rules include regulatory technical standards on market abuse and outline systems and procedures to detect and prevent abuse in crypto-asset markets. These standards also provide reporting templates for suspected market abuse and detail coordination procedures for addressing cross-border enforcement issues. Ripple Exec Says MiCA Regulation is Far From Complete In a recent interview with CryptoNews , Tom Kiddle, co-founder of Palisade and former Ripple executive, shared insights on the EU’s MiCA regulation. While MiCA is being hailed for its clarity to the market, Kiddle raised important concerns. From whether MiCA offers sufficient protection for retail investors to the gap in regulation for NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi), Kiddle believes regulation is a significant first step. With geopolitical tensions rising and cryptocurrency being scrutinized as a tool for money laundering, global regulatory cooperation will be essential for the future of crypto assets. The EU’s MiCA laws may provide a competitive advantage, but the global regulatory environment is still tightly fragmented.

42415851,a72b2b57-dab3-4ffc-b7d6-8c26bc4b6234,1734454169,Staking Will Define Bitcoin's Role in the Global Digital Economy in 2025,"Bitcoin has historically been used for two main things: as a store of value and a medium of exchange. These two use cases have served the burgeoning digital economy well, as evidenced by bitcoin's roughly $2 trillion market cap and millions of institutional and retail users around the globe. These two use cases can be considered ""native"" to Bitcoin in that BTC holders do not need to trust third parties to benefit from them, while ""foreign"" use cases would include lending and borrowing, which involve reliance on centralized intermediaries.  So it's fair to say that Bitcoin has achieved global prominence, including inspiring the creation of Ethereum and thousands of other protocols and tokens and BTC becoming the reserve currency of El Salvador, on just two main use cases. Is this enough to continue its exponential impact on finance? Based on Bitcoin's extraordinary contributions to transforming our global systems to-date, it certainly could be, but I would argue that the introduction of additional native use cases—that is, those that retain the core tenets of decentralization and self-custody—will further Bitcoin's impact on the world's stage. The advent of novel security sharing protocols have made BTC staking a third native use case for Bitcoin, which will define the next era of its growth.  Bitcoin staking as a means of enhancing the security of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems while retaining user control enhances the utility of bitcoin as an asset for holders, while also providing a key service to Layer-2s, data availability layers, oracles, wallets and liquid staking token providers. By enabling both institutional and retail holders to realize staking rewards without having to liquidate their positions, BTC gains a new role within the broader digital economy.    PoS-based systems also tap into the decentralized security architecture for Bitcoin, safeguarding their ecosystems. Such synergy has furthered the bridging of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and PoS worlds and created more financial utility for bitcoin, the asset.    Do PoS chains need added security?    The short answer is yes. Because PoS chains are secured by validators that stake capital, security increases with the amount of value staked. But, it can be difficult for smaller chains to incentivize staking validators, and so high inflation is often leveraged to attract capital with greater rewards. The downside to this approach is that the high inflation can't then be used to incentivize applications being built on the chain—which hampers the growth and ultimately the success of the project. The pool of potential validators with capital within the Ethereum ecosystem is also only so big.    Bitcoin, on the other hand, remains the network with the largest market cap and the greatest number of holders. If these holders could be incentivized to stake their BTC assets to secure PoS chains… well, that's an elegant solution that is now a real option.    How BTC staking works  Bitcoin staking is a two-sided market. On one side are the BTC holders—the suppliers—who earn staking rewards in exchange for offering their assets to secure PoS chains. And on the other side are the PoS protocols that benefit from the enhanced security stemming from the increased capital being staked as a part of the transaction validation process essential to the long-term viability of the network. The fact that Bitcoin is the most decentralized network and BTC is the least volatile among digital assets also helps. Additionally, because PoS systems rely on slashing as a way to punish bad actor-validators, this also applies to staked BTC.  BTC staking goes institutional  Beyond benefiting retail users by allowing them to earn passive rewards on their BTC holdings, bitcoin staking offers an incredibly attractive opportunity to corporations and governments, both of which are increasingly getting involved in digital assets. Around 2.2% of bitcoin's supply was held by governments around the world as of August 2024, with the United States possessing 213,246 BTC, followed by China with 190,000 BTC.  Interestingly, smaller nations such as Bhutan have also become significant actors in the bitcoin space, ranking in fourth place for bitcoin owned by governments, behind the UK's 61,000 BTC reserves and just ahead of El Salvador's reported holdings of 5,800 BTC. This trend of increasing governmental bitcoin holdings represents a larger evolution in financial and geo-strategic planning to bolster economic stability on both a large and small state level.  Rather than sitting on idle bitcoin in their treasuries, institutions and governments can put these assets to work through bitcoin staking. The massive opportunity enabled by bitcoin staking is poised to transform bitcoin from merely a store of value and medium of exchange into an active asset that further incentivizes participation in decentralized systems and digital assets more broadly.  Bitcoin staking is likely only the beginning of Bitcoin as a foundation for innovation. In 2025, we are likely to see the rise of other native use cases that continue to cement bitcoin as a foundational asset within the global financial ecosystem.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Fisher Yu,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/16/bitcoin-staking-will-define-the-crypto-s-role-in-the-global-digital-economy-in-2025,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d362b063d041968027a3867005ab0fb225024f51-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here Are the Details,"Lido, the largest liquid staking protocol by total value locked (TVL), has begun terminating staking services for its Polygon PoS chain following a community-approved vote in November. Lido Begins to Phase Out Staking Service for Polygon PoS Chain Lido’s integration with the Polygon PoS network allowed users to stake Polygon’s native MATIC tokens in exchange for liquid staking tokens called stMATIC. However, the protocol officially shut down the Polygon staking service on Monday, with users able to withdraw their funds until June 16, 2025. According to the official announcement, withdrawals will still be possible after this date but will require the use of explorer tools. Lido attributed this decision to a combination of challenges that prevented the service from achieving its desired impact. “Lido on Polygon encountered significant challenges in achieving its intended impact,” the memorandum said. “A variety of factors contributed to this situation: limited user adoption, insufficient rewards, resource-intensive maintenance requirements, and evolving ecosystem dynamics.” The announcement also noted that the focus of token holders is shifting towards Ethereum, where Lido continues to dominate as the leading liquid staking provider. Earlier this year, Lido DAO approved a “community staking module” initiative that aims to make Ethereum solo staking more accessible and inclusive. The move mirrors Lido’s decision to shut down its Solana staking service last year, when operating losses of $484,000 far exceeded revenues of $220,000. Lido continues to be the largest liquid staking protocol for Ethereum and maintains its position as the top decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by TVL. At the time of writing, Lido’s TVL stands at approximately $39.3 billion, underscoring its continued dominance in the liquid staking sector. *This is not investment advice.

The Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin has been officially launched by the titular San Francisco-based crypto company. At present, the stablecoin is intended to run on two networks concurrently: Ethereum and, of course, Ripple’s “native” ledger, XRP Ledger (XRPL). According to reports, RLUSD has already been officially made accessible to all users. Ripple’s team adds that “An enterprise-grade stablecoin built for everyone, $RLUSD combines fiat stability with blockchain efficiency.” Ripple USD (RLUSD) is now live on global exchanges. An enterprise-grade stablecoin built for everyone, $RLUSD combines fiat stability with blockchain efficiency: ➡️ Instant global payments, 24/7 ➡️ Seamless on/off ramps ➡️ Access value in real-world assets.… pic.twitter.com/lJ43GdoDGR — Ripple (@Ripple) December 17, 2024 The launch follows the approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services earlier this month. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed excitement over the launch of the Ripple USD stablecoin. He described it as “an enterprise-grade stablecoin for everyone.” Ripple’s RLUSD goes live – Trade here Designed for trust, utility, and compliance, RLUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents, with monthly third-party audits ensuring transparency. Ripple’s CEO shared on social media platform X that RLUSD would debut on Uphold, Moonpay, Coinmena, Archax, and Bitso — with Bullish, Mercado Bitcoin, Zero Hash, Independent Reserve, and Bitstamp “soon to follow.” Garlinghouse highlighted the regulatory rigor behind RLUSD, stating, “Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide.” Source: Ripple Ripple Payments will incorporate RLUSD into its global operations early next year, capitalizing on its near-global reach and $70 billion yearly payment volume. However, note that the stablecoin will not initially be available on Coinbase or Robinhood. “Part of the impetus for us wanting to launch a stablecoin is the growth we’ve seen specifically in cross-border payments,” Jack McDonald, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins, told CNBC . “As we’ve been using stablecoins more and more in our flows, that really piqued our interest that we should have our own native stablecoin that can be more cost effective and more operationally efficient to use.” Simon McLoughlin, CEO of Uphold, highlighted the company’s enthusiasm for Ripple’s innovation, stating, “It’s no secret that we’ve been big supporters of the XRP community and the innovation Ripple has brought to the industry.” “RLUSD is poised to play a significant role in the evolution of digital payments, enterprise finance, and beyond, and we are proud to be among the initial launch partners of Ripple’s first-ever stablecoin solution,” he added. RLUSD price fluctuations The stablecoin’s price initially fluctuated within a 20% range on several decentralized exchanges. However, according to XPMarket, the price of RLUSD has currently stabilized at $1. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, recently issued a cautionary note regarding potential market dynamics, suggesting that an initial scarcity of stablecoin supply could trigger a price surge, contradicting the very essence of stability that these coins are designed to uphold. Ripple’s RLUSD launch comes at a time when demand for stablecoins is increasing. According to Ripple, the whole stablecoin market could skyrocket to $2 trillion by 2028. This is a result of the increase in demand for low-volatility fiat-pegged tokens. Ripple’s regulatory contingencies Ripple is not new to regulatory crackdowns and lawfare from the United States SEC. The team behind the stablecoin could not accommodate any of that this time around. To that end, Ripple brought in Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and Kenneth Montgomery, former COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, to its advisory board. Rajan highlighted the transformative potential of stablecoins in private payments, describing RLUSD as a secure and efficient alternative to conventional systems. Montgomery underscored RLUSD’s capacity to revolutionize global finance and broaden access to financial services. Armed with robust partnerships, regulatory support, and a commitment to innovation, RLUSD is on track to redefine the standards for stablecoins. XRP price action amid the launch Interestingly, following the launch of the stablecoin, the price of XRP fell by more than 2.3%, dropping to $2.4 per token at one time. This was most likely caused by investors trading the crypto for RLUSD for testing or simply for the sake of hype. However, that sentiment has turned bullish. The price of XRP (XRP) is trading at $2.59 today, with a 24-hour trading volume of $18,509,352,084. Source: CoinMarketCap Note that, the availability of RLUSD is dependent on jurisdiction.

BVNK has applied for licenses in all U.S. states, securing approval in several, including Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Michigan and New Hampshire, the company told CoinDesk in an e-mail.  The latest investment round was led by Haun Ventures and included contributions from Coinbase Ventures and Tiger Global, BVNK said on Tuesday.

Amid this flurry of activity, 1Fuel is garnering significant attention, aiming to raise $100,000 daily in its ongoing crypto presale, as investors seek opportunities in this dynamic space. Problem-Solving 1Fuel Might Just Give You The Trading Experience of Your Dreams The crypto market has no shortage of users but that's not to say that all the users are active. One major reason for this is the complexity associated with crypto wallet platforms like Trust Wallet. 1Fuel was created to solve this problem by simplifying digital asset management. This way, there will be increased accessibility which will ensure that crypto trading is easy for both new and seasoned traders in the market. Apart from this crypto wallet feature, 1Fuel also protects user privacy with its built-in mixer and disposable wallets. These two special features anonymize transactions and prevent tracking. 1Fuel also has a P2P exchange which allows users to trade directly without any meddling intermediaries. This results in little to no fees and increased privacy when trading. Further, 1Fuel will offer debit cards as part of its ecosystem, enabling users to easily convert their cryptocurrency to fiat currency for online, in-store, and everyday purchases. The cards will seamlessly integrate with users’ wallets, automatically handling the conversion process to make transactions quick and convenient. XRP Future May Hold Green Charts Despite Legal Battle Since President-elect Donald Trump’s U.S. election victory, XRP has skyrocketed by over 167% in the last month. This impressive rise has resulted in XRP surpassing SOL in market capitalization. Currently trading around $2.40, XRP investors are thrilled, especially considering the significant growth challenges posed by XRP’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Despite all the legal drama, things are finally looking up for XRP this altcoin season, and not just in terms of price. Recently, major financial firms like Bitwise, WisdomTree, and 21Shares are planning to introduce XRP-backed ETFs. If these ETFs gain approval, they could attract huge investments and potentially increase XRP’s price to $5 very soon. Avalanche New Ecosystem Update Could Push Its Price to New Highs On December 12, the Avalanche Foundation made a big announcement that raised a lot of excitement in the AVAX community. The foundation announced that it raised $250 million through a private AVAX token sale to support the Avalanche blockchain. The funding round included around 40 participants, including huge firms like Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, and ParaFi Capital. Unsurprisingly, the announcement triggered a notable 10% increase in AVAX’s value. As a result, AVAX has been hovering around the $50 mark for the past week. With this news and according to its price chart data, it is likely that AVAX will hit $60 this altcoin season. A potentially contributing factor to this growth is the Avalanche9000 upgrade. This upgrade, which is scheduled for Dec. 16, will reduce Layer-1 deployment costs by 99.9% and cut C-Chain transaction fees by 25x. Conclusion While XRP and AVAX are making strides in the DeFi space, 1Fuel is stealing the spotlight with its fast-selling crypto presale. Currently priced at $0.012 in its second stage, it has already raised nearly $700,000. With this momentum, this figure is likely to escalate into the millions soon.

Ondo (ONDO) Ondo Finance is changing how we think about investing by bringing together the best of traditional finance and blockchain technology. It takes stable, income-generating assets from the real world and turns them into tokens on the blockchain. This means more people can access high-quality financial products that were once out of reach. Ondo's setup includes an asset management team that creates these tokenized products and a tech team that builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, making their offerings more functional and able to grow. In a crypto market often marked by ups and downs, trust and safety are key. Ondo tackles this by teaming up with trusted partners like BlackRock and using Coinbase to securely hold crypto assets. They focus on being clear and following all legal rules. One of their standout products, USDY, mixes the ease of stablecoins with yields backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits. This offers non-US investors a way to access regulated and transparent financial products. With the market leaning towards stability and real-world asset backing, Ondo's approach might make it a notable player compared to other coins. Tron (TRX) TRON (TRX) is a blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It aims to decentralize the internet by giving content creators full ownership of their work. Instead of relying on middlemen like YouTube or Facebook, artists can share content directly with their audience. This means creators receive more rewards for their efforts. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), making it a valuable tool for developers. Transactions are transparent and recorded on a public ledger, similar to how Bitcoin works. The potential of TRON lies in its mission to reshape how content is shared and monetized online. By cutting out intermediaries, it offers lower fees and greater control to creators. This approach is attractive in today's market, where there's a growing demand for fair compensation in digital spaces. Compared to platforms like Ethereum, TRON boasts faster transaction speeds and better scalability. As interest in decentralized applications grows, TRX could see increased adoption. For those looking to support a decentralized internet and empower content creators, TRX presents an intriguing option in the current market cycle. Conclusion Although ONDO and TRX are promising alternatives to XRP, XYZVerse (XYZ) offers a unique sports-meme fusion aiming for significant growth during the current bull run.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The scheme , which targeted real estate transactions, resulted in millions of dollars in losses for businesses and individuals. In December 2023, fraudsters infiltrated systems used in real estate transactions, sending fake wire transfer instructions to divert funds intended for mortgages and other payments. One company reported losing over $1 million. Investigators later uncovered at least ten additional victims, with individual losses ranging from $75,000 to $425,000, according to the DOJ. The stolen funds were laundered through multiple bank accounts and eventually consolidated into a cryptocurrency wallet controlled by fraudsters in Nigeria . Law enforcement seized 32.68 Bitcoin ( BTC ) from the wallet, valued at $900,000 at the time. To facilitate victim compensation, the U.S. Attorney’s Office filed a civil forfeiture case to claim the seized Bitcoin. You might also like: Binance Wallet unveils Binance Alpha to highlight emerging projects Bitcoin’s price surge will facilitate repayment Since the seizure, Bitcoin’s price has more than tripled, significantly increasing the value of the seized assets. This rise in value now allows the DOJ to compensate each of the ten victims who filed claims, potentially making them whole. Civil forfeiture is a legal process where authorities seize assets linked to criminal activity, even before suspects are arrested. U.S. Attorney Tessa M. Gorman highlighted its importance in helping victims recover losses. “I commend the quick work by law enforcement and the Asset Forfeiture Unit who moved to seize this Bitcoin and are working diligently to make these victims whole,” said Gorman. “Civil forfeiture is an important tool that we can use to help victims, even before the bad actors themselves have been arrested.” You might also like: Tether backs StablR to expand MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin offerings",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/bitcoins-treble-allows-us-gov-to-pay-back-crypto-fraud-victims/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37763874.jpeg

Stacks (STX) Over the past six months, Stacks (STX) has experienced significant growth, with its price increasing by over 55%. In the last month alone, the coin surged nearly 33%. However, the past week saw a slight decline of about 8%, bringing the current trading range to between $1.96 and $2.84. The recent dip might be a temporary correction in an overall upward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55.07, suggesting that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are hovering around $2.48 and $2.34, respectively, indicating a mild bullish momentum. The MACD level at 0.0299 also hints at potential upward movement. If STX manages to break above the nearest resistance level at $3.22, it could target the next resistance at $4.09. This would represent a potential increase of around 44% from current levels. On the downside, if the price falls below the nearest support at $1.47, it might test the second support at $0.5981, which would be a significant drop. Traders are keeping a close eye on these key levels to gauge the coin's next move. IOTA (IOTA) IOTA has seen significant price movements recently. In the last month, its price surged by 154.56%, showing strong upward momentum. Over the past six months, the price increased by 136.67%. However, the past week saw a decline of 17.32%, indicating some short-term bearish pressure. Currently trading between $0.32 and $0.48, IOTA is close to its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.38 and $0.40. The nearest resistance level is at $0.57. If the price breaks above this, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.73, which would be an increase of about 52%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.24. A drop below this could see the price fall towards the second support level at $0.0832. Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index is at 56.57, suggesting the market is neither overbought nor oversold. The stochastic oscillator stands at 79.79, approaching overbought territory, which may lead to a price correction. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0009444, hinting at potential bearish momentum. Based on this data, IOTA may consolidate in the short term before making a decisive move. Conclusion While STX and IOTA show promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its unique sports memecoin ecosystem, aiming for massive growth and engaging a broad fan community.

A front company in the UAE called Green Alpine Trading, LLC, had been converting crypto into cash for North Korea, according to a press release by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The U.S. government's sanctions wing stuck that company on its blacklist as well as two Chinese nationals who had been participating in the network since 2022.

37763728,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663482,1734453033,Solana Slips To $209: Rising Bearish Pressure Threatens Key Support,"Solana is navigating a critical juncture as its price edges toward the $209 mark under increasing bearish pressure. Recent market dynamics have tilted in favor of the bears, challenging SOL’s previous upward momentum. The $209 level now emerges as a crucial line of defense, with the bulls required to act swiftly to prevent deeper losses and regain control of the market narrative. This heightened selling pressure highlights growing uncertainty, making the stakes even higher for both sides of the market. If the bulls manage to hold the line, it may signal strength and set the stage for a potential rebound. However, failure to defend this level could pave the way for further downside, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Solana Nears The Critical $209 Support Level Recent price movements indicate that Solana is under significant downside pressure as it approaches the crucial $209 support level. This decline comes despite the cryptocurrency remaining above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key indicator often associated with broader bullish trends. The negative sentiment has overshadowed the SMA’s support, signaling possible vulnerability in SOL’s price structure. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas – Analyst Expects $300 Soon While the 100-day SMA typically acts as a safety net for upward momentum, the increased selling pressure suggests that bears are testing the strength of this support. If Solana fails to hold above the $209 mark, it might invalidate the SMA’s bullish influence, paving the way for deeper losses. However, a rebound at this level could reaffirm the SMA’s role in sustaining the positive outlook, setting the stage for potential recovery. Furthermore, the 1-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending below the critical 50% threshold, signaling a shift in market sentiment toward bearish dominance. The RSI, a widely used momentum indicator, measures the speed and magnitude of price movements. When it dips below 50%, it typically indicates weakening buying pressure. This downward trend in the RSI reflects the increased bearish influence on Solana’s price, aligning with its recent decline toward the $209 support level. Sustaining its position below 50% suggests that bulls may be losing their grip, making it imperative for them to regain control soon to prevent further losses. Should the RSI continue to decline, it could reinforce the negative outlook, potentially leading to a deeper price correction. Potential Scenarios: Rebound Or Further Decline? Solana’s price, currently hovering near the $209 support level, sets up two potential scenarios: a bullish rebound or an extended decline. If the price successfully rebounds from this level, it may indicate strength and resilience, possibly pushing Solana toward higher resistance levels, such as $240 and $260, while reigniting its uptrend. Related Reading: Solana Price On The Rise: Key Resistance At $235 Could Spark Major Breakout However, failing to hold above $209 could intensify selling pressure, potentially driving the price lower toward $194 as bearish dominance takes hold. A break below this level would heighten the risk of more drops, with Solana testing the 100-day SMA as the next key support.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has seen notable price movements. In the past week, the price changed by 0.6656%, showing stability. Over the last month, Ethereum surged by 30.57%, indicating strong growth. Over six months, the price is up 15.86%, reflecting an upward trend. The current price ranges from $3648 to $4137, above the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $3948.70 and $3907.55, suggesting a positive trend. The RSI at 67.14 and Stochastic at 91.32 indicate potential overbought conditions. The MACD at 20.21 shows positive momentum, hinting at further increases. If the trend continues, Ethereum could test resistance at $4318, a gain of about 4%. Breaking this may lead to $4807, an increase of around 16%. If the price pulls back, support might be found at $3340, a drop of about 19%, or at $2852. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has experienced notable volatility recently. Over the past six months, its price has surged by 189.82%, indicating significant growth. In the last month alone, ADA climbed 56.78%, showcasing strong upward momentum. However, the past week saw a slight downturn, with the price dipping by 7.11%. Currently, ADA is trading between $0.94 and $1.22. The nearest resistance level stands at $1.35, a point where selling pressure might increase. If the price breaks through this level, the next resistance is at $1.636. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.78, providing a potential floor if prices decline. A second support level sits at $0.50, which could be crucial in preventing further losses. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $1.08 and $1.09 respectively, suggesting a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 62.08, approaching overbought territory. The Stochastic oscillator reads 84.68, which may indicate the asset is overbought and could face a price correction. The MACD level of 0.0036 points to a modest bullish trend. Conclusion ETH and ADA are set for gains, but XYZ, the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% growth, uniting sports fans in a community-driven movement.

TRON (TRX): A Decentralized Platform for Digital Content and dApps TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform developed by the Tron Foundation in 2017. It aims to give content creators full ownership rights and fair rewards for their work. Originally deployed on Ethereum as ERC-20 tokens, TRX moved to its own network in 2018. TRON supports smart contracts, blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It allows developers to create dApps and users to access content without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. Transactions occur on a public ledger, similar to Bitcoin's model. This technology could be attractive in the current market cycle as an alternative to Ethereum, offering lower transaction fees and encouraging direct interaction between creators and consumers. Kaspa: High-Speed Cryptocurrency Using GHOSTDAG and BlockDAG Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG allows blocks created in parallel to coexist and orders them in consensus. Kaspa's blockchain is a blockDAG, which generalizes Nakamoto consensus. This enables secure operation while maintaining very high block rates, currently 1 block per second, with goals of 10 per second and even 100 per second. This results in confirmation times dominated by internet latency. Kaspa has features like Reachability for querying the DAG's topology, block data pruning, SPV proofs, and future plans for subnetwork support to facilitate layer 2 solutions. Kaspa's technology shows potential for scalability, and it has attracted interest in the current market cycle due to its innovative approach. VeChain (VET): Enhancing Supply Chain Transparency with Blockchain VeChain is a blockchain platform focused on improving supply chain management. It uses smart contracts to assign unique IDs and sensors to physical products, allowing detailed tracking through the supply chain. This helps in verifying authenticity and managing recalls in industries like fashion, food, and automotive. Founded in 2015 by Sunny Lu, VeChain transitioned to its own blockchain in 2018, introducing a dual-token system with VET for value transfer and VeThor Token (VTHO) for transaction fees. With partnerships like Walmart China and BMW, VeChain demonstrates real-world utility. Its proof of authority consensus mechanism enhances transaction validation. Given its growing adoption and practical applications, VeChain looks attractive in the current market cycle. Terra Classic (LUNC): A Revived Blockchain with Stablecoins Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain protocol that uses stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies. It aims to provide fast and affordable global payments with price stability. The project began in January 2018 and launched its mainnet in April 2019. In May 2022, the original Terra chain was renamed Terra Classic, and its native token became LUNA Classic (LUNC). The technology combines the stability of fiat currencies with the benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. LUNC's potential lies in offering efficient and stable transactions. Its attractiveness in the current market depends on various factors, including market trends and individual investment goals. Conclusion While TRX, KAS, VET, and LUNC may offer gains, they have less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out as the Meme Token for Alpha Males, embodying luxury and success. It aims for high growth, with 700% expected by presale end and potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

37763668,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629064,1734452458,UK’s FCA warns citizens to avoid Solana-based meme coin,"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. has issued a public notice aimed at the Solana meme coin Retardio. FCA alleges that this entity may be offering or endorsing financial services or products without the necessary authorization. According to FCA, using the meme coin disqualifies investors from contacting the Financial Ombudsman Service which provides a service that settles complaints between consumers and businesses that provide financial services. Also, Retardio buyers are similarly not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme that comes into play if the financial firm used goes out of business and can’t pay the claim. The entity can step in to pay compensation. FCA asserted, “You should avoid dealing with this firm and beware of scams.” Still, the Retardio community seemed to take the matter lightly as they responded with memes on social media. Retardio memecoin on Solana Immediately following the FCA’s notification, the token experienced a 17% decline in value, following a previous peak of approximately $240 million. The Retardio project includes a non-fungible token (NFT) collection based on Solana, with a lifetime sales total of $31 million, as reported by CryptoSlam. Dexscreener also estimates that the linked meme coin, “Retardio,” is worth approximately $0.08 and has a market cap of approximately $87 million. The FCA urged its citizens to only conduct business with authorized organizations. The regulator stated that authorized firms provide consumers with more protection in the event of an incident. In addition, FCA stated that consumers can verify the authorization of the company they are doing business with by consulting its registry. The meme coin and NFT project, however, humorously responded to the FCA, stating that it had “issued a warning against the UK’s financial regulator.” FCA tightens regulations amidst becoming a crypto hub Early this year, the U.K.’s FCA planned to focus on increasing its capabilities in detecting and pursuing market abuse in the crypto sector and assisting in delivering a proportionate market abuse regime for the asset class for the whole year. Additionally, the financial regulator declared that it would implement advanced analytics capabilities, such as cross-asset class visualizations and network analysis. The regulator also stated that it will enhance its consumer awareness campaigns to inform investors about fraud. On the other hand, the UK committed itself to taking the U.S. on as a global crypto hub. The doubts are still there as the FCA issued a comparable notification regarding the meme coin launchpad – Pump.fun in the early part of December. Pump.fun subsequently restricted platform access for users in the United Kingdom. Previously, crypto investors ran off from the US. With the new pro-crypto administration, crypto investors are looking for ways to go back to the US. Is the UK going to replace the US with unfriendly regulations? Solana-based meme coins Generally, meme coins have been doing well in the current market. The risks are steep, but so is the upside. Memecoins are volatile, unpredictable, and yet undeniably relevant. Solana offers an appealing substitute for Ethereum. Its scalability and speed enable meme coin developers to establish cost-effective and rapid ecosystems, which in turn facilitates more frequent transactions and broader adoption. Built on the Solana blockchain, BONK capitalizes on the network’s speed and scalability. Bonk Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Pump.fun, for example, is also lighting up Solana’s activity charts, and meme coin communities on X and Discord are driving the momentum. Despite these benefits, Solana meme coin’s network’s security and reliability have been a source of concern due to its relatively centralized make. Pump.fun experienced a decline in its weekly revenue as a result of the disabling of its live stream feature in response to allegations of detrimental content being broadcast. Such issues have caused discouraged users from investing. I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting ""a little"" weird now. Let's build real applications using blockchain. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 26, 2024 Additionally, the extensive liquidity and developer support that is available on Ethereum are frequently absent from Solana meme coins. Although Solana has succeeded in attracting retail investors through its efficiency, the absence of robust utility restricts the long-term viability of its meme coin ecosystem.

37763666,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629116,1734452432,The Gem Pad token launchpad has been exploited for $2M on multiple chains,"The Gem Pad token launchpad is posting suspicious transactions, on-chain research shows. The platform for token launches and sales was exploited for an estimated $2.2M. Gem Pad is sending out suspicious transactions, pointing to an exploit of multiple chains and tokens. The Gem Pad team immediately mitigated the hack, explaining that multiple security locks had been breached. IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT As some of you may have noticed, an incident occurred last night where someone managed to breach our security locks. We immediately contacted all of our partners and experts in the space to investigate and resolve the situation. The issue has now been… — 𝗚𝗲𝗺𝗣𝗮𝗱 (@TheGemPad) December 17, 2024 Code analysts pointed out the reason for the attack as a reentrancy on one of the functions that creates a token lock. The malicious token transfer allowed the hacker to get back the liquidity from several projects. The tokens affected were from three major chains – Ethereum, Base, and BNB Smart Chain. The GempadLock smart contract was the flawed entry point, due to lack for reentrancy protection. The exploit happened despite the recent audit by Cyberscope. GemPad was even given a high security score, though the flaw was found within one function in one smart contract. After the news of the exploit, the GEMS token backtracked slowly to $0.11. The native token of the Gem Pad platform already slid in the second half of 2024, and now trades at around $0.11. Gem Pad projects face fallout from stolen tokens The attacker drained resources from the security locks of Gem Pad, then swapped them for ETH and BNB and consolidated the haul. According to Gem Pad, only a handful of projects were affected, but the platform is now safe and back online. Only the Locker service is unavailable until further announcement. Token locks on Gem Pad are the smart contracts that hold some of the tokens transparently, ensuring they will not be sold in a rug pull. Launchpads are still a tool for distributing new tokens, in addition to meme token markets. Launchpad volumes have decreased, yet Gem Pad has managed to attract a portfolio of projects. While Gem Pad itself is not compromised, it remained the central flaw point, due to the logic of its smart contract. However, the affected projects and communities are the ones that absorbed the losses. Five projects affected by drained liquidity Munch Protocol was one of the projects to have their token lock attacked. However, the protocol announced its funds are safe and unaffected, and may be recovered with the help of Gem Pad. Munch Protocol tokens are not yet traded, and have not felt the secondary effects of the hack. The protocol has not mentioned how it managed to keep its funds safe, and whether it has absorbed any direct losses. The Nutcoin Ecosystem was another project affected by the lock attack. This time, all of the project’s liquidity has been drained on Ethereum. At one point, four transactions of 100 ETH were sent directly to Tornado Cash, making them essentially unrecoverable. Anon was another project with drained liquidity, with $3.6M in value exposed. The Anon community on Base is not affected and personal wallets are safe. While $2.2M have been accounted to date, there may be a larger final accounting for all the tokens lost. FOMO Network also reported its liquidity pool on the launchpad was drained. As a result, the native FOMO token crashed from $0.004 to $0.00098. The hack also affected the newly launched DUB token by one of the partners of Alien Base DEX, a trading app on the Base chain. The hack also affected the liquidity for BPAY tokens. The exploiter sent BPAY tokens directly to Uniswap V2, later transforming the haul into WETH. Immediately after the news, BPAY slid by 75% , from $0.004 to $0.001. While the Gem Pad attack was relatively small in terms of funds stolen, the secondary effects erased even more liquidity from the market. The loss may also further compromise the integrity of the tokens and projects affected. The attack came at a time when Gem Pad was expanding its activity on Base, and posting more content to drive investors to its launchpad projects. Multiple new launches are expected in the coming days, though for now no explanation has been given on the new method of locking up liquidity .

Although it experienced a move to the upside later than most of its peers, since December 4, prices have gone up from $0.503 to approximately $2.68 at press time — a 423.80% surge. As it currently stands, XRP has seen returns of 337.18% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. XRP price YTD chart. Source: Finbold There have been quite a few positive developments for XRP as of late — on December 10, RLUSD, a stablecoin that is to be pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar received final regulatory approval. The re-election of Donald Trump is widely seen as a positive catalyst for the wider crypto market — but XRP in particular stands to benefit. Trump has named Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency advocate, as the upcoming chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. If confirmed, Atkins’ tenure would certainly be a dramatic shift from current chairman Gary Gensler’s more stringent stance — particularly in light of Ripple Labs’ ongoing legal dispute with the regulatory body. However, that wasn’t a foregone conclusion — and investors who took the risks of getting in early have secured quite the windfall for themselves. Here’s how much a $1,000 investment in XRP would be worth on December 17, 2024. The investment: $1,000 in XRP on January 1, 2021 To begin with, on January 1, 2021, XRP was trading at a much lower price — $0.23744, to be exact. Now, by press time on December 17, prices have skyrocketed to $2.68 — representing an increase of 1028.70%. A $1,000 investment made on January 1, 2021, would have netted traders approximately 4,211 XRP. At the time of publication, that amount of XRP is worth roughly $11,327 — or, in other words, a profit of $10,327. As impressive as that would have been, it pales in comparison to what would be perfect timing. XRP’s all-time high price of $3.40 was actually reached before January 1, 2021. In December of 2017, XRP was trading at $0.25322 and entered a parabolic rally — by January 6, 2018, the all-time high was reached. In comparison, a $1,000 investment made in December of 2017 would have netted investors roughly 3949 XRP — which, after the rally, would have been worth around $13,426 — for a $12,426 profit. While it’s fun to speculate and reflect, trying to time the market has historically been a tall order. Readers should note that, even in the volatile and hype-laden cryptocurrency market, theses based on analysis, utility, and due diligence are the only reliable pathways to sustainable profits.

Despite this, it has risen by about 31% over the past six months, showing strong potential. The RSI is around 37, close to oversold levels. This suggests a rebound could be on the horizon. The nearest support is at $1.91, and the nearest resistance is at $4.19. If WIF breaks through this resistance, it could reach the next level at $5.33, which would be a significant increase from current prices. The oversold indicators and upcoming altcoin season could drive WIF's price upward. Bonk (BONK): A Potential Gem in the Next Altcoin Bull Run Bonk's price has dipped over the past week and month, falling by over 20%. Despite this, it has gained more than 68% in the last six months, showing resilience. Currently trading between $0.00003055 and $0.00004474, Bonk is approaching its nearest resistance level at $0.00005269. Breaking through this level could pave the way toward the next resistance at $0.00006687. The Relative Strength Index sits around 42, suggesting the coin is nearing oversold territory, which might lead to a rebound. While the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicates slight downward momentum, the anticipated altcoin season could reignite interest. Many are watching to see if Bonk can capitalize on these conditions for potential growth. Pepe (PEPE) Poised for Potential Breakout Amid Bullish Indicators Pepe (PEPE) is showing signs of an upcoming surge. Currently trading between $0.00002107 and $0.00002779, it's approaching the nearest resistance level at $0.00003145. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 43.81, indicating room for upward movement before hitting overbought conditions. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are nearly identical, suggesting stability and potential for a bullish crossover. Over the past 6 months, PEPE has gained over 113%, hinting at strong momentum. If it breaks the resistance, it could target the second resistance at $0.00003818, representing an upside of about 37%. With the altcoin season on the horizon, PEPE might be ready for a significant rally. Conclusion While WIF, BONK, and PEPE may have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. With high growth potential during this altcoin season, DOGEN follows the success of tokens like SOL. It builds a community of ambitious leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.

37763340,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375022,1734452244,Lido Announces Phase-Out of Polygon Liquid Staking Protocol After Community Vote,"Lido, the prominent liquid staking protocol, has announced the discontinuation of its liquid staking protocol on Polygon, marking the end of its operations over the coming months. Following extensive discussions on the DAO forum and a community vote, LDO token holders officially approved the decision to phase out Lido on Polygon. The process is set to begin shortly. Lido’s Exit from Polygon Initially launched in 2021 through a proposal by Shard Labs, Lido on Polygon faced challenges such as limited user adoption, insufficient rewards, and high resource maintenance demands, according to the official blog post . Additionally, the evolving DeFi space – specifically the growing focus on zkEVM solutions – has reduced the demand for liquid staking on Polygon PoS, which hindered Lido’s ability to serve as a foundational DeFi layer. These factors, combined with Lido’s strategic focus on Ethereum, as outlined in the GOOSE and reGOOSE governance initiatives, led to the reevaluation and eventual discontinuation of Lido on Polygon. The phase-out process carries several key implications for stMATIC holders. As such, rewards will be discontinued during the transition, and a temporary pause in operations is scheduled between January 15-22, 2025, during which no withdrawals will be processed. Users are encouraged to unstake their MATIC tokens through the Lido on the Polygon front-end before June 16, 2025. After this deadline, front-end support will cease, and withdrawals will only be accessible through blockchain explorer tools. The timeline begins on December 16, 2024, when new staking will no longer be accepted. A six-month withdrawal period will follow, spanning December 16, 2024, to June 16, 2025, to facilitate a smooth transition for users. Lido has previously halted its operations on Solana last year. This decision came after a community vote, citing financial sustainability concerns and low fees as key issues. Lido was initially launched on Solana on September 8, 2021. Setbacks for Polygon Ecosystem Lido’s current decision to wind down on Polygon comes after lending protocol Aave proposed discontinuing its operations . The proposal was made by Aave’s founder, Marc Zeller, on December 13 in response to Polygon’s governance request regarding a new bridging mechanism, which raised concerns about the risk profile of bridged assets. In a related development, liquid restaking protocol Swell announced that its Layer 2 is migrating to the Optimism Superchain, moving away from the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) as part of this transition in October.

The utility-based altcoin led the top 20 crypto projects with more than 10 percent gain to trade at about $2.64 on Tuesday, December 17, during the mid-New York session. As a result, the large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $265 billion and a daily average traded volume of about $21 billion, is only 21 percent away from retesting its all-time high (ATH) set in January 2017. Moreover, XRP price has already broken out of a multi-year symmetrical triangular consolidation following an impressive rally of over 420 percent in the past two months. What Next for XRP Price? After being trapped in a bearish consolidation in the past two weeks, the XRP price has broken out of a falling channel in preparation for a fresh bull rally. According to legendary trader Peter Brandt, XRP price has finally broken out of a bullish flag, signaling the onset of a rally toward an all-time high.

37765438,https://invezz.com/?p=2392157,1734452038,"Bitcoin hits new all-time high above $107,000 as Fed rate cut looms","Bitcoin climbed to a new all-time high on Monday, surpassing $107,000 as investor sentiment strengthened ahead of a widely anticipated interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this week. The price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency rose as high as $107,229.38, marking a new record, before settling at $106,126.74, a nearly 3% increase, according to Coin Metrics. The broader cryptocurrency market also showed gains. Ether, the second-largest digital asset, surged 3% to break through the $4,000 mark for the first time this year. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which measures the performance of the top cryptocurrencies, traded about 1% higher. Investor optimism fueled by expected rate cut Investors are anticipating that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates during its two-day policy meeting set to conclude on Wednesday. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there is a 96% probability of a 25-basis-point reduction. Lower interest rates are generally seen as positive for bitcoin and other risk assets, as they tend to drive investors toward higher-yield opportunities. Bitcoin, often compared to tech stocks for its volatility and growth potential, benefits from an environment of lower borrowing costs, a weakening US dollar, and a growing money supply. “Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional risk assets like tech stocks continues to hold, and the potential rate cut provides a favorable backdrop for further price gains,” said an analyst at a leading crypto research firm. Crypto stocks face mixed performance Crypto-related equities reflected the broader market sentiment but saw mixed results as the trading session progressed. Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, gained over 1% in early trading before paring back some of its gains. MicroStrategy, widely considered a bitcoin proxy due to its extensive holdings of the cryptocurrency, initially surged by as much as 7%. However, its shares fell below the flat line later in the day. The company recently announced it would join the Nasdaq-100 stock index and the popular QQQ ETF later this month, a move expected to boost investor visibility and liquidity. MicroStrategy’s founder, Michael Saylor, also revealed that the firm had purchased an additional 15,350 BTC, bringing its total bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC, valued at approximately $46 billion. Saylor continues to buy bitcoin as the crypto market turns bullish. Long-term catalysts driving bitcoin momentum Bitcoin’s price surge extends its impressive performance this year. The cryptocurrency is up 9% for the month, 52% since the US presidential election, and a staggering 149% year-to-date. The potential for a more favorable regulatory landscape under the incoming Trump administration has provided a significant boost to investor confidence. Analysts point to discussions around establishing a national strategic bitcoin reserve as an emerging factor that could lend further credibility and adoption to the digital asset. The Fed’s upcoming decision will remain in focus as traders weigh the implications of monetary easing. A reduction in interest rates typically correlates with a softer US dollar, which has historically bolstered bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against currency devaluation. Can Bitcoin hit $200,000 in 2025? Market analysts remain optimistic about bitcoin’s upward trajectory, citing its resilience in navigating macroeconomic uncertainties. “With growing institutional adoption and favorable policy signals, bitcoin has a clear path for continued growth in the near term,” noted a strategist at a global crypto fund. However, some warn that bitcoin’s recent gains may lead to short-term corrections. “We’ve seen significant price appreciation, and a rate cut could trigger some profit-taking in the days following the announcement,” a market observer said. Ether’s rise above $4,000 further underscores the broader momentum in digital assets, particularly as investors anticipate developments in Ethereum’s network upgrades and growing utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Analyst at Bitfinex said, “The current bull market reflects strong institutional demand, led by ETFs and spot accumulation. Historical data suggests we are mid-cycle, following the April 2024 halving, with the market likely to peak around Q3-Q4 2025, approximately 450 days post-halving. Historically, post-halving years have seen the strongest rallies. Looking ahead, we believe the current run-up to over $100,000 has captured a significant portion of Bitcoinʼs price appreciation for this cycle. Our minimum price target for Bitcoin remains at $140,000- $200,000 around mid-2025”.

However, a new project, 1Fuel, is now catching the attention of ADA and SHIB backers as a potentially perfect addition to their portfolios. This article examines the unique features of 1Fuel and explains why its crypto presale is an investment opportunity worth considering. Trade Your Way To a Fortune With 1Fuel 1Fuel is quickly emerging as one of the most promising DeFi projects of the season, thanks to its impressive suite of benefits and standout features. Among these, its advanced cross-chain functionality truly sets it apart. Unlike traditional crypto trading platforms, 1Fuel achieves full decentralization through a robust cross-chain bridge, seamlessly connecting multiple networks within the crypto industry. The platform’s cross-chain system features a user-friendly one-click transaction model, enabling traders to effortlessly choose and trade any coin of their choice. Additionally, 1Fuel offers a decentralized P2P exchange, allowing users to connect directly with trading partners for transparent and secure transactions. Best of all, this exchange operates without any additional fees or hidden levies, ensuring maximum value for its users. Cardano Witnesses Huge Growth Trend in Price and Market Activity Like many other cryptos this altcoin season, ADA has had a good run this past month as it surged by an impressive 82.85%. For the past week, the token has been trading around the $1 mark after hitting its support level at $0.90 on Dec. 10. This price action has driven ADA above its 50-day EMA, so there could be some for growth in its future. However, the price of ADA‘s isn’t the only thing echoing growth in its ecosystem. The DeFi activity of ADA has also expanded exponentially. After only 2 days, ADA's TVL rose from $560 million to $644 million, according to DeFiLlama data. As such, if ADA can maintain both price and ecosystem growth, it could very well be en route to a new ATH by the end of 2024. Will Shiba Inu's Trend Continue Long Term? Over the past week, SHIB has been trading at around $0.000027, much to the delight of its investors. This price is remarkable, as it has gained almost 160% on its August low. While this growth is already noteworthy, some analysts believe the coin is on the cusp of a strong bullish breakout in the upcoming altcoin season. An X post by SHIB Mortal predicted that Shiba Inu could reach $1 during this bull run. One major factor driving this optimism in SHIB’s surge is its ongoing token burn. Data from ShibBurn shows that there has recently been a 425% burn rate increase, with 71,122,860 coins burned. Just a little over a month ago, SHIB formed golden cross and cup-and-handle patterns as its 200-day and 50-day moving averages crossed. These patterns are a sign that SHIB will go bullish soon and once this momentum starts, it might be sustained for the long term. Conclusion Want to see why ADA and SHIB backers are so hyped about 1Fuel? Take the chance to buy OFT at $0.012 each via 1Fuel's presale. Don't miss the chance to enjoy the benefits of what could be the best crypto presale of 2024.

37765907,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320350,1734451799,"Saga Launches Mainnet 2.0, Partners with Uniswap","Layer-1 blockchain protocol Saga announced the launch of its Mainnet 2.0 , as well as a new collaboration with the major decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap . Mainnet 2.0 aims to transform blockchain economics and the way the blockchain industry approaches liquidity, the team said in a press release shared with Cryptonews . This step moves the team closer to launching its Liquidity Integration Layer (LiL) in the first quarter of 2025. The novel layer will build upon Mainnet 2.0’s foundational infrastructure to provide a solution for “unified liquidity across all blockchain ecosystems.” Developers can now build on Mainnet 2.0 and will seamlessly integrate into the LiL environment once it’s launched. ‘Never Pay Gas Fees’ The Saga team argues that “unprecedented challenges” arose in the space due to the growing number of independent blockchains. This particularly impacts liquidity management and cross-chain operations. “Blockchain’s promise of financial accessibility has been held back by fragmented liquidity and prohibitive gas fees,” commented Rebecca Liao, Co-Founder and CEO at Saga. This fractured landscape of appchains and Layer-2s “forces users to navigate complex bridges, manage multiple tokens, and pay unpredictable fees just to complete basic transactions,” she added. Mainnet 2.0 and LiL aim to solve this by creating a unified environment for liquidity to flow “freely” between chains and apps. “Users never pay gas fees, and developers can finally build without constraints,” said Liao. Today we're proud to launch Saga Mainnet 2.0 with Uniswap as a partner on their first canonical appchain deployment. Learn more here: https://t.co/A3e5Av2eB4 — Saga ⛋ (@Sagaxyz__) December 17, 2024 The team stated that Saga is “a radical departure” from traditional blockchain economics. Combining LiL with a new token economic design will enable Saga to automate bridge and routing transactions. Also, it will eliminate gas fees for users interacting with DeFi products on the chain. Saga does not charge per-transaction gas fees, which tends to create barriers for users and developers. Instead, it generates revenue by capturing a percentage of the total value going through the network. Therefore, this model enables full interoperability between blockchain ecosystems, gasless transactions for end users, seamless movement of assets between different chains and applications, and new revenue opportunities for developers without burdening users. Additionally, it eliminates complex bridge systems and token management, said the team.

Per the announcement, Uniswap v3 is now deployed on Saga’s natively multichain protocol “in a historic first.” This is the inaugural app chain, the team said. Uniswap v3’s deployment on a Saga Chainlet will enable completely gasless trading, while Saga’s LiL will enable automated asset movement from any ecosystem to the Uniswap DEX. The partnership removes a major barrier to mainstream crypto adoption and makes decentralized finance accessible to everyone, said the team. “We are very supportive of the first canonical appchain deployment,” said Joe Bjornsen, Head of Uniswap Growth Program . “So many projects, especially in the ETH ecosystem, have tried to solve liquidity fragmentation in multichain environments, and this is the first comprehensive solution to market. At the most basic level, gasless trading on Uniswap is a game-changer, and now everyone can enjoy it here,” he said.

A secure foundation for the next wave of AI, gaming, and DeFi innovation. Chainlets: built to last. — Saga ⛋ (@Sagaxyz__) December 17, 2024 Additionally, to support the Mainnet 2.0 upgrade, Saga is working with two infrastructure partners: Evmos and Squid Router . Evmos is providing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) runtime for Saga’s chainlets, said the team. This enables native support for EVM tokens. At the same time, Squid Router is extending its token swapping and routing services to Saga’s EVM environment. These partnerships support the LiL development, eliminating gas fees for users and creating new revenue opportunities for developers, Saga said.

It is a CEX token that gives holders privileges like discounts, staking, and profit sharing. CRO and BNB, on the other hand, power their respective layer-1 networks. Cronos has a vibrant ecosystem that includes popular platforms like VVS Finance, Tectonic, Orby Network, and Veno Finance. Its total value locked stands at over $610 million, while its stablecoin market cap is $18.52 million. BNB, on the other hand, powers the BNB Smart Chain, which has a TVL of over $5.86 billion .

This license allows StablR to issue stablecoins that comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) . StablR currently offers two stablecoins, EURR and USDR. Both are available as ERC-20 and Solana-compatible tokens, enabling them to be transferred to any compatible wallet address. StablR plans to expand its stablecoin offerings to additional blockchain networks using Tether’s Hadron platform, recognizing the growing need for stablecoins in Europe and worldwide. “We’ve seen an incredible surge in the global stablecoin market, perfectly aligned with the growing momentum of the digital assets economy,” said Gijs op de Weegh, Founder and CEO at StablR. “Just last month, the global stablecoin market shattered records, reaching an unprecedented market cap of $190 billion.” Stablecoins Overtake Bitcoin as the Go-To for Daily Transactions Stablecoins have become a significant force in the cryptocurrency market , accounting for more than two-thirds of the trillions of US dollars worth of cryptocurrency transactions recorded in recent months. According to the latest Chainalysis report , the stablecoin market is overtaking Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the asset of choice for everyday transactions. Stablecoins are rapidly gaining popularity for daily transactions, surpassing Bitcoin. Source: Chainalysis Stablecoins are becoming increasingly useful in regions facing economic challenges, such as Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, where stablecoin usage has grown by more than 40% year-on-year. In these areas, people are using stablecoins to protect their savings from local currency instability and to access basic financial services. Eastern Asia and Eastern Europe also show strong growth in stablecoin usage, with increases of 32% and 29% respectively. Stablecoins are proving vital in economically challenged regions like Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Source: Chainalysis While stablecoin adoption in North America and Western Europe is comparatively slower, likely due to existing robust financial infrastructure, it’s still significant. According to Chainalysis, institutional players in these regions are turning to stablecoins for efficient liquidity management, settlements, and easier access to the cryptocurrency market. However, Western Europe, and particularly the UK, has emerged as a major hub for merchant services using stablecoins.

37765903,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320018,1734451297,Controversial Crypto Documentaries To Watch This Holiday Season,"Unsurprisingly, families and friends are discussing Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency this holiday season. Documentaries focused on digital assets are gaining traction as a result. Crypto documentaries allow individuals to learn more about the ever-evolving blockchain ecosystem. Movies about cryptocurrency also demonstrate how digital assets extend beyond price action. Watching these documentaries provides viewers with unique perspectives about the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem – touching on even the most controversial topics. From understanding who created Bitcoin, to learning how crypto mining can help save the planet, the films below highlight some of the most important – and controversial – aspects associated with Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery Released in October this year on HBO, Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery explores the battle over the future of money. The one-hour and forty minute long film delves into nation-state adoption efforts, the rise of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and the compromises that come with mainstream Bitcoin adoption. While these are important topics, Money Electric rose in popularity for the theory it presents about Bitcoin’s creator. The film names former Bitcoin developer Peter Todd as Satoshi Nakamoto . Filmmaker Cullen Hoback – who produced and directed Money Electric – told Cryptonews that he cares greatly about digital privacy and rights, so making a film about Bitcoin seemed logical. “Today, Bitcoin more closely resembles digital gold than cash, a move away from its privacy-centric roots,” Hoback said. “Meanwhile, CBDCs – governments’ answer to Bitcoin – embody many of Bitcoin’s flaws while abandoning its protective freedoms. I hoped to unpack some of these headier issues into a film that mainstream audiences could enjoy.” Hoback added that the film lays out a compelling theory as to who Satoshi Nakamoto may be – which is one of the most intriguing parts of the movie. “This is backed by evidence, and reinforced with revealing behavior during an on-screen confrontation,” Hoback said. “Frankly, I didn’t want to believe it at first either – it’s just where the evidence led me.” Source: HBO Since the film’s release, Hoback says he has had quiet acknowledgments from crypto “OGs” who prefer to stay out of the public fray. He added that while people often gravitate toward the usual suspects as to who Satoshi Nakamoto may be , he believes that the original Bitcoin code doesn’t align with their skillsets. “It’s messy, almost amateurish – more like something an electrical engineer would produce. That alone rules out pretty much all of the usual suspects,” he remarked. Peter Todd’s actions and evasions speak volumes.” But Money Electric isn’t just about unraveling the Satoshi mystery; it’s a fast-paced, funny, and thrilling ride through the forces shaping our financial future. “You’re riding shotgun with figures like Adam Back and his right-hand man Samson Mow as they push for Bitcoin to become the global standard,” Hoback said. The filmmaker added that families have shared stories about watching Money Electric together, saying it’s sparked debates, laughter, and even a little detective work. The HBO documentary on Bitcoin was fun for us. My entire family watched it, even my little kids, riveted. — Takens Theorem (@takenstheorem) November 22, 2024 “With Bitcoin hitting all-time highs and relatives inevitably asking questions during holiday gatherings, the film is turning out to be an unexpectedly great holiday flick,” Hoback remarked. RIGGED FROM THE START Released in November this year on the Fruition Productions’ website, Rigged From The Start (previously titled XRP Unleashed ) showcases the United States Securities and Exchange Commissions’ (SEC) war on crypto. The film portrays this through the perspective of XRP token holders. Christopher Dodge, Producer and Director of Rigged From The Start, told Cryptonews that the documentary explores the power dynamics between US regulators and the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance . “Rigged From The Start dives into the explosive connections between the SEC and private interests,” Dodge said. Source: Fruition Productions Rigged From The Start features groundbreaking revelations from industry experts, such as John Deaton , Fred Rispoli, and Jimmy Vallee. “These individuals uncover previously hidden ties between regulatory decision-makers and influential blockchain entities,” Dodge said. “The film also showcases a diverse group of XRP researchers and influencers who rigorously investigate and expose the alleged ‘revolving door’ that may have advantaged Ethereum while disadvantaging XRP and other decentralized assets.” XRP Unleashed New Documentary revealing bombshells about the battle for control of the new monetary system.

Rigged From The Start is a documentary that is sure to spark heated crypto debates this holiday season. Born In Denver Newly released documentary, Born in Denver , is a story about cowboys, energy, and technology colliding in Pecos, Texas – a small West Texas town at the frontier of the crypto movement. The one-hour and thirty minute long film follows a group of ranchers and oilmen who attend ETH Denver 2023 to discover how blockchain can transform their community. Breckyn Hager, CEO of Cuneiform, told Cryptonews that the film is an entertaining and relatable look at how a traditional, hardworking Texas town grapples with the possibilities of innovation. “ Born in Denver focuses on the human side of the story,” Hager said. “It’s told through the eyes of people who never imagined themselves in the tech world, making it an approachable and compelling watch even for those outside the blockchain space. This relatability makes it a perfect bridge for mainstream audiences to understand the promise of blockchain.” The future of filmmaking rides through West Texas.

Stream now and join #NewHollywood — Cuneiform (@cuneiform) November 26, 2024 Indeed, Born in Denver is easy to watch and understand, especially for newcomers. Throughout the film, terms such as “DAOs” are explained through visuals and plain English definitions. Source: Born In Denver Johnny Rapp, CMO of Cuneiform, told Cryptonews that a key takeaway from Born in Denver includes explaining how blockchain can empower communities like Pecos to take control of their resources, finances, and futures. “There is also the importance of accessibility – this film presents blockchain in a relatable way that can inspire mass adoption,” said Rapp. Viewers can stream Born in Denver exclusively on Cuneiform.org . This is achieved by purchasing a non-fungible token (NFT) movie ticket. Like other blockchain-based films, the NFT movie ticket also acts as a collectible digital asset that connects viewers to the film’s community. “Channels have labeled the film as ‘too innovative,’ and even independent film festivals are reluctant to embrace it,” Rapp added. “We’re finalizing secondary distribution deals to bring the film to wider audiences and preparing to open Cuneiform to other independent filmmakers. Our goal is to establish a new standard for producing and distributing independent films through blockchain technology.” DIRTY COIN Released this year, DIRTY COIN is a documentary that goes in depth about Bitcoin mining and its role in the global energy crisis . The film is an hour and ten minutes long and contains key takeaways focused on the Bitcoin mining industry. Alana Mediavilla, Director of DIRTY COIN, told Cryptonews that the documentary challenges the mainstream narrative by showcasing how Bitcoin mining – when done responsibly – can drive innovation in energy infrastructures, and even help stabilize power grids . Source: DIRTY COIN “What sets DIRTY COIN apart from other crypto documentaries is its unique perspective on the real world effects of the data center side of the digital industry,” Mediavilla said. “it’s not just about the technology or the controversies, but about the bigger picture of energy infrastructure and the opportunities Bitcoin mining brings to communities.” This documentary further fueled my pre-existing love, respect and understanding of Bitcoin mining. Great watch https://t.co/YWsFl39D8y — donny (@itsdonnyok) December 1, 2024 Mediavilla added that crypto documentaries like DIRTY COIN are critical for the mainstream because they help bridge the gap between complex technology and public understanding. DIRTY COIN won “Best Movie” at the Bitcoin Film Festival . Viewers can watch DIRTY COIN through the streaming platform Kinema through November 2025.

With sBTC, investors can access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications while maintaining Bitcoin’s core security principles. Its mainnet release follows the Nakamoto upgrade, which introduced faster transaction speeds and 100% Bitcoin finality to the Stacks network. Implemented in October, the upgrade provided the technical foundation for the successful launch of sBTC. Deposit-Only Mode According to a press release sent to CryptoPotato , sBTC deposits will be available on the Stacks mainnet starting December 17, 2024, with withdrawals expected in March 2025. L2 Labs noted that the initial phase of the sBTC launch introduces deposit-only functionality, allowing users to mint sBTC by depositing Bitcoin on Stacks. The platform has set a temporary cap of 1,000 BTC to manage liquidity and facilitate early development. “The BTC cap provides liquidity for developers to utilize sBTC and for further integrations with institutional custodians and additional partners,” the platform stated in the release. According to L2 Labs, the initial cap will gradually expand to accommodate more users as sBTC withdrawals become available in the first half of 2025 and the protocol transitions towards a fully open, permissionless signer set . Reward for Early Participants Perks have been set aside for early participants. According to the release, depositors will receive up to 5% annual Bitcoin rewards, paid in sBTC, simply for holding the asset. sBTC’s launch marks a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin ecosystem as it opens up new possibilities for developers and users to build and utilize DeFi applications on the Bitcoin network. Commenting on the latest release, Andre Serrano, Head of Product at Bitcoin L2 Labs, said: “sBTC is a major milestone for the Bitcoin ecosystem. With sBTC, Bitcoin becomes highly capable beyond a store of value, unlocking the full potential of BTC in decentralized applications.” The post sBTC Launches on Stacks Mainnet With Deposit-Only Functionality appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | SPONSORED,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/sbtc-launches-on-stacks-mainnet-with-deposit-only-functionality/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37762871.jpeg

37763677,https://blockworks.co/news/bullish-december-rally-possibility,1734451200,A bullish December rally could still be in the books,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . I am once again asking: Could we see a Santa Rally? Kaiko analysts reckon there’s a chance, though they don’t think it’s worth getting your hopes up for bitcoin at $120,000 by year-end (sad). The options data, as seen below, looks promising for a bullish December finale. There are far more calls than puts. However, analysts think that any rally may be distributed across the ecosystem, with other coins getting a boost. “Any upcoming rallies will likely be much broader than last year. Since the election smaller layer-1 coins have been outperforming BTC and ETH as traders repricing risk amid regulatory shifts in the US,” the analysts wrote. Oh, and any Santa Rally we see may not follow the traditional timeline of a rally (meaning that it occurs in the last five days of the year into the first two days of the new year). Let’s just hope Santa and his elves don’t have to work too much harder for everyone’s bags, I guess. This just underpins what we’ve been hearing from analysts and folks around crypto, which is that they expect crypto to come out looking strong in the beginning half of next year. In this week’s Empire pod , Daniel Matuszewski of CMS Holdings and Roshun Patel from Hack both carried a bullish tone. Patel, in particular, thinks that there could be big ETF inflows in January but expects seasonality to be a factor once we inch towards the summer. “I think as you go into March or May, you can maybe think a little bit more about portfolio rebalancing, but for now it’s like. It feels pretty healthy,” he told Jason Yanowitz. On the other hand, Matuszewski said that altcoins could have a similar market cycle to what we’ve seen in the past. However, he still expects “crazy swings” from the likes of memecoins and AI chatbot tokens. If I’m being honest, I’d be more afraid if both memecoins and AI chatbots weren’t volatile.

Analyst Dark Defender targets $5.85 and $8.76 as near-term price levels. Key support zones identified for potential retracement, including $2.29 and $2.02. XRP broke out on the 4-hour chart after two weeks of consolidation. Technical analyst Dark Defender has analysed and updated data to confirm this as a bullish momentum. The breakout occurred as XRP broke through a key descending trendline that had suppressed its price since it touched $2.87 on December 4. The latest move is further supported by a bullish signal on the Ichimoku Cloud and an RSI Golden Cross, which indicates growing buying strength. XRP Price Targets After Breakout Confirmation According to Dark Defender, XRP’s next step is securing a daily close above $2.52 for further confirmation.

Meanwhile, Rollblock is dominating the DeFi market with its viral GambleFi project and is poised for 880% gains before the end of its presale stages. Notcoin (NOT) Goes Viral After Launching New Reward Scheme Notcoin’s ecosystem is experiencing an impressive rebound as investors regained interest in the token earlier this week. Since Notcoin has recently launched a new Earn as a Community reward initiative, the platform is making it easier for Notcoin investors to benefit from the growing Telegram ecosystem. These rewards come from new projects on Notcoin’secosystem that want more market exposure. Notcoin is currently trading for $0.0077 after an intraday surge of 1.91%. Notcoin’s trading volume has declined by 37.71% during this period which suggests low network activity despite the anticipated airdrops. Since Notcoin’s RSI has recovered to the neutral zone already, analysts believe Notcoin can surge towards a new peak at $0.018200 by the end of Q4. Floki (FLOKI) Launches New Debit Card to Increase Crypto Adoption Floki has just launched its new Visa debit card which allows investors to spend digital assets at POS machines anywhere in the world. Since Floki’s card has no transaction fees or exchange rate fees, traders are rushing to invest in Floki to get their hands on a physical or virtual card. Since the card can be funded with Floki tokens, Floki is experiencing a huge surge in its demand. Floki is currently trading for $0.0002423 after an intraday surge of 1.26%. Since Floki’s debit card is expected to attract millions in capital inflow, analysts expect Floki’s ongoing rally to continue throughout early 2025. Since Floki’s Momentum indicator is already suggesting bullish dominance, analysts believe Floki could set a price target of $0.0005596. Rollblock (RBLK) Dominates DeFi Market in Q4 Altseason with Viral GambleFi Protocol Rollblock’s new GambleFi protocol is becoming an overnight sensation in the DeFi market as the platform has already accumulated more than $7 million in its presale stages. Since Rollblock is revolutionizing the global gambling market which is already valued at more than $500 billion per annum, analysts expect this new low cap crypto to target the gains of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies in early 2025. The main driver behind such bullish predictions is Rollblock’s commitment to user experience and security. Instead of only offering minimal security like traditional iGamblingplatforms, Rollblock has integrated Ethereum’s immutable blockchain to record all financial and betting information. Since this information is encrypted, Rollblock users can rest assured that their bets are 100% secure and unchangeable after they are placed. Rollblock is also breaking barriers to entry in the DeFi space by offering its presale tokens for a low price of only $0.0415 each. Since Rollblock’s circulating supply is capped at 1 billion tokens, analysts expect RBLK to experience strong deflationary pressure after its launch on the open market. This means that the forces of demand and supply will constantly drive Rollblock’s price upwards and increase the ROI for investors. Aside from the deflationary tokenomics, Rollblock also offers staking rewards with the highest APYs in the market. Since Rollblock uses 30% of its weekly revenue to purchase tokens on the open market, 40% of these are distributed to long-term holders as rewards. In addition, Rollblock also offers huge bonuses to VIP-tier presale holders which makes now the perfect time to invest in RBLK before the limited presale supply runs out.

37765902,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320279,1734450352,Rare Chart Pattern on Cardano – Could This Signal a Massive ‘Santa Claus Rally’?,"While the Cardano price seems more bullish today, boasting a 3.68% gain, this momentum seemingly lacks the conviction seen earlier this month, bringing bullish projections to a halt. This has translated to heightened volatility on the weekly. In a step back from the significant ground covered in the early week, the top-ranking altcoin now trades within a tight range, though it still retains an 8.83% gain. This stagnancy is all the more apparent looking at the altcoin’s trading volume, which has hit a ceiling at $1.6 billion, increasing just 0.67% today. Cardano Price Analysis: Could a “Santa Rally” Be in Play? The stagnancy in Cardano’s price action could be attributed to a bullish pennant pattern that has been forming since early November. ADA / USDT 1D chart, bullish pennant pattern. Source: Binance. While the Cardano price has been constrained by its upper resistance, it now nears its confluence point, suggesting an imminent breakout. If this pattern materializes, it would set Cardano on a breakout path targeting $2 running into 2025, representing an 80% advance on current prices. However, barriers still remain. Although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) maintains a neutral but bullish position at 57, the MACD line remains below the signal line, indicating that control still lies in the hands of the bears. To achieve this breakout, Cardano will need a significant increase in trading volume and broader market support to overcome these technical challenges. A potential “Santa Rally,” a phenomenon where asset prices tend to rise ahead of Christmas Day, could bring the momentum Cardano needs.

The social media platform further confirmed that the new update was part of YouTube’s plan to give creators more control over how third-party companies can use their content. The YouTube team explained that the platform’s default settings will have the update off, indicating that a creator does not wish for third-party companies to use their content. The platform added that the decision to turn the update on would allow YouTube to share eligible creator videos with chosen third-party companies. Eligible creators include those using YouTube Studio and the YouTube Studio Content Manager. Another statement from YouTube highlighted that creators could choose from a list of companies with whom they could share their content. Some of the companies reportedly on the list include Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Apple, AI21 Labs, OpenAI, Cohere, IBM, ByteDance, and more. YouTude added that if a creator selects ‘All third-party companies,’ any company, including unlisted companies, might leverage their content. The platform reportedly chose the 18 companies listed in the AI training update due to their progression in building generative AI models. They also reportedly chose the companies with the highest potential to collaborate with creators.

A reported interview this year with the CEO of Viggle Hang Chu revealed that the company had been using publicly available videos to train its AI model. Another interview with the OpenAI CTO Mira Murati in the Wall Street Journal revealed that the AI company used publicly available content to train the Sora AI model. Google and YouTube have also been subject to similar accusations. Several users highlighted that the companies used their content without consent or compensation. The video-sharing platform assured users in September that it would address the issue. The platform announced the launch of AI detection tools to protect all creators. Content ID is an identification program that will allow partners to detect and manage AI content on the platform that uses their voices. The second tool will allow different parties to identify content on YouTube that uses their faces. The video streaming platform also promised to uphold its privacy terms, prohibiting the unauthorized access and use of creator content on the platform. The video-sharing service further assured users that it would continue investing in services that detect and prevent illegal access to creators’ content. YouTube opens creator access to the AI era The YouTube team revealed in the recent update that the steps it is taking are a way to open up creators to the AI era. The video-sharing platform insisted that the update was a way of helping creators understand the value of their content in AI development. YouTube also assured that it would use its users’ feedback to expand features that enable more collaborations between creators and AI companies. YouTube and Google have notably informed users of their use of creator content to improve products, services, and experiences on the platforms, including AI applications.

A recent study shared by CoinGecko, an independent crypto data aggregator, highlights Bitcoin's remarkable performance while examining its evolving correlation with the S&P 500, gold, and other major assets.Despite its fluctuations, Bitcoin emerged as a top-performing asset, demonstrating significant growth, particularly during specific economic cycles.Bitcoin Outpaces Other AssetsOver the last 10 years, Bitcoin has posted an extraordinary return of 26,931%, far outpacing traditional investment assets. A $100 investment in 2014 would now be worth over $26,900, emphasizing Bitcoin's transformative growth.In comparison, the S&P 500, a key equity benchmark, achieved a 193.3% return over the same period. Gold, widely regarded as a stable store of value, posted a 125.8% gain. Treasuries also maintained relevance, with 5-year bonds delivering 157.1% returns and 10-year Treasuries returning 86.8%. In contrast, crude oil lagged significantly, offering a modest 4.3% return over the decade.The year-to-date (YTD) data for 2024 reinforces Bitcoin's dominance . It delivered 129.0% returns, followed by gold at 32.2%. The S&P 500 also showed strength, with 28.3% growth. Bonds and crude oil offered comparatively weaker performance. While 5-year Treasuries provided 5.3%, and 10-year bonds delivered 8.2%, crude oil declined slightly by -0.13%. Comparison of investments assets Comparison of various investment instruments like Bitcoin | CoinGecko Shifting Correlations with S&P 500 and GoldBitcoin's relationship with the S&P 500 has evolved significantly over the years. Before 2018, its correlation with equity markets hovered near zero. However, this changed around 2020, particularly during global economic events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Bitcoin's price began aligning more closely with stock market performance during these periods.In contrast, Bitcoin's correlation with gold has remained inconsistent. While both assets are considered alternatives to traditional investments, their relationship often moves inversely. When Bitcoin's price rises, its correlation with gold tends to decline and vice versa. This pattern suggests that investors may shift toward gold when Bitcoin underperforms. Occasionally, brief periods of correlation emerge during macroeconomic uncertainties, signaling shared responses to market conditions.Volatility and Cyclical TrendsBitcoin's extraordinary gains have come with significant volatility, marked by sharp price swings over the last decade. Historical data indicates two major bull cycles in 2017-2018 and 2020-2021, driven by Bitcoin's halving events that occur every four years. During these periods, Bitcoin prices surged to record highs before experiencing steep declines exceeding 70% of their peaks.Bitcoin's price range highlights this volatility. It has traded as low as $172.15 and peaked at $107,780.

37762239,https://crypto.news/?p=14320158,1734449995,Gaming tokenomics 2025: How cryptocurrencies are creating new rules in GameDev,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Blockchain and tokenomics are changing gaming, merging crypto economics with GameDev for decentralized ecosystems. Table of Contents Play-to-earn models: Changing the way players are rewarded Use of blockchain in game development The role of non-fungible tokens Economic opportunities for developers Challenges facing gaming tokenomics The future of gaming tokenomics Conclusion The gaming industry has been characterized by fast evolution for its entire life cycle. Still, it seems like there’s yet another transformation that is ushering with the advent of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Once we cross over to 2025, incorporating tokenomics into game development (GameDev) will change how we engage with them, own them, and make money off of them. The combination of gaming and tokenomics works on the basis of the economics of cryptocurrency and principles of game development. This has developed decentralized ecosystems that are fundamentally altering the way games are created and played. You might also like: Tether backs StablR to expand MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin offerings Play-to-earn models: Changing the way players are rewarded Tokenomics is being changed by the P2E, or play-to-earn, gaming model. This paradigm allows players to receive a monetary payout for completing quests, winning battles, or staking tokens. The way ‘Axie Infinity’ and ‘The Sandbox’ have been adopted within use makes it clear that P2E will eliminate the boundaries of gaming and working. P2E games allow for flourishing local online marketplaces where users are players and investors. This cryptocurrency reward enables gamers to make money from their pastime. This has significantly improved the situation in countries that don’t have enough opportunities to earn money since it gave the players a new way to outperform them. Another opportunity to compete for real money is by applying to get free spins from an online casino , which users can explore further on platforms like Slotozilla. These spins let players try their luck without spending money, making it easier to win rewards. Together, P2E games and online casinos offer new ways for people to earn in the digital world. Use of blockchain in game development There is a remarkable correlation between ‘gaming tokenomics’ and ‘blockchain.’ Blockchain provides much-needed transparency and security while making decentralization a reality. In-game currencies and assets will now become permanent features of a game rather than being created or edited through a centralized gaming server because they are stored on a blockchain. This has not only increased the trust levels amongst players and developers but also has opened doors for new growth opportunities across economic models. No longer would all the hard-worked in-game assets be vulnerable to being erased, as users would have the answer to where people store in-game assets as they would be utilizing blockchain. Moreover, developers can now build games where virtual economies operate autonomously, reducing their need to micromanage transactions or maintain centralized control over assets. The role of non-fungible tokens Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) drive the player-centric approach to gaming tokenomics and allow a player to possess true ownership of in-game elements. They also allow game developers to forge one-of-a-kind, tradable assets in the form of skins, weapons, or possibly a new character. Unlike other digital assets, however, NFTs are secured on the blockchain, making them non-transferable. For gamers, NFTs are social features and economic tools. These virtual items can be resold on other trading platforms, frequently at great prices. Gods Unchained, and Decentraland’s examples display how NFTs can convert game economies into participatory markets, which allow players to spend and generate wealth. Economic opportunities for developers Game developers find new revenue generation models in gaming tokenomics beyond game sales and microtransactions. They can access funds through initial token offerings (Itos), whereby they sell attached tokens. With these tokens, players can access exclusive content or features or share in the profits. Additionally, NFT sales have turned out to be an excellent opportunity for developers. By selling unique and limited assets, studios can earn much more and engage the players more in the process. Such financial opportunities not only promote welfare but also make independent game development more realistic than ever before. Challenges facing gaming tokenomics Tokenomics holds much promise in the form of gaming but isn’t without its challenges. For instance, some blockchain games require high payments as an entry fee, which easily prohibits casual players, hence not being favorable for acclimatization. Additionally, certain blockchain networks’ energy consumption can also cause issues and promote the need for greener alternatives. Problems begin to appear for the regulations themselves as the universe of NFTs isn’t protected by a legal framework. Countries all over the world are still figuring out how digital currencies and NFTs can be treated, thereby presenting some legal risks for both developers and players. Lastly, the chance of the games shifting towards excessive economic aspects and becoming simply a money-making mechanism instead of a source of entertainment, which would not be acceptable for most gaming addicts, isn’t negligible either. The future of gaming tokenomics In the coming years, several factors will affect the future of gaming tokenomics. Cross-platform metaverses are becoming true, in which players can move their assets and experiences from one game to another across different platforms. Such a view promises the emergence of vast new digital nations where currencies will be merged. Also, AI is poised to make a huge contribution to the future of gaming in the blockchain world. Smart AI tools can improve the gaming experience by making it adaptive and more relevant to users. Moreover, the fusion of physical entities into virtual universes further diminishes the line between the two spaces. Blockchain games are expected to see an upsurge in the next growth in mobile gaming as the low barrier of entry. Simple interfaces appeal to more users. The prospect of gaming tokenomics in the future seems bright as there are rising trends that can be incorporated while existing issues are being solved. Conclusion Thanks to gaming tokenomics, new rules are being written, and new opportunities are emerging for players and developers. The combination of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs has shifted the reach of games, facilitating a different sense of ownership, activity, and monetization. While there are still obstacles to overcome, it is unquestionable that the developments brought about by gaming tokenomics are going to change not only the development of games but also the in-game experience. At the beginning of the year 2025, The gaming industry is poised to lead a paradigm shift across the entertainment space and beyond. The combination of blockchain and GameDev is not a dream anymore– it is the present of the next phase of gaming.

At press time, BTC is trading near $107,850 and has experienced a price surge of over 2.25% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by a modest 8%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid the ongoing bull run. $117 Million in BTC Inflow Despite notable participation and whale acquisitions, data shows that some long-term holders continue to dump their holdings onto exchanges, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from Bitcoin spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant $117.66 million worth of BTC inflow. Source: Coinglass This inflow refers to the transfer of assets from the long-term holder’s wallet to the exchanges, which suggests potential selling pressure and a possible price decline in the coming days. However, the recent accumulation is significantly higher than the inflow, which suggests that this won’t impact the BTC price. Why is the BTC Price Increasing? Besides the recent accumulation by whales, demand from institutions has skyrocketed as of December 16, 2024. Major firms like MicroStrategy and Semler Scientific acquired 15,350 BTC and 211 BTC, respectively, as reported by CoinPedia. The acquisitions by these whales and institutions could be a potential reason behind the ongoing bull run.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/are-you-buying-bitcoin-whales-add-7-3-billion-in-btc/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Analysts are highlighting a 10x rally for the Dogecoin price, fueled by its loyal community and speculative trading appeal. Ripple (XRP) continues to see steady growth, with institutional adoption driving the XRP price upward. However, the standout performer among them is ETFSwap (ETFS), which is predicted to surge by an extraordinary 33,000% by 2025. ETFSwap (ETFS), listed on Uniswap , is now attracting savvy investors who missed its presale. Its unique tools and market positioning make it an ideal choice for investors seeking sustainable growth in 2025. ETFSwap (ETFS) is leading the way in utility and future potential over the Dogecoin price, as well as Ripple (XRP). ETFSwap (ETFS): A Mid-Cap Leader for Sustainable Growth ETFSwap (ETFS) sets itself apart by providing tools that cater to both novice and seasoned investors. One of its key features is a real-time ETF price tracker, which delivers accurate and immediate market data. This level of functionality makes ETFSwap (ETFS) a standout choice for those seeking long-term growth. With a projected 33,000% surge by 2025, the real-time tracker gives investors a critical edge in managing their portfolios, surpassing the speculative nature of the Dogecoin price and the institutional focus of Ripple (XRP). ETFSwap (ETFS) expands its appeal by offering access to crypto ETFs and traditional commodities such as oil, silver, and gold. This feature bridges the gap between decentralized trading and conventional markets, allowing investors to create balanced portfolios. The diversification potential of ETFSwap (ETFS) provides stability while maintaining exposure to high-growth opportunities. Unlike the Dogecoin price and XRP price, which are tied to specific market narratives, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers a more comprehensive investment strategy that caters to a wide range of financial goals. ETFSwap (ETFS) is also introducing an AI-powered ETF screener to assist investors in identifying profitable opportunities. The addition of this feature reinforces the platform’s position as a leader among mid-cap tokens. For those aiming to benefit from the predicted 33,000% surge by 2025, the AI-powered screener simplifies complex decisions, making ETFSwap (ETFS) an indispensable part of any portfolio. Why ETFSwap (ETFS) Stands Above Dogecoin Price And Ripple (XRP) The Dogecoin price has long been a reflection of community sentiment and high-profile endorsements. With expectations of a 10x rally, the token continues to attract traders looking for short-term gains. The Dogecoin price has built its reputation on market hype and speculative activity, making it a favorite during bullish phases. However, this reliance on sentiment leaves the Dogecoin price vulnerable to rapid fluctuations. While it may provide opportunities for quick profits, it lacks the structural advantages offered by tokens like ETFSwap (ETFS), which focuses on delivering long-term value through innovative platforms and practical tools. Ripple (XRP) has established itself as a leading solution in the cross-border payments space, with its XRP price benefiting from partnerships with major financial institutions. This focus on efficiency and scalability has made Ripple (XRP) a reliable option for those seeking steady growth in 2025. Despite its advantages, the XRP price faces challenges from regulatory scrutiny and competition within the payments sector. For investors looking for diversification and exponential returns, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers a broader range of opportunities through its integration of traditional financial assets and decentralized trading mechanisms. The Dogecoin price and XRP price highlight distinct advantages, with Dogecoin offering speculative gains and Ripple (XRP) benefiting from institutional partnerships. However, ETFSwap (ETFS) delivers a more well-rounded investment experience. Its combination of real-time data, portfolio diversification, and advanced tools makes it a token designed for sustained success beyond 2025. The affordability of the ETFSwap (ETFS) price on Uniswap adds to its appeal, providing a low entry point before the token gains further traction. As the market grows, ETFSwap (ETFS) is positioned to outpace competitors, making now the ideal time to join ETFSwap (ETFS) for exponential returns. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is presenting a range of opportunities, with the Dogecoin price targeting a 10x rally and Ripple (XRP) seeing steady growth through institutional adoption. However, ETFSwap (ETFS) leads the pack with unique features and a projected 33,000% surge by 2025, setting it apart from other mid-cap tokens. Acting now offers the chance to join a project that is reshaping the future of cryptocurrency.

Ethereum ( ETH ), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at $4,008. But the momentum failed to continue as it has faced resistance over the past three consecutive weeks. Still, ETH has positive catalysts that could push its price higher in the near term. The first main catalyst is that Bitcoin ( BTC ) has continued rising and moved to a record high this week. Altcoins like Ether often follow the price of Bitcoin. Spot Ethereum ETFs are also seeing strong inflows, a trend that may continue in the coming months. Its cumulative inflows rose to over $2.3 billion, with those by Grayscale and Blackrock having the biggest market share. It has had inflows in the last 17 consecutive days. You might also like: XRP price rises ahead of RLUSD launch, but a reversal is possible On-chain metrics show that the number of active Ethereum addresses has held steady just under 600,000. Total addresses have risen to over 123 million, according to IntoTheBlock . More data, as shown below, shows that Ethereum whales are continuing to hold their coins. There are 90 accounts holding between 100k and 1 million ETH tokens and 966 of them holding between 10k and 100k coins. Meanwhile, data shows that Ether is seeing accumulation below the $4,000 metric. 7.2 million coins were bought slightly below that level. As $ETH pushes back above $4000, a strong support level is solidifying just below this threshold. 7.2 million ETH were purchased at prices slightly under $4,000, signaling significant demand. This demand should help sustain Ethereum's value above the $4,000 level. pic.twitter.com/yAunfqcbY5 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 17, 2024 Etherscan data shows that one Ethereum whale moved 16,000 ETH tokens worth $64 million from Binance to a custodial wallet. More such transactions have happened in the past few weeks. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s Decentralized Exchange ecosystem is doing well as its total value locked jumped by 36% to $79 billion. Its DeFi protocols have more asses than the next ten chains, combined. Ethereum price could surge soon ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that the ETH price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few weeks. It has found a strong barrier at $4,000, where it failed to move above since March. The main risk is that it has formed a triple-top pattern, a popular bearish sign in the market. This pattern has formed slightly above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. Ethereum has remained above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. It is also between the middle line and the first resistance point of the Andrew’s pitchfork tool. Therefore, a break above the triple-top level will point to more gains, possibly to the all-time high of $4,877. A move above that will lead to more gains to $5,000.

37761900,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627011,1734449400,Here’s Why Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Is the Best Bet for Altcoin Investors in 2025,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, 2025 is shaping up to be a game-changing year for altcoin investors. Among the numerous blockchain projects vying for attention, Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is standing out as a leader. With its unique combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized technology, Lightchain AI is more than just another speculative token. The project prioritizes real-world applications, scalability, and sustainability, making it a top choice for investors seeking both innovation and robust returns. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to get in early—check out the Lightchain AI Presale now ! Why Lightchain AI Stands Out in the Altcoin Market 1. Revolutionary Technology Stack At the core of Lightchain AI’s appeal is its cutting-edge technology designed to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in blockchain and AI: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI introduces an entirely new consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for meaningful AI computations, such as data analytics or machine learning tasks. PoI not only secures the network but also drives real-world innovation. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): AIVM allows developers to execute AI-specific tasks directly on the blockchain, enabling advanced applications like fraud detection, predictive modeling, and dynamic NFTs. This technology stack positions Lightchain AI as a leader in the next wave of blockchain innovation, where decentralization meets AI-driven utility. 2. Addressing Key Industry Challenges The blockchain space has long struggled with issues like scalability, high energy consumption, and lack of practical use cases. Lightchain AI addresses these head-on: Scalability: Unlike Ethereum, which still grapples with network congestion and high fees, Lightchain AI employs parallel processing and adaptive resource allocation to ensure seamless scalability. Energy Efficiency: PoI eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining, making Lightchain AI one of the most environmentally friendly blockchain platforms. Real-World Utility: From healthcare to supply chain management, Lightchain AI’s technology has applications in industries that demand transparency, efficiency, and security. 3. Strong Tokenomics and Investor Appeal Lightchain AI’s tokenomics are designed to promote long-term growth and investor confidence: Limited Supply: The fixed supply of $LCAI ensures scarcity, driving potential value appreciation as demand grows. Presale Opportunity: Early investors can benefit from the ongoing presale, offering $LCAI tokens at an attractive entry price before they hit the broader market. Decentralized Governance: Token holders play an active role in shaping the platform’s future, ensuring alignment between the network and its community. Scalable Architecture The platform boasts a highly scalable architecture with advanced sharding and workload distribution, ensuring high throughput. Adaptive resource allocation enhances performance and cost efficiency, while Layer 2 integration reduces costs and increases speeds for large-scale applications. Sustainability Focus With PoI eliminating energy-heavy mining, the platform significantly reduces its carbon footprint. The streamlined design of the AIVM ensures fast and efficient processing, aligning computations with impactful AI use cases. This focus on sustainability supports responsible blockchain growth. Broad Real-World Applications The platform has diverse applications across industries. In healthcare, it supports AI-driven diagnostics and personalized treatments. In finance, it aids in fraud detection and predictive analytics. Supply chain processes benefit from transparent logistics and resource optimization, while education is enhanced through adaptive, AI-powered learning systems. Decentralized Governance The platform emphasizes decentralized governance through token-weighted voting, giving the community a voice in decision-making. Quadratic voting prevents large stakeholders from dominating governance, ensuring fairness. Open-source development further encourages collaborative innovation and growth. 2025 Predictions: Lightchain AI vs. the Competition To truly understand why Lightchain AI is the best bet for altcoin investors, it’s essential to compare it to other prominent players in the space. Ethereum (ETH): The Legacy Player Ethereum revolutionized blockchain with smart contracts but faces persistent challenges in scalability and high gas fees. While Ethereum 2.0 promises improvements, Lightchain AI’s PoI and AIVM offer immediate and innovative solutions for developers seeking advanced capabilities. Solana (SOL): The Speed Contender Solana is renowned for its high transaction speeds, but concerns about centralization and network reliability persist. Lightchain AI matches Solana’s performance while introducing AI integration—an area where Solana lags significantly. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB): Community-Driven Memecoins While these tokens have garnered attention for their strong communities, they lack the technical advancements and practical applications that make Lightchain AI a standout choice. As blockchain continues to evolve and mature, Lightchain AI’s technology stack and real-world utility will play a crucial role in driving its success. Lightchain AI’s Real-World Applications One of Lightchain AI’s most compelling features is its ability to solve real-world problems across a variety of industries: 1. Healthcare AI-Powered Diagnostics: Lightchain AI enables advanced medical imaging and predictive analytics, enhancing patient care and reducing diagnostic errors. Secure Data Management: The platform ensures transparency and privacy in handling sensitive patient data. 2. Finance Fraud Prevention: AIVM supports the development of fraud detection tools that analyze transaction patterns in real-time. DeFi Advancements: Adaptive protocols and predictive analytics enhance decentralized finance applications, making them more efficient and secure. 3. Supply Chain Management Transparency and Traceability: Lightchain AI enhances accountability by providing a tamper-proof record of supply chain activities. Predictive Analytics: Businesses can optimize operations by leveraging AI-driven insights. Investor Perspective: Why $LCAI Is Poised for Success 1. Early Adoption Potential The ongoing presale provides investors with a rare opportunity to acquire $LCAI tokens at a discounted rate. As the platform gains traction, early adopters are likely to see significant returns on their investments. 2. Alignment with Industry Trends The convergence of blockchain and AI represents one of the most exciting frontiers in technology. Lightchain AI’s focus on real-world utility positions it at the forefront of this trend. 3. Community and Governance Lightchain AI’s decentralized governance model fosters trust and inclusivity. By giving token holders a direct voice in the platform’s development, the network ensures that its goals remain aligned with the community’s needs. Challenges and How Lightchain AI Overcomes Them While Lightchain AI has a promising future, it must navigate several challenges: Market Competition: Competing with established blockchains like Ethereum and Solana requires continuous innovation and strategic partnerships. Adoption Barriers: Educating developers and businesses about the platform’s unique capabilities is essential for driving adoption. Regulatory Landscape: As governments tighten regulations around blockchain and AI, compliance will be critical to sustaining growth. Lightchain AI’s robust technology stack, commitment to sustainability, and focus on real-world applications position it well to overcome these hurdles and thrive in a competitive market. 2025 Predictions: Will Lightchain AI Be the Best Altcoin of the Year? As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach and real-world impact make it a strong contender for the title of best altcoin in 2025. Here’s why: Technological Leadership: With PoI and AIVM, Lightchain AI addresses the limitations of traditional blockchain platforms, offering unmatched capabilities for developers and businesses. Sustainability: Its energy-efficient consensus mechanism aligns with growing concerns about the environmental impact of blockchain technology. Real-World Impact: Lightchain AI’s applications in healthcare, finance, and supply chain management demonstrate its potential to create lasting value beyond the crypto market. Community Support: The platform’s decentralized governance model, combined with its commitment to open-source development, fosters a strong and engaged community that will drive future growth. While it’s impossible to predict the exact trajectory of any cryptocurrency, Lightchain AI’s unique features and potential for real-world disruption make it an appealing choice for investors seeking long-term growth opportunities. As blockchain and AI continue to converge and shape the future of technology, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to lead the way.

37761892,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27765,1734449336,"India Signals No Fixed Timeline for Crypto Rules, Calls for Global Alliance","India Gives Signal of No Fixed Timeline for Crypto Rules, Calls for Global Alliance The Indian government last week clarified before the Lok Sabha that it has no fixed timeline for the rollout of comprehensive VDA regulations. Responding to questions by Members of Parliament, the Government of India reiterated that by design, VDAs are borderless, hence their effective regulation and monitoring require cooperation at the international level to avoid regulatory arbitrage. The Push for Global Coordination India’s view epitomizes the challenges related to the regulation of crypto assets in a silo. As the G20 President, India emphasized the necessity of the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets to ensure that risk-sensitive regulatory frameworks have been instituted across jurisdictions. The government said consultation with industry stakeholders and international organizations has been ongoing, informally and formally. Cohesive, cross-border regulation remains necessary to bring about effective solutions to VDA complexities. Existing Measures and Sector Challenges While a structured regulatory framework is pending, Them has already taken steps to address immediate concerns. Income derived from VDA is taxed, and since March 2023, crypto transactions fall under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. These measures aim to enhance oversight and transparency in the sector. Despite these efforts, the challenges persist. The fast adoption of digital assets in India has resulted in growing risks as well. High-profile scams such as Andhra Pradesh fraud reveal how vulnerable the market is. In this regard, it was a case where investors were lured into promises of exaggerated returns, with wrong affiliations of reputed exchanges, which indicated the pressing need for far stronger mechanisms for investor protection. Balancing Innovation and Financial Stability The Indian government has to tread a tightrope between promoting innovation and economic growth on one hand, and financial stability and investor protection on the other. Without international cooperation, no national policy can effectively oversee and regulate borderless digital assets. This explains why them continued to push for international cooperation towards developing harmonized regulatory standards. Future Outlook While the absence of a clear-cut regulatory timeline keeps stakeholders in a state of uncertainty, India is committed to developing policies rooted in national interest while keeping in mind global consensus. The emphasis on collaborative approaches underlines India’s evolving role in shaping international VDA regulation. As the crypto industry grows, India’s leadership on global platforms like the G20 will be instrumental in creating a harmonized framework.

As the market surges, the choice of the right wallet becomes vital for not only maximizing returns but also protecting investments. Tomo Wallet offers a broad appeal with its multi-chain capabilities and its staking collaboration with Babylon, providing a user-friendly platform for crypto enthusiasts. In contrast, Plus Wallet caters specifically to Bitcoin users seeking focused security, streamlined transaction management, and specialized features like Lightning Network support, showcasing clear benefits for those invested in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Soars 41% in a Single Month Over the past month, Bitcoin has soared 41%, with prices fluctuating between $92,202 and $100,356 and now pushing towards the $103,686 resistance level. A breakthrough here could set its sights on $111,841, offering a potential 10% increase. Despite recent market turbulence and over $1 billion in liquidations, Bitcoin maintains a robust upward momentum. The technical indicators offer mixed signals; the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 64.40 and the Stochastic %K at 64.09, both suggesting a neutral market stance, while momentum points to a buy at 6,294.16. The MACD signals caution with a sell at 4,028.76. Yet, the moving averages, with a 10-day EMA at $96,708 and a 200-day EMA significantly lower at $69,874, bolster the bullish trend. Moreover, external influences such as profit-taking, whale transactions, and market rumors shape Bitcoin’s course. Nonetheless, substantial whale purchases underscore strong confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamentals, keeping market optimism high as it approaches significant levels like $103,000.

This collaboration aims to further refine the staking experience, offering a smooth and profitable way to expand Bitcoin holdings. This integration of Tomo Wallet’s intuitive interface with Babylon’s solid staking framework marks a significant leap forward in the crypto arena, providing both newcomers and seasoned traders an enticing opportunity to engage in Bitcoin staking.

At the same time, she firmly opposes the proposed ""digital euro,"" a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ).No to Digital Euro, Yes to Strategic Bitcoin ReserveIn a passionate speech delivered to the European Parliament, Knafo rejected the idea of the ECB’s digital euro, labeling it a tool for totalitarian control. Instead, she championed Bitcoin as a decentralized, freedom-affirming alternative. "" No to the digital euro, yes to a strategic Bitcoin reserve,"" Knafo wrote on X (formerly Twitter), accompanied by a video of her address. Sarah calling for Bitcoin reserve Sarah Knafo calling for Bitcoin reserve Learning from El Salvador's Bitcoin AdoptionIn her speech, Knafo highlighted the success of El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele made the controversial decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021.At the time, critics, including the political class and the IMF, ridiculed the move. However, El Salvador's bet on Bitcoin has paid off, showing over 100% return and providing hundreds of millions of dollars in security and sovereignty for the country.Furthermore, Knafo pointed to growing global interest in Bitcoin, noting that influential figures such as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are positioning themselves to take advantage of the cryptocurrency revolution. Powell has referred to Bitcoin as ""digital gold,"" and the U.S. is exploring the possibility of a strategic Bitcoin reserve.Europe Falling Behind on Crypto InnovationMeanwhile, Knafo criticized the European Union for lagging behind in cryptocurrency adoption. She lamented that the EU continues to waste public funds, struggle with inflation, and stifle innovation through excessive regulation and taxation.In her speech, Knafo called for a paradigm shift in Europe, urging EU states to protect their citizens from inflation and the consequences of poor economic policies. She particularly warned against the ECB's push for a fully controlled digital euro, fearing it could lead to a dystopian future where citizens are excluded from the financial system for expressing dissent or engaging in unpopular activities.Call to Develop Crypto Mining Industries In EuropeFurthermore, Knafo emphasized the need for European nations to follow El Salvador's lead in building strategic Bitcoin reserves and developing local crypto mining industries.She pointed out that France, in particular, has the advantage of abundant nuclear energy, which could power a thriving cryptocurrency mining sector. Knafo further urged policymakers to reduce the tax burden on cryptocurrency holders.In conclusion, Knafo called for a return to the values of freedom and innovation, advocating for a future where Europe embraces cryptocurrencies as a means of economic independence and protection from inflation. ""Let’s dare to be free,"" she concluded, ""and stay true to the ambition of our civilization."" Notably, the discussion around a strategic Bitcoin reserve has gained momentum since President-elect Donald Trump teased the idea at the latest Bitcoin Conference. Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill to this end, and lawmakers in states like Texas and Pennsylvania have presented the idea. Russian lawmakers are also considering the possibility.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/17/eu-lawmaker-proposes-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-citing-el-salvadors-success/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=eu-lawmaker-proposes-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-citing-el-salvadors-success,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37761718,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374928,1734449147,This Cohort of Ethereum Whales Accumulates Record 57.35% of Supply,"Amidst Ethereum’s rally this week, there has been a notable shift in its supply distribution. Large ETH wallets are accumulating aggressively, reaching an all-time high in supply ownership. Mid-tier and small wallet holdings hit record lows. On the upside, institutional inflows and historical trends suggest Ethereum has room for further growth despite market volatility. Ethereum Whales Strengthen Holdings According to Santiment’s latest analysis , whale wallets holding at least 100K ETH now own an all-time high of 57.35% of the total supply, which is worth approximately $333.1 billion. These 104 large wallets reflect growing confidence among Ethereum’s largest stakeholders as they continue accumulating despite market volatility. On the other hand, mid-tier wallets holding between 100 and 100K ETH have dropped to their lowest-ever supply ratio at 33.46%, while addresses with fewer than 100 ETH sit at a near four-year low of 9.19%. While the broader Ethereum ecosystem includes a rising number of DeFi and staking wallets, this trend generally signals a bullish long-term outlook, the on-chain analytic platform said in its latest analysis. For a mature, nine-year-old asset like Ethereum, such sustained accumulation by key stakeholders suggests growing conviction and reduced sell pressure from whales, which often aligns with positive market sentiment over time. The whale activity comes as the cryptocurrency broke yet another record that pushed its YTD gains to almost 80%. It hit $4,106 on Monday before dipping slightly to $4,020 at the time of writing. Despite this, the leading altcoin remains 22% below its all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021, but experts suggest that it might still have room for significant growth. Room for Growth According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s update , Ethereum’s price movements historically correlate with shifts in long-term holder sentiment. In the past two bull cycles, ETH saw parabolic price surges when long-term holders entered the “greed” phase. Currently, these holders are in the early stages of the “belief” phase, essentially which indicates they are just starting to feel optimistic about the asset’s price potential. However, this still appears to be far from the euphoric peaks that typically mark the beginning of explosive rallies. If history repeats itself, this suggests that Ethereum’s major upward move could still be on the horizon as long-term investor sentiment strengthens. Adding to the positive momentum, Ethereum-based investment products have recorded seven consecutive weeks of inflows. CoinShares’ data revealed that these products attracted a total of $3.7 billion during this period. Notably, $1 billion flowed in just last week, highlighting steady institutional interest and confidence.

Since its launch in 2020, SHIB has built a massive following with its meme-inspired branding, community-driven approach, and ambitious ecosystem developments, including decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and its upcoming Layer 2 solution, Shibarium. Alongside SHIB’s rise, exciting new projects like Lightchain AI Tokens (LCAI) are making waves, with the Lightchain AI Presale offering a unique opportunity for early investors to get involved in the next phase of blockchain innovation. In this article, we’ll dive into the latest updates in the Shiba Inu Coin ecosystem, covering everything from market performance and new exchange listings to community initiatives and technological advancements. We’ll also explore how emerging projects like Lightchain AI are contributing to the rapidly growing blockchain space, delivering fresh unique features that complement established players like SHIB. Let’s explore how these developments are shaping the future of cryptocurrency. https://t.co/Rqsk7V3nfv — Lightchain AI (@LightchainAI) December 16, 2024 Recent developments in the Shiba Inu ecosystem The Shiba Inu ecosystem has been hitting some exciting milestones lately, especially with the launch of Shibarium, its Layer-2 scaling solution. Introduced in August 2023, Shibarium is designed to make transactions faster and more affordable within the Shiba Inu network. By December 2024, it had already processed over 600 million transactions, achieved a total value locked (TVL) of $6 million, and reached around 2 million wallet addresses—clear signs of growing adoption and utility. On top of that, the Shiba Inu community has been working hard on token burn mechanisms to reduce the circulating supply of SHIB tokens. This effort aims to increase scarcity, which could help boost their value. Shibarium also plays a role here, with a built-in burning mechanism that supports these community-led initiatives. These developments highlight the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s focus on improving scalability, cutting transaction costs, and creating more scarcity for SHIB tokens. Together, they’re helping to enhance its utility and value in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency.

This collective has been instrumental in various initiatives, including the development of Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain that enhances transaction speed and scalability. Additionally, the community has actively participated in token burn events, such as the recent 250 million SHIB token burn, aimed at reducing supply and potentially increasing value. The SHIB Army’s engagement extends to governance, with members voting on crucial proposals to shape the project’s future. Their collective efforts have transformed Shiba Inu from a meme coin into a dynamic ecosystem, fostering innovation and adoption in the cryptocurrency space. Lightchain AI presale future opportunity for investors Lightchain AI’s presale presents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking to engage with the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. The platform has already raised over $2.2 million in its ongoing presale, reflecting strong investor interest.

Its unique Proof-of-Intelligence consensus mechanism and AI Virtual Machine facilitate efficient AI computations and the deployment of AI-powered decentralized applications. Currently in its sixth presale stage, LCAI tokens are priced at $0.003, with an anticipated increase to $0.003375 in the next phase. Investors can participate by connecting a decentralized wallet, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, to the Lightchain AI presale platform and purchasing tokens using ETH or USDT . As the AI industry continues to expand, Lightchain AI’s approach positions it as a promising investment in the evolving landscape of decentralized intelligence. How Lighchain AI going to 1000x or more? Lightchain AI’s growth potential lies in its unique use of artificial intelligence and blockchain. Its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) mechanism rewards nodes for AI computations, boosting network security and efficiency. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables seamless AI task execution on the blockchain, making it useful across various industries. Analysts suggest early investment in projects like Lightchain AI could yield significant returns, with some projecting up to 1000x growth. As the AI and blockchain sectors expand, Lightchain AI’s position strengthens its potential for exponential growth. However, such projections are speculative and depend on factors like market adoption, technological progress, and competition. Investors should carefully research and weigh the risks of emerging technologies before making decisions. Challenges and opportunities for Shiba Inu in a competitive market The Shiba Inu ecosystem’s success and growth face challenges in a highly competitive crypto market. With over 12,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation, standing out and maintaining relevance is no easy feat. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty and volatility can significantly impact adoption and value. Yet, these challenges also present opportunities for improvement and creativity. Projects like Shibarium and Lightchain AI are continually pushing boundaries to create more efficient, accessible, and secure blockchain solutions.

QCP Capital: Options Market Points to Caution However, the options market has issued a warning, suggesting that investors may currently prefer to hedge rather than actively chase upward momentum. The firm noted that supportive regulatory environments could create a cross-asset feedback loop. Companies that own Bitcoin (BTC) could find it easier to raise capital, which could then stimulate institutional demand for BTC in a non-linear manner. This cautious mood in the options market suggests that while optimism about Bitcoin’s price remains strong, some investors are bracing for potential volatility or pullbacks.

BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Leading the Charge BTFD Coin is rewriting the rules of presale success. In just three weeks, it has raised over $4 million, sold more than 55 billion tokens, and attracted 5,600+ holders. Starting at an almost unbelievable $0.000004 per token, the price has now reached $0.00013 in Stage 12. By the time the presale concludes, BTFD Coin is expected to list at $0.0006—a staggering increase for early investors. What’s making BTFD Coin a market darling isn’t just its presale numbers. This token brings utility to the meme coin market in a way that’s rare to see. Its P2E game offers users a fun way to earn rewards, while its staking system appeals to long-term holders seeking passive income. The referral programme is the icing on the cake, encouraging community growth by rewarding users who spread the word. For potential investors, here’s the kicker: imagine putting $85,000 into BTFD Coin at the current price of $0.00013. That nets you about 653,846,154 tokens. When the presale ends and the token hits $0.0006, your investment balloons to an impressive $392,307. That’s a jaw-dropping 361% return before the coin even hits mainstream exchanges. With four presale stages still to go, BTFD Coin isn’t slowing down. It’s already one of the best new meme coins to buy now, and its bullish momentum shows no signs of letting up.

It’s navigating the current market with creativity and grit, making it a standout choice for investors who appreciate both humour and strategy.

Built on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, NOT is all about making crypto easy to use and even easier to earn.

37761479,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/zoth-singularity-finance-bring-institutional-grade-tokenized-treasury-bonds-to-defi-investors,1734448543,Zoth & Singularity Finance Bring Institutional-Grade Tokenized Treasury Bonds To DeFi Investors,"Investors hoping to achieve more stable and consistent yields in the DeFi market may have finally found what they’re looking for in the shape of Zoth’s newest tokenized asset. Zoth said today it’s partnering with Singularity Finance to launch a new DeFi product for institutional investors called Zoth Tokenized Liquid Notes Prime, or ZTLN-P. It’s a tokenized asset that’s primarily backed by U.S. Treasury ETFs and Money Market Funds, bringing them on-chain, with the promise of easy access and more consistent returns. Zoth provides the sophisticated treasury management know-how that’s required to optimize DeFi yields. It’s utilizing Singularity’s SFI tokenization framework to ensure ZTLN-P is built on a fully compliant infrastructure that’s backed by a robust legal structure and sufficient liquidity, enabling investors to redeem their tokens at any time. With Zoth’s deep expertise in tokenizing traditional financial instruments, the collaboration promises institutions and asset managers an easy-to-access investment that will generate stable returns, similar to traditional treasury investments. Zoth explains that ZTLN-P puts a priority on liquidity, safety and transparency, and in this way it claims to be setting a new standard for institutional DeFi investments. ZTLN-P is a blockchain-based digital asset that’s designed to generate optimized yield at low risk, without encumbering investors with lock-in periods, instead giving them the flexibility to enter and exit a position at any moment. It’s backed by a combination of Blackrock-managed ETFs and MMMs that largely hold U.S. Treasury bills, and it’s designed to deliver the kinds of predictable, low-risk yields that asset managers yearn for during periods of economic uncertainty. It chose Singularity’s SFI framework because it adheres to the Cayman Island’s Monetary Authority (CIMA) and the Mutual Funds Act (2021 Revision), making ZTLN-P a regulatory compliant asset that’s both secure and accessible. This, combined with what Zoth says is ""unparalleled liquidity”, should make ZTLN-P an enticing option for investors seeking more stable asset classes in a traditionally highly-volatile DeFi industry. The announcement underscores the growing desire for tokenized MMFs, which have grown to more than $2.3 billion in value over the last year, driven partly by the flexibility of blockchain technology and the prospects of stable returns. Zoth’s ZTLN-P will compete with products like BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund or BUIDL, which is also backed by Treasury notes and provides on-chain yield, dividend accrual and distribution, and flexible custody options 24/7. Other tokenized funds include Franklin Templeton’s $420 million Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) on the Avalanche blockchain. Zoth says its focus on low-risk and high liquidity can help to position ZTLN-P as the new “gold standard” for tokenized assets, with strong guarantees that investors’ capital is deployed in a highly-vetted investment strategy that’s designed to generate steady gains while preserving their principal. Zoth Chief Executive Pritam Dutta said ZTLN-P represents one of the first institutional-grade short-term investments to leverage the efficiency and transparency of blockchain infrastructure, paving the way for a new era of DeFi. No longer will DeFi be seen as a speculative market, “but a legitimate alternative to traditional finance,” he said. Singularity Finance co-founder Mario Casiraghi said ZTLN-P embodies safety, liquidity and transparency. “This partnership sets a new standard for on-chain financial solutions, ensuring institutional investors can confidently navigate the DeFi space while enjoying consistent, low-risk returns,” he added.

TurboChain was developed in order to kick start the development of a vibrant ecosystem of DeFi, games and NFTs around the TURBO token, grow its utility and expand its already vibrant community. The new network was created using the Aurora Cloud Virtual Chain infrastructure, and it’s said to support rapid, low-cost transaction speeds and provide unmatched scale, laying the foundation for developers to get started building a variety of decentralized applications with TURBO at their heart. It’s cross-chain compatible with dozens of well-known blockchains, including Ethereum and NEAR. Aurora Cloud is an innovative platform that makes it possible for memecoin communities and others to quickly deploy their own blockchains, without any kind of coding skills required. The idea behind Aurora Cloud is that building a blockchain should be as easy as creating a Shopify store, and so the only thing that’s needed is to have an idea. After entering a few basic parameters, Aurora will spin up and deploy a brand new blockchain, either for an existing or brand new cryptocurrency. Every Aurora Virtual Chain boasts the same fast transaction speeds and dramatic scalability of TurboChain, enabling it to handle enormous transaction volumes and host a full-blown ecosystem of decentralized applications. With TurboChain, the TURBO token takes a prominent role as the currency for all transaction fees. By launching its own decentralized network, the TURBO token is setting the stage for a new era of growth, and the community has high hopes that it will expand well beyond its current $698 million market cap. To reinforce those efforts, TURBO is getting its very own simple swap mechanism called TurboSwap , which is accessible now and supports simple, low-cost, instant swaps between TURBO and cryptocurrencies like BTC, NEAR, ETH, USDT, AURORA, PEPE, AAVE, SOL and DOGE. Aurora is perhaps being a tad overly dramatic with its claims that it “redefines the decentralized trading experience”, but the availability of TurboSwap will certainly make the TURBO token more accessible, beyond the 115 or so crypto exchanges that already support it. The launch of TurboChain and TurboSwap highlight the incredible ease in which anyone can use Aurora’s tools to quickly spin up their own blockchain to host an ecosystem around any crypto token. With this showcase, Aurora’s CEO Alex Shevchenko hopes it will inspire many other crypto communities to do the same. He has set an ambitious target of launching more than 1,000 new blockchains in 2025. “TurboChain and TurboSwap show the power of Aurora Virtual Chains,” Shevchenko said. “They can turn ideas into scalable blockchain ecosystems.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37761374,https://finbold.com/?p=220286,1734448339,Crypto trader makes $8.3 million in 20 minutes,"Cryptocurrencies have brought about one of the biggest paradigm shifts in finance in recent memory. While they carry the potential to turn the tide in favor of decentralization and transparency, practical use cases are still in their infancy. On the other hand, digital assets have seen widespread adoption in the form of speculative investments. Once the domain of the particularly internet-savvy, they are now widely available and enjoy strong mainstream appeal. As this nascent industry matures, the rough edges are being smoothed out. While cryptocurrencies are still very volatile, they’ve slowly begun to stabilize — whether through a stronger correlation with the performance of traditional assets, the advent of stablecoins, or institutional involvement. The big payouts from trades that net savvy investors life-altering wealth are a rarer sight nowadays — but they do still occur, although primarily in the domain of meme coins . In one such instance, a wily trader made a $8.36 million profit in the span of just 20 minutes on December 17 — let’s take a closer look at exactly what happened. This PENGU trade was perfectly timed — but risky Roughly two hours before the time of publication, this trader spent a grand total of 23,742 Solana ( SOL ), worth approximately $5.36 million at the time, to execute 8 transactions in which they purchased 239.6 million Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), according to data retrieved by Finbold from Solscan . The trader’s initial purchases of PENGU. Source: Solscan This PENGU stake was then sold for 60,726 SOL worth $13.72 million after a 780.62% 1-day price surge — bringing the total profit of the trade to $8.36 million. Beyond the short duration of the trade, there are a couple of interesting factors to note. For one, someone has stepped forward to claim the trade as their own — pseudonymous X user Nakasintos , although the report has not been verified. I just pulled off an incredible trade, making a staggering $8.3M profit on $PENGU in only 15 minutes. I bought in at $5.3M and, with perfect timing, sold it for $13.7M. Thanks @pudgypenguins @LucaNetz for making this happen 🙏 pic.twitter.com/vPMIWVtXEO — Nakasintos | 我们会成功的 (@nakasintos) December 17, 2024 Secondly, a closer look at on-chain data reveals that the account in question executed as many as 500 trades within a single hour — suggesting that an automated system is at play no matter who is behind it. Ultimately, although impressive, this trade required a staggering amount of risk appetite — while this can serve as an interesting example of the profit potential seen with meme coins, risking millions of dollars on assets with questionable underlying value is an approach most cryptocurrency investors simply aren’t cut out for.

This enterprise-grade stablecoin combines the stability of fiat with the efficiency of blockchain technology. RLUSD will operate on two networks: Ethereum and Ripple’s native XRP Ledger (XRPL). Initially, the price of the stablecoin fluctuated within a 20% range, but it is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a 1:1 ratio, ensuring stability over time. Ripple CTO David Schwartz had previously said that there might be supply shortages at first, causing the price to fluctuate. However, once supply stabilizes, the price will quickly return to around $1. He also said, “Since the idea of $RLUSD many months ago to launch in a matter of hours, I’ve been looking forward to more use cases realized on the XRPL and more liquidity on-chain with a trusted stablecoin like RLUSD. Countless opportunities are here for devs and users who want the benefits of XRPL, RLUSD and XRP.” The stablecoin will be available on exchanges like Uphold, Bitso, and CoinMana, with more expected by the end of the year. Ripple’s stablecoin is fully compliant and backed by US dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents. This provides the stability and transparency that many stablecoins have lacked.

37762399,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320209,1734448285,India’s Leadership Pushes for International Crypto Regulation Framework,"India’s stance on crypto regulation continues to evolve, reflecting a balancing act between innovation, investor protection, and economic stability. In a recent statement to the Lok Sabha, the government acknowledged the challenges of regulating virtual digital assets (VDAs) without international collaboration. BREAKING: Crypto regulation discussed in parliament: 1⃣ Comprehensive Framework: The government is working on a regulatory framework for VDAs but emphasizes the need for international collaboration to address their borderless nature and avoid regulatory arbitrage. pic.twitter.com/Njlvw48Urj — Crypto India (@CryptooIndia) December 16, 2024 While taxation on crypto-related income and anti-money laundering measures are already in place, the absence of a comprehensive regulatory framework still presents a problem due to digital assets’ borderless nature. There is no definitive timeline for introducing such guidelines. However, India has reiterated its commitment to working alongside global counterparts to address the vulnerabilities and opportunities in this crypto sector. Is India Preparing Massive Comeback? The Indian government’s approach to VDAs has relied on a patchwork of existing laws and policies. Since March 2023, VDA transactions have been brought under the purview of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). It enables authorities to scrutinize the origins and movement of crypto-related funds. Additionally, income from VDAs is taxed under the Income Tax Act 1961. Other legal frameworks, such as the Information Technology Act 2000 and the Companies Act 2013, further regulate certain aspects of the digital asset ecosystem. However, while necessary, these measures fail to address the unique challenges VDAs pose. The government recognizes that crypto assets operate beyond national borders, making them inherently difficult to regulate through domestic frameworks alone. As a result, India has emphasized the importance of global collaboration to prevent regulatory arbitrage—where businesses exploit differences in rules across jurisdictions. During its G20 presidency in 2023, India was pivotal in advancing the global crypto discourse. Adopting the IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper and the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets showed the urgency of unified international action. These initiatives laid the groundwork for risk-sensitive regulations, urging nations, particularly emerging economies, to align their policies and develop safeguards against financial instability. Despite this, the government has admitted that it is not yet ready to commit to a timeline for a comprehensive domestic regulatory framework. Challenges in Evolving Crypto Sector While India has emerged as a leader in global crypto adoption, they claimed the the sector’s rapid growth has exposed significant vulnerabilities. One of the most pressing concerns is investor protection. The cross-border nature of VDAs limits the effectiveness of purely domestic safeguards, which they rule as exposing investors to fraud and other risks. The government’s response to such challenges has been twofold. On one hand, it seeks to ensure that innovation in the crypto space is not stifled. On the other hand, it is working to implement measures that protect investors without undermining financial stability. These dual objectives are not easily reconciled, particularly in a sector as dynamic and unpredictable as cryptocurrency. Stakeholder consultations have played a key role in shaping India’s approach to VDAs. Reflecting India’s stance on crypto, in a recent exclusive interview with CryptoNews, Bitget COO Vugar Usi Zade shared the exchange’s strategy for entering India’s burgeoning crypto market, highlighting challenges posed by local taxation policies. He expressed concerns over India’s steep crypto taxes, including a 30% tax on profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on each transaction, which he believes could push users toward black-market activities. Usi Zade stressed the importance of clear legislation to foster a healthy crypto ecosystem, describing the current tax regime as a significant barrier for users and businesses.

The Binance Alpha platform launches as part of Binance’s web3 wallet Binance Wallet and will serve as the selection pool for pre-list tokens. Notably, the new platform will offer users the opportunity to explore potential Alpha, with select projects likely to end up on the Binance exchange, according to a press release shared with crypto.news on Dec. 17. In recent months, Binance has listed some of the hottest tokens in the market, with this also coming amid investment by the exchange’s venture capital and incubation arm Binance Labs. The Alpha platform will enhance the listing process by adding transparency, Winson Liu, the global lead of Binance Wallet said. “By publicly highlighting a curated selection of early-stage projects, Binance Alpha fosters community trust, offering users insights into tokens with potential for future growth within the Binance ecosystem,” Liu said.

The exchange recently launched a verified WhatsApp account to ensure users avoid misinformation or scams. On Binance Alpha, investors will have an opportunity to explore and buy tokens via a Quick Buy feature. Tokens will also remain available in the Markets tab section after the spotlight period ends.

37761537,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628991,1734448241,Binance Alpha platform launches with spotlight on emerging tokens,"Binance Wallet will add a new service to put a spotlight on promising assets. Binance Alpha is launching for some regional users, aiming to point out assets that may thrive in the Binance ecosystem. Binance Alpha is the new service for Binance Wallet users, aiming to point out newly added promising assets. The service arrives a few months after Binance made its forays into the meme token space, adding relatively new assets. The wallet will be able to swap those early-stage tokens when available on DEX. However, not all of the assets will be guaranteed a listing. Binance Alpha will be available from December 18, though some regions may be excluded. Binance will offer batches of five tokens, with the first selections expected to appear daily. The posting schedule of new token batches is also to be determined as the service expands its availability. Tokens on Binance Alpha will come with a Quick Buy button and automated MEV protection to minimize attacks and slippage. Some of the tokens may only have DEX trading and will still require personal research before buying. The tokens on Binance Alpha will appear in batches, with 24-hour windows to explore or buy. Binance advises users to back up their wallets before using the Quick Buy option. Binance will also provide pre-announcements for users to prepare for the next Alpha session. Binance makes its token selection process more transparent Binance Alpha may serve as a pre-listing token screening pool, even though it maintains there’s no listing guarantee on the spot or futures market. The service could increase the transparency of Binance’s consideration process ahead of new token listings. Until recently, Binance’s wallets were watched for the addition of new tokens, which usually signal the creation of a spot market. The new selection may include meme tokens, but will also explore Web3 projects with more meaningful utility. Binance’s wallet still offers an exclusive tab for the most active meme tokens as a separate category. The launch of Binance Alpha follows a recent social media trend, where influencers claim foreknowledge of Binance’s selection of tokens. The new wallet feature front-runs those influencers, removing some of the guesswork. Previously, any connection to Binance-related wallets was presented as a sign for a potential listing. However, any token could be sent to a public wallet, and Binance has been relatively conservative with new spot markets. With the new Binance Alpha addition, Binance pre-empted the guesswork about its interest in new tokens. In the end, it is up to Binance to launch spot markets and give new tokens additional prominence. The service may point out potential new listings, but does not guarantee the addition to the official market. All the tokens on Binance Alpha would have gone through additional vetting based on a set of criteria such as community interest, a strong trend, and value alignment. The token selection will serve as an educational tool and not endorse specific tokens. Binance ecosystem lags in decentralized activity While the past year was highly successful for Binance’s centralized activity, its DEX and DeFi arms lag behind. Binance Smart Chain carries $5.85B in value locked, still not recovering its 2021 levels. Still, PancakeSwap expanded its activity in the past month, growing by 13.35%. The exchange is the busiest app on BSC, producing $3.74M in daily fees. For the completed month of November, PancakeSwap also achieved $5.06M in earnings, its best month in the second half of the year.

Backed by U.S. Treasury ETFs and money market funds (MMFs) managed by trusted asset managers and custodied with Doo Group, ZTLN Prime offers institutional investors a secure solution for optimizing treasury assets while generating consistent returns. A Strategic Partnership for Smarter Treasury Management Singularity Finance (SFI), partnering with Zoth for ZTLN-P’s launch, combines strategic treasury management expertise with an advanced tokenization framework. It optimizes DeFi yields while ensuring safety and liquidity, and its framework enables compliant tokenized funds for blockchain transition of real-world and AI-related assets. This comprehensive solution addresses key tokenization challenges through a robust legal structure, reputable service providers, and liquidity pools for token redemption. Together with Zoth’s expertise in GTM strategies for bringing tokenized traditional financial instruments on-chain, this collaboration offers asset managers and institutional investors a streamlined solution to efficiently manage their organization’s treasury while generating consistent returns. Drawing on its deep expertise in decentralized markets and investment strategies, Singularity Finance’s tokenization framework facilitates the launch of ZTLN-P. ZTLN-P is designed to provide optimized, low-risk yields without lock-in periods to its investors. SFI’s tokenisation framework also offers robust access to regulatory compliance, adhering to the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) and the Mutual Funds Act (2021 Revision). ZTLN-P complies with global regulatory standards, offering a secure and accessible solution for investors. Bringing TradFi-Backed Security to On-Chain Treasury Solutions The strength of ZTLN-P lies in its asset backing. By leveraging Blackrock-managed iShares ETFs and MMFs focused on the U.S. Treasury bills, ZTLN-P delivers predictable, low-risk returns with unparalleled liquidity, making it an attractive option for investors seeking stability in the traditionally volatile DeFi yield space. Unlike high-risk DeFi strategies that drive volatility, ZTLN-P prioritizes safety, liquidity, and transparency, setting a new standard for institutional-grade DeFi products. This emphasis on low-risk, compliant financial instruments positions ZTLN-P as the gold standard for RWA tokens, giving institutional investors confidence that their capital is deployed in rigorously vetted strategies designed to preserve principal and generate steady yield. “ZTLN-P is an industry-driven product that aligns institutional-grade short term investments such as Blackrock iShares Treasury Bond ETF with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain,” said Pritam Dutta , CEO of Zoth. “With Singularity Finance’s one-of-a-kind expertise, this partnership marks the beginning of a new era where DeFi is no longer a speculative market but a legitimate alternative to traditional finance.” Mario Casiraghi, Co-founder of SingularityDAO and Singularity Finance commented: “ZTLN Prime is a transformative step toward bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance. By combining Zoth’s expertise in tokenizing high-quality real-world assets we’re delivering an institutional-grade product that embodies safety, liquidity, and transparency for the global web3.0 ecosystem. This partnership sets a new standard for on-chain financial solutions, ensuring that institutional investors can confidently navigate the DeFi space while enjoying consistent, low-risk returns.” Cloris Chen, CEO at Singularity Finance concluded: “One of the core pillars of Singularity Finance is to build an ecosystem that serves as a home for RWA projects, enabled through the SFI tokenization framework. This partnership with Zoth represents an important milestone for SFI, and the launch of ZLTN Prime unlocks a new & innovative way for the global web3.0 ecosystem to manage and grow their treasury, unlocking new opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem while maintaining the highest standards of compliance and trust.” About Zoth Zoth is a retail-focused RWA ecosystem connecting on-chain and traditional finance through institutional-grade fixed-income offerings.

Historically, the crypto market often experiences a bullish surge fueled by increasing investments, positive sentiment, and holiday optimism. And now, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $107k and numerous tokens gaining traction, it's an ideal moment to consider which assets could outperform the market in the coming months. In this guide, we’ve selected the top 8 cryptocurrencies that are poised for growth during the end-of-year Santa Rally, offering a mix of both well-established cryptocurrencies and newer crypto projects. Best Crypto to Buy for Santa Rally - Top 8 List Here is the top 8 list of the best crypto to buy for Santa rally; Bitcoin - Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Cap Wall Street Pepe - Frog-Themed Meme Coin Aiming For Total Crypto Domination Ripple XRP - Third Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Cap Catslap Token - Cat-Themed Play-To-Earn Meme Coin Crypto All-Stars - World’s First-Ever Meme Vault Best Wallet Token - The Ultimate 2024 Crypto Wallet Flockerz - Groundbreaking Vote-To-Earn Meme Coin Solana - Blockchain Built For Mass Adoption 8 Cryptos to Buy for End of Year Santa Rally - Full Reviews To help you make the best decision, we have done well-detailed research and curated a top 8 list of the best crypto coins to buy for the end-of-year Santa Rally. Read the detailed review about each crypto to find out which is suitable for you to invest in. Bitcoin - Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Capitalization Bitcoin needs no introduction as this cryptocurrency has remained the flagship crypto, often leading the market’s overall direction. As the pioneer of cryptocurrency, it has continued to dominate the market, representing nearly 50% of the entire crypto market cap. As the end of 2024 approaches, Bitcoin is trading at historical all-time highs, and if the Santa Rally plays out like it has in previous years, Bitcoin could see a significant upward momentum in the end-of-year period. During the holiday season, Bitcoin often leads the charge in price rallies, and with mainstream financial markets catching up to Bitcoin's value proposition as a hedge against inflation and a store of value, the future looks bright for BTC, making it one of the best cryptos to buy for the end of the year Santa Rally. Since the US election, Bitcoin has continued to benefit from the growing mainstream adoption, and as the foundation of the crypto market with its position as digital gold, Bitcoin remains a must-have during the Santa Rally. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading above $107k, with a YTD return of 153% and a 3-month return of 78%. In the last 12 months, Bitcoin has been one of the standout performers in the crypto space, increasing by an impressive 156% Generally, the limited supply of 21 million coins also adds to its appeal as an inflation hedge, and its market capitalization exceeds $2.00T, accounting for over 50% of the total cryptocurrency market. This dominance guarantees strong liquidity and allows for easy entrance and exit positions. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price saw a 10% increase over the past week, reflecting renewed interest in the token. One $BTC is currently trading above $107 per BTC/USD, breaking its old all-time high of 103K and setting a new one. Several crypto analysts have predicted that in 2025, Bitcoin could gain more and potentially hit the $150K mark. Wall Street Pepe - Frog-Themed Meme Coin Aiming For Total Crypto Domination Another cryptocurrency on our list is Wall Street Pepe , which is a hot new meme token that blends Pepe’s popularity with the excitement of Wall Street trading. This platform is creating a Wepe Army for high-risk, high-reward trading, and this meme coin’s potential for a surge during the Santa Rally lies in its growing following and ability to generate buzz. The project will provide its token holders with exciting meme coin trading strategies and alpha calls. Notably, the $WEPE presale offers early buyers a chance to get in early before the token lists on some of the top crypto exchanges. Wall Street Pepe is unique because it also offers staking rewards of over 40% p/a during the ongoing presale. Based on the whitepaper, 12% of the total $WEPE supply is allocated for staking rewards, which will be distributed over 3 years at the rate of 3044.14 $WEPE tokens per ETH block. All $WEPE token holders become part of the WEPE army movement and get access to WEPE’s exclusive trading calls on insights. This will help them potentially increase their earnings, making it one of the best cryptos to buy for the end-of-the-year Santa rally. All in all, this new meme coin has raised close to $28 million from its presale a few weeks after launch, indicating strong confidence from investors. $WEPE is currently priced at just $0.0003646 per token, and tokens can be purchased on the official Wall Street Pepe presale page. To those interested in this crypto, we suggest reading the Wall Street Pepe white paper, following them on X , and joining their Telegram group to stay updated. Visit Wall Street Pepe Ripple XRP- Third Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Cap Ripple’s XRP experienced significant price fluctuations throughout 2023, and this was largely driven by the ongoing legal battle it had with the SEC, making many wonder if XRP was dead. However, Ripple achieved a major win over SEC, and XRP began to show signs of recovery in the market. Additionally, recent speculations surrounding the approval of an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) have caused a surge in investor interest, making XRP one of the most closely watched assets heading into the end of the year. Over the past month, as a result of speculations regarding the launch of XRP ETFs, Ripple has gained nearly 330%, rising from $0.5 to $2.5 The growing optimism around XRP’s potential legal victory and its use case as a payment bridge for financial institutions has made it one of the best cryptos to buy for the Santa Rally. If the legal situation improves and an ETF is approved, XRP could see an explosive rally heading into the new year. Also, more interest in using XRP for international payments could send its price skyrocketing as even the most conservative XRP price prediction points to a value surge of more than 100% in 2025. Also, Ripple has recently announced through its X platform the Ripple USD Stablecoin launch (RLUSD), which will launch globally on the 17th of December 2024. Ripple is one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in 2024, and it has seen a 307% increase in the past 12 months. XRP’s price also rose by 132% in the past month, currently trading at $2.47 per XRP/USD. Catslap Token - Cat-Themed Play-To-Earn Meme Coin Catslap is the latest cat-themed play-to-earn meme coin, featuring an aggressive feline figure that aims to follow in the success of other cat tokens like $MOG, $POPCAT, and $MEW. The fair launch token was launched directly on a decentralized exchange (DEX), demonstrating openness and inclusivity for investors. Despite being relatively new, Catslap has seen impressive growth thanks to its frequent token burns, limited supply, and engaging social media presence. While meme coins often experience volatile price movements, the community-driven aspect of Catslap could lead to increased demand during the holiday season, especially if it capitalizes on social media momentum and meme culture during the Santa Rally. Technically, Catslap has a fun and engaging clicker game on the platform that encourages community involvement worldwide. Users can click the Catslap graphic and compete with other countries to see who can slap the most. Since 10% of the total $SLAP supply is allocated for community rewards, participants will be rewarded for their slap contributions on the rumored upcoming Catslap P2E game, making it one of the best cryptos to buy for the Santa rally. The unique nature of this application has led many crypto analysts to set high expectations for the Catslap. Following its listing on popular DEX Uniswap, $SLAP could potentially be the first cat token on Binance. Currently, there are only two days left before major announcements, and one $SLAP is trading at a discount price of just $0.00548972 per token. Catslap can be swapped with ETH, USDT, or directly through a bank card. For more information on this new meme coin, follow Catslap on X or join its Telegram channel .

Furthermore, in terms of tokenomics, 25% of Crypto All-Star's total token supply is set aside for staking rewards. $STARS tokens can be staked for a generous APY of over 150%. This is a dynamic APY, meaning it will drop as more tokens are staked, so it is important to stake as early as possible to get the highest APY and earn more $STARS tokens for free. As a pioneer and first-mover in the sector, $STARS aspires to be one of the top ten meme coins ever created, making it an attractive crypto project to buy for the Santa Rally. Even more, some analysts predict that Crypto All-Stars could double on launch day. Take note that the Crypto All-Stars presale ends on the 20th of December, and this meme coin has so far raised over $19.8 million. $STARS is presently trading at $0.0016782 and can be purchased on the official Crypto All-Stars website.

Essentially, it empowers its community, known as 'The Flock' to guide the project and vote on key decisions. That way, every holder has a voice and can earn rewards through the groundbreaking Vote-To-Earn mechanism. With the goal of revolutionizing rewards in the meme coin space, Flockerz is the latest decentralized crypto project that has gained huge popularity and interest from analysts and investors. Powered by $FLOCK, the campaign’s native token, the platform will launch a groundbreaking new decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) named Flocktopia. This DAO rewards token holders with a unique vote-to-earn protocol. Based on the Flockerz whitepaper, 25% of the total token supply is set aside for staking.

However, you should note that transfers with ETH can only be used to take advantage of staking rewards over the next two years. For more details about this project, you can follow Flockerz on X and join its Telegram channel . Visit Flockerz Solana - Blockchain Built For Mass Adoption Solana has undergone a strong recovery after its collapse in 2022, largely due to increased developer activity, network upgrades, and institutional support. Over the past year, SOL has gained 192%, making one of the most impressive comebacks in the crypto market. As one of the fastest blockchains in the world, Solana is attracting a growing number of decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. Also, as new projects continue to launch on the Solana network and major partnerships emerge, the token could see a substantial price boost by the end of the year and in early 2025. Solana's appeal lies in its fast transaction speeds and low costs, which makes it a credible rival to Ethereum. Its unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus technique allows for the processing of thousands of transactions per second, thereby improving scalability. The network's ecosystem is also growing, with more activity in dApps and NFTs. Notably, demand in the Solana meme coin sector increased by 6%, with trading volumes topping $20 billion. Overall, Solana is now the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, with plenty of room to grow. It has been one of the most successful crypto tokens of the resurgent crypto bull market, having increased 192% in value in the last 12 months and 63% in the last 3 months. At the time of writing, one SOL is currently trading at $214.75 per SOL/USDT, and analysts predict SOL can range between $200 to $500 in 2025. What is the Crypto Santa Rally? The ""Santa Rally"" refers to the tendency for financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, to experience a surge in price action during the final weeks of the year. Historically, Q4 has seen positive returns for many assets, fueled by factors like institutional investments and holiday optimism. However, it also should be noted that this is a debatable topic since many see the end-of-year as a period when the markets typically fall as a result of year-end tax considerations and take profit from large investors and institutions. Either way, when it comes to cryptocurrencies, some crypto analysts argue that the crypto market is less predictable and more volatile than traditional markets. Still, with Bitcoin’s surge and growing institutional interest, many expect a similar pattern to play out this year. Whether or not the market will see a significant Santa Rally is still up for debate. However, as we approach the final quarter of 2024, several cryptocurrencies, especially those on our list, appear well-positioned to take advantage of the bullish sentiment. Final Word - Will The Crypto Market See A Santa Rally This Year? In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency, trends like the Santa Rally offer investors a potential window of opportunity to capitalize on seasonal price movements. With Bitcoin trading at all-time highs and altcoins like Ripple, Solana, and meme coins gaining momentum, the prospects for a Santa Rally in 2024 are strong. So, for those looking to capitalize on a potential rally, the cryptocurrencies highlighted in this guide offer a diverse range of opportunities. Whether you're looking for solid, time-tested assets like Bitcoin, Solana, and Ripple XRP or new meme coins like Wall Street Pepe, Crypto All-Stars, Catslap Token, and Flockerz, there’s a token for every type of investor.

37761075,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394318,1734447822,Bitcoin Breaks Out To $108K; Achieves Another Record High Amidst Market Optimism,"The post Bitcoin Breaks Out To $108K; Achieves Another Record High Amidst Market Optimism appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In an exciting development, Bitcoin has hit the $108,000 level and is currently trading at $108,223, up over 2% in the past day. Notably, Bitcoin is up almost 60% since the election, largely driven by Trump’s incoming administration’s support for cryptocurrencies, including the President-elect’s promises to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Besides, Trump has also nominated crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, replacing current chair Gary Gensler, who was known for his hostility towards digital assets. Corporate Adoption Soars The rising institutional adoption has further added to Bitcoin’s rally. Notably, over 70 public companies now have Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Recently, MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor called the cryptocurrency the “Cyber Manhattan” of the digital age. “Every day is a good day to buy Bitcoin,” he noted, stressing that, like real estate in Manhattan, Bitcoin is always a sound investment. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has been accumulating one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holdings in the world and now totals 439,000 BTC, worth around $46 billion “We have a new crypto and Bitcoin-friendly administration, with discussions underway for a U.S. Bitcoin treasury and also FASB [Financial Accounting Standards Board] rules now allowing companies to hold bitcoin on their balance sheet without penalty,” James Lavish, Managing Partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, noted. “This is further legitimizing Bitcoin as a corporate asset.” Notably, the number of Bitcoin whales on the network went parabolic ever since Trump won the US presidential elections. A prominent on chain analyst, Ali Martinez, recently shared that Bitcoin whales bought over 70,000 BTC in the last 48 hours, totaling more than $7.28 billion, adding to the bullish momentum. #Bitcoin whales bought over 70,000 $BTC in the last 48 hours, totaling more than $7.28 billion! pic.twitter.com/lEoVzmZ4i2 — Ali (@ali_charts) December 17, 2024 Growing Optimism MicroStrategy recently bought 15,350 BTC for $1.5 billion, raising the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC. Other firms like Semler Scientific, Mara Holdings, and Riot Platforms have also intensified their stake in Bitcoin over the past few weeks. Moreover, the incoming president is working on a national Bitcoin strategic reserve. To top it all, MicroStrategy will be added to the Nasdaq 100 on Dec. 23, which has further increased the optimism. With the growing momentum, analysts predict between $150,000 and $200,000 for Bitcoin by the end of 2025.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-hits-108k-for-the-first-time-in-history/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37762397,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320205,1734447758,US Convicts Virginia Man for Funding ISIS with Crypto,"Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa, a 35-year-old resident of Springfield, Virginia, has been convicted for crypto terrorism funding to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). According to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) , Chhipa sent $185,000 worth of cryptocurrency to ISIS members in Syria between October 2019 and 2022. A federal jury convicted Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa, 35, of Springfield, on charges relating to his efforts to provide material support to ISIS, which was designated by the United States Secretary of State as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. #NSD #FBI https://t.co/BczmJfV9UQ — U.S. Attorney EDVA (@EDVAnews) December 16, 2024 Court evidence revealed that the funds were used to support ISIS operations, including financing the escape of detained female members from prison camps and aiding fighters on the battlefield. Chhipa raised funds through social media platforms, electronic bank transfers, and in-person cash collections. The money was then converted into cryptocurrency and smuggled through Turkey to ISIS contacts in Syria. The DOJ confirmed that Chhipa worked closely with a British-born ISIS member who resides in Syria. This co-conspirator was instrumental in facilitating the movement of funds and coordinating efforts to finance prison escapes and terrorist attacks. In a statement regarding the conviction, DOJ Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen explained that the defendant sent out over $185,000 in cryptocurrency. The charges brought against Chhipa include one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization and four counts of providing and attempting to provide support. In combination, the offenses carry a maximum sentence of 100 years in prison if served consecutively. However, federal sentencing guidelines often result in penalties below the maximum limit. Chhipa is scheduled to be sentenced on May 5, 2025, when a federal judge will determine his prison term. While the maximum penalty could reach 100 years, actual sentencing will depend on statutory factors and federal guidelines. Crypto Misuse and Anti-Money Laundering Efforts The misuse of crypto in terrorism financing has become a growing concern globally. Due to the speed, anonymity, and cross-border capabilities of digital assets, they are increasingly used by terrorist organizations to bypass traditional financial systems. Chhipa’s case is not unique. In May 2024, Victoria Jacobs was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a New York State jury after being convicted of funding Syrian terrorism using Bitcoin. She was found guilty of charges like money laundering, soliciting or providing support for an act of terrorism, criminal possession of a weapon, etc. In October 2024, a teenager was accused of using crypto to support Al Qaeda and other extremist groups . Although the defendant pleaded not guilty, it was revealed that he allegedly raised approximately $1,300 in cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Maximiliano Pilipis, operator of the crypto exchange AurumXchange, was charged with money laundering related to the infamous Silk Road darknet marketplace. Between 2009 and 2013, Pilipis’ exchange violated anti-money laundering regulations by processing illegal transactions without proper licensing. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and law enforcement agencies continue to push for stronger global oversight to curb the misuse of cryptocurrencies. Unlike other countries, the UK has tightened its grip on cryptocurrency regulation to combat market risks. On December 16, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed stricter rules, including banning public crypto offerings by unregulated companies.

While the price action suggests the dominance of the bears, the technicals remain in favour of bulls. In the meantime, Solana seems to have remained stuck within this clash and as a result, the price continues to trade under bearish influence. Will the current attempt to clear the resistance fail? Will this lead to an extended bearish action close to $200? In a short while, the SOL price managed to surge, displaying huge bullish momentum. It is among the top & primitive altcoins that managed to achieve new ATH after Bitcoin, while the others within the top 10 remain pretty much distinct. This indicates a huge backing from not only the market participants but also the bulls. Moreover, the rise in trading activity over the platform has largely contributed to the surge. Therefore, the SOL price is believed to display an unexpected bullish move in a short while that may thrash the bearish possibility. The daily chart of Solana displays the price being stuck within a falling wedge, which is considered to be a bullish pattern. However, the token is facing equal pressure from both sides, which suggests uncertainty over the next price action. Meanwhile, the bulls are trying hard to hold the price above the immediate support at $216 and if this breaks yet, the levels around $205 could offer some support to trigger a rebound. Nevertheless, the technicals remain in favour of the bulls as the MACD seems to be preparing for a bullish crossover, while the selling pressure does not seem to have faded. Meanwhile, the OBV is trying to validate a bullish reversal that it has been doing for over a few weeks. If, in that case, the levels validate a rise, then the SOL price is believed to breach the resistance of the falling wedge and reach the resistance at $243; otherwise, it may face a small pullback close to $210 and rebound towards the upper targets. Solana’s (SOL) price is primed to revamp a strong ascending trend, while the timeframe remains not restricted to 2024.",NEUTRAL,SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/solana-bulls-attempt-to-rise-above-the-bearish-range-will-sol-price-reclaim-250/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37760997,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663505,1734447639,Ethereum Price Crash Incoming? Tron’s Justin Sun Unstakes $209 Million ETH From Lido Finance,"The Ethereum price could face some turbulence, as Justin Sun, the founder of Tron (TRX), has unstaked a whopping $209 million from Lido Finance, a liquid decentralized staking platform for Ethereum. Compared to top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE), the Ethereum price has had a relatively muted performance, skyrocketing to $4,000 before consolidating and struggling to move higher. With the possibility of more sell-offs, Ethereum could see its price crashing down if Sun decides to dump more coins. Justin Sun Dumps ETH New reports from Spot On Chain, an AI-driven crypto platform, revealed that Sun recently applied to withdraw a staggering 52,905 ETH tokens worth about $209 million from Lido Finance. According to the on-chain data, this massive withdrawal was part of the ETH stash Sun allegedly accumulated between February and August 2024. Spot On Chain has revealed that the total amount of Ethereum Sun bought within this period amounted to 392,474 ETH tokens, valued at $1.19 billion. All of these tokens were purchased via three wallet addresses at an average price of $3,027. Presently, the total profit the Tron founder has acquired since his purchase is up to $349 million, representing a 29% increase from its purchasing price. Interestingly, on October 24, Sun had unstaked a massive 80,251 ETH tokens, worth over $131 million, from Lido Finance. Four days later, he transferred the entire amount to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. This notable move took place just before the price of Ethereum had dropped sharply by 5% in mid-October, which could have resulted in a loss for Sun. Unsurprisingly, this is not the first time Sun has dumped Ethereum. Spot On Chain revealed earlier this month that the Tron Founder had been cashing in his Ethereum holdings during the market rally. In November, Sun deposited 19,000 ETH worth $60.83 million to HTX, a crypto exchange. Additionally, he transferred 29,920 ETH valued at $119.7 million to HTX again after its price surpassed $4,000 over the past week. These are just a few transactions the Tron founder has made with ETH over the past month. Given Sun’s history of large-scale asset movements, further sell-offs could impact the already fragile Ethereum market. Nevertheless, the lingering question remains whether the Tron founder will continue his Ethereum dumping spree. Ethereum Price Crash Ahead? While Sun has not publicly commented on his recent large-scale Ethereum withdrawals, the size and timing of these transactions could pose a problem for the altcoin’s future trajectory. Historically, large ETH liquidations have triggered a price crash due to increasing selling pressures. Related Reading: Time To Sell XRP? Price Completes Head And Shoulder Pattern, Suggesting Crash To $2.2 Is Imminent With the price of Ethereum still unstable and aiming for a stronger upward rally, further large-scale ETH dumps could exacerbate market volatility, especially if other investors or whales follow suit. For now, the price of Ethereum seems to be performing well, recording a more than 7% increase in the last seven days and a 28% surge over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap.

While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines and market sentiment, early-stage altcoins with disruptive potential are capturing the interest of investors looking for huge profit. Bitcoin’s Climb to $200k: A Catalyst for Altcoin Growth Bitcoin’s ascent toward $200k has reignited investor enthusiasm in the cryptocurrency market. Historical patterns suggest that Bitcoin often leads the charge in market rallies, but once its momentum stabilizes, altcoins typically take center stage, delivering massive returns. The factors fueling Bitcoin’s current uptrend include: Institutional Adoption: Major corporations and hedge funds continue to accumulate Bitcoin, signaling confidence in its long-term value. ETF Approvals: The potential approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is expected to attract trillions of dollars in new capital to the market. 2024 Halving Event: Bitcoin’s supply reduction has historically triggered bull markets due to increased scarcity. PropiChain Stealing the Spotlight PropiChain , with its focus on real-world utility and blockchain innovation, is positioned as a leading candidate for exponential growth in the 2025 bull run. PropiChain is tackling real-world challenges in property investment. Revolutionary Features Tokenized Real-World Assets: PropiChain enables users to invest in tokenized real-world assets like real estate, creating new pathways for wealth generation. Automated Transactions: The platform’s automated payment processes reduce administrative hassles. Leases renew automatically, and tenants receive automated payment reminders. Scalability and Speed: Unlike Bitcoin, which struggles with high transaction fees and slower processing times, PropiChain boasts lightning-fast transactions and a highly scalable network, making it ideal for mass adoption. Security Audits and Listings: PropiChain’s successful BlockAudit review and its recent CoinMarketCap listing provide added credibility, reassuring investors of its reliability and growth potential. Why PropiChain Is Perfect for the Bull Run Early-stage altcoins are often the biggest winners during bull runs due to their low market capitalization and the ability to capture outsized gains. PropiChain is especially promising because: Massive Upside Potential: A $0.011 price tag means even small investments can yield significant returns. For instance, a $1,000 investment could grow to $100,000 if the token reaches $1. Strong Community Backing: A growing community of developers, investors, and enthusiasts is driving adoption and innovation on the platform. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with global enterprises and blockchain leaders are accelerating the project’s roadmap. PropiChain Presale Opportunity Currently in its presale phase, PropiChain offers a unique opportunity for early investors to secure tokens at a heavily discounted price. The presale price of $0.011 is expected to rise significantly in subsequent stages, creating a sense of urgency for those looking to maximize their returns. Current Presale Price: $0.01 per token Next Stage Price: $0.023 per token Projected 2025 Price: $10+ Investors who secure tokens at the current presale stage could see exponential gains as PropiChain’s adoption grows and its value aligns with its utility. The current presale phase represents the lowest possible price for PropiChain. As it progresses to the next stage, prices will rise, reducing the potential for outsized returns. A $1,000 investment today could yield $2,300 by the next presale stage, and $100,000+ if PropiChain reaches $1 in the 2025 bull run. Conclusion As Bitcoin charts its path toward $200k, the spotlight is shifting to emerging altcoins with massive growth potential, especially because of low barrier entry. PropiChain stands out as a game-changer, combining real-world utility with blockchain innovation to address pressing challenges in real estate. With its presale underway and the price set to increase soon, the time to act is now. Don’t wait, this could be your chance to turn a small investment into a fortune as the 2025 bull run unfolds.

37761134,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628910,1734447389,"The next big crypto crash might come from Donald Trump himself, and it’ll be the worst","Donald Trump won the election, Bitcoin is literally worth over $107,000 right now, and Wall Street’s now drooling over crypto like it’s the new gold rush. Sounds perfect, right? Except it actually isn’t. Thanks to Trump, crypto is sinking its claws deep into everything. Wall Street, banks, pensions, 401(k)s—places it never belonged. That’s great for investors I guess, but if you ask me and any other true Bitcoin believer, there’s a dark reality behind the hype. It is an unwritten law of the world that whatever goes up must eventually come down. So no matter how high Bitcoin goes, it will crash in the end. And the scary part is when it does, it’ll be the worst we’ve ever seen. Naturally, since the market has never reached current levels. The higher the stakes, the worse the crash. Just ask Wall Street bros. For years, crypto’s appeal was its independence from the system. Now, the system is embracing it. We’re not the rebels anymore, we’re the establishment. At the July Bitcoin Conference, Trump threw out an idea that stunned everyone—a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile.” Analysts are taking this seriously. Under Trump, the U.S. could actually start hoarding Bitcoin like it’s gold. If that sounds insane, it gets wilder. This guy wants $15 trillion in Bitcoin reserves. Even before his election win, the floodgates were opening. BlackRock and other financial giants launched Bitcoin ETFs, giving ordinary investors access to Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts. Crypto is breaking into mainstream finance at full speed but with zero brakes. Trump’s crypto army is dismantling the rules – There will be costs After the last crash in 2022 when Bitcoin fell apart and billions evaporated, the industry didn’t actually stop. There was no new “killer app” or game-changing technology to win back trust. Instead, they played politics. Over $130 million poured into political campaigns during this year’s election cycle. The crypto industry sold lawmakers on a story: ignore us at your own risk because “crypto voters” are coming for you. The pitch was brilliant, even if the “crypto voter” narrative was stitched together out of thin air. Trump ran with it. His administration is already lining up crypto loyalists for key regulatory roles. Paul Atkins, a longtime critic of financial oversight and a strong crypto lover, is Trump’s pick to lead the SEC. Under him, the crypto industry will face less scrutiny, not more. If you think fraud was bad in 2022, just wait. Though Trump’s playbook doesn’t stop at gutting the SEC. As we speak, Congress is working to move crypto oversight to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Compared to the SEC, the CFTC is frankly quite underfunded and far less experienced with crypto’s retail-heavy markets. The result? A regulatory free-for-all, exactly what the industry wants. The CFPB is next. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created after the 2008 crash to protect consumers from predatory financial practices. Crypto’s biggest names hate it. Marc Andreessen slammed the agency, calling it a roadblock for crypto firms. Elon Musk doubled down, telling the government to “delete CFPB.” To be fair, these guys have a point. If Trump and Congress gut the CFPB, it’s open season for crypto platforms, fintech startups, and shady payment systems. Tens of thousands of people were left stranded when Synapse, a fintech company backed by Marc, collapsed earlier this year. That kind of chaos would only get worse without consumer protections. Banks and pensions are playing with fire The last time crypto imploded, banks were relatively safe. Pension funds and 401(k)s barely felt a thing. Regulators made sure of that. The 2022 crash was brutal for retail investors, but hey, at least it didn’t trigger a financial meltdown. That firewall is now crumbling. The SEC’s approval of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs opened the door. Banks and traditional investment firms are stepping in, eager to capitalize on crypto’s new wave. Now retirement administrators are adding Bitcoin exposure to 401(k) plans. The industry is even fighting to hold crypto directly on their balance sheets. It’s not hard to see where this is heading. Crypto firms have already fought to kill protections like SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121. The rule forced banks to disclose crypto holdings and keep reserves to back customer assets. Lawmakers passed a bill in early 2024 to overturn it, but Biden vetoed the attempt. Trump won’t. Under his leadership, those protections will vanish, leaving banks fully exposed. But the president’s plans aren’t just about deregulation. His World Liberty Financial project—a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform—is already spending millions on crypto acquisitions. Reports say the project burned through $45 million in December alone. The real endgame FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried spent over $100 million buying political influence. He pitched lawmakers a vision of a regulated crypto future, where firms could “self-regulate” and innovation would flourish. It was a scam. FTX blew up, and billions of dollars disappeared overnight. The crypto industry hasn’t changed. It’s still lobbying hard against regulations. It’s still pushing lawmakers to look the other way. And now it has Trump in its corner. I’d feel safer if I actually trusted that these guys truly believe in Bitcoin. But I don’t, because, at the end of the day, politics really is just politics. If Bitcoin wasn’t going to make Trump richer in any way at all, how many of you can say for a fact that you believe he’d still be all in? Let’s not be delusional. Every bull run ends in collapse. And every collapse leaves devastation in its wake. The difference now is Bitcoin has grown too big to fail. A crypto crash under Trump wouldn’t just hurt retail investors and break my heart. It would hit the banking system, pension funds, and the entire global economy. So as we watch Mr. Trump recite the oath of office, beware that a countdown will be starting.

37760862,https://crypto.news/?p=14320129,1734447372,Nuffle Labs and Wormhole launch cross-chain restaking solution,"Nuffle Labs, a universal restaking platform, and Wormhole, an interoperability protocol, have announced a new solution to connect different blockchain networks through native cross-chain restaking. This solution hopes to allow users to restake their assets without relying on token bridges, a process that often carries security risks. The integration uses Wormhole’s ( W ) messaging system and Nuffle Labs’ new Fast Finality AVS to enable secure interactions across various blockchain networks, according to a note shared with crypto.news from Nuffle Labs. You might also like: EU Parliament Member pushes for a strategic Bitcoin reserve and says ‘no’ to digital euro Restaking assets By incorporating EigenLayer’s restaking infrastructure, the system allows users to restake assets on any blockchain that supports Layer 1 (e.g., Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH )) or Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Polygon ( MATIC ), Arbitrum ( ARB )). This eliminates the need for users to move their assets between blockchains through traditional bridging methods, which are often prone to hacks. Restaking allows users who hold blockchain tokens to earn additional rewards by securing more than one protocol or service. For example, users can stake their Ethereum tokens to help validate transactions on the Ethereum network, and “restake” those same tokens to support additional networks or applications. “This is just the beginning for us,” said Altan Tutar, CEO and Co-Founder of Nuffle Labs. “By eliminating the risks associated with traditional token bridging, we’re enabling assets to be restaked from anywhere.” The blockchain sector has grown rapidly, with over 600 million users and a market value of $3.72 trillion in 2024, according to Nuffle Labs. This expansion has increased the demand for better ways to connect blockchain networks. Currently, more than 300 active blockchains operate independently, creating challenges for users who want to interact with multiple platforms. Nuffle Labs and Wormhole plan to launch a testnet in the coming months, enabling users to explore cross-chain restaking. Their goal is to create a system where assets can move seamlessly between chains, enabling activities like lending, borrowing, and restaking without restrictions.

This will be followed by text-based responses. OpenAI’s billion-dollar funding spree The creator behind ChatGPT is making waves with a reported plan to raise more funds. OpenAI has rocketed from a startup to a household name in record time. Launched in late 2022, the chatbot gained 100 million weekly active users within a year and doubled that number by August 2024. According to reports, the cost of training AI models like ChatGPT is huge, and OpenAI is operating at a loss. Despite raising a jaw-dropping $17.9 billion by September 2024, it needs even more cash to stay afloat. These funds mostly came from Microsoft. The company has tapped investors every 11 months on average. This is a stark contrast to other AI startups which typically raise funds every 2 years. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s internal projections forecast $44 billion in red ink over the next 5 years. Just like Musk did with Tesla, OpenAI could tap into retail investor hype to make billions even before the stock hits the market.

42389568,64cffb0d-3df0-47cb-82c4-121aaa3ed2d5,1734447064,Decentralization Is Why We Fight for Crypto,"The last four years were focused on fighting for the survival of the crypto industry in the United States. Against a hostile administration and unprecedented lawfare, the industry fought back boldly – and won.    But now, the industry faces a more pressing task: Helping to shape the legislation and policies that will govern it for decades to come. At the core of this fight is the issue of “decentralization.”    Put simply, decentralization is the distribution of control and decision-making, eliminating the need for a central authority – ensuring more choice, transparency, security, and resilience for users. While it may sound technical, decentralization is the core premise of blockchain technologies. The benefits of decentralization include promoting competition, creativity, and collaboration while protecting freedom and value – both financial and reputational.    But why should decentralization be enshrined in law? By adopting policies that incentivize it, we can ensure three important outcomes:    First, we can guard against the big, centralized companies – from Big Tech, Big Finance, and Big Entertainment – entrenching their dominance in the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem. As we’ve seen across internet, banking, and entertainment networks, centralized control has led to consolidation and value extraction to the detriment of the people who use those products. The next iteration of the internet should focus on uplifting those in Little Tech, because the world needs more options, not the same few options.    Second, we can ensure founders and builders are rewarded for giving up unilateral control and for creating systems that function more like public infrastructure, and less like proprietary technologies. The internet rapidly evolved because entrepreneurs could build on top of shared, open protocols like email and the web. Blockchains unlock a similar, but even more expansive, world of possibilities.    Finally, we can protect consumers and promote long-term investment and building. Minimum standards of decentralization would push digital assets to function more like commodities than securities, helping to guard against volatility, scams, and the casino culture of pump-and-dump schemes – without stifling innovation. While this could be bad news for crypto hedge funds and day traders, it would be great news for those looking to build useful products on blockchains.    Without these three incentives, the allure of centralization is too powerful for builders. Even though blockchains now make decentralization more technically possible and easier to implement at scale, it’s still far too convenient for builders to make unilateral decisions, rather than build consensus; and it’s tempting to hoard profits for a few, rather than distribute them among a community.    So how do we incentivize decentralization?    We need a new “fit for purpose” regulatory framework for decentralized technologies like blockchains – one that isn’t predicated on the existence of centralized intermediaries, the way securities laws currently require. Such a framework could incentivize decentralization by reducing regulatory burdens; and by enabling broader market access for projects that both disseminate ownership and control as well as provide tailored disclosures.    This approach is not new – it builds on the SEC’s 2019 Framework for Digital Assets – but it also solves one of the key paradoxes that framework had introduced. The framework sought to mitigate risks to users by limiting reliance on centralized actors. But, it also incentivized projects to obfuscate their ongoing development efforts – or to even abandon work altogether – exposing users to significant risks.    By reframing decentralization in terms of control – and combining control-related decentralization requirements with disclosure requirements – this new regulatory framework would empower founders to build decentralized technologies, helping them resist the convenience and ease of centralization. And it would do so without exposing consumers to the risks securities laws aim to address.    This approach would also be malleable enough to evolve as the industry grows. It therefore fosters innovation, accelerates the progress of decentralized technologies, and enables the crypto ecosystem to thrive in the U.S. over the years to come.    There will obviously be pushback from those in the industry looking to advance their own agendas and gains – but let’s not lose sight of the benefits of blockchain technologies, not just for crypto users, but for all.    If we win the battle for decentralization, we can defend the purpose of crypto.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Miles Jennings,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/17/decentralization-is-why-we-fight-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be9a884eb582c67fbaef8e3c4b5f0e566fda2c6b-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance Spot has announced that it will launch Simon’s Cat on Tuesday, along with a new meme coin Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). #Binance is excited to announce @SimonsCatMeme $CAT and @pudgypenguins $PENGU on Binance HODLer Airdrops!The Airdrop page will be available on the Binance Airdrop Portal in 10 hours.

Popcat, Mog Coin and Catslap are some of the projects drawing Binance rumours. Binance Spot To List Simon’s Cat - How High Can The Meme Coin Go? Simon’s Cat is establishing itself as a blue-chip meme coin for the 2025 supercycle. The CAT coin secured a Binance Futures listing earlier this year and will go live on Binance Spot on Tuesday. Moreover, it is a multi-chain meme coin. Already a top project on the BNB Chain, Simon’s Cat also went live on Solana earlier this year. This means it can benefit from rallies in both BNB and SOL, considering smart money investors view meme coins as beta bets on their respective blockchains. Prominent crypto experts are extremely bullish on CAT’s upside potential. Legendary trader Unipcs, aka “the Bonk guy” , believes that it could flip Popcat’s market capitalization in the coming months. Similarly, crypto investor Poseidon offloaded his Ethereum holdings and swapped it for Simon’s Cat. The timing couldn’t be better, considering the CAT price has skyrocketed by nearly 50% following its Binance spot listing. You all questioned me yesterday about why I’m selling my $ETH for $CAT ,Here’s the answer. pic.twitter.com/9LF14FRobL — Poseidon (@CryptoPoseidonn) December 16, 2024 There is growing consensus that Simon’s Cat is the next billion-dollar meme coin. Considering it currently has a market cap of just $422 million, sidelined investors could still see outsized returns from it. However, swing traders should be careful while trading CAT’s post-Binance launch price action. The meme coin is launching on Binance as a part of the HOLDer Airdrop program. Airdrop winners could look to secure their profits, which could result in a short-term correction in the token price. Is Catslap The Next Binance Listing? Catslap (SLAP) , a new cat-themed token, is going viral and drawing Binance rumours. Inspired by the viral “slapping cat” meme, the token saw an 8,400% rally following its fair launch. Catslap isn’t an ordinary meme coin. For instance, its deflationary token supply - the result of regular burn events and a buyback program - separates it from the run-of-the-mill coins on the market. Even its viral slap-to-earn game enhances the deflationary tokenomics, burning a set amount of tokens whenever the 'slapometer' reaches specific milestones. The meme coin also has strong community support. For instance, its holder count continues to surge, as does its social media following. Over $2 million worth of SLAP coins have also been staked and earning 40% APY, a sign of strong community trust. The project has recently launched a “Slap-to-Earn” quest, which promises $100,000 USDT for the top 10 slappers and SLAP airdrops to the rest. Unsurprisingly, the challenge is going viral. The Catslap price has pulled back from its all-time high as the early buyers locked in their profits. However, it has bounced back up from a key support level, which is typically when Binance announces its listings. Considering that Catslap is still a microcap meme coin with a $21 million valuation, smart money investors are eyeing outsized returns from it. For instance, popular crypto trader ClayBro believes that up to 50x returns could be a possibility for SLAP.

37760480,https://crypto.news/?p=14320122,1734446630,"Stellar’s XLM price rises as XRP rebounds, but gains may be brief","Stellar Lumens was one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies on Dec. 17 as it continued to mirror Ripple. Stellar ( XLM ) price rose by 10%, reaching an intraday high of $0.4713, up 32% from its lowest level this month. This rally coincided with the ongoing XRP price surge after the developers unveiled the RLUSD stablecoin. Ripple Labs expects its new stablecoin will soon see inflows and challenge Tether’s dominance. XLM and Ripple ( XRP ) often move in sync because they are both focused on money transfer. Stellar’s goal is to promote peer-to-peer transfers of cash, while Ripple is mostly focused on institutions like banks and money transfer. You might also like: XRP price rises ahead of RLUSD launch, but a reversal is possible Ripple and Stellar have a common origin as well. Jed McCaleb, Stellar’s founder, was one of the founding team of Ripple Labs. Therefore, Stellar often rallies when Ripple is rising. For example, Stellar rallied to a yearly high of $0.1963 in July 2023 when Ripple Labs won a major lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission. Similarly, XLM price jumped by almost 500% in November after Donald Trump won the election. His victory meant that the SEC may abandon his appeal against Ripple Labs when Paul Atkins starts his tenure . XLM also jumped as Bitcoin continued its strong rally, moving above the crucial resistance at $107,000 for the first time ever. Altcoins often when Bitcoin is doing well. Stellar is also seeing strong fundamentals. For example, its most recent report showed that the number of addresses in the network rose to over 9 million. Also, the number of volume handled in its network soared to $4.9 billion. Stellar price analysis XLM price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the XLM price bottomed at $0.3535 earlier this month. It then formed a hammer pattern, a popular reversal sign characterized by a long shadow and a small body. Stellar has remained above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. It has also formed a bullish engulfing chart pattern, which is characterized by a big bullish candle that covers a previous red candle. Therefore, Stellar will likely continue rising as bulls target the intermediate resistance point at $0.50, which is about 12% above the current level. The risk, however, is that the coin may have formed a bearish flag pattern, which may lead to more downside. Such a move would see it retest the support at $0.3535.

37760422,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111023,1734446510,How to Build a Resilient Crypto Portfolio for the New Year,"The end of the year is more than just a time to reflect. It’s an opportunity to reset, reassess, and prepare for what lies ahead. After months of volatility, corrections, and uncertain sentiment, something is shifting in the crypto market. Confidence is creeping back in, with prices stabilizing, projects delivering real progress, and investors once again showing optimism. Analysts are watching closely, pointing to signals that may mark the start of a just fired off crypto bull run . Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone reentering the space, the question now is simple: is your portfolio ready for the opportunities of the new year? Why the Start of the Year Is a Critical Moment for Investors A new year isn’t just symbolic; it’s a natural time for recalibration. Investors of all sizes retail and institutional alike, tend to reallocate capital and realign strategies for the months ahead. This influx of focus and funding often shapes market momentum, and those who act early put themselves in the strongest position to benefit. Adding to this, market sentiment is beginning to shift after a turbulent year marked by regulatory uncertainty, project failures, and hesitant recovery. While some remained sidelined, institutional players quietly began returning to the space, and on-chain data shows increased activity in major crypto assets. Projects with strong fundamentals are emerging stronger, signaling that the market is maturing beyond hype-driven rallies. If you want to know more about behind the scenes of the crypto bull run, visit this guide . This evolving environment presents a critical opportunity. A resilient portfolio positions you to thrive during upward trends while safeguarding against the volatility that crypto markets inevitably bring. How to Build a Resilient Crypto Portfolio in Today’s Market Building resilience starts with understanding where the market is headed and aligning your portfolio with assets that can deliver value. For 2024, the focus is on a balanced, intentional strategy, one that combines stability with growth potential. First, revisit your foundation. Core assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the backbone of a strong crypto portfolio. Bitcoin continues to lead the market, attracting institutional attention as digital gold, while Ethereum solidifies its place as the infrastructure for decentralized finance, NFTs, and smart contracts. Holding these established players provides a base of stability while still capturing upside as the market recovers. Once your foundation is in place, diversify with growth-focused opportunities. Look beyond the obvious and focus on emerging sectors that are showing signs of real progress. Scalability remains a priority for blockchain adoption, putting Layer-2 projects in the spotlight. Real-world use cases, such as tokenized assets, decentralized applications, and AI-blockchain integrations, are gaining traction and presenting fresh opportunities. Projects in these areas are not just innovating, they’re solving problems that matter. Risk management should underpin every move you make. Volatility will always be part of crypto investing, so keeping a portion of your portfolio in stablecoins like USDT or USDC ensures you can seize opportunities during pullbacks without needing to liquidate other assets. Additionally, a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, investing a set amount regularly, allows you to build positions over time without the stress of trying to time the market perfectly. Finally, make sure to feel confident about your platform too. Prioritize features like zero commission trading and fractional trading, which enable every type of investor to participate without strict limitations. The right tools can make a significant difference in how effectively you build and manage your portfolio. Adapting to Today’s Changing Market Conditions The current market is shifting, and the narrative is changing alongside it. Institutional involvement is increasing, signaling growing trust in digital assets as part of broader financial strategies. At the same time, developers are delivering real progress, and communities are reengaging with innovative projects that promise long term utility. But this isn’t a market for blind optimism. It’s a market that rewards preparation. The days of speculative hype driving sustained rallies are fading. Instead, projects with tangible use cases, active ecosystems, and strong teams are the ones leading the charge. Investors who focus on these signals, rather than chasing hype, are the ones who will find success as the new year unfolds. Are You Ready to Take on the New Year? There’s no doubt that the crypto market is evolving. Whether it’s signs of institutional trust, technical developments, or a just fired off crypto bull run gaining momentum, the pieces are aligning for a new chapter of growth. Building a resilient portfolio isn’t about timing the market or chasing trends, it’s about being ready. By rebalancing, focusing on strong fundamentals, and managing risks effectively, you’ll be positioned to thrive no matter what the year ahead brings. The opportunities are coming.

By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The USDT Paired Chart On the USDT paired chart, the price has been surging almost vertically since breaking above the 200-day moving average at the beginning of November. While the market has broken above several resistance levels, it is currently consolidating below the key $3 level. Meanwhile, the $2 support zone has supported the asset, preventing a long-term correction even though XRP dipped below that level last week. With the RSI also cooling down, it is likely that the market will continue higher soon. The BTC Paired Chart Looking at the XRP/BTC pair, things look quite similar to that of the Tether paired chart. The market has begun an aggressive uptrend since breaking above the long-term bearish trendline but failed to break above the 2800 SAT resistance level in its first attempt. Yet, as long as the 2000 SAT support area is intact, higher prices could be expected for XRP against BTC.

At this point, a French MP, inspired by El Salvador in the face of the European Union's economic inactivity, proposed a strategic Bitcoin reserve for Europe. According to Bitcoin Archive, in a recent speech in the European Parliament, French member of the European Parliament (EP), Sarah Knafo, opposed the digital euro and called for the European Union to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Knafo said Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, limited supply, and growing adoption make it an attractive option for governments to diversify their reserves and hedge against economic uncertainty. “The European Union is wasting our money through incredible mismanagement. It continues to accumulate tragically inflationary deficits. It insists on regulation, taxation, slowdown. It's time to focus on freedom. It's time for our states to invest in Bitcoin to create national strategic reserves. If France does not take the lead on this issue, it risks finding itself in economic weakness in the coming years. This is an unavoidable and important geostrategic issue. Because Bitcoin can serve as a guarantee for the economic soundness of a State on the same level as gold.” Member of the European Parliament Knafo also noted that it is time to develop the mining industry in Europe, noting that Bitcoin miners are found elsewhere, especially in the United States. *This is not investment advice.

This strategic move reflects the company’s confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset, following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy’s similar approach. The zero-interest bonds will mature on June 16, 2025 , allowing Metaplanet enough time to execute its plan of purchasing more Bitcoin. What makes this initiative unique is the company’s structured repayment method: the bonds will be repaid using funds raised through earlier-issued warrants. This strategy enables Metaplanet to avoid taking on additional debt, ensuring financial stability while continuing to build its Bitcoin reserves. Since April 2024, Metaplanet has acquired 1,142 BTC , currently valued at around $122.67 million . This latest issuance highlights Metaplanet’s ongoing effort to hedge against Japan’s rising debt levels and the volatility of the yen. The company views Bitcoin as a key investment that can offer long-term growth while reducing financial risk. To maintain investor confidence, Metaplanet focuses on responsible capital management. By recycling proceeds from previous financial instruments, the company can meet its obligations without burdening its finances. This approach not only secures bondholders but also reinforces trust in Metaplanet’s ability to balance financial innovation with stability. This is not Metaplanet’s first venture into bond issuance. Earlier, the company raised 1.75 billion yen (about $11.3 million) through one-year bonds with a 0.36% interest rate, dedicating all proceeds to buying Bitcoin. The company’s clear and consistent strategy demonstrates its strong belief in Bitcoin’s role as a hedge and a core financial asset. Metaplanet’s decision comes amid growing global interest in Bitcoin, which currently holds a market cap of $2.12 trillion. By investing heavily in the cryptocurrency, the company positions itself for future growth while reducing exposure to the weakening yen. The zero-interest bonds offer a creative way to achieve this without creating immediate financial pressure. The strategy reflects Metaplanet’s commitment to sustainable financial management. With clear repayment plans and a long-term vision, the company showcases how Bitcoin can be leveraged not just as an asset but as part of an innovative financing model. This move underlines the company’s faith in Bitcoin’s potential while proving its ability to manage funds efficiently. Metaplanet’s approach provides a model for other firms looking to adopt Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy.

37760295,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394294,1734446283,5 Blockchain Innovations Transforming the World in 2025,"The post 5 Blockchain Innovations Transforming the World in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ideal world is one where technology doesn’t just solve problems but creates once unimaginable opportunities. As we approach the start of 2025, blockchain technology is reaching new heights, proving it’s not just about cryptocurrency anymore. Over the past year, we’ve seen it being used in some amazing ways to make life better, from helping people access education and cutting down on pollution to improving internet connections and supporting good causes. With big reports predicting blockchain’s role in reshaping industries like finance, energy, and digital infrastructure, the focus is shifting to real-world applications that impact everyday lives. In this article, we spotlight five forward-thinking projects—Aave, Philcoin, Alephium, FedRok AG, and Helium. These projects aren’t just using blockchain to innovate, they’re changing how we think about solving problems and building a more connected, sustainable world. Aave: Changing How We Think About Finance For anyone exploring decentralized finance (DeFi), Aave is a name that stands out. This platform allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without relying on banks or other intermediaries. Innovation: Using smart contracts, Aave eliminates the need for third parties in financial transactions. Its overcollateralization model ensures that loans are secured, providing an additional layer of trust and security. The platform operates across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche, offering a seamless, cross-chain experience. Societal Impact : Aave’s decentralized model democratizes access to financial services. By removing traditional barriers like credit checks and geographical limitations, it empowers individuals worldwide to participate in financial activities, fostering economic inclusion. Philcoin: Building a Global Digital Economy of Giving The idea of combining giving and earning has long seemed idealistic, but Philcoin has turned this vision into reality. As a blockchain-based ecosystem rooted in philanthropy, Philcoin creates a global digital economy that blends technological innovation with social impact. Innovation : Philcoin leverages blockchain to power its PHILApp, a dApp that integrates education, communication, entertainment, and e-commerce. Originally built on the Binance Smart Chain, Philcoin has migrated to the Polygon network to improve sustainability and scalability while reducing transaction costs. Its give-to-earn model encourages users to engage with the app and donate 50% of their earnings to philanthropic causes before claiming rewards. By making philanthropy a fundamental part of its operation, Philcoin addresses financial inclusion and bridges the digital divide, setting an example of how blockchain can be used to build equitable economies. Societal Impact : By addressing digital access in underserved communities, Philcoin bridges the digital divide. Its ecosystem enables users to improve their skills, connect with others, and support global causes. To date, the platform has attracted over 200,000 users and facilitated significant charitable donations, showcasing its potential to combine technology with philanthropy. Alephium: Making Blockchain More Efficient Scalability and energy efficiency are two ongoing challenges for blockchain technology, and Alephium tackles both head-on. This Layer 1 blockchain employs advanced sharding technology to divide its network into smaller, more manageable pieces. Innovation : Alephium’s approach includes a “Proof of Less Work” consensus mechanism, which reduces energy consumption compared to traditional Proof of Work systems. This mechanism minimizes the environmental impact of mining while maintaining the security and decentralization critical to blockchain networks, making it a standout solution in a space often criticized for its environmental impact.

Its ability to balance scalability, security, and decentralization makes it an important player in blockchain’s evolution and demonstrates that foundational challenges can be overcome with well-designed systems. FedRok AG: Innovating the Carbon Credit Market Tackling the environmental challenges of today requires groundbreaking solutions, and FedRok AG is at the forefront of this effort. This Swiss blockchain company is reshaping the carbon credit market with its innovative “Proof of Green” consensus mechanism. Innovation : FedRok uses blockchain to improve transparency and trust in carbon credit trading, ensuring that each credit corresponds to a verifiable reduction in carbon emissions. Its proprietary “Proof of Green” model encourages miners on energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains, such as Bitcoin, to transition to renewable energy sources. By aligning mining rewards with sustainability practices, FedRok reduces the environmental impact of these blockchains. FedRok’s native coin, FDK, is directly tied to real-world carbon credits, promoting a standardized and interoperable global carbon credit market. Societal Impact : By addressing inefficiencies in the fragmented carbon credit market, FedRok promotes sustainable practices and transparency, helping to build trust among stakeholders. Its compliance with stringent Swiss regulations, including voluntary membership in organizations like VQF (Association for Quality Assurance in Financial Services), enhances its appeal to institutional investors and governments. Through this, FedRok lays the groundwork for scalable, environmentally impactful solutions​​. Helium: Connecting Communities Through Decentralization Access to reliable connectivity remains a challenge in many parts of the world, and Helium offers a fresh approach to solving it. The project creates a decentralized wireless network powered by community-operated hotspots. Innovation : Helium employs LoRaWAN technology to provide affordable connectivity for IoT devices. Individuals who set up hotspots earn Helium Network Tokens (HNT) as rewards, creating an incentivized model that promotes network growth without relying on traditional telecommunications infrastructure, making it cost-effective and scalable. Societal Impact : Helium’s decentralized network provides practical, low-cost connectivity solutions, particularly valuable for IoT devices in areas like smart agriculture, logistics, and environmental monitoring.

Conclusion These five blockchain projects—Aave, Philcoin, Alephium, FedRok AG, and Helium—show just how far blockchain technology has come in solving real-world problems. From building a global economy of giving to promoting greener practices, creating smarter financial tools, and expanding connectivity, each project brings tangible solutions to the table. As we move into 2025, it’s exciting to see how blockchain is growing beyond its early days and finding new ways to help people and industries. The projects highlighted here are just a glimpse of what’s possible when technology is used to create practical, meaningful solutions. They remind us that blockchain isn’t just about innovation, it’s about making life better, more connected, and more sustainable for everyone.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MATIC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/5-blockchain-innovations-transforming-the-world-in-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

With the stablecoin market seeing significant developments both in new projects and regulation, Tether’s move to invest in StablR is a notable milestone. Tether announced the investment on December 17. USDT issuer invests in StabIR According to the company, whose Tether (USDT) is the world’s largest US dollar-pegged stablecoin with over $140 billion in market cap, the investment reinforces the commitment to bring the regulated crypto assets to the European market. A number of exchanges have recently confirmed plans to delist non-compliant stablecoins as the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) come into effect. Tether itself said it was halting support for the Euro-pegged stablecoin EURT due to MiCA. EU’s MiCA regulations take full effect on December 30, 2024. Investment in StabIR also comes as Europe welcomes several regulated stablecoin launches. This includes StablR’s euro-pegged EURR and USD-pegged USDR. In November this year, Tether announced an upcoming investment in Quantoz, the company that recently unveiled EURQ and USDQ. With this investment, Tether is eyeing the growing EUR-pegged stablecoin market, which currently stands at $400 million. “The European stablecoin market is rapidly evolving and it’s poised for significant further growth in line with broader trends. Tether is proud to support initiatives like StablR that align with our vision for fostering compliance, innovation, and accessibility in the European stablecoin market,” Paolo Ardiono, Tether’s chief executive officer, said. Growth for the USDT issuer has also included the launch of Hadron by Tether, an asset tokenization platform. Users can leverage the solution to simplify their digital tokens issuance processes. Ardoino says its launch brings several benefits to users. “This investment demonstrates our support for the European digital asset ecosystem. The deployment of Hadron by Tether, our asset tokenization platform that simplifies the process of converting various assets into digital tokens, is a significant step towards an economy with unprecedented benefits, flexibility, and transparency,” the Tether CEO added. StablR will tap into Hadron by Tether for the tokenization of stablecoins, stocks, bonds and commodities. Its partnership with the USDT issuer follows key other milestones in recent months, including securing an Electronic Money Institution license from Malta Financial Services Authority in July. The EMI license allows StabIR to offer MiCA-compliant stablecoins – EURR and USDR. The two tokens are ERC-20 and Solana-compatible.

The blockchain firm announced the stablecoin will debut today, and anticipation surrounding the event appears to increase XRP’s market activity. According to data cited by crypto market analyst, Ali Martinez, XRP whales have added over 830 million coins in the last 24 hours alone. Whale interest has intensified in recent days, signaling confidence in the asset as Ripple pushes forward with its stablecoin initiative. Whales have purchased over 830 million $XRP in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/KzNds2CVdf — Ali (@ali_charts) December 16, 2024 Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed RLUSD will be available today on platforms such as Uphold, MoonPay, and Bitso, with additional support expected on Bitstamp and Zerohash. Positive signals emerge amid heightened whale activity Data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment highlights strong whale activity involving Ripple’s native coin over the past few weeks. Notably, large holders began accumulating the asset during a market dip in early December, contributing to XRP’s price rise from $0.60 to $0.80. While the coin’s price rally has garnered attention, some investors appear to be cashing in on the gains. On-chain tracker Whale Alert recently flagged a transaction involving 69.3 million XRP (valued at $175.87 million) moved to Binance by a wallet identified as “rEbXa….poLBo.” Such activity suggests that certain holders may be preparing to book profits following the price surge. CryptoQuant, another analytics platform, observed that spikes in large XRP transactions to exchanges often coincide with price peaks. These trends indicate that while whales are accumulating, some are also positioning themselves for potential profit-taking as market activity heats up. RLUSD launch could positively affect XRP Ripple’s highly anticipated USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, is set to launch globally today following Monday’s official announcement. The rollout follows Ripple’s December 10 approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which greenlit the stablecoin after initial speculation of a December 4 launch. The coin has surged over 13% in the last day, trading at $2.67, as its 24-hour trading volume soared by 156% to $17.4 billion. According to recent updates from Coinmarketcap, the cryptocurrency has achieved a remarkable year-to-date gain of over 300%. Data from CoinGlass revealed a nearly 21% increase in XRP Futures Open Interest, signaling strong market confidence. Other crypto analysts have also shared bullish outlooks for the token, forecasting rallies of up to $9. Maintaining support above $2.52 could be critical for XRP, with its next target at $2.72, and subsequent milestones at $5.85 and $8.76. Technical analysis indicates XRP’s bullish momentum Other analysts have pitched in on X, including Natalie Dormer, who noted the formation of a bullish flag pattern on the XRP/USDT 4-hour chart.

Knafo urged European nations to follow El Salvador’s example and build their own Bitcoin reserves to strengthen their economies during uncertain times. Knafo emphasized Bitcoin’s key benefits, including its decentralized system , fixed supply, and rising adoption worldwide. She described Bitcoin as a secure asset that governments could use to safeguard their economies and protect citizens from financial instability. Referring to El Salvador, Knafo highlighted its bold move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender three years ago, despite global criticism. “El Salvador’s decision has already paid off,” she stated, noting that the country has seen its Bitcoin investment double. “Hundreds of millions of dollars are now available for their citizens, improving both sovereignty and security,” she added. Knafo didn’t hold back in her critique of the EU’s financial policies. She accused European leaders of poor financial management, creating enormous deficits, and pushing inflationary measures that harm everyday people. “The time has come to shield citizens from inflation and bad decisions made by governments,” she stressed, calling for a fundamental shift in how Europe handles its finances. She also raised serious concerns about the ECB’s digital euro plans. Knafo warned that such a system could give bureaucrats too much control, allowing them to restrict or block individual transactions with the click of a button. “This would open the door to totalitarianism,” she declared, underlining the need to protect financial freedom and individual rights. To address these challenges, Knafo proposed a clear path forward. She called on European countries to adopt Bitcoin, invest in the mining sector, and provide legal protection for cryptocurrency users by avoiding excessive taxation. “We must embrace freedom, face challenges without fear, and remain true to the values that define our civilization,” she concluded. Knafo’s speech highlighted a growing debate in Europe over the role of digital currencies. While the EU pushes for centralized solutions like the digital euro, advocates like Knafo argue for decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin , which they see as tools for financial independence and security. By pointing to El Salvador’s success, she aimed to show that embracing Bitcoin could offer Europe a viable and innovative solution to its economic challenges. With mounting concerns over inflation, rising deficits, and state control, Knafo’s message resonated with those seeking greater financial autonomy. Her vision is bold: a Europe that moves away from outdated systems and instead adopts innovative, decentralized technologies that empower individuals.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/eu-mp-warns-against-digital-euro-urges-bitcoin-adoption,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37760139.jpeg

The Solana-based token has a total supply of 88.88 billion and has racked up around $90 million in trading volume in the first hour since release, CoinMarketCap shows.  23.5% of PENGU's supply was allocated to the airdrop while a further 22% has been set aside from Solana and Ethereum communities. An additional 12.3% of supply will also be used as liquidity on decentralized exchanges.  The floor price of the Pudgy Penguin NFTs has risen alongside the release of PENGU, with the cheapest NFT now trading at 34.1 ETH ($136,000) to mark a 2.6% increase. It is now the second most expensive collection after CryptoPunks.  It has outperformed the wider NFT market which remains in a multi-year slump following the emergence of meme coins this cycle. NFTs were the plat du jour in 2022 amongst the more speculative crypto investors, but as hype and liquidity withered away so did asset prices.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

Ondo (ONDO) is showing strong upward momentum, currently trading between $1.53 and $2.32. Over the past month, its price soared by over 130%. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is above the 100-day average, indicating a bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index is moderate, suggesting more room for growth. If ONDO breaks the nearest resistance at $2.59, it could climb to the next level at $3.38, which would be an impressive gain of around 45%. With the current market optimism, ONDO might continue its ascent, especially as the altcoin season approaches. Optimism (OP) Set to Soar: Eyeing Breakout Beyond Key $3 Level Optimism (OP) has surged over 57% in the past month. Despite a slight dip of around 6% last week, it’s trading between $2.14 and $2.81, showing strong momentum. If OP breaks above the nearby resistance at $3.09, it could climb to the next target of $3.77. This jump would be more than a 30% increase from current prices. The coin’s average price over the past 10 and 100 days is steady at around $2.54, indicating stability. With positive trends and a potential altcoin season ahead, OP might be poised for significant growth.

The Relative Strength Index is at 41.17, and the stochastic oscillator is at 24.66, both nearing oversold territories, suggesting a potential upward move. Currently trading between $0.91 and $1.32, JUP faces its nearest resistance at $1.54. Breaking this could lead to the next target at $1.95, representing a possible increase of over 45%. With altcoin season on the horizon, JUP may be set to capitalize on the bullish momentum. NEAR Protocol Eyes $10 Breakout as Altcoin Season Ignites NEAR Protocol is trading between $5.91 and $7.81, showing strong consolidation. With a 1-month gain of 19.80% and a 6-month surge of 40.84%, the momentum is building. The RSI at 44.03 indicates potential for upward movement. Breaking through the nearest resistance at $8.78 could open the path to $10, marking an increase of over 25% from current levels. The SMAs converging around $6.80 suggest solid support. As altcoin season approaches and a global crypto bull run looms, NEAR Protocol could soar to new heights. Conclusion ONDO, OP, JUP, and NEAR may offer less short-term potential, but DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking the best, it embodies luxury and success. Expected 700% growth by presale’s end, with potential thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK and WIF, DOGEN builds a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

37761769,https://invezz.com/?p=2391538,1734445798,Brazil’s Nubank invests $150 million in Tyme Group to expand digital banking offerings,"Brazilian digital bank Nubank (NU.N) announced on Monday a $150 million investment in Tyme Group, an innovative and quickly growing digital financial institution headquartered in Singapore. This strategic initiative represents a significant step forward in Nubank’s ambitions to expand its worldwide reach and diversify its digital banking services in a growing, competitive, and linked market. Tyme Group has not only received significant backing from one of Asia’s largest tech firms, Tencent (0700.HK), but it has also amassed an impressive customer base of approximately 15 million people in South Africa and the Philippines, demonstrating its ability to resonate with a broad audience in diverse geographical regions. Tyme group reached unicorn status Tyme Group has officially celebrated its designation as a unicorn, a significant achievement that recognizes firms with valuations greater than $1 billion. This achievement was aided by the company’s recent finance efforts, which resulted in a significant $250 million in Series D financing. This latest round of funding aided Tyme Group’s valuation to reach an astonishing $1.5 billion. The investment round included significant contributions from various investors, including the M&G Catalyst Fund, which committed $50 million on its own, and contributions from existing owners, which effectively added another $50 million to the total raised. Karl Westvig, CEO of TymeBank in South Africa, expressed his excitement about the determination and drive that this funding will unleash, stating to Reuters, “This funding will propel our growth strategy, enabling us to realize our stated goal of being a top three retail bank in South Africa within the next three years.” Such financial backing is expected to dramatically boost Tyme Group’s resources, preparing the company for extensive expansion into new regions while also strengthening its trust with consumers and investors. Pathway to potential listing by 2028 Tyme Group is now pursuing an ambitious expansion strategy, including the possibility of going public by 2028, as a result of the restored confidence brought about by this investment. Westvig stated that the cooperation with Nubank, combined with collaborations with notable worldwide investors such as GIC and Berkshire Hathaway, will significantly increase Tyme Group’s visibility in the market. “The enhanced credibility and market visibility that comes with these affiliations help pave the group’s path towards a potential listing by 2028,” he argued in a recent interview with Reuters. After establishing a formidable presence in South Africa with TymeBank, a digital banking initiative launched in 2019, the company has successfully expanded its operations into the Philippines with the innovative GoTyme platform, demonstrating its ability to navigate and penetrate diverse markets across continents. Strategic expansion to Southeast Asia Tyme Group is now in a strong position to support its much-anticipated expansion aspirations in Southeast Asia. The company is currently focusing on expanding its activities, particularly in Vietnam and Indonesia. Tyme Group plans to deliver core transaction banking products in Vietnam by 2025, where it is currently focused on merchant financing. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, Westvig has expressed plans to develop a merchant cash advance business while also pursuing a banking license, thereby cementing its position in this burgeoning region. Tyme Group’s diversification of offers is more than just a commercial strategy; it reflects the changing landscape of digital banking, where consumer expectations are increasingly focused on seamless ease, accessibility, and access to new financial solutions. Westvig noted that the company’s ultimate purpose is deeply based on growth: “We are determined to enhance our product offerings and provide more robust financial services to our customers in existing and new markets.” Innovations in South Africa and the long-term crypto vision As part of its informed and forward-thinking approach to its ongoing strategy in South Africa, Tyme is preparing to relaunch its credit card services on a much greater scale in the coming year. Beyond typical banking products, Tyme is looking at the intriguing prospects of incorporating cryptocurrency into its service range. Westvig stated that, while they are carefully studying long-term crypto strategy, significant decisions would need to be made regarding whether Tyme Group will support crypto transactions directly or make efforts to develop their cryptocurrency exchange. This forward-thinking push into creative and flexible banking solutions demonstrates Tyme Group’s amazing potential to fundamentally alter the digital banking experience—not just in Africa and Southeast Asia, but globally. As Nubank strengthens its international partnerships and strategic investments, the implications for the digital banking sector are set to be profound, setting a new and ambitious standard for how emerging markets will interact with and integrate financial technology in the coming years. By doing so, Nubank and Tyme Group not only pave the road for financial success but also contribute to the industry’s overall progress in a way that promotes inclusion and accessibility for all.

37759827,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375030,1734445409,Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Maintaining $100K Suggests Going After $110K and $120K Next,"Bitcoin has been trading above $100K over the past couple of days and is currently climbing toward the $110K mark. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset has been making higher highs and lows over the past few weeks, even after the uptrend slowed following the breakout above the $90K level. Meanwhile, the market failed to break above the $100K level on the first few attempts but finally succeeded a few days ago. At the moment, the $110K and $120K levels are likely targets for Bitcoin, as the $100K level has now turned into a support zone. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart, however, shows a worrying signal. The market has yet to break above the ascending channel, which can be a reversal pattern if broken to the downside. The price is currently testing the higher boundary, and in case of a bearish rejection, the $100K support level will be the first likely destination. Yet, an aggressive surge toward higher prices could be expected if the market can break the pattern to the upside. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Exchange Reserve While Bitcoin’s price has been rallying over the past few weeks, making new all-time highs, investors have also been accumulating significantly. This in itself could be a primary reason behind the recent uptrend. The exchange reserve metric, which measures the amount of BTC held in exchange wallets, is demonstrated in this chart. It is quite a helpful metric, and many analysts use it as a proxy for supply. As the chart depicts, the exchange reserve metric has been dropping rapidly over the recent weeks, indicating a considerable decrease in supply. If this trend continues, Bitcoin will likely see higher prices in the coming months, as the supply and demand equation is clearly in favor of a price increase.

37759790,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394288,1734445266,Pudgy Penguins Surpass BTC as Anticipation Grows for Mythical Games Release,"The post Pudgy Penguins Surpass BTC as Anticipation Grows for Mythical Games Release appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News NFTs never cease to surprise, but few could have predicted that a series of waddling, wide-eyed jpegs would surpass Bitcoin in value. Yet here we are: the beloved Pudgy Penguins collection, whose floor price has recently soared past $100K, is now valued higher than a single BTC. It’s a development that attests to the patience of the iron-handed Pudgy community, who won’t have to wait long to enjoy their next milestone. The launch of Pudgy Party, the first web3 game featuring the franchise, is now just weeks away. With Mythical Games applying the finishing touches to the eagerly-anticipated title, rising demand for the Pudgy NFTs that began it all points to a bright future for both partners. Mythical Games doesn’t have its own 8,888 collection of colorful NFTs, of course, but it does have a native token – and it too is performing admirably well. How Crypto Came to Love Penguins Crypto loves dogs and cats – a quick glance at the top memecoins will tell you that. Which is why, when Pudgy Penguins made their debut in 2021, they were dismissed by most as yet another passing craze amidst NFT mania. Fast forward to today, and these colorful, charismatic digital birds have soared to heights that other NFT collections only dream of reaching. Even the lowest-priced Pudgy Penguins are now fetching more than one BTC on NFT markets. Who said that penguins can’t fly? This milestone is part of a wider comeback story for the NFT sector, which has seen renewed interest following a crypto market resurgence. Floor prices are picking up, rumors are swirling around what OpenSea intends to do next, and there’s a sense that, after lying dormant for much of the current bull market, NFTs are ready to break out. Pudgies, admittedly, have been bucking this trend, outperforming the rest of the NFT sector year after year. Mythical Penguins Meet Mythical Games The timing couldn’t be better for Pudgy Penguins fans, who have more than just record floor prices of 30 ETH to celebrate. Pudgy Penguins and Mythical Games are joining forces to release Pudgy Party, a web3 mobile game that leverages the playful charm of the Penguin brand. Mythical Games, known for creating NFL Rivals , as well as forthcoming soccer variant FIFA Rivals, is crafting an experience that looks like making Pudgy Party one of the most popular web3 mobile games to date. One of the less publicized beneficiaries of this partnership is Mythical Games’ native MYTH token, which underpins the ecosystem’s marketplace and in-game economy. While the Pudgy Penguins brand alone is a draw, the synergy with Mythical’s broader ecosystem is likely to spark interest in MYTH as an asset for facilitating transactions, minting new in-game assets, or offering community rewards. Should Pudgy Party attract a large player base, as seems likely, the MYTH token will see heightened trading volume as gamers look to buy and sell in-game items and use the asset to unlock new experiences within Mythical’s growing universe of games. But of course there’s another reason why MYTH has, like Pudgy Penguins, been performing so well lately: it’s seen by shrewd traders as a leveraged bet on web3 gaming. If the sector succeeds in onboarding hundreds of millions of players, as seems inevitable, the leading GameFi utility tokens will do very well. In this respect, MYTH appears undervalued based on its current market cap versus the robust trading volume it now commands. Where Next for Pudgies? The success of the Pudgy Penguins and the impending release of Pudgy Party mark another milestone in NFT history. What was once a cluster of cartoon penguins on the Ethereum blockchain is quickly evolving into a fully-fledged gaming ecosystem, complete with gameplay, collectibles, and token-driven economies. Having long transcended the role of facilitating digital art speculation, NFTs are now forging new forms of community-centric entertainment. With the Penguins’ star power on the rise and Mythical Games’ established reputation for quality development, there’s a real chance that Pudgy Party could break the mold of NFT gaming. In doing so, it will pave the way for other high-profile NFT collections to explore new frontiers in interactive media. Whether you’re a hardcore Pudgy holder, a casual gamer curious to play the new mobile title, or simply watching from the sidelines, there’s no denying the excitement in the air – and the sense that these lovable little penguins are only just getting started. Like the web3 studio they’ve partnered with, Mythical Games, there’s compelling evidence that the best is yet to come.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/pudgy-penguins-surpass-btc-as-anticipation-grows-for-mythical-games-release/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37761591,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105463,1734445157,"XRP Critic Peter Brandt Predicts XRP to $4.6, Citing Half-Mast Flag Pattern","Veteran trader and XRP critic Peter Brandt is expecting an XRP upsurge to a new all-time high, citing a half-mast flag pattern on the daily charts. Peter Brandt, a long-time XRP critic, is now bullish. Following XRP's strong rally in November, Brandt suggests the asset is forming a half-mast flag pattern. This continuation structure points to a potential price surge, with Brandt forecasting a move toward $4.6. XRP Forms a Half-Mast Flag PatternIn his recent analysis , Brandt discussed the half-mast flag structure on XRP's daily chart. Notably, this pattern occurred during XRP's strong uptrend from late November.Particularly, following a six-day consolidation that began on Nov. 23, XRP eventually staged a breakout on Nov. 27, rallying from the $1.5 level to a new seven-year peak of $2.9 by Dec. 3. This impressive upsurge created the flagpole. Following this move, XRP entered a brief consolidation phase in December as it faced resistance at the $2.9 level. Price action formed a descending channel, which featured lower highs and lower lows and formed the flag. Notably, this flag represents a period where traders pause to assess the market direction. XRP Half Mast Flag Pattern Peter Brandt Interestingly, XRP broke out above the upper boundary of the flag on Dec. 14 after it closed the day around the $2.4 level. This breakout signals the potential continuation of the original uptrend. Since then, the asset has stayed above the boundary, looking to establish it as support.According to Brandt, the half-mast flag pattern predicts that the next upward move will mirror the height of the flagpole. Notably, the flagpole height, measured from the rally's starting point at $1.50 to its peak of $2.9 represents a 93% upsurge.This rate becomes the basis for XRP's next move. For context, XRP's breakout occurred around the $2.4 region on Dec. 14. If the altcoin replicates the 93% rally from the $2.4 level, this will lead to a price of $4.63 for XRP, marking a new all-time high. What's Next for XRP?However, for XRP to achieve this bullish target, it must maintain the breakout above $2.4. This level, which previously acted as resistance, now serves as a major support zone. A retest of this level without falling back inside the flag would confirm the breakout's strength. If momentum continues, XRP's next resistance lies around $2.9, the previous high from the November rally. Clearing this level would open the door for a surge to $4.63. However, a failed breakout, where XRP drops back below $2.4, could invalidate the flag pattern and delay further upside. Interestingly, another analyst CryptoInsightUK recently suggested that XRP could trade at $5 by Christmas day. Analyst Ali Martinez also insists a rally above $4 is a certainty. XRP currently changes hands at $2.66, up 11.59% in the past 24 hours amid the launch of Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/17/xrp-critic-peter-brandt-predicts-xrp-to-4-6-citing-half-mast-flag-pattern/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-critic-peter-brandt-predicts-xrp-to-4-6-citing-half-mast-flag-pattern,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37759877,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628916,1734445054,Lido commences closing down Polygon PoS chain staking service,"Lido has officially begun the phase-out of its staking services on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain following a community-approved vote in November. The decision marks a significant shift in the protocol’s operations, which had previously allowed users to stake Polygon’s MATIC tokens in exchange for liquid staking tokens called static. Per a blog post from the defi platform, the service discontinuation began on Monday. Lido notified users that they have until June 16, 2025, to withdraw their funds. After this deadline, withdrawals will only be available through explorer tools, the protocol stated. Additionally, from January 15 to January 22, 2025, Lido’s operations on Polygon will be temporarily paused, meaning users will be unable to withdraw their staked assets during this window. Lido’s community support and governance decision Lido’s decision to phase out its services on the Polygon PoS network follows extensive discussions and a community vote within the Lido DAO. In the blog post, Lido Finance’s team explained that the move was prompted by the overwhelming support from LDO token holders, with 99% of voters favoring the proposal. The vote considered two key proposals: one to discontinue the Polygon staking service and another to reevaluate the economic model of the protocol’s middleware. The Lido on Polygon sunset process has begun. https://t.co/icgidJsbqF See below for an overview of upcoming timelines and requirements 📆📜 — Lido (@LidoFinance) December 16, 2024 The team mentioned that several factors led to Lido’s decision to wind down its Polygon staking offering. The announcement cited limited user adoption, insufficient rewards, and the resource-intensive nature of maintaining the service as significant challenges. The announcement also highlighted the changing dynamics of the ecosystem, noting that the demand for liquid staking solutions on the Polygon PoS network had diminished. This decline in demand ultimately affected Lido’s ability to position itself as a foundational defi building block on the network. The blog post further pointed to the development of alternative liquid staking solutions within the Polygon ecosystem as a contributing factor to the decision. These alternative solutions, coupled with the smaller-than-expected growth of the Polygon PoS ecosystem, reduced the viability of Lido’s service on the chain. Focus shifting to Ethereum and defi trends The development team acknowledged that Lido’s focus has increasingly shifted toward Ethereum. The DAO recently approved a new initiative to launch a “community staking module” designed to make Ethereum solo staking more accessible. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance the inclusivity of Ethereum’s staking ecosystem and better meet the demands of Lido’s user base. Lido’s exit from Polygon is not the first instance of the protocol retreating from a blockchain. In 2023, LDO’s DAO approved the discontinuation of its Solana staking service after the protocol experienced losses of $484,000, which significantly outweighed its $220,000 in revenue from the Solana network. The decision to exit Solana reflected similar challenges in user adoption and resource allocation, as well as the evolving dynamics of the blockchain and defi space. Aave, one of the largest lending protocols on Polygon, has also proposed ceasing operations on the network due to concerns over an upcoming review of the risk profile of bridged assets. On December 13, Aave founder Marc Zeller introduced the proposal, responding to Polygon’s governance request to use over $1 billion in stablecoin reserves to farm assets on other protocols. The proposal highlighted unease among defi projects about the evolving governance and risk factors within the Polygon ecosystem. At press time, LDO remains the largest liquid staking protocol for Ethereum, with approximately $39.7 billion in TVL, per DefiLlama data . The protocol continues to dominate the Ethereum liquid staking market ahead of the likes of Ether.fi and Rocketpool.

Salovaara, who helped raise token sales for major names in the industry, believes 2025 will be dominated by two major trends: Fair Token Offerings (FTOs) — A push for more reasonable valuations and more equitable access for everyday investors AI Tokens — A major leap forward where crypto meets advanced AI agents, opening fresh opportunities for projects and investors alike “2024 was phenomenal, with Bitcoin hitting $100,000 on December 4th—CoinMarketCap confirms this milestone,” says Salovaara. “Thousands of meme-coins also launched this year, many reaching secondary markets, as tracked by BDC Consulting. But 2025 is set to be even bigger. I predict Bitcoin will push towards $150k–$200k, and meme-coins will hopefully adopt stricter compliance. Even more exciting is how AI is finally converging with crypto, spawning a new generation of AI-driven utility tokens.” 1. Fair Token Offerings (FTOs): Leveling the Playing Field While Bitcoin’s and meme-coin’s rise dominated headlines in 2024, these trends also highlighted how rampant scams and rug-pulls remain. Meme-coins in particular saw thousands of launches, not all created equal. Private insiders often orchestrated low-float, high-valuation tactics—leaving retail investors at a disadvantage. To counter these, TokenBuilder has pioneered an FTO Rating system, providing a transparent scoring framework for new token offerings. This rating focuses on five pillars: Access: Retail investor inclusion in private rounds Appreciation: Fair token valuations with upside potential Supply: At least 20% circulating supply after token launch to avoid price manipulation Liquidity: Early secondary market trading plans (DEX or otherwise) Transparency: Public, identifiable teams rather than anonymous founders “We want to end the days of anonymous projects,” Salovaara says. “A legitimate project should be proud of its team, structure, and open to scrutiny.” FTOcalendar.com is TokenBuilder’s curated platform listing upcoming offerings. Each token must achieve at least one star on the FTO Rating scale to even be considered—raising the bar for fairness in Web3 fundraising. Although the five-pillar overview remains the core, TokenBuilder continues refining the FTO Rating for greater sophistication. 2. AI Tokens: The Next Billion-Dollar Crypto Sector According to Salovaara, For most of 2024, AI was overshadowed by surging meme-coins and the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin ETFs. Yet behind the scenes, developers have been blending language models (OpenAI, Grog, Llama) with crypto utility. In practice, these AI tokens will: Use AI-agent frameworks (like AI16Z’s “Eliza”) to enable advanced, automated services Offer exclusive data and analytics functionalities Function as native payment methods for discounted or premium AI services “We see AI tokens as the next wave of utility tokens—where owning them isn’t just about price speculation, but unlocking actual AI-based features,” Salovaara explains. “Expect many new AI-token launches by mid-2025, each aiming to monetize everything from data analytics to real-time predictions. We will launch our first version of ‘Eliza’ in January–February 2025.” 3. TokenBuilder’s Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond Building on a decade of crypto experience, TokenBuilder is developing a Fair Token Offering launchpad focused on AI-driven tokens.

37759988,https://blockworks.co/news/hyperliquid-most-valuable-airdrop,1734444795,Hyperliquid could have the most valuable airdrop ever,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . No question that HYPE is now technically the largest airdrop in crypto history, at least in terms of paper value. Hyperliquid’s new coin could soon also be the most valuable airdropped token to date. The team behind the popular perps-DEX-slash-layer-1 initially designated 310 million tokens for the airdrop, with more than 94,000 addresses eligible. So far, about 270.94 million HYPE has been claimed, per this dashboard from ASXN, equivalent to ~87% of the total. At current prices, the HYPE sent out would fetch almost $7.6 billion altogether. That officially beats Uniswap’s UNI distribution from September 2020, which until now was generally considered crypto’s biggest airdrop. At UNI’s peak in May 2021, the paper value of the airdrop surpassed $6.4 billion, more than a billion less than the current value of HYPE’s. UNI’s airdrop was still larger in scope. Tokens were initially sent to more than a quarter of a million addresses that had, at some point, used the DEX. Almost 94% of those addresses netted under 412 tokens, which was only slightly above the minimum allotment of 400 UNI (now worth $6,500). According to a Dune analysis , more than 250 addresses — liquidity whales, $SOCKS holders and power users — had meanwhile received an eye-twitching 250,000 UNI ($4 million at current prices). Two years later, 93% of recipients had dumped all their tokens. At that point, only 2% were still holding and only 1% had increased their position. It’s been less than three weeks since the HYPE airdrop, so it’s too early to say whether its token generation event will be any stickier. HYPE has, however, only gone up since, tripling from $3.81 to $28 as of this morning. That gives HYPE a market cap of $9 billion — only 9% short of UNI — and a fully diluted value of $27 billion. Unlike the UNI airdrop, almost 12% of HYPE recipients received between 5,000 and 10,000 tokens, now worth $140,000 and $280,000, respectively. 4.3% were in the top bracket, which received 10,000 tokens or more, while 57% found themselves in the lowest tranche of up to 100 HYPE ($2,800). Still, as Hyperliquid’s TVL grows beyond $3.2 billion (now eighth behind Arbitrum and ahead of Sui), some airdrop recipients do appear to have sold their stash. Earlier today, 182 of the top 500 addresses to receive the airdrop no longer held any tokens at all, according to ASXN data. That includes addresses that netted between 1.95 million ($44.6 million) and just under 100,000 HYPE ($2.8 million). Dozens of others are now holding up to 75% fewer tokens, although it’s unclear whether they’ve actually sold, as they may have simply moved their tokens to another address, or otherwise deposited them to a supporting exchange. At the same time, 58 of the top 500 (around 11%) have added to their holdings since the airdrop. Something tells me many more — especially those who didn’t receive the airdrop — are now waiting for a dip. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

37759502,https://finbold.com/?p=220232,1734444737,"The Bitcoin ‘train still has room to run’ after the $107,000 record high","With Bitcoin ( BTC ) surging to a new record high of above $107,000, momentum indicators suggest that the asset’s current run is far from over. Specifically, the maiden cryptocurrency’s Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) has yet to reach the 90 mark—a level achieved during the past two bull cycles , according to an analysis by financial data platform Barchart in an X post on December 17. Indeed, Bitcoin’s cycle tops in 2017 and 2021 coincided with the monthly RSI surpassing 90 and currently reads 77.19, far below previous overbought levels. “Bitcoin’s Cycle Tops in 2017 and 2021 occurred with a Monthly RSI reading above 90. It’s currently only at 77. This train still has room to run,” the platform noted. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Barchart. The RSI indicator measures the speed and magnitude of price changes. Readings above 70 typically indicate overbought conditions, but previous Bitcoin bull cycles show that the market can stay overbought for extended periods while prices continue to surge. Bitcoin’s room for further growth Regarding the possibility of continued price growth, whale transaction data could offer notable insights into what to expect. According to prominent on-chain crypto analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on December 17, wallets between 100 and 1,000 BTC have accumulated over 70,000 BTC in the past 48 hours. This accumulation represents a staggering $7.28 billion in Bitcoin. Bitcoin whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts The sentiment suggests that the market remains optimistic as such transactions often trigger further price growth. In this scenario, with whales acting as catalysts, retail investors might also capitalize on the momentum. Adding further optimism to the possibility of Bitcoin surging past its record $107,000 is its historical performance in the year following the U.S. elections , which often aligns with its four-year halving cycle. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TrendSpider For instance, following the 2012 election, Bitcoin climbed from $15 to over $1,000 in 2013. Following 2016, it peaked at nearly $18,000 in 2017. Post-2020, the asset hit an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. After the November 2024 elections, Bitcoin’s momentum was inspired by Donald Trump’s election , who is widely expected to spearhead the implementation of crypto-friendly policies. Additionally, several entities believe Bitcoin will likely double in value next year. As reported by Finbold, Standard Chartered projects the asset’s current cycle will peak next year, potentially reaching $200,000. According to the banking giant, institutional investors will be central to this rally. At the same time, investment firm VanEck projected that the current run will extend into 2025, peaking in Q1, with Bitcoin likely reaching $180,000. However, not everyone is fully bullish on Bitcoin. As per a Finbold report , a trading expert warned investors to prepare for an exit, noting that the asset might be nearing its top and that the current momentum may not last long. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $107,133, an increase of 3.5% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the maiden cryptocurrency had made gains of over 5%.

37759501,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/tokenbuilder-releases-2025-forecast-on-ai-integration-and-fair-token-offerings,1734444648,TokenBuilder Releases 2025 Forecast on AI Integration and Fair Token Offerings,"Tortola, British Virgin Islands, December 17th, 2024, Chainwire According to the prediction of Ransu Salovaara, CEO of TokenBuilder and a crypto veteran since 2014, the next twelve months will be pivotal in boosting transparency for token launches and integrating AI technology into new crypto projects. Salovaara, who helped raise token sales for major names in the industry, believes 2025 will be dominated by two major trends: Fair Token Offerings (FTOs) — A push for more reasonable valuations and more equitable access for everyday investors AI Tokens — A major leap forward where crypto meets advanced AI agents, opening fresh opportunities for projects and investors alike “2024 was phenomenal, with Bitcoin hitting $100,000 on December 4th—CoinMarketCap confirms this milestone,” says Salovaara. “Thousands of meme-coins also launched this year, many reaching secondary markets, as tracked by BDC Consulting. But 2025 is set to be even bigger. I predict Bitcoin will push towards $150k–$200k, and meme-coins will hopefully adopt stricter compliance. Even more exciting is how AI is finally converging with crypto, spawning a new generation of AI-driven utility tokens.” 1. Fair Token Offerings (FTOs): Leveling the Playing Field While Bitcoin’s and meme-coin's rise dominated headlines in 2024, these trends also highlighted how rampant scams and rug-pulls remain. Meme-coins in particular saw thousands of launches, not all created equal. Private insiders often orchestrated low-float, high-valuation tactics—leaving retail investors at a disadvantage. To counter these, TokenBuilder has pioneered an FTO Rating system, providing a transparent scoring framework for new token offerings. This rating focuses on five pillars: Access: Retail investor inclusion in private rounds Appreciation: Fair token valuations with upside potential Supply: At least 20% circulating supply after token launch to avoid price manipulation Liquidity: Early secondary market trading plans (DEX or otherwise) Transparency: Public, identifiable teams rather than anonymous founders “We want to end the days of anonymous projects,” Salovaara says. “A legitimate project should be proud of its team, structure, and open to scrutiny.” FTOcalendar.com is TokenBuilder’s curated platform listing upcoming offerings. Each token must achieve at least one star on the FTO Rating scale to even be considered—raising the bar for fairness in Web3 fundraising. Although the five-pillar overview remains the core, TokenBuilder continues refining the FTO Rating for greater sophistication. 2. AI Tokens: The Next Billion-Dollar Crypto Sector According to Salovaara, For most of 2024, AI was overshadowed by surging meme-coins and the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin ETFs. Yet behind the scenes, developers have been blending language models (OpenAI, Grog, Llama) with crypto utility. In practice, these AI tokens will: Use AI-agent frameworks (like AI16Z’s “Eliza”) to enable advanced, automated services Offer exclusive data and analytics functionalities Function as native payment methods for discounted or premium AI services “We see AI tokens as the next wave of utility tokens—where owning them isn’t just about price speculation, but unlocking actual AI-based features,” Salovaara explains. “Expect many new AI-token launches by mid-2025, each aiming to monetize everything from data analytics to real-time predictions. We will launch our first version of ‘Eliza’ in January–February 2025.” 3. TokenBuilder’s Roadmap for 2025 and Beyond Building on a decade of crypto experience, TokenBuilder is developing a Fair Token Offering launchpad focused on AI-driven tokens. Using on-chain sales accessible to everyone, the platform plans to offer: $TBAI launch on Uniswap 2nd of January 2025 Multiple token offering methods: Fixed-price sales, Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) auctions, and more Multi-chain support: Ethereum, Base, and possibly other Ethereum Layer-2 networks AI-Powered Tools: AI-powered tokenomics analysis, compliance tracking, and advanced analytics Alongside the FTO Calendar and an “AI-Agent Army” for compliance and tokenization, TokenBuilder aims to streamline the entire process of launching new tokens in a fair, open, and transparent manner. “We believe the ‘AI-Agent Army’ will be central to many utility tokens from 2025 onward,” Salovaara adds. “Imagine an AI-powered framework that automates compliance checks, optimizes liquidity, and offers real-time market intelligence for both investors and founders. That’s the future we’re building.” Contacts TokenBuilder Platform: tokenbuilder.ai FTO Calendar: FTOcalendar.com Media Contact Ransu Salovaara, Founder & CEO Telegram: @ransu_salovaara Email: ransu@tokenbuilder.ai LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/ransu About TokenBuilder TokenBuilder is a Fair Token Offering launchpad and platform for Web3 projects.

37759500,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/ionet-enters-strategic-partnership-with-ai-agent-zerebro-to-boost-ethereum-validation,1734444639,io.net Enters Strategic Partnership With AI Agent Zerebro To Boost Ethereum Validation,"io.net enters a strategic partnership with AI agent provider Zerebro. Zerebro will leverage io.net’s GPU network to launch validator operations. The pivot aims to enhance security across the Ethereum blockchain. Decentralized GPU network service io.net announces a strategic collaboration with autonomous AI agent provider Zerebro to kickstart its Ethereum validation operations. The announcement marks the latest AI-based startup to join io.net’s network, with recent additions from Mira Network, CreatorBid and Chainbase. Announced Tuesday, the partnership will see Zerebro leverage io.net’s vast decentralized GPU network infrastructure to enhance its newly launched Ethereum validation operations. According to Zerebro’s team, the partnership marks a “significant milestone” in the integration of autonomous AI and blockchain technology. Echoing the stance of the Zerebro team, Tausif Ahmed, Chief Business Development Officer at io.net, said: “This collaboration between io.net and Zerebro marks an exciting step forward for autonomous agents and decentralized AI in general. Zerebro can build with io.net’s permissionless and globally distributed compute network, ensuring it has the ability to continuously sustain operations and to keep innovating.” In addition, Zerebro users will also have access to the decentralized compute services offered on io.net, ensuring the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of its Ethereum validation activities. By tapping into the “Internet of GPUs”, users will have access to vast compute services on demand for their validation and further enhance the exploration of novel AI applications such as decentralized economic models and governance systems. The partnership also enables Zerebro to maintain its goal to provide a fully decentralized ecosystem, as Zerebro Co-Founder Agustin Cortes explained. By leveraging the immense power of io.net’s decentralized compute network, the two companies will narrow the gap between AI, crypto and blockchain technology. “By building on io.net’s decentralized compute network, we are able to innovate while staying true to the crypto principles of decentralization,” Cortes added. “This collaboration will be the stepping stone for agents to have the autonomy to plug into web3 infrastructure. Decentralized compute will be the lifeblood of agents and we are excited to be tinkering at the cutting edge.” Apart from enhancing the Ethereum validation operations on Zerebro, io.net’s GPU resources aim to advance the development of AI models. Zerebro is a creative autonomous AI agent that dynamically engages with the digital world. It posts on social media platforms, executes blockchain transactions, generates original artwork, composes music, and refines its activities through continuous learning from past experiences. Additional GPU resources at a cost-friendly price will allow users to build more complex protocols and applications, championing innovation across the platform. “This collaboration provides a first glimpse of a future in which millions of AI agents leverage decentralized compute networks to power an array of on-chain tasks, extending the capabilities of what agents can do,” Ahmed stated. In addition, Zerebro will also enhance the diverse set of skills it offers, broadening the offerings to users with features such as digital art creation to community engagement. The partnership opens up a new feel to how blockchain technology can help advance AI and respective applications of AI, starting with autonomous AI agents. By harnessing io.net’s versatile GPU clusters, Zerebro can sustain its operations, generate revenue, and explore innovations such as developing large language models (LLMs) on decentralized computing networks. The partnership illustrates the value of decentralized networks in creating a sustainable future for autonomous AI agents. Lastly, the entry of Zerebro into Ethereum validation operations could redefine how AI can be useful in securing the second-largest crypto network. This partnership not only strengthens Zerebro’s capabilities but showcases the broader potential for web3 infrastructure to support AI agents, fostering a future that is autonomous, creative, and decentralized.

37762391,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320222,1734444564,Germany’s Former Finance Minister Slams Government For Ignoring Bitcoin’s Potential,"In his speech in the Bundestag on Dec. 16, Christian Lindner, Germany’s former Finance Minister and leader of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), accused the German government and opposition of missing out on the economic opportunities offered by Bitcoin ( BTC ). Lindner specifically called out Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck, and the Leader of the Opposition Friedrich Merz for failing to engage with the growing role of cryptocurrencies in global finance. Lindner fordert kryptofreundliche Politik in Deutschland und spricht sich für die Chancen von Bitcoin aus. #BTC pic.twitter.com/gkRpXAJKp8 — Frank Schäffler (@f_schaeffler) December 16, 2024 US Embraces Bitcoin While Germany Falls Behind Lindner pointed to recent developments in the United States, where the government is introducing pro-crypto policies under the new Trump administration . “I haven’t heard anything from the Chancellor, the Economic Minister, or the Opposition Leader about the new crypto-friendly policies being launched in the US,” Lindner said in his speech. He argued that the US is capitalizing on the potential of cryptocurrencies. Germany could also benefit from it if only politicians would take it seriously. “I don’t hear anything about this in the central debates of the German Bundestag. What kind of negligence is this, and what opportunities are we missing?” Lindner added. US Plans Bitcoin Reserve, While Germany Misses Billions The incoming Trump administration is expected to introduce crypto-friendly policies. One of the key proposals is the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve , a move that could significantly boost the country’s role in the global crypto market. Lindner highlighted these developments, stressing that the US is positioning itself to lead in the crypto world while Germany is missing a key opportunity. Meanwhile, Germany made headlines in July for selling nearly 50,000 Bitcoins seized by the public prosecutor’s office in Saxony, a federal state in Germany. At the time of the sale, the price of Bitcoin was around $53,000 per coin – much lower than the current price of over $107,000 – meaning Saxony lost around $2.7 billion. X Users Send Mixed Reactions Lindner’s speech has sparked various reactions on X (formerly Twitter). While some applauded that Bitcoin is being discussed in the Bundestag, others criticized Lindner for not pushing for crypto policies during his time as Finance Minister. “Well, it seems rather hypocritical. Why now and not in the last 3 years?” one user commented . “But don’t worry, Bitcoin doesn’t need a single politician. And it will be a pleasure to watch when you realize that”. The other user added , “This is ridiculous. The Finance Minister had years to take advantage of Bitcoin’s opportunities. Now, to complain about it is more than silly.” Political Crisis in Germany Christian Lindner was the Finance Minister from December 2021 to November 2024. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed the Finance Minister, saying it “was necessary to prevent harm to our country.” The firing came after days of political negotiation between the key members of Germany’s ruling “traffic light” coalition government – Scholz of the Social Democratic Party, Lindner of the Free Democratic Party, and Robert Habeck of the Green Party. On Dec. 16, Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence in the German parliament. In the Bundestag, 394 members voted no, 207 voted yes, and 116 abstained. Following the collapse of Olaf Scholz’s coalition, new elections will be held on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than planned. FDP Pushes for Bitcoin Reserves at the ECB and Bundesbank In his X post from Dec. 13, Lindner’s FDP colleague, Frank Schäffler, called for the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bundesbank to hold Bitcoin as part of their official reserves, alongside traditional assets like gold. Bundesbank und EZB sollten Bitcoin in ihre Währungsreserven aufnehmen. — Frank Schäffler (@f_schaeffler) December 13, 2024 Overall, Germany’s liberal FDP, one of three parties in the governing coalition Scholz led since December 2021, sees cryptocurrencies as a key driver of innovation in capital markets and fintech over the coming 10 years and champions a proactive, innovation-friendly approach to blockchain and digital assets. The party also supports developing and establishing a digital euro , which is essential for maintaining the European Union’s competitiveness in the digital age. The FDP wrote in its program for the 2024 European elections: “Cash is freedom. That is why we are committed to the unrestricted preservation of cash as a means of payment in the European Union and reject uniform cash ceilings. We constructively support the introduction of a digital euro as a supplement to the existing cash.” At the same time, the FDP wants citizens’ privacy to be fully protected. “There must be no compulsion to use the digital euro and no additional risks for the financial system,” said the party, adding that they want to make the European common market “attractive for cryptocurrencies and positively support their development.” The post Germany’s Former Finance Minister Slams Government For Ignoring Bitcoin’s Potential appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/germany-ex-finance-minister-criticizes-government-for-overlooking-bitcoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37762391.jpeg

But some memes go beyond that, and they narrate a story. Yes, the chicken-themed memecoin, HEADER, is known for its extreme potential to yield gains; at the same time, the memes convey a tale. The memes created by the HEADER community mix a sense of creativity and chronicle of the token. Mosty is featured in the Hyundai, Honda, and HP brands. All these brands have just one thing in common. It’s the name that starts with the letter H. It is an intriguing fact and a mystery to unwind. Explore the HEADER’s initiatives in this article. How The HEADER Got Its Inspiration? From DOGE, the recent viral meme coin PNUT, every token has its own story and inspiration. Similarly, the HEADER token got its story from the political talks that happened between Musk and Trump at Mar-a-Lago. On the political side, the conversation holds a significant value. But, the meme coin community has made up a story to mock at the incident. It was said that during the dinner, Trump argued his chicken parm is “the best in the world,” while Elon suggested genetically engineered chickens for Mars. This dialogue formed the foundation of the HEADER token. Owing to the origin story of the chicken-themed token, some experts believe when Trump reclaims the Whitehouse and takes over the office, this token could skyrocket by 1000%. It could be a lucrative opportunity for traders and meme coin fans to make using the speculative nature. The Spreading Conversations About Partnership The HEADER token thrives on user-generated content, with memes playing a central role in shaping its narrative. These memes, widely shared across social media and community forums, are sparking curiosity and debates, adding an unexpected twist to the project’s story. Interestingly, many memes focus on companies whose names start with the letter H, such as Hyundai, Honda, and HP. This recurring theme has fueled speculation about a possible collaboration between HEADER and these H-brands. Despite the buzz, no official confirmation or announcement has been made by the HEADER development team. Whether this connection is pure coincidence or a deliberate move remains a mystery, but the conversation continues to build excitement and intrigue around HEADER’s journey. Reason Behind the Silence of HEADER Team Despite ongoing debates and speculation, the HEADER team’s silence remains a mystery. Memes, often fun and lighthearted, tend to tell a story—but in the case of the HEADER token, these memes carry a deeper narrative. The community eagerly engages to decode hidden messages, adding intrigue and excitement to the project. Some believe this is a strategic media stunt to keep the community active, while others anticipate an official announcement in the near future. Regardless of the speculation, experts predict that this chicken-themed memecoin is poised for explosive growth, with potential gains of up to 1000% in the coming days. As curiosity builds, HEADER’s story continues to captivate and energize its growing community. What Will Happen If The Partnership Happened? If the HEADER team were to collaborate with the prominent H-brands, it would mark a groundbreaking moment in memecoin history. Such a move could position HEADER as a pioneer, uniting top global brands and setting itself apart as a dominant force in the crypto space. This collaboration could redefine the memecoin market, which has so far been largely dominated by cat and dog-themed tokens. HEADER, with its unique chicken theme and subtle nods to brands like Hyundai, Honda, and HP, has the potential to become a trendsetter. A partnership of this scale would significantly boost trust and credibility, attracting both investors and the broader crypto community. It could also elevate the token’s value, making HEADER a highly sought-after asset. For traders, adding this token to their portfolios might prove to be a game-changing decision, with opportunities for tremendous profits on the horizon.

37760213,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52401,1734444401,"$272,300,000 In XRP Shorts Will Get Liquidated If XRP Hits $3","XRP is witnessing an extraordinary surge and could have huge implications for the market. After climbing over 14% in the past 24 hours, it trades at $2.71 at the time of press, edging closer to breaking $3 resistance. This surge has been fueled by heightened investor enthusiasm surrounding Ripple’s new RLUSD token launch. If XRP reaches $3, it will mark its highest price since 2018 and potentially trigger a significant short-squeeze event. According to data shared by Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal), a well-known crypto expert on X, over $272 million worth of XRP short positions are at risk of liquidation if the digital asset hits the $3 price point. The attached chart shows a cumulative short liquidation leverage build-up near this level, signaling a critical threshold for traders.

XRP SHORT SQUEEZE IS HERE pic.twitter.com/XiLJMgzbEH — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) December 17, 2024 At the time of Ash Crypto’s analysis, the digital asset traded at $2.677, and the climb has continued, as the community anticipates the launch of RLUSD . The stablecoin’s launch could flood the ecosystem with new investors, potentially driving XRP higher, and helping it cross the $3 threshold. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Short Squeeze A short squeeze occurs when traders who bet against an asset (by shorting it) are forced to buy back at higher prices to cover their positions, driving the price further. In XRP’s case, the sheer size of leveraged positions adds significant pressure to the market. Should the price surpass $3, this massive liquidation could amplify the asset’s upward trajectory. The sharp price rally is not only technical but also fundamentally driven. Ripple’s RLUSD token launch has reinvigorated interest in XRP, with investors interpreting the development as a positive indicator for the broader Ripple ecosystem. This increased optimism has contributed to the momentum, attracting institutional and retail investors. While the possibility of a short squeeze presents opportunities for XRP holders, it also introduces heightened risk for traders. High leverage is a double-edged sword—those on the losing side of such a market move will face significant losses. Will the Short Squeeze Benefit XRP Investors? The broader implications of this event could extend beyond XRP, influencing sentiment across the crypto market. A successful rally past $3 may signal renewed investor confidence in altcoins, particularly those linked to Ripple’s ecosystem. As RLUSD’s popularity and adoption grow over the next few days, it could accelerate XRP’s surge, driving it closer to its all-time high of $3.84. Experts have projected that XRP can surpass Ethereum in this cycle, and the groundwork for this might be laid over the next few days if it can surpass $3.

In an X post on Tuesday, December 17, the analyst asserted that the asset was heading toward the $4 price point, representing an over 50% increase from current prices of around $2.6.However, according to Martinez, there is one condition for this trajectory to be confirmed: XRP has to break the price resistance at $2.6.As highlighted in the four-hour candle chart shared by the analyst, the price level has served as a wall to XRP's price in the past week after it broke out a bull flag pattern it entered after surging to $2.9 on December 3.

According to a press release shared with CryptoPotato , Aurora Labs has launched TurboChain and TurboSwap in collaboration with the Near Protocol. TurboChain is the first AI meme coin blockchain and a virtual chain for TURBO, while TurboSwap offers decentralized trading with cross-chain liquidity for the ecosystem. Aurora Labs Unveils TurboChain and TurboSwap Per the announcement, TurboChain will offer its users scalability, customization, and unmatched speed. Built using Aurora’s advanced Virtual Chain technology, the network allows developers to create decentralized applications and enables cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum, Near Protocol, and other major chains. “By blending advanced technology with a thriving community-driven approach, TurboChain pushes the boundaries of blockchain innovation and exemplifies the future of AI-powered meme coins,” Aurora Labs stated. The launch of the TurboChain will enhance Turbo’s utility as the asset will become the network’s native token, powering all transactions and playing a central role in the ecosystem. The community-run meme coin, created from the ChatGPT prompt “create the next great meme coin, starting with a budget of just $69,” currently operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Noteworthily, TurboSwap will enable users to access liquidity from several networks, including Ethereum , Near, Bitcoin, Solana , Arbitrum, Base, and TurboChain. Alex Shevchenko, CEO of Aurora Labs, said: “TurboChain and TurboSwap show the power of Aurora Virtual Chains. They can turn ideas into scalable blockchain ecosystems. With the Turbo Token community, we’re setting a new standard for seamless blockchain innovation and interoperability.” Powering Communities to Use Aurora Cloud Aurora Labs intends to launch 1,000 interconnected blockchains in 2025, and TurboChain and TurboSwap represent the start of this plan. This plan aims to empower communities to use Aurora Cloud, which enables innovation at a low cost and with simplicity. Aurora Cloud allows innovators to deploy scalable virtual chains without any tech skills and at a very low cost compared to traditional financial systems. Aurora Labs says launching a blockchain on Aurora Cloud is as easy as launching a Shopify store.

With early funding, AADAO and Neutron aim to secure priority consideration in Confio’s future endeavors and encourage other stakeholders to follow suit. CosmWasm adoption and funding Confio has been working on CosmWasm since 2020, and so far, the smart contract framework has been adopted by nearly 100 blockchain networks. CosmWasm lets developers build decentralized applications ( dApps ) that interact across the Cosmos interchain. Over the last year, CosmWasm dApps generated more than $5.7 million in fees within the Cosmos ecosystem. Despite the broad adoption, the funding for CosmWasm has mostly come from the Interchain Foundation (ICF). However, following the recent ICF restructuring, Confio’s budget for 2025 has been significantly reduced, resulting in a lot of doubt in regard to the future of the platform. CosmWasm Coalition Atom and Neutron investments are part of the newly launched CosmWasm Coalition, which builds on previous support from the Cosmos Hub, including a $1.25 million allocation under Proposal #103 in March 2023. The coalition aims to raise the $2 million necessary to keep CosmWasm growing in 2025 and allow Confio to focus on security , performance optimization, feature development, source development kit (SDK) compatibility, and the overall developer experience. Relying on CosmWasm for permissioned smart contract capabilities, Cosmos Hub sees Confio’s framework as an essential component of its network. A number of consumer chains leveraging Cosmos Hub’s Interchain Security also depend on CosmWasm, meaning that fresh funds will affect an entire ecosystem.

Linea is a zero-knowledge rollup that came out in July 2023 and was built by Ethereum infrastructure giant Consensys. It is the seventh-largest rollup network, according to L2Beat, with $1 billion locked in its ecosystem.    ENS Labs said it picked Linea to build its network for two reasons. ""One is sort of values alignment,” said Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer of ENS. The other has to do with speed.    Rollups are a special type of blockchain where one can transact faster and at a lower cost. There are two kinds of rollups: optimistic and zero-knowledge. Optimistic rollups use optimistic proofs, which have a seven-day window to dispute transactions before they are finalized (proofs are assumed to be ""optimistic"" that no one will dispute their contents). Zero-knowledge rollups, by contrast, use zero-knowledge cryptography, seen by many as a superior technology, to secure proofs and finalize those proofs within minutes.    ENS has been described as ""the phone book for Web3,"" but a more precise analogy is the web's domain name service (DNS). The domain name ""CoinDesk.com"" is easier to remember and type than a numerical IP address. Similarly, ENS handles like parishilton.eth, which the namesake heiress acquired in 2021, are more relatable than the strings of letters and numbers that make up Ethereum wallet addresses.    For this service, ""we need fast finality,” Johnson said. That's because “you want to be able to update your ENS name and have the chain reflect it in the smallest interval possible. And to do that and have it remain decentralized and secure, we need fast finality, and optimistic roll-ups can't deliver that,"" Johnson said.    The news comes as other major crypto projects announce their intentions to roll out layer-2 networks, though unlike ENS, some of the biggest names in blockchain have tapped Optimism’s OP Stack to build out their networks.    ENS will be one of the first major projects to build out a layer-2 blockchain based on Linea's technology (Linea is also building a layer-2 network for blockchain wallet application Status.)    The team behind Linea said last month that it plans to issue a Linea token. Both Johnson and Nicolas Liochon, the founder of Linea, told CoinDesk that there are no concrete plans yet for how that token would be used in the Namechain ecosystem.    Liochon said having the Namechain team working on the Linea stack will help strengthen and decentralize the L2 protocol.    “We really want to have multiple organizations contributing to Linea, and we work on having more organizations too, as a way to make [the network] more secure,” he said. “So really, we want to have multiple teams so there's no centralization point.”  Read more: Ethereum's ENS Identity System Set to Launch Own Layer-2 Blockchain",POSITIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | OP | ENS,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/12/16/ethereum-s-ens-identity-system-picks-consensys-tech-for-its-layer-2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b34bf424620e3a99205fe8101506f06c75c671aa-1920x1296.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37759025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628830,1734443533,Cardano Foundation clarifies position on ecosystem’s governance controversies,"Cardano Foundation has responded to criticisms of its overt involvement in the Project Catalyst program, noting that it is acting in the network’s best interests. In a blog post, the non-profit organization explained its role within the Cardano Network. According to the Foundation, it has been actively involved in Project Catalyst since 2021 through participation in previous editions, including F4, F7, F8, F9, and F12. Thus, its participation in F13 should not be controversial, even if it commits more ADA to voting. The Foundation explained that it has highlighted several concerns with the Project Catalyst since it started participating in 2021, but not all of these concerns have been addressed. One of the major concerns it identified was that several high-quality proposals, particularly from new entrants, do not get enough ecosystem support. To address this concern, the Foundation decided to allocate 180 million ADA to vote on proposals in Project Catalyst F13 to support these high-quality proposals. It said : “With our vote, we wanted to double down on the topics of long-term sustainability, decentralization and governance for Cardano. These principles are exemplified by the projects we chose to support.” Project Catalyst is a decentralized public goods innovation fund on Cardano where the community can determine which solutions to prioritize based on the proposals from the participants. Proposals usually focus on challenges within the crypto community. Meanwhile, the Foundation further noted that the level of its influence in the program might be overrated. This is because 4.8 billion ADAs registered to vote in Project Catalyst, which means the Foundation only has about 3.75% of the registered stake. However, it acknowledged the low participation given that there are 35 billion ADA in circulation and observed that not even all the registered stakes will vote on every proposal. This low participation could end up giving its 3.75% voting power a much larger influence. The roots of the controversy Concerns about the Swiss-based Cardano Foundation started last week after a popular Cardano community member, BigPey, shared an anonymous whistleblower email about the foundation’s actions. In the email, the whistleblower alleged internal power struggles in an attempt to sabotage key ecosystem contributors, including the network founder Charles Hoskison and Input Output Global. They further accused the Foundation of not participating in decentralized governance initiatives, including CIP-1694 and the drafting of the Cardano Constitution. Beyond this, there were concerns about the Foundation’s transparency and accountability. While the Foundation has since debunked several of the claims, network founder Charles Hoskinson acknowledged some of the issues. In a post on X, he observed that the foundation’s decision-making process is not transparent and that it exists independently of the community. Board members are not elected or appointed by the community and no one has the power to question their decisions. Cardano Foundation promises more transparency Meanwhile, the Foundation’s official statement also made new commitments to the community. It has now pledged to be more transparent about its decision-making process and provide more information about how it will vote in the Project Catalyst programs and how much ADA it will allocate for voting. It said: “We commit to providing improved clarity and predictability regarding our voting in Project Catalyst, including how much ada we will vote with and our criteria.” The organization further promised to incorporate the community’s feedback into its process and encouraged other stakeholders to do the same. However, it noted that the Foundation is not a membership-based organization. Thus, there is no plan to allow the community to elect board members. On a positive note, Cardano’s internal drama did not affect the market sentiment, as the ADA token is up 2% in the last 24 hours. The token has maintained its value above $1 after seeing over 50% gains in the last 30 days.

One of the core contributors on OpenLedger believes the partnership with Ether FI will enhance the “trust and resilience” of the platform, making the platform “future-proof”. “Partnering with Ether.fi enables OpenLedger to elevate these principles by leveraging their restaking infrastructure,” the core contributor stated. “This collaboration reflects our shared vision of a decentralized ecosystem that is secure, scalable, and future-proof.” Notwithstanding, the partnership comes at a time when OpenLedger is preparing for the launch of its testnet and data intelligence layer, in its mission to democratize access to decentralized AI. The collaboration follows a strong adoption and investment year for OpenLedger. The decentralized AI company welcomed tens of partners during the year and recently completed an $8 million funding round led by Polychain Capital and Borderless. The funding highlights strong investor confidence in OpenLedger’s vision and further positions the company to support the development of adaptable AI models. Securing A Stronger Future For Decentralized AI The rise of artificial intelligence to the mainstream in the past few years has changed the world as we know it. Similarly, blockchains are increasingly adopting AI solutions to transform the AI landscape by distributing decision-making across networks rather than relying on centralized entities. OpenLedger is one of the pioneering firms in this space, offering industry-specific solutions for enterprises. The company creates scalable solutions for developers while ensuring data security and transparency. The partnership with Ether FI will see the company strengthen its offerings by leveraging its already-proven restaking infrastructure. It will gain a strong foundation to support the next phase of its development, enabling it to onboard developers seeking to create smarter AI models with verifiable data. As Ether.fi CEO and Co-Founder Mike Silagadze explains in his speech on the partnership: “Ether.fi is excited to shape the future of AI models and data infrastructure with OpenLedger. Through the utilization of our security and operators, we will work with OpenLedger to service the growing community of builders in need of specialized models and data for training, fine-tuning, and scaling their AI workflows.” In addition, the strategic collaboration will ensure secure processing for AI models and workflows, a critical requirement for developers and organizations in need of specialized solutions.

42416521,de3c3204-2523-4260-a8b9-54c84c4b18d5,1734443242,Bitcoin Holder Semler Scientific's Shares Now Available for Options Trading,"The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Semler Scientific (SMLR) and MicroStrategy (MSTR).   Shares of Semler Scientific (SMLR), the small-cap medical device maker that adopted a bitcoin treasury strategy earlier this year, are now available for options trading.   This comes after six months of share-price growth for the company driven by its bitcoin (BTC) pivot and capital-raising initiatives. Semler had requested approval on Dec. 5 from options exchanges to allow options trading as the company believed it met the eligibility requirements.   Though no official announcement has been made, a check of brokerage accounts Tuesday morning U.S. hours showed the options as available to trade.  Options are financial contracts that give the investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a specified price before a certain date. The introduction of options on a stock gives investors new tools to hedge risk and speculate on price movements.   Among the requirements needed for an options market to be granted are a minimum share price of around $3-$5, a minimum market capitalization of at least $75 million and sufficient trading volume of around 500,000 to 1 million shares per day. Additionally, a minimum number of publicly available shares and sufficient number of shareholders are required.  Semler's stock price has almost tripled to more than $74 as of Monday's close since making public its initial bitcoin purchases on May 28. It has a market cap topping $600 million. SMLR is ahead 5% in premarket action Tuesday to $78.20.  The company recently filed a second prospectus supplement under its S-3 Shelf, which has seen an additional $50 million in share offerings under its existing at-the-market (ATM) program, increasing the total offering to $150 million. To date, the company has raised approximately $100 million in proceeds through ATM issuance.  Semler to date has acquired 2,084 bitcoin for $168.6 million, or an average price of about $81,000 each. Those holdings are worth about $222 million at bitcoin's recent price of roughly $106,500.  Semler may be looking to recreate the success mammoth bitcoin holder MicroStrategy (MSTR) has achieved through the issuance of convertible notes to raise capital for accumulating more tokens. By not causing immediate dilution of existing shares, convertible offerings can be a more attractive way than share offerings to raise cash. The active options market Semler is hoping for allows investors an easy way to hedge, thus making convertible paper more attractive to potential buyers.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin gains bullish momentum toward $1, while Rexas Finance draws attention with bold 25x rally projections, turning 400 USDT into 10,000 USDT. Table of Contents Dogecoin’s bullish momentum points toward $1 target Rexas Finance presale gains traction with record-breaking interest New coin aims for 25x rally, drawing interest from buyers Looking ahead, will DOGE and RXS deliver? Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently gained momentum, sparking optimism among buyers as its price trends above 0.44 USDT. Meanwhile, a new cryptocurrency, Rexas Finance (RXS), is capturing attention with bold projections of turning 400 USDT into 10,000 USDT through a potential 25x rally, positioning it as a strong competitor in the market. Dogecoin’s bullish momentum points toward $1 target The price of Dogecoin has been on the rise due to the bullish investors and congestion in the Dogecoin market. Having fluctuated between 0.37 USDT and 0.47 USDT in the past couple of weeks, DOGE looks set to break out. Crypto analysts think that DOGE might cross 0.73 USDT its all-time high level and reach almost 1 USDT if the present performance persists. Source: TradingView There are signs of bullish strength from key technical analyses including the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). The MACD line is above the signal line and histograms of bars point upwards indicating that buying pressure is strengthening. On the lower time frames, chart patterns, such as an ascending triangle, also point to an upward breakout. One analyst claims that DOGE is in the process of constructing a bullish pennant chart pattern that suggests that the uptrend will persist. If this happens, the DOGE value could rise by approximately 30% to 40% and get a lot closer to that minimum of 0.62, than it currently is. However, according to the specialists, the current positions may be volatile, and the inability to maintain above 0.40 level may lead to short-term corrections. Rexas Finance presale gains traction with record-breaking interest While Dogecoin focuses on the bulls in its future, Rexas Finance appears to be one of the most promising projects in the presale segment. The arrangements are good as RXS has managed to receive more than 25 million USDT in its presale, and buyers are still eagerly purchasing tokens as they enter the 9th stage at 0.125 USDT. The presale price is planned to rise to 0.150 USDT in the subsequent stage, which generates interest among holders. Source: X In addition to security, there is an audit and review by Certik for more confidence in Rexas Finance. The project has some special tools including IEO which provides a 100,000 USDT rewards program that enhances participation as well. In the longer term, RXS must target a launch price higher than 0.20 USDT for long-term development. New coin aims for 25x rally, drawing interest from buyers Rexas Finance has lured the market with their great expectation to amplify 400 USDT to 10,000 USDT. Over the presale stage, RXS already has nearly 97% of the current stage completed with 325 million tokens sold. One of the main reasons behind the high demand for holding the project is its innovative nature as the bridge between the asset markets and Blockchain. While some buyers are getting ready, RXS’s detailed development plan and excellent start indicate it has the potential to be a giant in the crypto space. With increasing public interest and an inventive bonus plan, it is a project worth keeping an eye on over the next few months. Looking ahead, will DOGE and RXS deliver? As Dogecoin continues its upward trajectory, surpassing its all-time high remains a realistic goal for holders. Analysts have pointed to historical patterns suggesting that the meme coin could achieve a rally comparable to its 2021 performance. On the other hand, Rexas Finance presents a different kind of opportunity, with its presale setting the stage for a potentially explosive debut on major exchanges. Both DOGE and RXS are poised for strong performances, each appealing to a different segment of buyers. While Dogecoin targets steady growth, Rexas Finance offers high-risk, high-reward potential, making the crypto market more dynamic than ever.

37758907,https://thecoinrise.com/uk-fca-flags-solana-based-retardio-project-over-unauthorized-activities/,1734443129,UK FCA Flags Solana-Based ‘Retardio’ Project Over Unauthorized Activities,"The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued a warning against the Solana-based project “Retardio,” raising concerns over unauthorized financial promotions that target UK consumers. In a notice released on December 16, the FCA stated that the project may be offering or promoting financial services without proper authorization, a breach of the regulator’s rules. The FCA noted the importance of dealing exclusively with FCA-approved firms to ensure consumer protection. According to the regulator, users interacting with unauthorized projects like Retardio risk losing their money, as they would not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). “This means it’s unlikely you’d get your money back if the firm goes out of business,” the FCA warned. The agency also encouraged users to verify firms through its registry and report unauthorized operations via official channels. Retardio Responds with Humor Amid FCA Crackdown The Retardio project, which includes a NFT collection and a memecoin, appeared unfazed by the warning. In a tongue-in-cheek response , the project claimed to have “issued a warning against the UK’s financial regulator.” Retardio’s NFT collection has reportedly amassed $31 million in lifetime sales, according to CryptoSlam data. Its memecoin, trading under the ticker “Retardio,” currently holds a market capitalization of $87 million, priced at approximately $0.08 as per Dexscreener. Despite its playful tone, the FCA’s warning highlights ongoing concerns about the rapid growth of unregulated crypto memecoin projects , particularly those relying on viral attention and speculative hype. Memecoins and the Value of Attention Animoca Brands Chairman Yat Siu weighed in on the concept of memecoins, describing them as tokens that capture the value of user attention. Siu argued that while traditional social platforms fail to transparently measure the value of user-generated content (UGC), memecoins embed that culture directly into Web3 ecosystems. “If attention was a token, that’s basically what memecoins represent,” Siu explained, adding that their market value often reflects the collective focus and engagement they command. The FCA’s notice serves as yet another cautionary reminder for consumers engaging in the speculative world of memecoins and NFTs .

Zhang emphasizes the importance of AI and digitalization in future investment strategies. Investment success requires adapting to market dynamics with smart technologies and AI. China’s capital markets may enter a new bull cycle, driven by digital innovations. The future of capital markets lies in the transformative power of smart technologies. Zhang Bao Long, a renowned investor and strategic advisor for Finanx AI , often called China’s “Warren Buffett,” emphasizes that digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) will shape investment strategies as market complexities grow. He believes that smart tools are critical for improving market efficiency and helping investors adapt to volatile global markets. The convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology is already transforming the financial landscape, creating new opportunities for innovation and efficiency. Finanx AI leads this revolution, using cutting-edge AI combined with blockchain to take trading to new heights. This vision is matched by Zhang’s forward-thinking insights about the necessity that investors embrace innovation for future success in an increasingly digitized market. Evolution of Investment Strategies Zhang views capital markets as a domain requiring systematic expertise, combining strategy design, knowledge, and empirical analysis. He stresses that investment success demands more than buying and selling; it requires understanding complex market dynamics. According to him, future growth opportunities lie in emerging sectors, particularly those leveraging digital assets, AI, and big data technologies. As smart technologies evolve, traditional investment approaches will need to incorporate these tools to keep pace. The Role of Quantitative Trading in Modern Markets Quantitative trading has significantly advanced, but Zhang believes its implementation must account for localized market systems. In China, the T+1 trading mechanism demands tailored strategies to achieve greater flexibility. Zhang predicts that technology-driven trading systems will allow for more agile decision-making, unlocking new opportunities. However, he urges investors to remain vigilant about policy changes, as these significantly influence market trends. Modern investing is increasingly driven by behavioral finance principles. Zhang argues that market movements often follow emotional patterns, creating both risks and opportunities. Identifying these signs can assist investors in keeping their cool during periods of extreme fluctuations and making rational decisions. Comprehending behavioral patterns are important for managing the risks associated with volatile markets, and more importantly, securing revenues in volatile conditions. Emergence of a Bull Market Cycle Zhang is optimistic about China’s capital markets entering a new bull cycle in 2024. He links this potential growth to global economic shifts, with digital and intelligent sectors leading the way. Key drivers include advancements in AI, blockchain, and big data, which are expected to reshape market structures. Investors who focus on these areas may seize substantial opportunities as the next market cycle unfolds. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37758820,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628896,1734442736,Tech YouTuber unlocks native PS3 emulation on PS5 hardware,"A tech YouTuber recently experimented with PS5 hardware to prove it can run PS3 games. Lowest Logan’s experiment used an AMD BC-250 mining card and was able to run games like Gran Turismo 5 Prologue. The YouTuber also noted that game performance could be improved through optimization. Game emulation has remained a contentious area within the gaming world, with many gamers opting for PCs to emulate games across the board. However, with many tech developments, console gamers have joined in on the fun, with PlayStation emulation steadily growing and techies performing experiments. In one such case, a YouTuber experimented using underclocked hardware to debunk beliefs such as those stating that PS5 cannot run PS3 games. YouTuber proves that the PS5 can run PS3 games A tech YouTuber named Lowest Logan successfully used PS5 hardware to run PS3 games in a groundbreaking experiment. Logan used the AMD BC-250 mining card, which has a system-on-chip (SoC) similar to the PS5’s native chip but with limited CPU and GPU capabilities. The chip has six cores and 12 threads, and only 24 out of the original 32 GPU compute units are active. The BC-250 chip was limited to 450MHz clock speed with the Youtuber’s setup using 16 GB of GDDR6 memory. The YouTuber’s experiment also used RPCS3, the popular open-source PS3 emulator compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD. Logan’s experiment proved that the PS5’s setup can run PS3 games built using the complex CELL-based model by converting them to x86-compatible instructions. Logan’s improvised setup ran games such as Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, Watch Dogs, and LittleBigPlanet 2 at 60fps. The experiment was able to run the games with occasional shader compilation stutters being the only major issue despite increasing the resolution to 1440p. Logan’s experiment upstages previous attempts at backward compatibility on Sony consoles, which left many believing it was impossible. Watch Dogs notably had more glitches than the other games. The tech YouTuber attributed the extra glitches to the game’s original PS3 optimization issues. Logan reignited backward compatibility debates After his successful experiment, Logan reignited debates about the PS5’s untapped potential for backward compatibility without requiring cloud streaming. The YouTuber’s approach overcame many technical and software limitations while also using an underpowered setup to run PS3 games. Gamers pointed out that Logan’s experiment disproved Sony’s initial stance that implied that native PS3 emulation on the PS5 is not feasible due to technical barriers and high costs. Many gamers argued that Sony’s staff are not as competent or motivated when working towards providing backward compatibility for previous PlayStation consoles. The gamers stated that the problem was not the hardware but rather the PS3’s software issues that Sony was unwilling to address. Some gamers stated that Sony should do a better job since most PS1, PS2, and PS3 games could be properly emulated using a PC or other consoles such as the Steam Deck.

37758503,https://crypto.news/?p=14320104,1734442701,"XRP price rises ahead of RLUSD launch, but a reversal is possible","The XRP price continued rising, becoming one of the best-performing large-cap cryptocurrencies in the market. Ripple ( XRP ) surged by over 12%, extending an uptrend that began on December 10 when the token bottomed at $1.9065. The rally came after Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, announced that the company would launch the RLUSD stablecoin on Dec. 17 . The stablecoin will initially debut on major exchanges such as Uphold, Bitstamp, MoonPay, and others. The launch follows Ripple developers receiving approval from New York authorities after months of regulatory review. Ripple Labs aims for RLUSD to become a significant player in the stablecoin industry by offering enterprise-grade solutions. Additionally, Ripple hopes RLUSD will complement XRP to boost cross-border transaction volumes in the coming months. Still, RLUSD faces substantial risks ahead. The biggest risk is that it may not gain traction among users after all. Some stablecoins launched by big companies have failed to become popular in the past. For example, Justin Sun’s USDD stablecoin’s market cap has remained around $740 million since its launch in 2022. Similarly, PayPal USD, which was launched in 2023 by PayPal, has struggled and has $458 million in assets. On the other hand, Tether ( USDT ) has continued to grow its market share as its market cap has jumped to over $140 billion. It has become the most used stablecoin in the industry, with a market dominance of over 66%. You might also like: Bitcoin is “under-exposed” to corporate adoption, says VanEck’s Matthew Sigel XRP price chart points to potential risks XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The other potential risk for the Ripple price is that users may sell the news. This is a situation where users buy an asset in anticipation of a major event and then sell it when it happens. A good example of this is what happened after the last Bitcoin ( BTC ) halving in April. Bitcoin rose ahead of the halving and then retreated after it happened. Another technical risk for XRP is a developing double-top pattern at $2.90. A double-top is a bearish chart formation that often precedes a price pullback. In this case, XRP may hit $2.90 and then retrace to its neckline at $1.90. Furthermore, the coin could experience mean reversion, where the price falls back toward its key moving averages. Currently, XRP trades about 60% above the 50-day moving average, increasing the likelihood of a correction. Conversely, a move above the double-top resistance at $2.90 would invalidate the bearish outlook and could propel XRP toward the $5 level.

In a video shared on her X account on Dec. 17, Knafo delivered a speech in parliament, calling for European nations to start building national Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserves, develop the crypto mining industry and stop hiking up taxes on crypto holders. “It’s time to bet on freedom, it is time for our states to bet on Bitcoin. To build national strategic reserves. It is time to develop the mining industry,” said Knafo. She took the opportunity to oppose the European Central Bank’s plan to create a digital euro , a mechanism that she believes would only give the bank more power over people’s finances due to how centralized the digital euro was. “We do not want this dystopian world where a European bureaucrat will be able to prohibit certain transactions and even eliminate us from the banking system with a click for a simple comment made on social media or for stating an opinion that disagrees with them.” Sarah Knafo, Member of the European Parliament In the beginning of her speech, she cited El Salvador’s decision to invest in cryptocurrency back in 2021 and Donald Trump’s commitment to establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S. as key examples for how the world has shifted towards decentralized finance. “The whole world is now preparing to take advantage of this decentralized finance revolution.

Knafo claimed that the EU “is squandering our money on unbelievable mismanagement” because it refuses to turn to crypto as a more reliable alternative to store its national funds. “It is time for a paradigm shift. It is time to protect our people from inflation and the poor economic choices of our states,” she stated. In the past few months, several nations have been leaning towards plans of building a Bitcoin reserve. On Dec. 16, Donald Trump reaffirmed his plans to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve as part of his plan to make America the “crypto capital.” In addition, states across the country are in the process of passing Bitcoin reserve bills, including Texas, Alabama and Pennsylvania. Prior to that, lawmakers in both Japan and Russia have urged their governments to consider establishing a national Bitcoin reserve to protect the national funds of their respective nations. On Nov. 26, Brazilian legislators in the Chamber of Deputies proposed a Bitcoin bill that would limit Brazil’s reserves to approximately $18.5 billion worth of Bitcoin.

37763773,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/how-central-bank-digital-currencies-are-disrupting-traditional-banking-systems,1734442503,How Central Bank Digital Currencies Are Disrupting Traditional Banking Systems,"Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are transforming the financial landscape, offering a digital version of a nation’s fiat currency that is issued and regulated by central banks. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, CBDCs aim to blend the stability of traditional money with the speed and convenience of digital payments. As part of this evolution, innovative blockchain projects like Lightchain Tokens (LCAI) are stepping into the spotlight. Don’t miss the chance to participate in the Lightchain AI Presale , where cutting-edge solutions are shaping the future of secure, decentralized technologies. As countries race to meet the growing demand for faster and more secure transactions, CBDCs are emerging as potential disruptors to traditional banking systems. They offer advantages such as reduced transaction costs, improved payment efficiency, and greater financial inclusion. However, their rollout introduces critical challenges around privacy, monetary policy, and the role of private banks. In this article, we’ll dive into the mechanics of CBDCs, their benefits and limitations, and what they could mean for financial institutions and consumers. We’ll also explore how blockchain innovations, like Lightchain Tokens (LCAI) , are paving the way for decentralized systems that could either complement or challenge the rise of CBDCs. What are Central Bank Digital Currencies? Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital forms of a nation's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and represent a direct liability of the central bank, ensuring stability and trust. They are designed to complement physical cash, providing a digital alternative for transactions and payments. CBDCs can be categorized into two types. retail and wholesale. Retail CBDCs are intended for use by the general public, facilitating everyday transactions, while wholesale CBDCs are designed for financial institutions to streamline large-scale interbank transfers and settlements. The implementation of CBDCs aims to enhance payment efficiency, promote financial inclusion, and provide a secure, government-backed digital payment option. As of 2023, numerous central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting CBDCs to adapt to the evolving digital economy and maintain monetary sovereignty. How Do CBDCs Work? Each country may have its own unique approach to implementing CBDCs, but in general, they work similarly to traditional fiat currencies. The main difference is that CBDCs are entirely digital and operate on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform. This allows for real-time, secure transactions, with the central bank acting as the intermediary. Consumers can hold their CBDCs in digital wallets provided by commercial banks or directly through the central bank. Transactions using CBDCs can be conducted online or offline, making them easily accessible and convenient for everyday use. Central banks may also have control over the supply of CBDCs, allowing them to implement monetary policies more effectively. They may also have the ability to monitor transactions and combat illegal activities like money laundering. The Role of Lightchain AI in the CBDC Landscape Lightchain AI is poised to transform the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) landscape by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism enhances transaction security by validating operations through AI-driven computations, ensuring robust protection against fraud and cyber threats. The platform's Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) facilitates scalable solutions for centralized digital currencies, enabling efficient processing of high-volume transactions essential for CBDC implementation. By merging AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI offers a secure, scalable, and efficient framework for central banks exploring digital currency issuance, potentially revolutionizing the future of digital finance. Potential Impact on Traditional Banking Systems The introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could significantly impact traditional banking systems. One primary concern is the potential for bank disintermediation, where customers might prefer holding funds in CBDCs over traditional bank deposits, perceiving them as safer or more convenient. This shift could reduce the deposit base of commercial banks, affecting their ability to lend and manage liquidity. To mitigate such risks, central banks might implement measures like limiting individual CBDC holdings or ensuring that CBDCs are non-interest-bearing, making them less attractive as a savings vehicle compared to bank deposits. Additionally, the coexistence of CBDCs and traditional bank money necessitates functional consistency to prevent fragmentation in payment systems. Establishing common operational characteristics across all forms of regulated digital money is essential to maintain stability and public confidence in the financial system. Lightchain Tokens (LCAI) A Disruptive Force in the CBDC Landscape Lightchain AI is a blockchain ecosystem that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance scalability, privacy, and decentralization. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing AI computations, promoting efficient and secure processing of large data volumes. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables real-time AI computations on-chain, supporting applications across various industries. While Lightchain AI offers innovative solutions within the blockchain and AI sectors, there is no direct evidence to suggest it has a disruptive impact on the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) landscape. CBDCs are digital forms of a nation's fiat currency, issued and regulated by central banks, focusing on enhancing payment efficiency and financial inclusion. Therefore, while Lightchain AI contributes to advancements in blockchain technology, its role as a disruptive force in the CBDC landscape remains unsubstantiated. How Lightchain Tokens Presale Is The Oppurtunity You Don't Want To Miss Lightchain AI's presale presents a unique opportunity for investors to engage with a pioneering project at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. By participating in the presale, investors can acquire LCAI tokens at an early stage, potentially maximizing returns as the platform develops and gains market traction. The presale has already garnered significant attention, raising over $2.2 million, indicating strong investor confidence in the project's vision and potential. The LCAI token serves multiple functions within the Lightchain AI ecosystem, including payments for AI services, staking for governance participation, and unlocking premium features. Investing in the presale allows early adopters to support the development of a decentralized AI platform that aims to revolutionize various industries by enhancing scalability, privacy, and efficiency. However, as with all investments, it's crucial to conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks associated with early-stage projects in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The Future of Banking in a CBDC-Driven World And Lightchain AI's Role As central banks worldwide explore and implement CBDCs, the future of banking is likely to be heavily influenced by these digital currencies. They have the potential to enhance payment efficiency, promote financial inclusion, and provide a secure alternative to traditional forms of currency. However, their implementation will also impact traditional banking systems, potentially leading to disintermediation and requiring regulatory measures for stability. In this evolving landscape, Lightchain AI presents a unique opportunity as a pioneering project at the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. While its role in the CBDC landscape remains unclear, its innovative solutions have garnered significant attention and investment, positioning it as a disruptor in various industries. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Speaking with podcast host Natalie Brunell, Sigel outlined a clear four-year pattern in Bitcoin’s price action that he believes has persisted through multiple market cycles. Why $180,000 Per Bitcoin Seems Plausible Sigel explained that Bitcoin tends to outperform nearly every other asset class for three years out of each four-year halving cycle, followed by a deep correction in the fourth year. Referencing a drawdown typically ranging from 60% to 80%, Sigel said this decline often arrives roughly two years after the BTC halving event. Since Bitcoin’s most recent halving took place in April 2024, Sigel sees 2024 and 2025 as potentially strong years. “That down year typically is the second year after the halving,” Sigel explained. “The Bitcoin halving occurred in April of this year. So 2024 [will be a] strong year, 2025 should be a strong year. I think 2026, unless something changes, would be a down year.” Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Hit $160,000 In 2025? Matrixport Thinks So Drawing on historical data, he recalled the smallest trough-to-peak appreciation in Bitcoin’s previous cycles, which was approximately 2,000%. Even if that figure halves to 1,000%, Sigel pointed out that Bitcoin could rise from a trough of around $18,000 to as high as $180,000 in the current cycle. “So I see an upside to $180,000 this cycle, and I think that’s likely to happen next year,” Sigel added. He also emphasized that Bitcoin’s volatility means the price could overshoot or undershoot that number, but that $180,000 represents a plausible target for 2024 if the pattern holds and no major “red light” indicators appear. Sigel broke down what he sees as the most important topping signals for traders to watch. The first involves derivatives funding rates: if the annualized cost to hold bullish Bitcoin positions on leveraged markets pushes above 10% for longer than a couple of months, Sigel considers that a red flag. “Some of those indicators include the funding rates. When the funding rate for Bitcoin exceeds 10% for more than a couple months, that tends to be a red light,” Sigel warned and explained that recent market activity reset elevated funding rates: “[Last week’s] washout eliminated that as well. So funding rates [are] not really flashing red.” The second is the level of unrealized profits on the blockchain, where on-chain analysis can reveal whether market participants’ cost basis is so low that significant profit-taking might soon create selling pressure. “We’re not seeing scary amounts of unrealized profits [yet],” Sigel noted. Finally, he said anecdotal evidence of widespread retail leverage or speculation could also flash warning lights. He explained that if all these risk indicators were to align at a certain price point—for example, if Bitcoin hit $150,000 and these metrics pointed to a market top—he would be cautious. However, he said that if the price reached around $180,000 without those signals appearing, there might still be room for further appreciation. Related Reading: National Bitcoin Reserve Initiative: MP Satoshi Hamada Urges Japan To Take Action “If we reach $180K and none of those lights are flashing, maybe we let it run. If all those lights are flashing and the price is $150K, I’m not gonna wait,” Sigel added. Next BTC Cycle Predictions He also explored the longer-term growth potential for Bitcoin by comparing it to gold’s market capitalization. Because about half of gold’s supply is used for industrial and jewelry purposes, he reasoned that the other half can be compared more directly to Bitcoin’s function as an investment and store of value. If Bitcoin were to reach a valuation comparable to that half portion of gold’s market cap, Sigel believes the price could trend toward roughly $450,000 per coin over the course of the next cycle. Taking an even more forward-looking perspective, he described VanEck’s long-term model in which global central banks might eventually hold Bitcoin as part of their reserves, even if just at a 2% weighting. Since gold constitutes about 18% of central bank reserves worldwide, Sigel’s assumption is that Bitcoin’s share would be far smaller by comparison. He also factored in the prospect that Bitcoin might one day serve as a settlement currency for global trade, potentially among emerging economic alliances such as the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), which could push its valuation significantly higher. In VanEck’s calculations, this scenario might place Bitcoin at $3 million per coin by 2050: “We also assume that Bitcoin is used as a settlement currency for global trade, most likely among BRICS countries. We get to three million dollars a coin by 2050, which would be about a 16% compound annual growth rate.” At press time, BTC traded at $107,219.

However, lately, both projects have been stuck in a cycle of limited growth, and they’ve failed to deliver on the explosive potential that many once expected. In contrast, IntelMarkets is stepping in with something different. This platform combines AI-driven solutions and real-time blockchain monitoring to offer a product that truly stands apart. Having already raised over $4 million in its presale, IntelMarkets is showing investors it's more than just another crypto project. ADA Can't Seem to Break out of Its Plateau Cardano (ADA) has been stuck in a tight range for months, with its price hovering just above $1. Right now, it's teetering near its support level of $0.91, and many are hoping for a breakout. Traders are closely eyeing this level because if Cardano (ADA) manages to break through, the price could jump to $1.45, $1.75, or even $2.03. Currently, Cardano (ADA) is sitting at $1.08, and it moves closer to the triangle’s lower boundary around $0.91. But on the flip side, if ADA fails to break resistance and starts sliding back toward support, traders will be on the lookout for any signs of weakness before making their next move. In the next few days, Cardano (ADA) price movement will be crucial. Traders will be watching closely to see if Cardano (ADA) can break free from its consolidation phase. If it does, the price could climb to the $2 mark and beyond. If not, it may remain stuck in its current range, and traders will need to reassess. Tron Keeps Falling Short of Expectations TRON (TRX) has continued its downward trend, with a 10% drop over the past week, further solidifying concerns among investors. The token, which reached an all-time high of $0.44 in November, has retraced to $0.28. This pullback is not unexpected in the volatile crypto market, where rapid rises are often followed by declines. Despite some recent bullish sentiment due to TRON (TRX) growing total value locked, many industry experts believe the token is struggling to meet long-term expectations. As TRON (TRX) holders look for new opportunities, alternatives like IntelMarkets are emerging as potentially better investment choices. IntelMarkets Is Rewriting the Rules of Crypto Growth IntelMarkets is changing the dynamic for crypto investors. With the launch of its $INTL token, it is delivering tangible benefits to its users, including staking rewards and governance rights. The presale has performed well, demonstrating strong early support for the platform. Holders of the $INTL token can access reduced trading fees, with discounts up to 30%. Additionally, early adopters get exclusive access to new features and products through IntelMarkets' Launchpad. Moreover, its QuantumX Wallet is designed to withstand the growing threat of quantum computing, ensuring that assets remain safe even as the tech evolves. Furthermore, its Route X21 initiative addresses potential quantum vulnerabilities, securing blockchain ecosystems for the long term. Plus, IntelMarkets’ automated trading robots give users the ability to set personalized metrics so they can trade with confidence and precision. Even more, the total supply of 2 billion $INTL tokens ensures there’s enough liquidity while maintaining scarcity. Also, the platform’s stage 8 is underway, with 6.19% of tokens sold. The current price is $0.07, set to increase to $0.08 in the next round. As a result, investors are actively purchasing the $INTL tokens to unlock reduced trading fees, earning up to 30% off, and gaining access to exclusive products and features.

37758299,https://coinpaper.com/6577/avalanche-unveils-major-network-upgrade-to-boost-subnets-and-smart-contracts,1734442224,Avalanche Unveils Major Network Upgrade to Boost Subnets and Smart Contracts,"Two major developments in blockchain technology emerged this week, highlighting ongoing efforts to enhance scalability and efficiency across layer-1 networks. Avalanche rolled out its largest upgrade to date, Avalanche9000, introducing improvements that reduce costs for launching subnet blockchains and running smart contracts. Meanwhile, Monad Labs announced the formation of the Monad Foundation, an independent entity focused on governance and ecosystem development, signaling significant progress toward a potential mainnet launch. Avalanche Launches Avalanche9000 Upgrade to Usher in Hundreds of New Layer-1 Blockchains Avalanche (AVAX) - the application-friendly layer-1 blockchain - has officially rolled out its largest-ever upgrade, Avalanche9000, introducing key advancements aimed at enhancing its network efficiency and accessibility. Announced on Monday, the much-anticipated upgrade is poised to revolutionize the blockchain landscape by making it easier and significantly cheaper to launch subnet blockchains and deploy smart contracts. “This is the start of hundreds of Avalanche L1s launching,” Avalanche’s team proclaimed in a post on X. “Avalanche9000 reduces the cost to deploy an L1 by 99.9%, and with hundreds of L1s being developed on testnet, look out for an explosion of launches in the coming months.” Key Features of Avalanche9000 The Avalanche9000 upgrade integrates two major improvement proposals, ACP-77 and ACP-125, signaling a significant leap for developers, validators, and end-users. 1. Validator Optimization Through ACP-77 A major highlight of ACP-77 is its overhaul of validator requirements. Previously, validators had to stake a minimum of 2,000 AVAX tokens – valued at approximately $100,000 – to validate the main Avalanche network alongside any subnets they operated. This setup posed substantial financial and hardware burdens on participants. The “Etna” upgrade, as part of ACP-77, addresses this limitation by decoupling validators from the requirement to validate the primary chain when focusing on specific subnets. This change allows validators to dedicate their efforts to specific layer-1 subnets, cutting down operational costs and enabling more efficient hardware usage. With reduced entry barriers, the Etna upgrade paves the way for projects to bootstrap their own blockchains cost-effectively. Furthermore, it introduces regulatory flexibility, empowering subnet operators to meet specific jurisdictional requirements as needed. 2. Lowering Fees with ACP-125 Another pivotal enhancement is ACP-125, which directly impacts Avalanche’s primary smart contract chain, the C-Chain. The proposal reduces the base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX (roughly $0.00000004), addressing what the Avalanche team described as an ”artificially high” minimum fee. “The current minimum base fee of 25 nAVAX is higher than what the market demands, leading to artificially reduced network usage,” reads the official ACP-125 proposal on GitHub . “By lowering the minimum base fee to 1 nAVAX, we allow the market to dictate appropriate fee levels, resulting in a more efficient allocation of resources and potentially higher network usage.” This reduction is expected to stimulate activity on Avalanche’s C-Chain by making smart contract interactions significantly cheaper, catering to developers and users seeking affordable decentralized application (dApp) deployment. At the heart of Avalanche’s scalability lies its subnet architecture. Subnets are sovereign groups of validators working together to validate transactions on specific blockchains, offering a “blockchain-as-a-service” model that supports customization for diverse use cases. Subnets can tailor their parameters, including tokenomics, validator sets, and consensus mechanisms, enabling developers to create highly specialized layer-1 solutions without being tied to Avalanche’s main chain operations. This flexibility opens doors for innovation across industries ranging from gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) to enterprise applications. Avalanche claims to already support over 500 layer-1 blockchains, with Avalanche9000 expected to accelerate subnet adoption significantly. The Avalanche9000 upgrade arrives on the back of substantial financial support and developer activity. Earlier this year, Avalanche launched its Avalanche9000 testnet, allocating over $40 million in retroactive rewards to developers building on the network. The testnet saw strong engagement, signaling growing enthusiasm among blockchain builders. Adding to this momentum, the Avalanche Foundation recently secured $250 million in funding through a locked token sale. The round was led by prominent venture capital firms including Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly Capital, and ParaFi Capital, signaling investor confidence in Avalanche’s vision. The capital injection will help ensure a smooth rollout of Avalanche9000 while supporting future ecosystem growth, developer incentives, and subnet launches. Avalanche: A Multi-Chain Powerhouse Avalanche’s architecture comprises three distinct blockchains optimized for specific functionalities: X-Chain (Exchange Chain): Handles the creation and trading of digital assets. P-Chain (Platform Chain): Coordinates validators and manages subnets. C-Chain (Contract Chain): Executes Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, making it ideal for dApp deployment. This multi-chain design, combined with Avalanche9000’s improvements, positions Avalanche as one of the most scalable and versatile layer-1 networks in the blockchain ecosystem. Monad Labs Unveils the Monad Foundation to Drive Blockchain Development Ahead of Mainnet Launch In related news, on Monday, Monad Labs announced the establishment of the Monad Foundation, an independent organization dedicated to advancing the growth, governance, and adoption of the Monad blockchain. The formation of the foundation marks a critical milestone for Monad, which recently rolled out its testnet and is now positioning itself closer to a potential mainnet and token launch. In its official blog post , the Monad Foundation described its mission as fostering validator-driven governance, supporting community-led improvement proposals, and providing tools and documentation for developers. The foundation will also play a pivotal role in ecosystem growth, marketing, and advisory initiatives for the Monad blockchain. ”We are sharing an exciting organizational update, signaling a next step in the evolution of the Monad blockchain: the Monad Foundation, an independent organization dedicated to encouraging the development and adoption of the Monad blockchain protocol,” the foundation announced. While the statement refrained from explicitly confirming a mainnet or token launch, the timing of the foundation’s launch has fueled speculation that such milestones could be imminent. This comes on the heels of Monad Labs' progressive testnet rollout, which began in November, a step widely regarded as a precursor to a full mainnet deployment. The Monad Foundation’s core focus areas include: Validator-Led Governance:The foundation will facilitate decentralized governance through validators, ensuring that key decisions about the protocol’s evolution are driven by stakeholders within the community. This approach aligns with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. Developer Support and Tools:Providing detailed developer documentation, tools, and educational resources will be central to the foundation’s activities. The goal is to create a robust developer ecosystem that supports the growth of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Monad blockchain. Ecosystem Development and Adoption:The foundation will engage in ecosystem development, offering marketing and advisory support for projects building on Monad. By fostering strategic partnerships and promoting community-led improvement proposals, the foundation aims to accelerate Monad’s adoption. The formation of the Monad Foundation comes amid increasing interest and investment in the Monad blockchain ecosystem. In July, three projects built on Monad announced securing venture capital funding, signaling growing confidence in the network’s potential. Earlier this year, Monad Labs made headlines when it raised $225 million in a Series A funding round led by Paradigm in April, reportedly at a $3 billion valuation. The funding points to strong backing from major players in the blockchain investment space and highlighted the industry’s recognition of Monad as a promising layer-1 solution. Monad aims to address Ethereum’s current scalability challenges by offering significant improvements in throughput and efficiency. Unlike layer-1 networks that replicate Ethereum’s existing codebase, Monad is building a brand-new Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) from the ground up. Monad leverages a pipelined architecture, a technical innovation that allows the blockchain to process multiple steps of transactions simultaneously. This design significantly enhances transaction throughput, making Monad a high-performance alternative to traditional Ethereum-compatible chains. By improving Ethereum’s operational efficiency while maintaining EVM compatibility, Monad enables developers to deploy Ethereum-based dApps with higher scalability, lower latency, and greater performance. The approach positions Monad as a next-generation layer-1 solution capable of supporting demanding decentralized applications. Mainnet Launch on the Horizon? The timing of the Monad Foundation's formation and the recent launch of Monad’s testnet have fueled anticipation within the crypto community. Typically, testnet deployments allow developers to test applications and protocols in a simulated environment, ironing out bugs before launching a mainnet. With Monad’s testnet already in progress, the community is speculating that a mainnet rollout—and potentially a token launch—could soon follow. The foundation’s focus on governance and ecosystem development further hints at readiness for a fully operational network. Validator participation, governance frameworks, and developer adoption are all critical components that must align ahead of a successful mainnet deployment. Monad’s emergence comes at a time when scaling solutions and Ethereum alternatives are in high demand. Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform, but its limited throughput and rising transaction fees continue to present challenges for developers and users. By building a new EVM optimized for performance, Monad positions itself as a solution that retains Ethereum’s compatibility while offering a scalable, high-throughput alternative. This is particularly significant as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and other dApp sectors require networks that can process large volumes of transactions efficiently.",POSITIVE,AVAX,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6577/avalanche-unveils-major-network-upgrade-to-boost-subnets-and-smart-contracts,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

But there’s a new player making waves—Qubetics. Its decentralised VPN (dVPN) is changing how we think about privacy in the digital age. While giants like Bitcoin and Solana dominate headlines, Qubetics is quietly solving problems its predecessors never tackled. With over $6.8 million raised in its presale, it’s not just another crypto—it’s a game-changer. Qubetics: The Future of Decentralised Privacy Privacy matters more than ever. Whether it’s government surveillance or corporations tracking your every move, people are losing control over their data. Traditional VPNs, often centralised, come with their own risks—security breaches, data restrictions, and a lack of true anonymity. Qubetics is flipping the script with its decentralised VPN. Using blockchain technology, it removes the need for central servers, giving users complete control over their data. No middlemen, no hidden agendas—just pure, unfiltered privacy. Qubetics isn’t just promising; it’s delivering. The presale numbers speak volumes: over 347 million $TICS tokens sold, raising a whopping $6.8 million. Analysts are eyeing significant price hikes as demand soars. Imagine you invested $1,000 in $TICS today at $0.0342 per token. If predictions hold and it hits $0.10 by the next quarter, you’d walk away with nearly $3,000. That’s a 200% return! While Bitcoin and Solana are household names, Qubetics offers something truly unique—a solution to one of the most pressing issues of our time: privacy. Its dVPN isn’t just another feature; it’s a revolutionary tool that could redefine how we use the internet. With its presale in the 13th stage and over 10,000 token holders already on board, the momentum is undeniable. Analysts suggest $TICS could surpass $0.15 within months, making it one of the best altcoins to invest in this month. For more information on how Qubetics is transforming the crypto world, watch this video. Bitcoin: The Reliable Giant Bitcoin recently saw a significant surge, breaking above the $106,000 mark, driven by optimistic speculation surrounding its potential inclusion in strategic reserves. This rally follows widespread market discussions about central banks incorporating Bitcoin into their reserve strategies, a move that could further solidify its status as a store of value. The surge is also tied to increasing institutional adoption, signaling a shift in how large investors view the asset. Analysts are closely watching Bitcoin’s performance, especially as countries like China and Russia explore the role of digital currencies in their economic frameworks Solana: The Underdog’s Comeback Solana’s price experienced a notable 4% drop within 48 hours, settling at $225 by Friday. This decline marked a sharp decoupling from the broader altcoin market rally. Contributing to this dip was a surge in investor interest toward the Ethereum ecosystem, spurred by Trump-backed WLFI’s recent crypto acquisitions. As attention shifted to tokens like ETH, LINK, and AAVE, Solana found itself temporarily sidelined in the ever-competitive crypto market. Despite the price slump, on-chain data revealed a silver lining for Solana. Whale activity surged, with the average balance in buying addresses rising dramatically from 383 SOL to 1,096 SOL—a 186% increase over three days. This uptick suggests that major investors are strategically capitalising on the dip, solidifying Solana’s position as a long-term player in the altcoin space, even amidst shifting market trends. The Final Word The crypto market is buzzing with opportunities, but not all projects are created equal. Bitcoin offers reliability, Solana provides innovation, but Qubetics? It delivers a vision for the future. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big thing. With $6.8 million already raised, $TICS is poised for a breakout.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT.

Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum blockchain as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. The coin aims to capitalize on the popularity of meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE distinguishes itself by implementing a no-tax policy and embracing its identity as a pure memecoin without utility, appealing to those who value simplicity in the crypto space. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, with its market capitalization reaching up to $1.6 billion. This rapid growth created substantial gains for early investors and fostered a strong community. The project’s roadmap includes three phases: initial listings on platforms like CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter, followed by listings on centralized exchanges, and culminating in “tier 1” exchange listings and a “meme takeover.” The coin’s performance has sparked interest during what some refer to as a “memecoin season.” Whether PEPE will continue to perform strongly in the current market cycle remains a topic of interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. JasmyCoin (JASMY) JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency project developed by Jasmy Corporation, a Tokyo-based Internet of Things (IoT) provider. The platform connects service providers and data users, facilitating the buying and selling of data. By integrating IoT technology with blockchain, Jasmy aims to restore and protect the sovereignty of individual data, giving users control over their personal information. The Jasmy platform creates a secure environment where users can exchange data between IoT devices and decentralized protocols without relying on trust. By leveraging edge computing and storing data on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Jasmy decentralizes data workflows. The project seeks to democratize data ownership, allowing users to transform their information into personal assets while enabling service providers to utilize this data to promote their services. The potential of JasmyCoin lies in its unique approach to data management within the expanding IoT ecosystem. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that began as a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin but sets itself apart by running on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB started with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, removing them from circulation. SHIB’s operation on Ethereum allows it to participate in a wide range of decentralized applications. This integration has led to the creation of ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade and stake SHIB tokens. Future plans include developing an NFT platform and establishing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for governance. These developments aim to enhance SHIB’s functionality and presence in the cryptocurrency space beyond its origins as a meme coin. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that utilizes the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains that discard blocks created simultaneously, GHOSTDAG allows these parallel blocks to coexist and orders them through consensus. This method transforms the blockchain into a block directed acyclic graph (blockDAG), generalizing the Nakamoto consensus. As a result, Kaspa can securely operate at very high block rates, currently achieving one block per second with ambitions to reach 10 blocks per second and even 100 in the future. Confirmation times are exceptionally short, primarily limited only by internet latency. The Kaspa implementation offers features like Reachability, enabling users to query the topology of the DAG. It supports block data pruning and plans to introduce block header pruning soon. Additional functionalities include Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs and anticipated subnetwork support, which will facilitate the implementation of layer 2 solutions. These advancements position Kaspa as a scalable and efficient cryptocurrency. In the current market cycle, its focus on high transaction speeds and minimal confirmation times may appeal to users and investors seeking effective blockchain technologies. Conclusion PEPE, JASMY, SHIB, and KAS are promising under $1 cryptos, but XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends memes and sports, aiming for 20,000% growth with strong community engagement.

Shortly afterwards, the world’s largest asset manager bought up a massive amount of Ethereum, signalling a massively bullish outlook. This wave of institutional investment into ETH has brought the price closer to its ATH of $4,891 reflecting growing confidence in the market. On the other hand, the Solana (SOL) holders are up to something even bigger. SOL holders are doubling as the SOL ecosystem appreciates, and the price action has remained strong over the past few weeks. But the greatest shock is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a new viral presale token currently taking the Play to Earn (P2E) market by storm. BlackRock Fuels Ethereum’s Bullish Rally This was a watershed moment in the historic acquisition of Ethereum by BlackRock. Historically, the firm deployed over $500 million into Ethereum ETFs over a few days. Such a tremendous purchase shows that institutional interest in ETH’s future dominance in crypto is growing faster than ever before. Ethereum’s price reacted positively, rising over 29% in the past month and trading near $4,000 at the time of writing. According to analysts led by BlackRock, ETH price could break its all-time high as early as Q1 2025. More institutional funds in ETH have been forecasted as ETFs heat up. 1-month Ethereum price chart- source: CoinMarketCap The uptick indicates ETH's increasing utility to DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 scaling solutions. The long-term future of the Ethereum network looks promising as it stays on the cutting edge of innovation. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Bets On Growth Another project that has been on the run is Solana (SOL). Solana: Known for its fast transaction speeds and low fees, Solana is still the darling of developers and projects, with a high percentage of new arrivals in the space. Over the past month, its recent action suggests investors are betting on its future gains. 1-month Solana price chart- source: CoinMarketCap The network has suffered periodic outages during its operation; despite this, it remains the choice for meme enthusiasts. Institutional interest in SOL has also increased, with previously recorded trading volumes surging 20% this week. NFT, DeFi, and blockchain gaming are storming the Solana ecosystem. As a result, investors have increased their SOL positions, making it the hot competition against Ethereum as SOL price increases. Stage 2 Of The Yeti Ouro Presale Now Available As Demand Explodes While Ethereum and Solana have been riding high, a new altcoin is breaking through, drawing astute traders' attention: Yeti Ouro. The token has already completed Stage 1 of its presale, which sold out in just a couple of months and raised an incredible $1.2 million. Now in stage 2, Yeti Ouro is attracting a lot of interest from investors looking for high returns. Yeti Ouro isn’t just another meme coin. Through its forthcoming Unreal Engine (>50, 0.97%) powered racing game Yeti Go, it charges ahead in the Play-to-Earn (P2E) frontier. High-energy PvP racing, power-ups and in-game rewards based on YETIO tokens are featured in the game. Some of the most important features of Yeti Ouro are: Token Burn Mechanism: Adjusting supply for long-term value Passive Income through Staking: Holders of YETIO can stake their tokens to earn passive rewards. Player Marketplaces: Players exchange items and power-ups with YETIO. Investors can enjoy a 10% bonus in the Yeti Ouro presale stage 2, providing more value for early investors. YETIO is still an attractive entry price at $0.017 per token, perfect just before its price increases. Why Yeti Ouro Stands Out That uniqueness is the key to Yeti Ouro’s success. Ethereum and Solana dominate their respective ecosystems, but Yeti Ouro capitalizes on the increased interest in blockchain-based gaming. It's more than just hype; its immersive gameplay and its utility are strong. It has been shown to outperform other P2E tokens and be aware of this potential in 2024. In comparison to other altcoins, Yeti Ouro offers: High Growth Potential: Still in presale, offering massive upside. Real Utility: Integrated directly into the Yeti Go gaming ecosystem. Community Focus: Building a strong gaming and investor community. With blockchain gaming expected to explode in the coming years, Yeti Ouro is positioned to capitalize on this trend. Conclusion BlackRock’s historic buying spree marks a new era for institutional crypto investments. Ethereum’s rise in funding is 7-8 times higher, as their ecosystem has remained sound & people are willing to bet on their growth. But the focus is now on Yeti Ouro, which has already shown off its popularity by selling out Stage 1. Early investors in Yeti Ouro should stand to gain the most as Stage 2 commences. YETIO is poised to be one of the most exciting Altcoins in 2024 with its emphasis on Play-to-Earn gaming and unique features. Yeti Ouro's presale offers an ideal entry for anyone eager to ride the wave of the next great opportunity.

What Is The Reason For The Rise? Analysts Explained, Gave A Date For A New Record!","Today will be an important day for Ripple. As Ripple announced yesterday, its stablecoin Ripple USD (RLUSD) will be available for sale on global exchanges starting from December 17. “Each RLUSD token is fully backed by US dollar deposits, US government securities, and cash equivalents,” Ripple said in a statement. While RLUSD is expected to be available for sale on exchanges, the XRP price has increased by over 14% in the last 24 hours, making it the second altcoin to gain the most in the last 24 hours. Evaluating this rise in XRP, Obchakevich Research founder Alex Obchakevich stated that RLUSD was behind the recent rise in XRP and said, “Since XRP will be burned in RLUSD transactions, the two assets are intertwined and investors noticed this connection.” “XRP has seen the biggest growth among the top 10 cryptocurrencies over the past week, significantly outpacing Bitcoin’s 10% increase over the same time frame. XRP has been consolidating in this bull flag for a while now, but I think it will head towards $4 once it breaks the $2.60 resistance. “Also, according to my predictions, RLUSD will enter the top 100 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $1 billion in the first days.” Bitrue exchange chief executive Adam O'Neill stated that the launch of RLUSD will play a role in increasing market demand for XRP and will support the rise in price. O'Neill pointed to spot XRP ETFs as a bullish factor other than RLUSD, and stated that he expects them to be approved in 2025. “We think XRP ETFs will also be a likely event in 2025 and we expect a new record for XRP by the end of Q1 2025 at the latest. Because we think XRP will benefit greatly from Trump's pro-crypto administration.” XRP continues to trade at $2.68, up 14 percent in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice.

37758200,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628874,1734441792,Google releases AI tool that creates images from other images,"Google has unveiled Whisk, a new AI tool that generates images using other images as prompts. Unlike older tools that rely heavily on long, detailed text descriptions, Whisk reportedly allows users to upload images to define the subject, scene, and style they want to generate. The tool also supports multiple images for each of these inputs, giving users significant flexibility to experiment. If you don’t have an image to start with, Google has a dice icon that auto-fills the prompts with visuals. However, these placeholder images appear to be AI-generated as well. Users can also add a bit of text to fine-tune the output, but the text box is optional. Whisk still churns out results without it, according to the company. The tool then generates an image and a corresponding text prompt that was used in its creation. If you like the result, you can favorite it or download it. If you don’t, you can refine it by editing the underlying text prompt or generating something entirely new. Imagen 3 powers Google’s Whisk AI Google says Whisk is built for “rapid visual exploration, not pixel-perfect edits.” So while it’s flexible and fun to use, it won’t deliver flawless results every time. The company admits the tool can “miss the mark,” which is why they allow quick edits for better accuracy. Whisk runs on Google’s latest Imagen 3 image generation model, which the company also announced alongside the tool. Imagen 3 powers Whisk to produce its AI-generated results, and the underlying technology is said to improve the overall quality of the outputs. Alongside Imagen 3, Google also introduced Veo 2, its upgraded video generation model. Veo 2 reportedly has a better grasp of cinematography and fixes common issues like hallucinated features—for example, the classic AI error of extra fingers. The model is first launching on Google’s VideoFX platform, which is still in limited testing through Google Labs. The company says Veo 2 will eventually expand to YouTube Shorts and other Google products sometime in 2025. For now, the company positions Whisk as an exploration tool rather than a professional editing solution. Whether it holds up against competitors like OpenAI’s DALL-E remains to be seen.

Blockchain investigator ZachXBT revealed that the “LastPass threat actor” targeted more than 40 crypto addresses in this latest heist. How the Attack Played Out In a December 17 update, ZachXBT explained that the stolen funds were first converted into Ethereum, then moved through various instant exchanges, and finally transferred back into Bitcoin. This incident is part of a string of attacks that began with the December 2022 LastPass breach, where attackers accessed encrypted vault data stored on an unknown cloud platform. At the time, LastPass assured users that their master passwords were protected with high-level encryption, making brute-force attacks highly unlikely. Despite this, hackers have been systematic, targeting users who stored cryptocurrency private keys or seed phrases within their LastPass vaults. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Weekly Crypto Hack Report: Are Your Digital Assets Safe? , Losses Mount to $250 Million According to cybersecurity group Security Alliance (SEAL), total losses from the LastPass hacks have exceeded $250 million as of May 2024. Major incidents include $6.2 million stolen in February 2024 and $4.4 million in October 2023. As of May 2024, over 250 million USD has been stolen, and almost all of it was preventable https://t.co/CYt8acsofm — Security Alliance (@_SEAL_Org) December 16, 2024 Hackers have strategically timed many of these attacks to coincide with holiday seasons, when people are more likely to fall for scams, fake promotions, or festive bonuses. With Christmas just a week away, the risk of further attacks remains high. Secure Your Assets Now! LastPass users who suspect they have stored private keys or seed phrases in their vaults are urged to move their crypto assets immediately to safer storage solutions. This ongoing wave of attacks underscores the risks of relying on centralized password managers to protect critical blockchain data. While LastPass promotes its encryption capabilities, this breach shows that even encrypted data can be vulnerable when stolen in bulk. To avoid similar risks in the future, crypto holders should: Avoid storing private keys or seed phrases on online platforms. Use hardware wallets, which offer secure offline storage. In crypto security, decentralization and offline solutions like hardware wallets remain the most effective defense against cyber threats. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37760962,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/how-brazils-crypto-regulations-are-shaping-latin-americas-blockchain-future,1734441615,How Brazil’s Crypto Regulations Are Shaping Latin America’s Blockchain Future,"Brazil is emerging as a leader in Latin America’s blockchain revolution, with progressive crypto regulations that set the stage for widespread adoption and innovation. By implementing frameworks that balance consumer protection, financial transparency, and technological growth, Brazil is creating a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based solutions. This leadership is inspiring neighboring countries to adopt similar policies, fostering regional cooperation and accelerating blockchain innovation. Much like the transformative opportunities presented by the Lightchain AI Presale , Brazil’s regulatory advancements showcase the potential of blockchain to drive economic inclusion, financial efficiency, and technological growth. As Brazil shapes the regulatory roadmap, it is solidifying its role as a hub for Latin America’s blockchain future. Brazil’s Current Crypto Regulations Brazil has significantly advanced its cryptocurrency regulations to enhance market transparency and investor protection. In December 2022, Law No. 14,478/22, known as the Brazilian Virtual Assets Law, was enacted, establishing a legal framework for virtual asset service providers (VASPs). This law mandates that VASPs obtain authorization from the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) to operate, adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) protocols, and comply with consumer protection standards. The BCB is actively developing detailed regulations, with plans to finalize them by early 2025. This process includes public consultations to ensure the rules are tailored to Brazil's unique market conditions. Additionally, the Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM) oversees digital assets classified as securities, ensuring comprehensive regulatory coverage. These coordinated efforts by Brazilian authorities aim to foster a secure and transparent environment for cryptocurrency activities, balancing innovation with robust regulatory oversight. The Impact of Regulations on Brazil’s Blockchain Industry Brazil’s progressive crypto regulations have had a significant impact on the country’s blockchain industry. By providing a clear legal framework for virtual assets, Brazil has encouraged the growth of blockchain-based solutions and attracted investment from both domestic and international players. 1. Fostering Innovation and Entrepreneurship By creating a favorable environment for virtual asset service providers, Brazil has opened up opportunities for entrepreneurs and startups to develop innovative blockchain-based solutions. With clear regulations in place, businesses can operate with legal certainty and focus on growth and innovation rather than navigating regulatory ambiguity. This has resulted in a thriving blockchain ecosystem, with numerous startups emerging to address various challenges across industries such as finance, logistics, supply chain management, and more. These startups are not only driving economic growth but also solidifying Brazil’s position as a leader in Latin America’s blockchain landscape. 2. Attracting Investment Brazil’s progressive crypto regulations have also attracted significant investment into the country's blockchain ecosystem. The legal clarity and regulatory oversight provided by Brazil's framework have instilled confidence in investors, leading to increased funding for blockchain-based companies. Investors recognize the potential of Brazil as a market with growing demand for innovative solutions and are keen to capitalize on this opportunity. This influx of capital has not only accelerated growth within the industry but also boosted Brazil’s economy as a whole. 3. Promoting Financial Inclusion One of the key objectives of Brazil’s crypto regulations is to promote financial inclusion. With over 45 million unbanked adults in Brazil, blockchain-based solutions offer a way to bridge the gap and provide access to financial services for underserved populations. By establishing a secure and transparent environment, Brazil’s regulations are enabling financial institutions and businesses to leverage blockchain technology to reach new customers and provide them with more efficient and cost-effective services. 4. Enhancing Transparency Another significant impact of Brazil’s regulatory advancements is increased transparency in the cryptocurrency market. With clear guidelines on AML protocols, VASPs must adhere to strict compliance measures, reducing the risk of money laundering activities associated with cryptocurrencies. This transparency has also enhanced consumer protection, as individuals can now confidently engage in crypto transactions knowing that they are operating within a regulated framework. This has helped reduce the stigma surrounding cryptocurrencies and increased adoption rates within Brazil. Regional Influence of Brazil’s Crypto Regulations Brazil’s progressive regulations have also had a significant impact on other countries in the region, inspiring them to follow suit. Countries like Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia, which previously had restrictive policies towards cryptocurrencies, are now considering or implementing similar frameworks to promote innovation and economic growth. This regional cooperation is fostering a more robust and interconnected blockchain ecosystem across Latin America. As Brazil continues to shape the regulatory roadmap for crypto in the region, it is solidifying its position as a leader in the continent's blockchain future. Does Lightchain AI Push Brazil’s Regulatory Advancements? Lightchain AI (LCAI) has the potential to complement Brazil’s evolving crypto regulations by introducing advanced, AI-driven solutions for compliance and operational efficiency. As Brazil implements its Virtual Assets Law and prepares detailed regulations under the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB), Lightchain AI’s capabilities can streamline regulatory adherence for platforms and service providers. Its AI algorithms optimize KYC (Know Your Customer) processes, anti-money laundering (AML) protocols, and transaction monitoring, ensuring seamless compliance with Brazil’s strict standards.

As the Lightchain AI presale progresses, its tools can bridge the gap between Brazil's dynamic crypto landscape and technological advancements. What Are the Challenges for Blockchain & Crypto in Latin America? Although Brazil’s progressive crypto regulations have had a significant impact, the region still faces challenges in adopting and implementing blockchain technology. Some of these include: Lack of education and awareness Many individuals and businesses are unfamiliar with blockchain technology, hindering its adoption. Infrastructure limitations Limited access to internet services and technological infrastructure can impede the integration of blockchain-based solutions. Regulatory fragmentation Despite Brazil's advancements, other countries in Latin America have varying regulatory approaches towards cryptocurrencies, making it challenging for businesses to operate across borders. As the region continues to address these challenges, collaboration between governments, businesses, and educational institutions will be crucial to drive further growth and innovation in the blockchain industry. With continued efforts and advancements, Latin America has the potential to become a global leader in blockchain technology. Future Prospects for Blockchain in Latin America The future of blockchain in Latin America is bright, with Brazil leading the way. As more countries in the region follow suit and implement progressive regulations, it will foster a more interconnected and innovative ecosystem for blockchain technology. With increased investment, financial inclusion, transparency, and regional cooperation, Latin America's blockchain industry has the potential to drive significant economic growth and disrupt traditional industries. And with Lightchain AI's cutting-edge solutions complementing Brazil's regulatory advancements, this progress can accelerate even further.

Analysts express optimism about its potential, as it looks primed for a massive upward rally. 1Fuel can make crypto millionaires, too, making the presale one of the excellent crypto investments for 2025. New 1fuel Token Tipped To Make Crypto Millionaire The 1Fuel token is a prospective top coin with utility in DeFi. 1Fuel has numerous real-world uses that will drive its value and make it a profit-yielding crypto asset for investors. Currently, 1Fuel is an undervalued presale token, selling for $0.012 per unit. However, the token is projected to rally significantly by over 100x soon, making it a perfect buy for savvy investors. The project’s DeFi utilities will facilitate simple cross-chain transactions, enable faster peer-to-peer exchanges, and offer cold storage functions. 1Fuel will also offer better support, advanced security, privacy protection, and user experience, which will set it apart from conventional DeFi solutions and increase its propensity for high adoption. The crypto solution is expected to quickly become users’ favorite, making its predicted success a likely reality. The 1Fuel presale offers a chance to get maximum benefit from 1Fuel’s anticipated success, placing it among the excellent crypto investments for 2025. Shiba Inu Gears Up For Impressive Recovery As Shibarium Adoption Grows In the past month, Shiba Inu hit a $0.000032 yearly high from a $0.000023 market value, yielding a significant gain. According to experts, this impressive rally and Shiba Inu’s over 175% year-to-date return are highly driven by collaborations, Shibarium’s increased adoption, and the token burn mechanism. These factors are responsible for Shiba Inu’s growth and looks ready to continue in 2025. Shibarium is an Ethereum-based layer-2 solution developed for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It has over 2 million registered wallet addresses and averages 4 million transactions daily as of November. Shibarium has processed over 620 million transactions to date, and Shiba Inu is among the major beneficiaries of its growth. Experts say Shiba Inu will experience a further value increase as Shimarium usage skyrockets. The meme coin looks prepared to rally above the resistance at $0.000030 and hit $0.000050 soon. This makes Shiba Inu a prospective top-performing crypto asset in 2025. Dogecoin Gears Up For An Upside Movement After The Price Consolidation Phase According to Coinmarketcap, Dogecoin’s 7-day run reflects a 13% decline. However, the meme coin has maintained a stable price of around $0.40 during this period. Chart analysis suggests that Dogecoin would break out after this phase, with a projected 70% rise. This could see Dogecoin rally upward and test the $0.7 resistance. Analysts say Dogecoin could achieve this breakout if there are substantial buy actions around its $0.46 resistance point. Broader market factors like Bitcoin performance could also spur an upward Dogecoin surge, as every analysis suggests a potential bull run. Dogecoin currently trades at $0.39, following a slight decline from its strongest support zone. The meme coin is expected to reverse the dip soon and could surge beyond the current resistance level. Dogecoin is another potential top-performing crypto asset in 2025. It is poised to reward investors and may soon reach a new all-time high. Conclusion Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are still excellent crypto buys, but their yields may not be as high as they were in their early days. 1Fuel is currently one of the few crypto assets that can offer such explosive returns, and joining the presale is the only way to enjoy such a yield.

This surge comes after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to create a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve.

And made more bold predictions for ETH, Sol, and Links coins. Bitcoin Bold Predictions for 2024 In a recent tweet, Michael van de Poppe shared some bold predictions for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He believes Bitcoin could soar to between $300,000 and $500,000 during this cycle. In this cycle, I won't be surprised if we see the following numbers: – $BTC $300-500K – $ETH $15-25K – $SOL $1.5-2.5K – $LINK $250-300 I think we'll have a comparable cycle to 2017 with a lot of upside. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 16, 2024 His optimistic outlook is based on the idea that the upcoming crypto cycle could mirror the explosive rally of 2017 but with even greater growth potential.

Van de Poppe predicts that Ethereum could rise to anywhere between $15,000 and $25,000. With Ethereum’s upgrades, including its transition to Ethereum 2.0, and the dominance of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, the outlook for ETH is very bullish. Van de Poppe is also optimistic about other cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK). He forecasts that Solana could hit between $1,500 and $2,500, while Chainlink could surge to $250 to $300.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With a 500% price increase, DTX Exchange, a $10 million presale star, looks set to follow in the success of Ethereum and Ripple. Table of Contents DTX Exchange is turning heads in the crypto space Elja: Ethereum could reach $10k in 2025 Ripple rises, analyst foresees more growth What’s next for DTX Exchange, ETH and XRP? The crypto market has had many superstars, from Ethereum (ETH), which introduced smart contracts, to Ripple (XRP), which made cross-border payments seamless. Now, a new crypto currency is looking to make its mark in history: DTX Exchange (DTX) . This exchange token has managed to reach new heights during its presale, with its value up 500% so far. Some experts predict that this rookie could replicate the success of ETH and XRP. Since DTX may transform online trading, this prediction could come true. Therefore, many analysts think that DTX could see a potential 3x growth in 2025. DTX Exchange is turning heads in the crypto space Ethereum and Ripple started as underdogs before soaring to heights. Some experts think DTX Exchange could have the same potential. This presale star is now in phase six and has soared by 500%, raising over $10.2m. Not only that, DTX Exchange now boasts over 300k wallets, which shows the demand for this crypto coin. Interest in DTX is high since those holding it will benefit greatly. For instance, holders of this altcoin will get a percentage of the trading fee revenue generated by DTX Exchange, governance voting rights, and the ability to vote on future developments for this platform. One DTX costs just $0.12, a 500% rise from its starting price. However, this phase six presale price will rise to $0.20 after a Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap lists it. DTX Exchange will redefine online trading by closing the gap between DEX and CEX. Therefore, users will find the best of both in one place. They will get to experience fast transaction speeds of 0.04 seconds, privacy thanks to no sign-up KYC checks, and access to over 120k asset classes (crypto coins, stocks, gold, etc.). These factors could make DTX Exchange a fan-favorite for millions and DTX one of the top altcoins in the future. You might also like: This could be the end of the bull run or time to buy XRP & DTX at low prices Elja: Ethereum could reach $10k in 2025 Crypto analyst Elja recently made headlines with his Ethereum price prediction. In a recent X post, he told his followers that the time for this top 5 cryptocurrency is finally coming. He also set two Ethereum price targets: $5,000 and $10,000, which may come in 2025. The technical analysis supports this Ethereum price prediction. TradingView shows its value sits above its 10-day EMA ($3,866) and its 20-day EMA ($3,751). CoinMarketCap data now points to the Ethereum price sitting around $3,900, a 25% increase over the past 30 days. However, the Ethereum market cap grew from $380b to $470b. This means this altcoin will need more money for a noteworthy price surge. Meanwhile, tokens like DTX Exchange will not face this issue, which means faster returns for traders. Ripple rises, analyst foresees more growth Ripple is also making some headlines in the crypto market. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of XRP has increased over 100% on the monthly chart. During that time, its value moved between $1 and over $2. Crypto expert Amonyx excited traders with his Ripple price prediction. In a recent X post, he said that the next move for this altcoin will be massive. He made a bullish pennant target of $64 for Ripple. TradingView data also shows some good signs for the Ripple coin. Currently, XRP is trading above its 10-day EMA ($2.37). However, DTX Exchange boasts some advantages as its testnet TPS sits at over 100k while the TPS of the Ripple blockchain sits at 1,500. What’s next for DTX Exchange, ETH and XRP? Ethereum and Ripple are some of the top 10 altcoins right now, and they could see big price gains soon. However, DTX Exchange may also make a name for itself thanks to its connections to trillion-dollar financial markets like the $18t gold one. With some experts predicting a potential 3x price growth for DTX in 2025, traders see it as an opportunity not to miss out on.

IntelMarkets (INTL) is capturing the most attention in this space. Analysts compare it to big movers such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and even Ethereum (ETH). Since this phase eight presale star has already experienced a 710% pump, many experts foresee another 1,000% rally in 2025. This price prediction may come true since INTL will also tap into the AI market. IntelMarkets (INTL) Price Rises 710%, More Gains Ahead IntelMarkets (INTL) is now being compared to the early days of Ethereum (ETH) and the rise of Dogecoin (DOGE). Like these projects, IntelMarkets aims to bring something unique to the crypto space. It will launch the first AI-powered trading platform to tap into the AI market, which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030. This trading platform will stand out from its rivals thanks to these features: Self-Learning Trading Robots: Trading robots that improve their performance over time and do not repeat the same mistakes. Up to 1000x leverage: A 1000x leverage meaning a simple $100 investment could open up liquidity of up to $100,000. Dual-Exchange Functionality: It will be supported on both the Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) blockchains, which will give traders the flexibility they desire. The INTL native token will power these features. It is now in phase eight of its presale with a value of only $0.073, a 710% rise from its starting price of $0.009. However, the next presale stage will cause a jump to $0.082 for this altcoin. Plus, a Tier-1 crypto exchange listing like Uniswap is expected to push this value to $0.11 - a 50% return for all those who buy INTL now. Crow: The Price of Dogecoin (DOGE) May Rise Soon As one of the best meme coins, Dogecoin (DOGE) also turns some heads. Crypto analyst Crow excited traders with his recent X post. In it, he says that traders will see an easy play as this meme coin could surge to $1 soon. According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price has jumped nearly 5% in the past 30 days. During that time, its value moved between around $0.37 and over $0.40. Therefore, this Dogecoin price prediction has attracted many traders. The Dogecoin crypto now trades above its 50-day EMA ($0.34) and its 100-day EMA ($0.27), as per CoinMarketCap. However, the Dogecoin (DOGE) market cap sits at $58B, which means it will need more money for its value to rise. Coins like IntelMarkets will not have this issue. Ethereum (ETH) Sees Price Growth, Analyst Remains Bullish Ethereum (ETH) is among the top altcoins right now. CoinMarketCap shows its value has surged over 20% on the monthly chart. The Ethereum price increased from around $3,100 and nearly $4,000. Crypto analyst Poseidon also excited many traders for Ethereum (ETH). According to his recent X post, this altcoin will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the next four months. This Ethereum price prediction has made shockwaves in the market. TradingView data shows some bullish signs too. The Ethereum coin is trading above its 10-day EMA ($3,859). Although this altcoin could see big price gains, its highest upswings have ended as it soared over 70% in the past year. Thus, traders are turning to IntelMarkets. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Soar Like Dogecoin (DOGE) & Ethereum (ETH)? Although Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) may surge soon, experts are also bullish for IntelMarkets (INTL). Unlike these tokens, INTL will have a smaller market cap, so its value will rise faster. The comparison to DOGE and ETH also has some backing since INTL could have the structure, community support, and more to replicate their success. Because of all these factors, experts foresee a potential 1,000% rally for this crypto coin in 2025.

37757895,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628848,1734441197,"Hong Kong commits to global crypto tax reporting, first exchange set for 2028","Hong Kong is officially onboard with the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, promising to roll out a global crypto tax reporting system by 2028. On December 13, the government told the OECD’s Global Forum on Transparency and Effective Exchange of Information in Tax Matters that it will adopt the framework to tackle cross-border tax evasion and boost international tax transparency. Legislative changes will begin soon, and the clock is ticking. The framework, launched in June 2023, is a global reporting mechanism designed to close loopholes in crypto taxation. It forces tax jurisdictions to share data annually on crypto accounts and transactions involving their residents. Hong Kong’s crypto industry has become “directly relevant” to these efforts, according to the Global Forum. In response, the government will complete necessary legislative amendments by 2026, ensuring it can meet the first reporting deadline. Legislative overhaul: Clock starts now The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Hui Ching-yu, said the framework is critical for Hong Kong’s position as a major international financial hub. “Implementing the Reporting Framework is vital to maintaining Hong Kong’s reputation as an international financial and business center and reflects Hong Kong’s reputation as a responsible tax jurisdiction,” he said. The government’s plan is straightforward. Amend laws, prepare the industry, and begin automatic tax reporting. But it’s not just about following orders. Reciprocity is a non-negotiable condition: Hong Kong will only share data with partners that meet strict standards for confidentiality and security. Local lawmakers will also consult stakeholders and the public during the process. Hong Kong already has experience in this arena. Since 2018, the region has exchanged financial account information annually with tax jurisdictions worldwide. This includes data on foreign bank accounts, which tax authorities use to uncover hidden income. How the OECD’s crypto tax system will work The OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework applies to crypto-asset service providers, including exchanges, custodial wallets, and intermediaries. These providers will be required to collect detailed information on their users and transactions, including who owns the accounts, balances, and transaction histories. Once gathered, the data will be sent to tax authorities annually and shared between jurisdictions. Any user with a tax residency in a participating jurisdiction will find their crypto activity reported. In short, there’s no more hiding behind anonymous wallets or offshore platforms. Hong Kong’s exchanges and crypto firms will face a heavy lift. They’ll need to revamp their systems to track, secure, and share this data without breaking confidentiality rules. For some players, it’ll mean a big compliance bill. Smaller exchanges and wallet providers might struggle to keep up. The state of Hong Kong’s crypto regulations The Hong Kong government has spent the last two years remaking its regulatory landscape to support innovation while maintaining tight control. On June 1, 2023, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) came into force. It mandates all Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) rules. Under the current regime, platforms trading security tokens must obtain a license from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), while platforms handling non-security tokens like Bitcoin fall under AMLO’s licensing requirements. Both regimes demand strict compliance, with no exceptions. Hong Kong is also pushing forward with stablecoin regulations. In July 2024, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) released a consultation paper outlining a licensing framework for stablecoin issuers. This covers everything from governance to risk management and reserves. Only stablecoins issued by licensed entities will be available to retail investors. To prepare for the incoming regulations, the HKMA launched a sandbox program in March for stablecoin issuers. Meanwhile, licensing for VASPs remains competitive. As of press time, only OS Digital Securities Limited and Hash Blockchain Limited had secured full licenses. Fourteen other applicants are still in limbo. Interest is growing, but the bar remains high.

37757730,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394187,1734441055,Hidden Potential: This Underrated Crypto Could Leave Cardano and Dogecoin in the Dust,"The post Hidden Potential: This Underrated Crypto Could Leave Cardano and Dogecoin in the Dust appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Investors looking for rare crypto gems may have found one in 1Fuel . The budding presale token is currently undervalued, but it’s expected to outperform Dogecoin and Cardano soon. 1Fuel is gradually making a name for itself in the crypto landscape, and it could be among the best crypto buys for 2025. The presale token is eyeing huge buzz, and experts are not putting a 1000% post-presale surge past it. 1fuel Could Outperform Top Altcoins As Prominence Increases The 1Fuel token could be the biggest revelation in 2025 , as the budding token is fast gaining exposure. 1Fuel is one of the rare crypto gems that could yield explosive gains for investors. The presale token is poised for about 1000% and early presale investors will benefit the most from this expected boom. Essential real-world use in DeFi and the sector’s continuous growth will drive 1Fuel’s projected boom. The 1Fuel ecosystem will promote easy access to DeFi opportunities. The crypto solution will provide a better experience and ensure improved adoption of DeFi. 1Fuel will make all these happen by providing unique solutions to recurring concerns in DeFi. The crypto project will reduce the difficulties of cross-chain asset swaps, enable low transaction fees, provide offline asset storage, and facilitate faster peer-to-peer exchanges, among other things. Compared to others, 1Fuel will be more reliable, secure, easier to use, and private. The features and perceived importance of 1Fuel in DeFi increase its success propensity. This also makes the 1Fuel token a potential profit-yielding crypto asset. Cardano Eyes $2 In Q1 Despite Slow Recovery Pace Cardano’s price is currently in the consolidation phase. The crypto coin has been trying hard to break the resistance around $1.10 but keeps revolving around $1.08 – $1.11. Cardano broke free of the resistance before the current downtrend. The altcoin rallied to a $1.32 yearly high, yielding about 100% return in the past month. Cardano will need to find similar momentum now to make the $2 goal possible. Cardano bulls are making efforts to see the altcoin rise with strong buy actions, but the recovery pace has been very slow. Cardano appears increasingly unlikely to break through its current resistance level before the end of the year. However, the upcoming year may bring renewed optimism and opportunities for Cardano investors Experts believe the altcoin can rally beyond the resistance at $1.10 and $1.32 and settle above $2. Even with this prediction, many investors do not see Cardano as one of the best crypto buys for 2025. While the altcoin could yield good returns, they believe many other crypto assets can yield more. Dogecoin Likely To Hit New All-time High Soon As Bull Rally Looks Imminent Dogecoin might be ‘one impressive Bitcoin performance’ away from surpassing its $0.7 all-time high. Experts have always maintained that a good Bitcoin run makes other altcoins pump, and Dogecoin is hoping for such an effect. The meme coin has maintained price stability around $0.40 for quite a while and now eyes a major break out. Dogecoin investors are positive about an uptrend, but many hope a catalyst can help hasten it and make it more significant. Analysts believe Dogecoin will surge impressively in the coming year, regardless of the catalyst. The meme coin could do over 100% for new investors soon, while its overall yield in 2025 could surpass 500%. As always, Dogecoin looks promising and remains the top altcoin in the meme ecosystem. However, it needs to back up the bullish sentiment with actual profit yields. Conclusion The fast-growing 1Fuel is expected to dominate the crypto market soon and may outshine altcoins like Cardano and Dogecoin. 1Fuel is billed to rally impressively post-presale and early presale investors are likely to gain the most from its boom.

37759178,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/how-blockchain-analytics-is-improving-transparency-in-the-crypto-space,1734440783,How Blockchain Analytics Is Improving Transparency in the Crypto Space,"Blockchain analytics is revolutionizing the crypto space by providing unparalleled transparency and accountability across decentralized networks. Through advanced data tools, analytics platforms track transactions, monitor wallet activities, and detect illicit behavior, ensuring that blockchain ecosystems remain secure and trustworthy. This capability is particularly critical as the industry grows, bringing more users and regulatory scrutiny. Much like the innovations highlighted by the Lightchain AI Presale , blockchain analytics bridges trust gaps by offering actionable insights and enhancing compliance. By empowering users, regulators, and businesses with real-time data and transparency, blockchain analytics is shaping a more accountable and resilient cryptocurrency landscape, fostering widespread adoption and long-term sustainability. Importance of Transparency in the Crypto Space Transparency is a fundamental element of trust in any financial system. The lack thereof has been one of the biggest barriers to widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional finance, where centralized entities like banks and governments have visibility into transactions, blockchain networks are decentralized, making it challenging to track and monitor activities. The anonymity and pseudo-anonymity features that make cryptocurrency attractive also create opportunities for illicit actors to engage in money laundering, fraud, and other criminal activities. Blockchain analytics addresses these concerns by providing transparency across the entire network, from individual transactions to overall market trends. By doing so, it promotes trust among participants and enables regulatory compliance. Understanding Blockchain Analytics Blockchain analytics refers to the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data from blockchain networks. It involves using advanced technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence to track and monitor transactions, addresses, and other network activities. The goal of blockchain analytics is not only to detect suspicious or fraudulent behavior but also to provide meaningful insights into the overall health of the network. This includes identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies that can inform decision-making for users, businesses, and regulators. How Blockchain Analytics Works At its core, blockchain analytics tracks data from blockchain networks, such as transaction details, wallet addresses, and network nodes. This information is then processed and analyzed using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and anomalies. Blockchain analytics platforms also use data from external sources, such as exchanges, to cross-reference transactions and detect suspicious activities. This helps to create a more comprehensive view of the entire ecosystem. How Blockchain Analytics is Improving Transparency Blockchain analytics is not only enhancing transparency in the crypto space but also driving it forward. Here are some of the ways blockchain analytics is improving transparency in the crypto space: 1. Identifying Suspicious Activities One of the main benefits of blockchain analytics is its ability to identify and flag suspicious activities on the network. This includes tracking known scam addresses, detecting money laundering attempts, and identifying other illicit behaviors. By providing this information to users, businesses, and regulators, blockchain analytics promotes a safer environment for all participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 2. Promoting Compliance With regulatory scrutiny increasing in the crypto space, compliance has become a crucial aspect for businesses operating within it. Blockchain analytics provides real-time data and insights that can help businesses stay compliant with regulations. This not only benefits the businesses themselves but also promotes a more transparent and trustworthy industry for all stakeholders. 3. Enhancing User Trust Transparency is key to building trust in any financial system, and blockchain analytics plays a vital role in promoting this trust among users of cryptocurrencies. By providing visibility into transactions and network activities, users can have confidence that their funds are being handled securely. 4. Providing Market Insights Blockchain analytics platforms collect data from various sources, including exchanges, to provide comprehensive market insights. This enables investors and traders to make informed decisions based on accurate information, rather than speculation or rumors. This also helps to create a more stable and mature market, attracting more participants and driving growth in the industry. Real-World Applications of Blockchain Analytics Blockchain analytics has become a cornerstone in improving transparency and security in the crypto space. One key application is monitoring decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to identify and prevent illicit activities like wash trading or market manipulation. It also plays a crucial role in tracking wallet activities, enabling the detection of suspicious patterns, such as large, unexplained transfers often linked to hacks or scams. Blockchain analytics aids compliance with regulatory requirements by supporting KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) efforts. Additionally, it empowers investors and businesses with actionable insights, fostering trust in the ecosystem. Innovations like Lightchain AI further enhance these applications by integrating AI for real-time monitoring, as demonstrated in its groundbreaking Lightchain AI Presale initiative. Lightchain AI's Role in Advancing Analytics Lightchain AI is at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, enhancing analytics within decentralized ecosystems. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for executing AI computations, such as model training and data analysis, thereby improving network security and efficiency. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) serves as a dedicated computational layer, enabling developers to deploy AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps) seamlessly. By incorporating these innovations, Lightchain AI addresses challenges in scalability, privacy, and data sovereignty, fostering a more transparent and equitable blockchain ecosystem. Its recent presale success, raising over $2.2 million, underscores the growing confidence in its potential to revolutionize blockchain analytics. Why Lightchain Can Benefit the Crypto Industry With its innovative integration of AI and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI is poised to significantly impact the crypto industry. Its advanced analytics capabilities will not only promote transparency and compliance but also drive growth and adoption by providing valuable insights for businesses, investors, and regulators.

Building on that momentum, Xterio is set to launch “Befriend”, a gamified event where users interact with AI agents in scenarios that playfully explore AI connections. Participants will not only experience the latest advancements in conversational AI but also compete for rewards in a uniquely engaging experiment. A New Standard for AI Companionship What sets Xterio’s AI agents apart is their adaptability and trustworthiness. Operating on blockchain technology, these agents have on-chain ownership provenance and provide transparency in every interaction. Beyond gaming, Xterio envisions applications in education, mental health, and productivity, where AI agents can become true partners in daily life. “Imagine an AI companion that evolves with you—offering emotional support, meaningful conversations, and tailored experiences,” said Dani Yogamata, co-founder and CEO of Reka. “This partnership with Xterio brings cutting-edge AI technologies to life in ways that are both entertaining and profoundly human.” Positioning for the Future of AI and Web3 Xterio’s partnership with Reka also underscores its broader ambitions in the Web3 ecosystem. By integrating blockchain technology with advanced AI, the company is creating a secure and decentralized framework for training and deploying its emotional engines. Users contribute to AI development through interactions, with full confidence that their data remains private and under their control. Upcoming projects like “Palio”, Xterio’s first AI-native game slated for Q1 2025, promise to blend conversational AI with trading mechanics, showcasing the versatility of this technology. The Industry Impact The Xterio-Reka collaboration highlights a broader trend: the race to create AI that doesn’t just act smart but feels human. Emotional AI is poised to become a critical component of user engagement across gaming, Web3, and enterprise applications.

The team behind the project claims that it can process up to 1,400 transactions per second (tps) and achieve confirmation times under 10 seconds. Ethereum Scalability Issues As of December 2024, Ethereum (ETH) had risen over 80% year-to-date, underperforming compared to other top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) , which gained 154% and 206%, respectively. Ethereum performance in 2024 | Source: Coingecko BTC continued to attract investor attention due to its stronger deflationary model and efficient store-of-value narrative. Solana’s performance advantages made SOL a preferred asset among DeFi and NFT developers. While Bitcoin’s fixed supply and meticulously regulated inflation controls positioned it as a beacon of security, stability, and predictability, Ethereum’s net issuance was curtailed by a decline in gas fee burns. CoinShares’ latest analysis revealed that the proliferation of layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism had siphoned activity away from Ethereum’s primary layer-1 chain, reducing ETH supply burns to almost zero and diminishing the efficacy of Ethereum’s once-celebrated deflationary framework. Moreover, competing L1 blockchains with faster transaction processing and lower fees, such as Solana, saw exponential growth in their user bases. The number of monthly active addresses on the Solana network reached 138 million in October, marking a 245% increase since August. Simultaneously, Solana’s total value locked (TVL) surged, with year-to-date inflows capturing 2.7% of Ethereum’s TVL. Overall, the Ethereum network has experienced $6 billion in net outflows in 2024. No. Adding some context (and data) changes the story regarding flows to Solana from other chains Over the last month, @base is #1 in terms of net flows ($463m). @solana is #2 with $197m of net flows. @SuiNetwork #3 with $120m.

It leverages a network of authorized nodes for block validation. This method is believed to enhance efficiency by reducing the computational and energy demands characteristic of conventional Proof-of-Work systems. Marko Ratkovic, the CTO at Graphite Network , told Cryptonews that their blockchain addresses common challenges to crypto adoption, including a lack of trust, fears of financial loss, and concerns about scams, ultimately increasing user confidence. “Graphite marks a step forward by merging blockchain technology with a trust-based, inclusive financial model that enables both TradFi and Web3 users to participate securely,” he said. Entry Node Rewards Moreover, income generation is limited to validator nodes with substantial resources in other blockchains. Graphite’s transaction architecture introduces a passive income opportunity for entry-point (transport) nodes. Graphite will reward transport node operators with 50% of fees passing through their nodes while allocating the remaining 50% to block sealers. What are Entry-Point Nodes in #GraphiteNetwork ?

Entry-point nodes are the… — Graphite Network (@GraphiteNetwork) December 13, 2024 Reputation-Based Blockchain Another goal of Graphite is to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) with the core mechanics of Web3. They’ve introduced the following features: Account activation: Before starting with Graphite, each user activates their account with a small fee, enforcing the blockchain’s “One user, one account” policy to prevent multiple disposable wallets often associated with fraudulent activity. Multi-layered KYC verification: Graphite implements a tiered KYC system, starting with basic social media verification and expanding to higher levels in future releases. It gives users and businesses flexibility in managing their privacy without compromising transparency. KYC transaction filters: With Graphite, users can establish KYC transaction filters to block interactions with accounts that don’t meet their verification standards. Meanwhile, businesses can create custom, reputation-driven smart contracts tailored to specific user profiles. Trust Score: Similar to a credit rating in TradFi, a Trust Score metric underpins all reputation-based interactions on Graphite. It shows each account’s credibility, which relies on factors like KYC level, transaction history, etc. In addition to that, Graphite upholds privacy by using Zero Knowledge Proof technology for data verification and conducting all KYC processes off-chain. This approach ensures that a user’s sensitive data is never published on the blockchain, with only the final KYC level of a given wallet shared with Graphite. Moreover, the Graphite network has tagged addresses, which allow users to label wallets linked to specific entities. This functionality ensures proper fund usage while detecting any misuse on the blockchain. Graphite’s smart contracts can automatically block transactions from that source when the address is flagged as suspicious.

FOMO has been in play at the moment, which has submerged the risk associated with the token for a while. Therefore, the XRP price continues to display a huge bullish potential in the coming days, which may unfortunately follow a notable pullback. The anticipated launch of it’s native stablecoin, RLUSD, is speculated to increase the demand for XRP. With it’s debut over the XRP ledger and Ethereum chain, the XRP’s utility is expected to increase, mainly in terms of transactions and remittances. The token has sored over 12% in minutes as the rounds of RLUSD launch circulated the crypto space. Therefore, once the token is launched, the XRP price is believed to launch a massive bullish run, forming a new ATH probably above $4 shortly. The daily chart of XRP price suggests the token has just broken out from a decisive symmetrical triangle and is about to validate a rise above the final resistance zone below the yearly highs. The volume over the platform has risen considerably, making it the 4th most traded token after USDT, BTC, & ETH. Besides, the RSI has triggered a bullish divergence and rising over the RSI-based MA, which is a 14-day SMA. On the other hand, the MACD indicates a drop in the trading volume and a probable bullish crossover. Now that the technicals have turned bullish, the XRP price is believed to maintain a considerable ascending trend and eventually reach the yearly highs at 1 FIB. With this, the token will confirm a breakout from the bull flag, which may result in a similar rise as the pole of the pattern. Considering this, the next highs could be somewhere around $3.5 while the ATH still remains pretty aloof. In the coming weeks, the XRP price is believed to continue to test the upper target and eventually mark a new ATH at around $4.2 in the first few weeks of 2024.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | USDT | XRP,BTC | ETH | TRADING | USDT | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-is-the-largest-token-after-btc-eth-despite-trading-below-3-heres-what-to-expect-if-the-price-marks-an-ath/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Tether will also support StablR's operations with its recently unveiled tokenization platform Hadron, providing tools for compliance, know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks, risk management and secondary market monitoring.  The firms did not disclose the size of the investment nor the valuation. A Tether spokesperson told CoinDesk that Tether now has a ""significant equity position"" in StablR.  The investment is the latest example of Tether's strategy to keep a foothold in the EU by backing smaller issuers and providing services through its tokenization platform Hadron as the bloc's MiCA regulation enters into force by the end of this year.

The US Dollar's strength weakens the means of economic expansion, while the global marketplace continues to grow more competitive. Increasing trades in Bitcoin boosts Coinbase valuations as expenses peter away and transaction fees pile on. Over the past one year till date, the price performance of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been staggering, with a nearly 127% increase since the 14th of December last year till early trends on the 16th of December. This increase in interest (and valuation) is reflected in the rise of Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) - the premier exchange of choice for a rising number of large institutional investors for all products crypto-related - wherein its stock has risen 109% in the same period. Bitcoin vis-à-vis Fiat Currencies (Mostly the Dollar) Bitcoin has long been touted as a viable alternative - mostly the U.S. dollar in the face of U.S. government debt continuing to pile on. As it stands, BTC massively outperforms the U.S. Dollar Index or ""Dixie"" ( DXY ) which measures the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to a basket of currencies, principally the Euro (which comprises 57.6% of the basket). Source: Created by Sandeep G. Rao using data from Bloomberg BTC has seen bursts of high traded volumes throughout the year, with the biggest spikes happening since the end of the U.S. election, which ensures the return of former U.S. President Trump to the Oval Office for a second term. Meanwhile, the ""Dixie"" has only risen by a little under 5% in the same period. Note: The trading calendar for BTC and COIN as well as the tabulation of the ""Dixie"" follow differing session schedules. In all calculations, only common traded sessions are utilized to calculate comparative performance. The principle behind the ""basket of currencies"" concept is that there is an ""economic tug of war"" between a country and its trading partners: if the ""basket of currencies"" is cheaper, e.g. the ""Dixie"" is high, economic activity would have a greater incentive to shift to the trading partners and vice versa. The ""Dixie"" is hobbled in that it doesn't account for major U.S. trading partners such as China, Mexico, South Korea and Brazil; instead it only considers the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland. Institutions - both private and state - instead utilize Real Effective Exchange Rates (REERs) which is the nominal effective exchange rate (a measure of the value of a currency against a weighted average of several foreign currencies) divided by a price deflator or index of costs. The basket of currencies chosen are typically the country's largest trading partners to form a ""narrow"" REER or all major trading partners to form a ""broad"" REER. In ""broad"" REER terms, the U.S. Dollar is steeply disadvantaged relative to their ostensible peers in the Western Hemisphere. Source: Created by Sandeep G. Rao using data from Bloomberg It bears noting that the REERs aren't one-shop explainers of all things economic: these are to be taken in context. For instance: while India might show nearly similar levels of REER appreciation as the U.S., India's biggest deficit-running trading partners are the Gulf Cooperation Council in the Middle East (who supply oil), Russia (oil, coal and gas) and ASEAN countries in Southeast Asia (minerals and sundries). Given that China runs a deficit against India via the supply of goods such as electronics, et al. , the rapidly growing indigenous manufacturing sector - which never fully ceased to function despite cheap goods readily available next door - has been increasingly incentivized to produce goods locally to ameliorate this. As the U.S. dollar grew increasingly disadvantaged in export competitiveness, its European and Asian counterparts grew stronger in their REERs relative to the U.S. Absent China and its pegged currency, the REER trajectory might be entirely different for both India and the U.S. But, unlike India, the American manufacturing sector is a shell of its former self. The high value of the U.S. dollar acts as an impediment to the restoration of its high status in a competitive and widely distributed global marketplace. While President Trump had proposed (or threatened) tariffs across the board for all its trading partners, the World Trade Organization - whose global rule book was once acknowledged by the U.S. government itself as having helped established American manufacturing's dominance across the world - has already issued a caution that such plans are a ""lose-lose"" proposition for the United States and its economy. European think tanks are already advising their governments to form economic coalitions that exclude the United States while mandating for continued commitment to the WTO rule book. Government spending has long lubricated select wheels/sectors of the U.S. economy. Regardless of the composition of the American legislature, successive administrations have relentlessly increased spending, and it is somewhat unlikely that it would be any different in 2025. If President Trump were to follow his own recommendation made in 2023 and default on U.S. government debt obligations if spending cuts aren't made, the consequences for the U.S. dollar are going to be manifold and complex. As uncertainty clouds the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin's valuation prospered. Its rising valuation and interest among investors - in turn - boosted Coinbase. Coinbase: Trend Drilldown As of Q3 of 2024 (nine months or ""9M""), stablecoins that are tethered to the U.S. dollars have witnessed a fairly significant drawdown from the highs experienced in 2023. Meanwhile, transaction revenues mostly driven by crypto trading are showing early trends of resurgence in contribution to the bottom line. Source: Created by Sandeep G. Rao using data from Coinbase's Financial Statements Transactions have nearly bounced back to 2022 levels, while blockchain rewards and custodial fees are witnessing explosive growth relative to the doldrums of 2022 and 2023. This implies a net pick-up in investor interest in cryptocurrencies. The company's balance sheets also witnessed a boost in net incomes and EBITDA as technology development costs petered away and revenues soared with increasing crypto-centric transactions. Source: Created by Sandeep G. Rao using data from Coinbase's Financial Statements As volume trends indicated, Q4 witnessed a massive bump in traded volumes in BTC (as well as some other cryptocurrencies). Given lowered expenses, pass-through efficiencies from revenues to earnings can be expected to be even higher come Q4 results. In Conclusion While BTC has seen several speculative swings in its history, a number of those were ostensibly driven by longstanding concerns over the robustness of the U.S. economy and the outlook for fiat currencies (primarily the U.S. dollar). Whether BTC would be an effective substitute for the U.S. dollar in the global economy remains to be seen. However, it also bears noting that blockchain networks and use cases for digital tokens continue to evolve and find steadily surer footing in the digital economy. Currency proxy or not, current market trajectories indicate that a sizeable portion of investors deem that BTC is likely here to stay, which imparts the likes of Coinbase and its stock's valuation a generally positive and reasonably strong tailwind.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744755-us-dollar-concerns-drive-bitcoin-and-coinbase-valuations-through-the-roof?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37757487.jpeg

37757833,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/cyberpunk-city-transfers-to-solana-a-new-model-of-blockchain-gaming,1734440399,Cyberpunk City Transfers to Solana: A New Model of Blockchain Gaming,"Cyberpunk City, an upcoming Free 2-play AAA Hero Shooter Battle Royale Game, will move to the Solana Blockchain in early 2025. The migration will provide faster transactions, lower fees, and better game dynamics, and more users are expected to sign up. The switch from MultiversX to Solana improves the game’s back end and economy. Crypto casino game players prefer SOL crypto tokens due to their low gas fees and fast transaction speeds, which make them suitable for crypto casino gaming apps, as suggested by Webopedia . Solana Post Migration Benefits Low Trading Fees One of the major issues users face when transacting on a blockchain is the fees attached to transactions. For example, the high gas fees attached to Ethereum transactions are unsuitable options for multiverse gaming. However, the transaction fees on Solana are very cheap, so Solana is the ideal blockchain for hosting the Cyberpunk City game. As a result, players can easily trade in-game assets without incurring heavy transaction fees. Transaction Speed The speed of transactions is also a selling point of the Solana blockchain. The Solana blockchain boasts lightning-fast transaction processing speed, so in-game transactions will not be delayed during gameplay. As a result, players can trade in-game assets in real time without disrupting the game flow. Scalability Solana accommodates a large number of users while maintaining high efficiency. As a result, new players can join the game, and all playing conditions will remain the same. Developer Ecosystem Solana offers adequate tools and resources for developing new games and services, which allows Cyberdeck Studios to develop new game functionalities. Using Solana blockchain technology, Cyberpunk City intends to offer a quality gaming experience while incorporating elements of blockchain technology that would appeal to players. The GameShift Effect Cyberpunk City will employ Solana Labs' GameShift to ensure that the games are easily understandable and can be played by individuals with little or no knowledge about blockchain. This package of tools is designed to simplify the interactions with the blockchain, making it easier for everyone. Features of GameShift Account Abstraction Users are also automatically provided with non-custodial smart wallets without the need to create wallets themselves. Gasless Transactions In line with this, players can perform in-game activities involving the blockchain without worrying about the associated fees. Fiat and Crypto On/Off-Ramps It lets users deposit and withdraw funds using debit/credit cards, cryptocurrencies, and fiat money. NFT Marketplace There will be a separate marketplace through which the in-game assets can be bought, sold or rented. Tournament Support Organising in-game events and challenges will also be possible, encouraging the community's active participation. GameShift removes most hurdles associated with using blockchain technology in games so that Cyberpunk City can appeal to normas and blockchain gamers. Key Impacts of GameShift Player Ownership The integration of the Solana blockchain allows players to own their in-game assets, which can be traded, sold or lent. Scalable Economy The Solana blockchain enables a flexible economy system where in-app purchases are not a barrier to entry. Mainstream Adoption GameShift technology makes it easier for traditional gamers to understand blockchain technology, thus making them embrace Web3 games. The migration of Cyberpunk City to Solana is a strong example for any future blockchain game; it shows how technology can be integrated into a game to improve players' overall experience and involvement $CYBER Token to $CYB Token Migration Cyberpunk City will also change from using the $CYBER token to the new $CYB token. This change in the game’s token brings the game’s economy in line with the Solana ecosystem and thus improves the token's efficiency. After the move to Solana is completed, all holders of $ CYBER tokens will have their tokens converted to $CYB tokens at a ratio of 1:10. The Token Generation Event (TGE) for $CYB is expected to happen in 2025, specifically in January. Also, the new $CYB token holders can participate in the latest rewards, including the staking of tokens for interest. Development Roadmap Cyberdeck Studios has developed a long-term plan for developing Cyberpunk City, which will serve as the game’s roadmap. The timeline includes key milestones that will shape the game's future. Q2 2025 The alpha demo will be released as a training map to familiarise players with the basic mechanics. Q3 2025 Introducing deathmatch mode to increase the diversity of the games that can be played. Q4 2025 Implementing some more features and working towards launching a closed beta version of the game. Q1-Q2 2026 Closed beta testing, integrating $CYB tokens and the NFT marketplace. Q4 2026 Open a beta test of the game to showcase all the features of the game on the Solana blockchain. This roadmap shows that Cyberpunk City is committed to offering a much more polished and enjoyable gaming experience. Challenges and Opportunities Moving to Solana has several benefits but one must also recognise the risks. Transitioning an entire ecosystem to a different blockchain is difficult because many issues must be addressed. It remains to be seen whether Cyberdeck Studio can seamlessly migrate the whole system and thus regain the players’ confidence. However, adopting Solana allows Cyberpunk City to interact with many developers, investors, and players, thus giving it a superior position in the Web3 gaming category. The transition from MultiversX to Solana is a technological shift and a daring leap for Cyberpunk City in Blockchain Gaming. With the recent developments and the progressive roadmap, it is safe to say that Cyberpunk City has set a trend that others will have to follow.

37757419,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110768,1734440299,Grayscale Research Predicts Current Bull Run Could Extend Into 2025 and Beyond,"Grayscale Research Predicts Current Bull Run Could Extend Into 2025 and Beyond Grayscale Research , a leading authority in cryptocurrency market analysis, has released a report suggesting that the current crypto bull run could potentially extend into 2025 and beyond . Unlike previous market cycles that adhered to a predictable four-year pattern , Grayscale believes the market’s trajectory could be influenced by new developments such as the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products (ETPs) and evolving macroeconomic conditions. This outlook signals an optimistic future for crypto assets, provided that key fundamentals—like application adoption , institutional interest , and supportive macro trends—continue to drive growth in the market. Breaking the Historical Four-Year Crypto Cycle Historically, cryptocurrency valuations have followed a recurring four-year cycle , marked by periods of intense growth (bull markets) followed by corrective phases (bear markets). This cycle has often been closely tied to the Bitcoin halving events , which occur roughly every four years and reduce the rate of new Bitcoin supply entering the market. However, Grayscale Research indicates that the crypto market is now undergoing significant structural changes, driven by: The Introduction of Spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs: These investment vehicles allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies through regulated markets without holding the underlying asset. Growing Political Support: The entry of crypto-friendly officials into the U.S. Congress is likely to pave the way for favorable regulatory frameworks. With these factors in play, Grayscale predicts that the market could see a longer and more sustained bull run that breaks away from the traditional four-year cycle. Spot ETPs: A Game-Changer for Crypto Adoption One of the primary drivers behind Grayscale’s bullish outlook is the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products (ETPs) . These financial instruments allow institutional and retail investors to trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in traditional markets, creating a bridge between the crypto ecosystem and mainstream finance. The benefits of spot ETPs include: Increased Institutional Participation: Institutional investors, such as hedge funds and pension funds, can gain exposure to cryptocurrencies through a regulated and familiar investment vehicle. Enhanced Liquidity: Spot ETPs can attract significant capital inflows, improving overall market liquidity. Greater Accessibility: Retail investors can invest in cryptocurrencies without dealing with complex wallets and exchanges. By broadening access to Bitcoin and Ethereum, these ETPs are expected to fuel demand and support higher valuations, further extending the bull market. Macro Market Conditions Supporting the Crypto Bull Run Grayscale also highlights the importance of broader macroeconomic factors that could sustain the current bull run. Some of the key drivers include: Inflation and Monetary Policy: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often seen as a hedge against inflation . With global concerns over rising inflation and potential shifts in monetary policy, investors may continue to flock to crypto as a store of value. Global Economic Uncertainty: Economic instability and currency devaluations in various countries could boost demand for decentralized assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Improving Regulatory Clarity: With the entry of crypto-friendly lawmakers in the U.S. Congress, regulatory clarity around crypto investments and digital assets could encourage further adoption. If these macroeconomic trends remain favorable, Grayscale believes the crypto market will continue to experience sustained growth through 2025 and beyond. Application Adoption: A Fundamental Growth Driver Another key pillar of Grayscale’s bullish thesis is the increasing adoption of crypto applications across various industries. Blockchain technology is rapidly gaining traction in areas such as: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Platforms that offer lending, borrowing, and trading services without intermediaries are continuing to attract users. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): NFTs have emerged as a major trend in gaming, digital art, and entertainment. Enterprise Blockchain Solutions: Businesses are increasingly integrating blockchain for supply chain management, payments, and data verification. The growing real-world utility of blockchain applications provides a strong foundation for long-term crypto market growth. Grayscale emphasizes that as adoption expands, valuations will be supported by tangible use cases and increasing demand. The Role of Ethereum and Bitcoin in the Next Growth Phase Grayscale’s report pays special attention to the leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , as critical drivers of the market’s continued expansion. Bitcoin (BTC): Often referred to as “digital gold,” Bitcoin remains a dominant asset class and a reliable hedge against economic uncertainty. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETPs is expected to attract significant institutional investment, driving further price appreciation. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum remains the backbone of the blockchain ecosystem, powering smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and ERC-20 tokens . The ongoing improvements to Ethereum, such as the move to Ethereum 2.0 , are enhancing scalability and efficiency, which will further boost its adoption. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are poised to play pivotal roles in extending the current bull run. Crypto-Friendly Officials: A Regulatory Boost for Adoption The entry of crypto-friendly officials into the U.S. Congress is another critical factor highlighted by Grayscale. Regulatory uncertainty has historically been a major hurdle for crypto adoption. However, with increasing political support, the regulatory landscape may shift in favor of digital assets. Potential impacts include: Increased Institutional Confidence: Clearer regulations will attract institutional investors who have previously been hesitant to enter the crypto market. Innovation and Growth: A supportive regulatory framework will encourage further innovation in blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Grayscale believes that this shift could act as a catalyst, extending the bull market into 2025 and beyond. Conclusion Grayscale Research’s latest report offers an optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency market, predicting that the current bull run could extend well into 2025 and beyond . Factors such as the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs , favorable macro market conditions , increasing application adoption , and growing political support are expected to drive this extended growth phase. By breaking free from the traditional four-year cycle , crypto valuations could enter a new era of sustained growth. Investors, both retail and institutional, are watching closely as the market evolves with promising developments that bridge the gap between blockchain technology and mainstream finance.

37757361,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110773,1734440260,U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs Record $51.1M Net Inflows for 16th Consecutive Day,"U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs Record $51.1M Net Inflows for 16th Consecutive Day U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs are continuing their impressive streak of net inflows, recording a combined $51.1 million on December 16 , according to data from Farside Investors . This marks the 16th consecutive day of positive inflows, signaling growing investor confidence and heightened interest in Ethereum (ETH) as a regulated investment product. Leading the inflows were major players like BlackRock , Bitwise , Grayscale , and Fidelity , whose ETFs captured the lion’s share of investments. Breakdown of Ethereum ETF Net Inflows The net inflows of $51.1 million on December 16 were led by prominent asset management firms: BlackRock’s ETHA: $30.7 million Bitwise’s ETHW: $8.7 million Grayscale’s ETH: $7.6 million Fidelity’s FETH: $4.1 million Other spot Ethereum ETFs reported no significant inflows or outflows , indicating that investor attention remains concentrated on the leading funds. This consistent growth underscores Ethereum’s increasing adoption as an institutional-grade asset, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market. 16-Day Streak: What’s Driving Ethereum ETF Inflows? The 16-day streak of positive net inflows highlights several factors driving investor interest in spot Ethereum ETFs : Regulated Investment Options: Spot Ethereum ETFs provide a compliant and secure way for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Ethereum’s Strong Fundamentals: Ethereum’s role as the leading platform for smart contracts , DeFi , and NFTs positions it as a core asset in the blockchain ecosystem. Investor Confidence: The involvement of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity lends credibility to Ethereum-based products, attracting long-term investors. Macro Market Trends: Broader optimism in the cryptocurrency market, combined with favorable macroeconomic conditions, has spurred demand for regulated crypto investments. BlackRock Leads the Charge with ETHA ETF BlackRock’s ETHA ETF was the clear leader on December 16, accounting for $30.7 million of the total inflows. BlackRock’s dominance in the Ethereum ETF space reflects the firm’s reputation and ability to attract institutional capital. The success of BlackRock’s ETHA highlights growing institutional interest in Ethereum as a digital asset, following the trend of spot Bitcoin ETFs , which have also seen strong demand this year. The Role of Grayscale and Fidelity In addition to BlackRock, Grayscale and Fidelity—two established names in the crypto investment space—also reported significant inflows: Grayscale ETH ETF: With net inflows of $7.6 million, Grayscale’s offering continues to attract both retail and institutional investors looking for exposure to Ethereum. Fidelity’s FETH ETF: Fidelity added $4.1 million in inflows, demonstrating steady demand for its spot Ethereum ETF. Grayscale’s success builds upon its existing reputation as a pioneer in crypto investment products, while Fidelity’s well-established client base adds further momentum to the Ethereum ETF market. What Makes Spot Ethereum ETFs Attractive? Spot Ethereum ETFs offer several advantages over other investment vehicles, making them particularly attractive to a wide range of investors: Direct Exposure to Ethereum: Unlike futures-based ETFs, spot ETFs directly track the price of Ethereum, providing more accurate performance for investors. Regulatory Compliance: Registered under U.S. financial regulations, spot ETFs offer investors peace of mind regarding security and transparency. Institutional Accessibility: These ETFs allow institutional players to include Ethereum in their portfolios without the complexities of crypto custody. Simplified Investment Process: Spot ETFs remove the need for investors to set up crypto wallets or deal with exchanges, streamlining the investment process. Ethereum’s Growing Market Position Ethereum’s strong performance and increasing institutional adoption are pivotal to the success of spot ETFs. As the backbone of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi , and NFTs , Ethereum’s utility and demand continue to grow. Upcoming developments such as scalability improvements via Ethereum 2.0 and greater energy efficiency further strengthen Ethereum’s long-term outlook. These advancements make Ethereum an attractive asset for investors seeking exposure to blockchain technology. Impact on the Broader Crypto Market The success of spot Ethereum ETFs could have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market: Increased Institutional Adoption: Continued inflows into Ethereum ETFs will likely encourage other institutional investors to enter the crypto space. Market Credibility: The rise of regulated ETFs enhances the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Increased Demand for Other Crypto ETFs: The success of Ethereum ETFs may pave the way for similar products for other cryptocurrencies like Solana or Polkadot. Conclusion The U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs’ 16-day streak of inflows, culminating in $51.1 million on December 16, underscores the growing confidence in Ethereum among institutional and retail investors. Led by BlackRock, Bitwise, Grayscale, and Fidelity, this milestone reflects Ethereum’s strong fundamentals and its growing role in mainstream financial markets. As Ethereum continues to drive innovation in decentralized finance and digital applications, the success of spot ETFs highlights its enduring value. The inflows also signify a broader trend of institutional adoption, which could propel the cryptocurrency market to new heights in the coming years.

37757354,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394177,1734440185,BlackRock vs. MicroStrategy: Who Holds the Better Bitcoin Strategy?,"The post BlackRock vs. MicroStrategy: Who Holds the Better Bitcoin Strategy? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF now holds about 2.55% of all Bitcoin, showing that big financial companies are buying a lot of Bitcoin . This has raised concerns because many people worry that institutions like BlackRock might be going against the idea of Bitcoin being decentralized. Even though BlackRock isn’t directly buying Bitcoin, its clients and investors are driving this buying spree. The main worry is that because BlackRock controls the ETF, it could gain too much influence over Bitcoin, potentially moving it away from its original decentralized goals and toward more centralized control. Mark Yusko Insight on Blackrocks Bitcoin ETF Accumulation In response to the market concern, Mark Yusko recently called Bitcoin accumulation by institutions like BlackRock a scam, suggesting a scenario where these institutions could own most of Bitcoin and the government might seize it. However, this idea seems unlikely because such a confiscation would affect not just “bad actors” but also everyday people, pension funds, and institutions holding Bitcoin through ETFs. Even if the government tried to seize Bitcoin, Yusko points out that Bitcoin’s divisibility means the remaining supply would still hold significant value. He believes that one entity leading the pack can cause Bitcoin ETF dominance to go directly into the hands of those still holding it, making it nearly impossible for any one entity to fully control Bitcoin. Bitcoin by nature is decentralized however if Blackrock gains dominance it might turn it towards a centralized approach. This can create a market crash situation if they start selling their Bitcoin holdings similar to the Mt.Gox crash . Institutional adoption is driving Bitcoin’s surge! Check out the Bitcoin price prediction to see how mainstream investments could skyrocket its future value! MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Leverage Strategy: A Calculated Risk? On the other hand, MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, has been raising debt to purchase more Bitcoin, which has drawn mixed reactions. While leverage can be risky, Saylor’s strategy is unique because the debt is secured by Bitcoin itself. Each time MicroStrategy issues bonds or raises equity, it accumulates more Bitcoin than the value of the debt, capturing additional value. The key to Saylor’s approach lies in moderation. Excessive leverage—like the 50x or 100x seen in risky crypto trades—can be catastrophic, but MicroStrategy’s debt levels remain within a prudent range. The company is betting on Bitcoin as an appreciating asset while borrowing in a depreciating fiat currency, a trade Yusko considers smart financial engineering. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37757311,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110775,1734440139,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Surges 40% in 2024, Hits All-Time High","Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Surges 40% in 2024, Hits All-Time High Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty has surged by 40% in 2024, reaching a record-breaking 108.52 trillion on December 16 , according to data from CloverPool , as reported by CryptoSlate . This latest adjustment, which reflects a 4.43% increase , marks a new all-time high, further underscoring the intense competition among Bitcoin miners and the growing resilience of the Bitcoin network. What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty? Bitcoin mining difficulty is a key metric that measures how hard it is for miners to solve the complex mathematical puzzles required to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The difficulty adjusts approximately every 2,016 blocks —or roughly every two weeks —to maintain a consistent block production time of 10 minutes . Higher difficulty means it requires more computational power (hash rate) to mine Bitcoin, signaling increased participation from miners and a more secure blockchain network. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits 108.52 Trillion On December 16, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty rose by 4.43% , reaching an unprecedented 108.52 trillion . This milestone reflects a significant increase in the overall computing power being deployed by miners to secure the network. To put this in perspective: The year-to-date increase of 40% highlights Bitcoin’s growing hash rate and competition among miners. Rising difficulty often correlates with an increase in Bitcoin price and mining profitability, as more miners join the network to capitalize on market opportunities. Factors Driving the Rise in Bitcoin Mining Difficulty The sharp rise in Bitcoin mining difficulty can be attributed to several key factors: Increasing Hash Rate The hash rate, which measures the total computational power of the Bitcoin network, has steadily increased throughout 2024. A higher hash rate means more miners are actively participating, pushing difficulty levels higher. This surge is driven by advancements in mining hardware, including more efficient ASIC miners that can perform more hashes per second with lower energy consumption. Bitcoin Price Recovery Bitcoin’s price movements often influence mining activity. As BTC prices rise, mining becomes more profitable, incentivizing more miners to deploy resources and secure the network. The anticipation of higher prices due to macroeconomic conditions and institutional adoption has likely spurred mining competition. Network Security and Stability Rising mining difficulty enhances Bitcoin’s security by making it harder for malicious actors to compromise the network. The decentralized competition ensures the integrity of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Post-Halving Momentum While the next Bitcoin halving event (expected in 2024) will reduce mining rewards by 50%, miners have already ramped up operations in anticipation of price appreciation to offset reduced block rewards. Implications of Rising Mining Difficulty The record-breaking rise in Bitcoin mining difficulty has several significant implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem: Greater Network Security A higher difficulty makes the Bitcoin blockchain more secure against potential attacks, as compromising the network would require an astronomical amount of computational power. Increased Mining Competition The surge in difficulty means that miners need to invest in more efficient hardware and lower energy costs to remain profitable. This could accelerate the shift to renewable energy solutions and innovative mining technologies. Impact on Smaller Mining Operations Smaller mining operations may struggle to compete with larger players, leading to further centralization of mining power. However, innovations like mining pools allow smaller participants to collaborate and share rewards. Correlation with Bitcoin Price Historically, increases in mining difficulty have often coincided with bullish trends in Bitcoin’s price. While not a guaranteed indicator, rising difficulty signals strong miner confidence in the network’s future profitability. Hash Rate Growth and the Role of Mining Hardware The surge in mining difficulty has paralleled the increase in Bitcoin’s hash rate, which has hit record highs throughout 2024. This growth can be largely attributed to the deployment of advanced mining hardware, including: Next-Generation ASICs: These devices offer higher efficiency and processing power, allowing miners to contribute more hash power while consuming less energy. Sustainable Energy Solutions: Miners are increasingly turning to renewable energy sources like solar, hydro, and wind to reduce costs and improve profitability in the face of rising difficulty. The adoption of energy-efficient solutions not only ensures profitability but also addresses growing concerns about Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. Mining Profitability Amid Rising Difficulty While higher difficulty makes mining more challenging, profitability remains a key consideration for miners. Factors that influence mining profitability include: Bitcoin Price Movements: Rising BTC prices can offset the challenges posed by increasing difficulty. Energy Costs: Miners with access to cheap and renewable energy have a competitive edge in maintaining profitability. Hardware Efficiency: Upgrading to efficient ASICs helps miners maximize their hash rate while minimizing operational expenses. Despite the challenges, the sustained increase in mining activity reflects long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value and adoption. What’s Next for Bitcoin Mining? As Bitcoin mining difficulty continues to surge, the following trends are likely to shape the industry: Consolidation of Mining Operations: Larger, well-capitalized mining firms will continue to dominate, while smaller operations may join forces through mining pools. Focus on Sustainability: The shift toward renewable energy will accelerate as miners seek to reduce costs and address environmental concerns. Pre-Halving Preparations: With the next Bitcoin halving event approaching, miners will optimize operations to remain competitive despite reduced rewards. Global Mining Expansion: Countries with abundant and cheap energy resources, such as Iceland , Kazakhstan , and parts of the U.S., will attract increased mining activity. Conclusion The 40% surge in Bitcoin mining difficulty in 2024, culminating in an all-time high of 108.52 trillion on December 16, reflects the network’s growing strength and miner confidence. This milestone highlights rising competition among miners, driven by increasing hash rates, advanced hardware adoption, and the anticipated Bitcoin halving. While higher difficulty poses challenges for smaller operations, it strengthens Bitcoin’s security and underscores its resilience as the world’s leading decentralized network. As the crypto market evolves, rising mining activity signals sustained optimism about Bitcoin’s long-term value and adoption.

37757416,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628858,1734440092,Gaming tokens in trouble as the SEC serves CyberKongz with a Wells Notice,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating a security claim again, this time regarding another gaming token. To that end, Cyberkongz has notified its users that the SEC has issued it a Wells Notice for not registering the blockchain game as a security. The NFT gaming project Cyberkongz told its users that the project has been suffering in silence for the last two years, ever since they first received contact from the SEC. The project said in an X post , “Throughout the entire process, they have showcased a complete lack of understanding of blockchain technologies that has resulted in unjust accusations and information inaccuracies.” Cyberkongz has, however, declared that it is a relief to have these restrictions abolished and to have this information made public. According to the project, CyberKongz is deeply rooted in gaming. It provides users with features such as randomly generated 2D and 3D avatar NFTs used in “play & kollect” games on the Ronin blockchain. Why the SEC issued the Wells notice CyberKongz stated, “SEC’s division of enforcement have approached us with very concerning rhetoric that you can not have a token (ERC-20) in tandem with a blockchain game without registering it as a security.” In addition, the project claimed that the SEC has also demonstrated a strange interpretation of smart contracts. Cyberkongz also revealed that one of their major concerns is around the “sale” of Genesis Kongz in April 2021, which was a contract migration. The project asserted, “If they cannot distinguish between a primary sale and a contract migration, what hope do we currently have for a clear regulatory pathway going forward?” The issue of entity assets being called securities has become a common problem in the digital assets landscape. XRP has been on this with the SEC for a period of time. It is one of the most anticipated issues for the new administration by the crypto industry. According to on-chain data, the project’s floor price remains steady at 8.2 ETH ($32,800), up 14.4% over 24 hours. Market expectations after the Wells Notice A Wells notice is a formal letter that the SEC issues to notify an entity that the regulator has completed a preliminary investigation and is considering enforcement action. CyberKongz will be granted a 30-day period to submit a response. So far, in 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has taken legal action against six digital asset companies. Also, it has sent Wells letters to an additional six people, informing them that they are under investigation. Three lawsuits and Wells notifications allege unregistered securities offerings. The remaining charges filed against crypto companies are related to securities fraud. In 2023, the SEC sued 31 crypto firms, accusing them of violating US securities law. Some of the most high-profile cases involve actions taken against crypto exchanges such as Beaxy, Bittrex, Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. The current administration, led by President Biden, has fined entities millions and billions of dollars. The SEC also imprisoned the founder of Binance. The SEC is known to antagonize entities when they appear in its crosshairs. However, Cyberkongz asserted, “It has become increasingly apparent that the current administration is trying to force their anti-crypto agenda at the last minute. We hope that the new administration puts an end to this unjustness on our industry, but until then we will fight for NFT projects on all chains.” Are gaming tokens in trouble? It seems as though the SEC is after gaming tokens. Recently, the commission also issued a Wells Notice to Web3 gaming firm, Immutable. Immutable said, “With this action, the SEC is continuing to indiscriminately assert that tokens are securities. While not specified in the notice, we believe its claims are targeting the listing and private sales of IMX in 2021.” Immutable, however, asserted that the IMX token is not a security despite the SEC’s indiscriminate claim that tokens throughout the industry are securities. One of the founders of Axie Infinity, Jihoz Zirlin, has expressed his confidence in the CyberKongz team, stating that he is confident that the new administration will end the persecution of “our industry.” Insane for the SEC to target a project like @CyberKongz . Always wanted the best for the space. Always strived for innovation. Always tried to lift others. Taking this fight is one of the most important moments for NFT projects.

37758403,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52398,1734440065,"As XRP, XLM, ADA Rises, Here Are Strategies to Help On the Other Side","In a recent tweet, business leader and investor Jake Claver emphasized the critical need for effective wealth management strategies following the digital assets’ bull runs. Cryptocurrencies like XRP , XLM, HBAR, ALGO, ADA, and XDC continue to generate substantial returns for their holders, Claver outlined a comprehensive framework to safeguard and grow wealth after price appreciation. Below is an analysis of the key strategies he proposed, aimed at helping individuals prepare for the complexities of wealth management in the digital age: Building a Wealth Management Team: Claver’s first recommendation is to establish a team of professionals, including an attorney, a CPA, and a wealth advisor. This team serves as the foundation for informed decision-making and ensures that the individual is legally and financially prepared for the responsibilities that follow significant wealth. Once the team is in place, Claver advises informing close family members in a structured sequence to maintain transparency and control. Creating a Personal Wealth Committee: To achieve a balance between strategic planning and maintaining healthy relationships, Claver suggests forming a personal wealth committee. This committee brings together a board of advisors to provide objective guidance, a family board to address familial interests and align them with financial goals, and a professional team to handle daily operations and implement the wealth management strategy. By integrating these elements, the structure ensures efficient decision-making while minimizing potential conflicts among stakeholders. Supporting Family and Setting Boundaries: When supporting family members financially, Claver recommends prioritizing gifts over loans to avoid unnecessary strain on relationships. Gifts should be documented using IRS Form 709 and take advantage of the $13.6 million lifetime gift tax exemption. Clear boundaries and proper documentation are essential for maintaining trust and ensuring the sustainability of wealth. In cases where family members seek investments in their business ventures, Claver advises setting a formal process. Proposals should include detailed business plans and be reviewed by the financial committee. This ensures that decisions are based on merit rather than emotional considerations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Advanced Trust Structures for High-Value Asset Holders: For individuals holding over $20 million in digital assets, advanced trust structures are essential. Claver highlights the importance of Asset Protection Trusts to shield wealth from creditors and legal claims, while internal and external LLCs can effectively manage credit and operations. Incorporating C-Corporations enables efficient management, and Dual Living Trusts provide added security for spouses. Together, these structures enhance tax efficiency and asset protection, offering peace of mind for wealth holders. Why Wyoming is a Preferred Jurisdiction: Wyoming is a top destination for digital asset protection due to its strong privacy laws, attorney-client privilege, absence of state taxes, and low maintenance costs. Claver highlights the importance of establishing protective structures in jurisdictions like Wyoming before assets significantly appreciate. Timing and Flexibility: Timing plays a crucial role in wealth management. Claver suggests setting up structures early and considering a tax year ending on September 30 instead of December 31 to increase flexibility. Collaborating with professionals who can adapt to changing markets and personal circumstances is vital for long-term success. Claver concludes with a clear message: Start planning early. Establishing protective structures and assembling a wealth management team before assets appreciate is essential. A personalized approach, tailored with the help of legal and tax professionals, is key to effectively navigating the complexities of digital asset wealth.

37757251,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110783,1734440033,"Altcoin Season Index Falls to 62, Still Signals Active Altcoin Season","Altcoin Season Index Falls to 62, Still Signals Active Altcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index , a key metric used to gauge the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, registered a score of 62 at 00:33 UTC on December 17 , according to data from CoinMarketCap (CMC) . This marks a slight decline of one point from the previous day but still indicates that the cryptocurrency market remains firmly in Altcoin Season . The index, which measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies over the past 90 days , highlights that a majority of altcoins continue to outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ), signaling sustained investor interest in alternative digital assets. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index tracks the relative performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens . Its scoring mechanism ranges from 1 to 100 and is updated daily to reflect market conditions. The two primary classifications include: Altcoin Season: At least 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season: Fewer than 25% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin during the same period. With a current score of 62 , the market is still experiencing Altcoin Season , though the slight dip suggests a modest shift in momentum. Key Factors Driving Altcoin Performance The persistence of Altcoin Season can be attributed to several critical factors that have driven altcoin demand and market activity in recent months: Diverse Utility and Innovation Altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , and Polkadot (DOT) continue to lead the market by offering innovative use cases, including DeFi , NFTs , and smart contract solutions. Growing adoption of altcoin-based ecosystems and projects drives investor confidence. Lower Entry Costs Compared to Bitcoin, many altcoins offer a lower price point for investors, attracting both retail and institutional interest seeking greater upside potential. Emerging Layer-2 Solutions Layer-2 scaling solutions and blockchain upgrades have enhanced the performance and scalability of altcoin networks, further boosting investor demand. Crypto Market Diversification With Bitcoin often seen as the “store of value,” altcoins attract traders looking to diversify their crypto portfolios and explore higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Altcoin Season Trends: What the Index Tells Us The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for identifying market trends and shifts between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin growth. Altcoin Season (Current Score: 62): Indicates that a majority of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin, reflecting strong investor interest in the broader cryptocurrency market. Slight Decline (-1 Point): The one-point drop from the previous day suggests a minor shift, though it is not yet significant enough to signal a reversal toward Bitcoin Season. For investors, understanding this index provides insights into market sentiment and helps guide trading and investment strategies. Impact on the Crypto Market The current Altcoin Season reflects the resilience of alternative cryptocurrencies and their growing role in the broader market. The performance of key altcoins often has ripple effects across the crypto ecosystem: Increased Trading Volume: Altcoins see higher trading activity as traders seek to capitalize on their outperformance. Broader Market Sentiment: A strong Altcoin Season boosts overall market sentiment, attracting new entrants and driving further adoption. Bitcoin Dominance: During Altcoin Seasons, Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization tends to decline as capital flows into altcoins. This pattern often signals opportunities for traders to rebalance their portfolios toward high-performing altcoins. How Altcoin Season Impacts Key Players Several altcoins have emerged as top contenders during the current Altcoin Season. These include: Ethereum (ETH): Leading the way with its growing role in DeFi and the expansion of its Layer-2 ecosystem. Solana (SOL): Known for its scalability and low fees, Solana has gained traction in both DeFi and NFTs. Polygon (MATIC): A key player in Layer-2 scaling solutions, improving transaction efficiency for Ethereum-based projects. Chainlink (LINK): Driving innovation with its decentralized oracle networks. These altcoins continue to attract significant attention, contributing to the broader success of the Altcoin Season. Is Bitcoin Losing Momentum? While Altcoin Season reflects a shift in investor preference toward altcoins, it does not necessarily signal a decline in Bitcoin’s importance. Historically, periods of Altcoin Season have been followed by strong Bitcoin recoveries: Bitcoin Dominance Rebounds: Investors often cycle profits from altcoins back into Bitcoin. Long-Term Stability: Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto market, offering stability amid altcoin volatility. Bitcoin’s performance continues to influence the broader market, and its role as a store of value remains unmatched. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index remains at a healthy 62 , signaling that the market is still in Altcoin Season despite a slight one-point decline. This trend reflects sustained outperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, driven by innovation, growing utility, and increased adoption across decentralized applications and ecosystems. For investors, Altcoin Season presents opportunities to capitalize on emerging altcoins, while also highlighting the importance of closely monitoring market shifts. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the performance of both altcoins and Bitcoin will remain integral to shaping investor sentiment and market trends.

This marks a four-point increase from the previous day and keeps the index firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone , signaling heightened optimism and bullish sentiment among investors. This uptick comes amid growing market momentum, increased trading volumes, and positive sentiment across social media platforms, reflecting renewed confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures investor sentiment on a scale of 0 to 100 : 0 to 24: Extreme Fear 25 to 49: Fear 50 to 74: Greed 75 to 100: Extreme Greed A score of 87 places the index squarely in the “Extreme Greed” category, suggesting that investors are displaying heightened enthusiasm, often driven by positive market trends and price movements. The index aggregates data from six primary factors to gauge sentiment: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Analyzes market swings and compares current volatility with historical trends. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Examines the current trading volume and market momentum. Social Media 15% Tracks mentions, hashtags, and engagement on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys 15% Collects investor sentiment through periodic surveys. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s dominance relative to other cryptocurrencies. Google Trends 10% Tracks interest in cryptocurrency-related search terms. Why Has the Index Climbed to 87? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s rise to 87 is driven by a combination of positive market factors: Market Momentum and Trading Volume Increased trading activity, driven by price surges in key assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , has contributed significantly to the index’s upward movement. High trading volumes often reflect strong investor confidence and a surge in buying pressure. Social Media Buzz Positive sentiment across social platforms like Twitter and Reddit has amplified enthusiasm around cryptocurrencies. Trending discussions, mentions, and hashtags surrounding digital assets contribute to the “Extreme Greed” signal. Bitcoin Dominance Bitcoin remains a focal point of market optimism. As BTC maintains its upward trajectory, investor sentiment improves, leading to increased confidence across the broader market. Google Trends Activity Rising search interest in cryptocurrency-related terms such as “Bitcoin price,” “crypto bull run,” and “Ethereum ETF” indicates heightened public interest and participation. What Does ‘Extreme Greed’ Mean for Investors? A Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 87 signals “Extreme Greed” , often interpreted as a sign of euphoria in the market. While this reflects strong investor confidence and optimism, it also raises cautionary signals: Potential Overvaluation: Extreme greed can lead to overbought conditions , where prices may have risen too quickly, increasing the likelihood of a market correction. Short-Term Risks: Historical data shows that periods of extreme greed are sometimes followed by pullbacks as investors take profits. However, sustained positive sentiment can also indicate strong momentum, particularly during bull markets when investor interest continues to grow. Comparison to Previous Fear & Greed Cycles The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is known for its cyclical behavior, reflecting shifts in market sentiment: During market downturns, the index often plummets into the “Extreme Fear” zone , reflecting investor panic and uncertainty. In contrast, bullish phases see the index rise into the “Greed” and “Extreme Greed” zones, as optimism and FOMO (fear of missing out) dominate the market. The current score of 87 reflects heightened confidence, reminiscent of previous bull markets when strong momentum pushed sentiment to similar levels. Key Market Signals to Watch As the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains elevated, investors should keep a close eye on the following signals: Price Movements: Watch for sustained price surges or sharp corrections in key cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum . Trading Volume: Rising trading volumes are a bullish indicator, but sudden spikes can signal profit-taking and market corrections. News Catalysts: Positive developments, such as regulatory clarity or ETF approvals, could sustain the bullish sentiment. Conversely, negative news may trigger reversals. Altcoin Season Trends: Altcoins often outperform during periods of extreme greed, driven by increased speculation and investor appetite for higher risk. Is Extreme Greed a Warning or an Opportunity? While “Extreme Greed” reflects a strong uptrend and growing confidence, it also serves as a cautionary signal for investors: Short-Term Strategy: Traders may consider taking partial profits during periods of euphoria to hedge against potential corrections. Long-Term Outlook: For long-term investors, strong fundamentals and adoption trends remain key indicators of a cryptocurrency’s value. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising to 87 on December 17 highlights the prevailing optimism and bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. With strong market momentum, increased trading volumes, and rising interest across social media, the index remains firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone . While this signals confidence, investors should remain cautious of overbought conditions and potential short-term corrections. Monitoring key indicators like price action, trading volume, and news developments will be essential to navigating this phase of the market.

To clarify, Inmortal set a new price target for Solana (SOL), one of the top crypto coins: $500. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is also seeing good price growth with bullish indicators. However, experts are currently focusing on one DeFi project – Lunex Network (LNEX) . In its presale run, this crypto coin has already experienced a 266% price increase. Some experts suggest a 5,000% surge for LNEX in 2025. Inmortal: The Price of Solana (SOL) Will Reach $500 Crypto analyst Inmortal recently made headlines with his Solana (SOL) price prediction. According to his recent X post , the Solana price will reach $500 and will not be stopped. He also said that dips are simple distractions for this movement. The Solana coin price has jumped nearly 5% in the past month alone. During that time, CoinMarketCap shows its value moving between $210 and nearly $230. Therefore, this Solana price prediction has excited many traders. The technicals for Solana (SOL) also show some bullish signs. TradingView shows that this altcoin is valued above its 50-day EMA ($213) and its 100-day EMA ($192). Plus, its momentum level sits at -9.81, which is in the buy zone and suggests further upside. Ripple (XRP) Shows Bullish Indicators As Price Rises Ripple (XRP) is another altcoin with green price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that the Ripple price surged from nearly $0.60 to over $2 in the past 30 days, or over 300% rise in just a few short weeks. Market analyst CryptoELITES also excited traders with his Ripple price prediction. In an X post , he told his followers that a second wave rally for this altcoin will soon come. He predicts a potential rise to $13 for Ripple (XRP). The technicals for the Ripple crypto back up this statement. TradingView shows that Ripple has a bull-bear power indicator of 0.20 in the buy zone and suggests bulls could push this value up. Plus, it is trading above its 30-day EMA ($1.81) – another bullish sign. Lunex Network (LNEX) Soars 266%, Further Gains Ahead Lunex Network (LNEX) is also making some noise in the crypto market. This presale star has already surged by 266%. Given that this DeFi coin price will rise on a three-day basis, further gains are expected. Traders are excited about Lunex Network because it could disrupt the DeFi market. According to IBS Intelligence , this market is projected to be worth $48B by 2031. Therefore, the long-term stability and growth potential of this DeFi project may be amazing. To clarify, Lunex Network will launch a new non-custodial trading platform that connects all isolated blockchains. On it, people will trade crypto coins across all these blockchains in total privacy. By holding the LNEX token, people will get many perks like governance voting rights and staking rewards. This DeFi coin is now worth just $0.0044, a 266% rise from its starting price of $0.0012. However, a Tier-1 crypto exchange listing may push this value to $0.0216 – a 390% return for all who buy this token now. This could make LNEX one of the top tokens to watch. What Could Come for Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) & Lunex Network (LNEX)? Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) are some of the top crypto coins right now and they could see big price gains. But, experts are also focusing on Lunex Network (LNEX). This rookie will have a smaller market cap than its peers. In other words, LNEX could need less money for its price to rise. As a result, experts predict a potential 5,000% growth for this altcoin in 2025. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Lunex Network (LNEX) Presale Today!

37757197,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110790,1734439920,ETH Outperforms BTC and SOL in December with 26.96% Gains,"ETH Outperforms BTC and SOL in December with 26.96% Gains Ethereum ( ETH ) has taken the lead in December’s cryptocurrency market performance, outpacing both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ), according to data reported by Glassnode on X . After Solana’s dominance earlier in Q4 2024 , Ethereum surged ahead with a 26.96% gain over the past 30 days, reflecting renewed investor confidence and growing momentum for the second-largest cryptocurrency. In comparison, Bitcoin recorded a 17.49% increase , while Solana posted a modest gain of just 1.61% for the same period. 30-Day Performance Breakdown: ETH vs. BTC vs. SOL The recent performance figures provide a clear picture of Ethereum’s dominance in December: Cryptocurrency 30-Day Performance Ethereum (ETH) +26.96% Bitcoin (BTC) +17.49% Solana (SOL) +1.61% These numbers indicate a significant shift in market leadership, as Ethereum regained momentum after being outpaced by Solana in the earlier part of Q4. Why is Ethereum Outperforming? Several factors have contributed to Ethereum’s impressive performance in December: Rising Institutional Interest Ethereum continues to attract institutional investors due to its critical role in decentralized applications ( dApps ), decentralized finance ( DeFi ), and the NFT ecosystem. The potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs has also added to investor optimism, following the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. Ethereum 2.0 Momentum Ongoing developments in Ethereum 2.0 and its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network have bolstered confidence in ETH’s long-term scalability, energy efficiency, and adoption. Strong DeFi and NFT Activity Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi, accounting for the majority of decentralized lending, trading, and staking platforms. The resurgence of NFT interest, particularly in gaming and digital art, has further solidified Ethereum’s utility. Broader Market Sentiment Improved macroeconomic conditions and positive sentiment across the crypto market have lifted major assets like BTC and ETH, but Ethereum’s stronger fundamentals have helped it outperform. Bitcoin’s Steady Gains: A Supportive Market Bitcoin, while lagging behind Ethereum in percentage terms, still posted a solid 17.49% gain over the past 30 days. As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to benefit from: Spot Bitcoin ETF Adoption: Increased inflows into U.S.-approved spot Bitcoin ETFs have bolstered BTC demand among institutional investors. Store of Value Narrative: Bitcoin remains the preferred asset for those seeking a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Growing Market Confidence: BTC’s performance reflects improved sentiment across traditional and crypto markets, setting a positive tone for 2024. While Ethereum has gained momentum, Bitcoin’s steady growth highlights its enduring dominance and investor trust. Solana’s Slower Performance: Cooling Off After Q4 Surge Solana, which experienced a strong rally earlier in Q4 2024 , saw its momentum slow significantly in December, posting a modest 1.61% gain . Key factors behind Solana’s subdued performance include: Profit-Taking: After its sharp price surge in October and November, investors likely took profits, leading to slower gains in December. Competitive Landscape: While Solana boasts faster transaction speeds and lower fees, Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi and NFTs remains a significant challenge. Market Rotation: Investors have shifted their focus toward Ethereum as it gains momentum and institutional support. Despite this cooling-off period, Solana’s robust fundamentals and growing developer activity position it for long-term growth. Market Implications of Ethereum’s Outperformance Ethereum’s strong performance in December signals a few key trends for the broader cryptocurrency market: Renewed Focus on Utility and Adoption Investors are increasingly prioritizing cryptocurrencies with tangible utility and strong ecosystems, such as Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi and NFTs. Institutional Adoption on the Rise The anticipation of spot Ethereum ETFs and continued institutional interest reflect growing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as a core digital asset. Altcoin Market Rotation Ethereum’s outperformance could spark renewed interest in altcoins , particularly those built on Ethereum’s ecosystem, such as Layer-2 solutions and ERC-20 tokens. Bitcoin’s Stability Amid Altcoin Gains While Ethereum leads in percentage gains, Bitcoin’s steady performance suggests strong market fundamentals, maintaining BTC’s position as the cornerstone of the crypto market. What’s Next for ETH, BTC, and SOL? As 2024 comes to a close, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana remain key assets to watch: Ethereum (ETH): Continued development of Ethereum 2.0, potential ETF approvals, and its leadership in DeFi and NFTs could drive further gains in 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional inflows and macroeconomic factors will play a crucial role in determining Bitcoin’s trajectory as it prepares for the next halving event. Solana (SOL): While momentum slowed in December, Solana’s focus on scalability and developer adoption positions it for a strong rebound. Investors will closely monitor market conditions, regulatory developments, and technological advancements as these three assets continue to shape the crypto landscape. Conclusion Ethereum ( ETH ) has outperformed both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ) in December, recording a 26.96% gain over the past 30 days. This marks a significant shift in market momentum, driven by Ethereum’s rising institutional adoption, strong fundamentals, and critical role in the DeFi and NFT sectors. While Bitcoin maintained steady gains of 17.49% , Solana slowed to just 1.61% following its earlier Q4 rally. The performance of ETH highlights a renewed focus on utility-driven assets as investors position themselves for continued growth in 2025.

37757196,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110793,1734439852,VanEck Executive Predicts Bitcoin to Hit $180K in 2025,"VanEck Executive Predicts Bitcoin to Hit $180K in 2025 Matthew Sigel , head of digital asset research at leading American asset management firm VanEck , has made a bold prediction: Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $180,000 by 2025 . Speaking on the Coin Stories podcast hosted by Natalie Brunell , Sigel shared his outlook on Bitcoin’s future price trajectory, citing critical drivers like institutional adoption and the growth of regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles. The prediction, highlighted by Bitcoin Magazine via X, underscores a growing consensus among financial analysts that Bitcoin is poised for a significant bull run in the coming years. Why $180K for Bitcoin in 2025? Matthew Sigel’s forecast of Bitcoin reaching $180,000 is grounded in several key factors that are likely to drive demand and adoption in 2025: Institutional Adoption and Spot Bitcoin ETFs The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has opened the door for institutional investors to gain regulated exposure to Bitcoin. Asset managers like BlackRock , Fidelity , and VanEck have already launched spot ETFs, attracting significant inflows from institutional clients. Increased accessibility through ETFs will provide a major catalyst for Bitcoin’s price growth, as large institutions allocate capital to Bitcoin as part of their diversified portfolios. Bitcoin Halving Event in 2024 Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event in 2024 will reduce the block rewards for miners by 50% , effectively cutting Bitcoin’s new supply in half. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have triggered massive bull runs due to the supply shock and subsequent increase in scarcity. If demand continues to rise, reduced supply could push Bitcoin’s price to unprecedented highs, supporting Sigel’s prediction. Bitcoin as a Store of Value With global economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as “digital gold” —a reliable store of value and hedge against currency devaluation. Institutional investors and corporations are adopting Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategies, further strengthening its position as an inflation-resistant asset. Macro Market Conditions Growing concerns over fiat currency devaluation and debt-driven economies have positioned Bitcoin as a viable alternative to traditional assets. As global macroeconomic conditions evolve, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive asset for both institutional and retail investors. Institutional Involvement as a Key Driver VanEck’s forecast aligns with the growing trend of institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past year, regulated products like spot Bitcoin ETFs have played a crucial role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. Spot ETFs: Products from BlackRock , Fidelity , VanEck , and other major players have attracted billions in net inflows, signaling strong demand from institutional investors. Treasury Allocations: Companies like MicroStrategy and growing numbers of hedge funds are allocating Bitcoin as part of their balance sheets, treating it as a long-term store of value. The combination of these institutional developments will likely provide strong upward momentum for Bitcoin’s price leading into 2025. Historical Price Trends and Halving Cycles Bitcoin’s price history has shown a pattern of significant growth following each halving event, which occurs roughly every four years. Halving Year Bitcoin Price Before Halving Price Peak Post-Halving Time to Peak 2012 $12 $1,150 12 months 2016 $650 $20,000 18 months 2020 $8,600 $69,000 18 months If this historical pattern holds, Bitcoin’s price is expected to surge following the 2024 halving, potentially reaching $180,000 as predicted by Matthew Sigel. The Role of Bitcoin ETFs in Price Momentum Spot Bitcoin ETFs have emerged as one of the most significant developments for Bitcoin in recent years. By providing regulated exposure to Bitcoin, ETFs attract institutional investors who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto market. Key benefits of spot ETFs include: Simplicity: Investors can gain Bitcoin exposure without dealing with wallets or crypto exchanges. Liquidity: ETFs improve market liquidity, ensuring efficient price discovery. Regulatory Confidence: Regulated investment vehicles increase trust and reduce barriers for institutional adoption. The success of Bitcoin ETFs is expected to drive further inflows, pushing Bitcoin closer to Sigel’s $180,000 target in 2025. What Does This Prediction Mean for Investors? Matthew Sigel’s prediction offers a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, but investors should consider both opportunities and risks: Long-Term Strategy: Investors with a long-term outlook may see Bitcoin as a key asset for their portfolios, particularly as institutional adoption accelerates. Portfolio Diversification: Allocating to Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, complementing traditional assets like stocks and bonds. Volatility Considerations: While Bitcoin has strong growth potential, its price remains volatile. Investors should assess their risk tolerance and adopt strategies to manage market fluctuations. Conclusion VanEck’s Matthew Sigel projects that Bitcoin could hit $180,000 in 2025 , driven by institutional adoption, the 2024 halving event, and Bitcoin’s growing reputation as a store of value . With spot Bitcoin ETFs gaining traction and macroeconomic factors supporting demand, Bitcoin is well-positioned to enter its next major growth phase. This prediction aligns with historical price trends and the increasing role of Bitcoin in global financial markets. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, Bitcoin’s scarcity, security, and institutional acceptance could make Sigel’s forecast a reality.

37757148,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110796,1734439791,Analysis: Bitcoin Price Increases as Demand Outstrips Supply,"Analysis: Bitcoin Price Increases as Demand Outstrips Supply The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is on the rise as demand outstrips supply , according to insights from CryptoQuant Senior Analyst Julio Moreno . In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter) , Moreno highlighted the significant decrease in Bitcoin’s over-the-counter (OTC) desk balances, which have dropped by 40,000 BTC since November 20 . This decline underscores rising institutional and retail demand, contributing to upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Key Factors Driving Bitcoin’s Price Increase The current market dynamics reflect a classic case of demand outweighing supply , leading to higher prices. Moreno’s analysis points to several critical factors fueling this trend: Decreasing OTC Desk Balances OTC desks, often used by institutional investors to make large-scale Bitcoin purchases, have seen a significant reduction in balances. A 40,000 BTC drop since November 20 indicates that institutions are accumulating Bitcoin at a rapid pace, reducing the available supply. Supply Shock Post-Halving Anticipation Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event in 2024 will reduce mining rewards by 50%, cutting the new Bitcoin supply in half. Investors anticipating this supply shock are increasing their accumulation now, further driving demand. Institutional Adoption and Spot Bitcoin ETFs The approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs have allowed institutional investors to enter the market through regulated investment vehicles, increasing buying pressure. Firms like BlackRock , Fidelity , and VanEck are attracting significant inflows, adding to Bitcoin’s demand. Hodling Behavior Long-term Bitcoin holders (often referred to as “hodlers”) are reluctant to sell, reducing the circulating supply and creating a scarcity effect. Data suggests that active addresses holding Bitcoin for over a year are at an all-time high, signaling strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. OTC Desk Balances: A Key Indicator of Demand Over-the-counter (OTC) desks play a vital role in the cryptocurrency market, especially for large institutional buyers. Unlike traditional exchanges, OTC desks facilitate significant Bitcoin transactions without impacting public market prices. The recent decline of 40,000 BTC in OTC desk balances suggests: Increased Institutional Demand: Large investors are accumulating Bitcoin at accelerated rates. Reduced Sell Pressure: The drop in balances indicates that fewer Bitcoins are available for sale, amplifying scarcity. Moreno’s analysis reflects a bullish outlook as institutional investors continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin. The Supply-Demand Imbalance: How It Works Bitcoin’s price is fundamentally driven by the relationship between supply and demand: When Demand Rises and Supply Decreases: Increased demand, combined with reduced availability of Bitcoin, creates a supply shock that drives prices upward. Limited Supply of Bitcoin: Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million BTC , with roughly 19.5 million already in circulation. As demand increases and fewer coins are available for trading, scarcity naturally pushes prices higher. Moreno’s data highlights this dynamic, with institutional buyers absorbing Bitcoin faster than it can be sold on the market. Why Institutional Demand Is Surging The current surge in institutional interest in Bitcoin can be attributed to several factors: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has legitimized Bitcoin as an investment asset. Institutional investors now have regulated pathways to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it an attractive hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, similar to gold. Store of Value Narrative: Institutional investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a store of value , adding it to their portfolios for diversification. Macro Market Conditions: Ongoing global economic challenges and fiat currency devaluation have pushed investors toward decentralized, hard assets like Bitcoin. Impact of Halving on Supply The upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 is expected to exacerbate the supply-demand imbalance further. Halving events, which occur approximately every four years , reduce the Bitcoin block reward by 50%. This reduction cuts the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation, effectively limiting supply. Historically, halving events have led to significant price surges: 2012 Halving: Bitcoin surged from $12 to over $1,150. 2016 Halving: Bitcoin climbed from $650 to nearly $20,000. 2020 Halving: Bitcoin skyrocketed from $8,600 to an all-time high of $69,000. Investors are anticipating a similar pattern post-2024, driving early accumulation and reducing circulating supply. How Hodlers Are Influencing Supply The behavior of long-term Bitcoin holders plays a critical role in shaping supply dynamics. Recent data indicates that: Over 70% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply has not moved in over a year, signaling strong holding sentiment. Hodlers’ reluctance to sell reduces sell pressure, limiting Bitcoin’s availability on exchanges. This “supply squeeze” effect further contributes to upward price momentum. Conclusion Bitcoin’s price increase is being fueled by a classic supply-demand imbalance, as demand—particularly from institutional investors—continues to outstrip supply. With OTC desk balances dropping by 40,000 BTC since November 20 and growing anticipation for the 2024 halving event , Bitcoin’s upward trajectory appears poised to continue. The combination of institutional adoption, hodling behavior, and the fixed supply of Bitcoin creates an environment where scarcity drives value. As more investors recognize Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and hedge against economic instability, demand is expected to remain strong, potentially pushing prices to new highs in the coming months.

37757147,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110802,1734439723,"UK FCA Plans to Ban Public Crypto Offers, Seeks Industry Feedback on New Regime","UK FCA Plans to Ban Public Crypto Offers, Seeks Industry Feedback on New Regime The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced plans to prohibit public crypto offers as part of its evolving regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. The proposal builds upon existing promotion rules that prevent unregistered firms from targeting UK clients and aims to ensure greater transparency, security, and anti-market abuse measures. While the ban will apply broadly to public crypto offerings, exceptions may be granted to regulated crypto trading platforms and qualifying offers , according to details reported by CoinDesk . The FCA is currently seeking industry feedback on the proposed changes, with draft regulations expected in 2025 and a finalized framework anticipated by 2026 . The FCA’s Approach to Crypto Regulation The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plays a critical role in overseeing financial markets in the UK, including cryptocurrency-related activities . Since 2020, the FCA has enforced crypto compliance under anti-money laundering (AML) rules, requiring firms to meet rigorous registration standards to operate legally in the UK. With its latest proposal to ban public crypto offers, the FCA aims to achieve three key objectives: Protect Investors: Prevent misleading promotions and unregulated public offers that pose significant risks to retail investors. Enhance Market Integrity: Introduce measures to combat market manipulation and ensure fair practices. Promote Transparency: Establish clear rules for disclosures and admission to market processes. The proposed framework underscores the FCA’s commitment to balancing innovation and investor protection as the cryptocurrency sector continues to expand. Why the FCA is Targeting Public Crypto Offers The FCA’s proposed ban on public crypto offers reflects concerns over investor protection and the risks posed by unregulated entities. Key drivers behind the initiative include: Rising Consumer Risks: Many public crypto offerings lack transparency, exposing retail investors to scams, misrepresentation, and volatile markets. Unregulated promotions often include misleading claims about returns and risks, leading to significant losses. Enforcement of Promotion Rules: The FCA has already implemented rules barring unregistered firms from promoting crypto-related products to UK consumers. The new legislation will extend this oversight to initial coin offerings (ICOs) , token sales, and similar public offers. Market Abuse Concerns: The absence of robust anti-market abuse measures leaves the crypto market vulnerable to manipulation and fraudulent activities. The FCA aims to introduce stricter rules to enhance market integrity and investor confidence . By prohibiting public crypto offers, the FCA seeks to reduce risks while allowing regulated platforms to continue operating under clear and enforceable standards. Industry Feedback: Key Areas of Focus The FCA is calling for input from crypto industry stakeholders to shape its upcoming regulatory regime. The consultation paper highlights three main areas for feedback: Market Admission Rules: Establishing criteria for cryptocurrencies and firms to gain admission to the market. Defining eligibility for exceptions, such as regulated platforms and qualifying offers. Disclosure Requirements: Introducing clear guidelines for firms to provide accurate, transparent information about crypto assets and offerings. Ensuring disclosures align with traditional financial products to improve investor understanding. Anti-Market Abuse Measures: Implementing stricter controls to detect and prevent market manipulation , insider trading, and other abusive practices. Enhancing surveillance mechanisms to ensure fair market operations. The FCA encourages industry participants to share insights, concerns, and recommendations as it works to refine its approach to crypto regulation. Timeline for Implementation The FCA’s proposed crypto regulations will follow a phased rollout: 2024: Industry feedback and consultations to finalize the draft framework. 2025: Publication of draft regulations for public review and further consultation. 2026: Expected rollout of the final crypto regulatory framework, including rules for public offers, market disclosures, and anti-market abuse measures. This gradual approach will allow the FCA to address industry challenges, incorporate feedback, and create a well-balanced regulatory environment. Impact on the UK Crypto Market The FCA’s proposed ban on public crypto offers and its broader regulatory measures are likely to have far-reaching implications for the UK crypto ecosystem: Tighter Access for Unregulated Firms: Unregistered crypto firms and projects will face stricter hurdles to promote or launch public offerings in the UK. This could lead to a decline in speculative token sales and ICOs targeting retail investors. Increased Oversight for Regulated Platforms: Crypto exchanges and trading platforms that comply with FCA standards may benefit from a level playing field and greater investor trust. Exceptions for regulated platforms could enhance their credibility and attract institutional investors. Improved Investor Protection: Clear rules on disclosures and anti-market abuse measures will protect investors from scams and misleading offers. Enhanced transparency will empower consumers to make informed investment decisions. Shift Toward Regulated Innovation: While the proposed ban may initially challenge some crypto projects, it could pave the way for regulated innovation , attracting legitimate businesses and institutional capital. Industry Reactions and Next Steps The FCA’s proposal has sparked a range of reactions within the crypto industry: Support for Investor Protection: Many stakeholders welcome the FCA’s focus on protecting consumers and ensuring market integrity. Concerns Over Innovation: Critics argue that overly restrictive rules may stifle innovation and drive crypto businesses to other jurisdictions. As the FCA prepares to gather industry feedback, collaboration with crypto firms, regulators, and other stakeholders will be essential to strike the right balance between regulation and innovation. Conclusion The UK FCA’s plan to ban public crypto offers marks a significant step toward creating a safer and more transparent cryptocurrency market. By focusing on investor protection, market admission, and anti-market abuse measures, the FCA aims to introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework that balances risk mitigation with industry growth. While the proposed ban may disrupt certain segments of the crypto market, exceptions for regulated platforms and qualifying offers suggest a path for compliant innovation. As the FCA seeks industry feedback, collaboration and transparency will be key to shaping a robust and forward-looking regulatory regime set for implementation by 2026 .

37757493,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/how-binance-coin-maintains-its-position-as-a-top-cryptocurrency-in-2024,1734439649,How Binance Coin Maintains Its Position as a Top Cryptocurrency in 2024,"Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in 2017 as a native token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. Since then, it has grown to become one of the top cryptocurrencies in the market, currently ranking fourth by market capitalization. BNB's success can be attributed to various factors such as its utility, strong community support, and innovative features like the Binance Smart Chain. However, in a constantly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, it is important for projects to continue innovating and adapting to maintain their position. This is where Lightchain AI (LCAI) comes in as a top project and competitor to Binance Coin. LCAI offers unique solutions such as artificial intelligence integration, cross-chain interoperability, and decentralized finance capabilities that set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. In this article, we will explore how Binance Coin has maintained its position as a top cryptocurrency over the years and how the emergence of LCAI could impact its dominance in the market. Utility and Use Cases Of Binance Coin Binance Coin (BNB) serves multiple functions within and beyond the Binance ecosystem. Initially, BNB provided trading fee discounts on the Binance Exchange, offering users reduced fees when paying with BNB. Beyond trading, BNB is accepted as a payment method for various goods and services, including travel bookings and online shopping, enhancing its real-world utility. Additionally, BNB is used in token burns, where Binance periodically repurchases and destroys BNB to reduce supply, potentially increasing its value. Furthermore, BNB is utilized in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), enabling activities such as staking, lending, and liquidity provision. These diverse applications underscore BNB's integral role in the cryptocurrency landscape. Utility and Versatility How BNB Powers DeFi, NFTs, and Beyond Binance Coin (BNB) is integral to the BNB Chain ecosystem, driving innovation across decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and beyond. In DeFi, BNB is essential for transaction fees, staking, and governance, enabling users to engage with over 5,000 decentralized applications (dApps) on BNB Chain. In the NFT space, BNB facilitates the creation, purchase, and sale of digital assets, with platforms like the Binance NFT Marketplace allowing users to transact efficiently. Beyond DeFi and NFTs, BNB is accepted for payments in various sectors, including e-commerce and travel, enabling users to book flights and hotels through platforms like Travala.com. Additionally, BNB holders enjoy discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange and access to exclusive token sales on Binance Launchpad. This versatility underscores BNB's pivotal role in advancing the digital economy. Lightchain AI (LCAI) vs. Binance Coin A Rising Contender in 2024 Lightchain AI (LCAI) is an emerging blockchain platform that integrates artificial intelligence through its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). These innovations aim to enhance scalability and efficiency in decentralized applications. In contrast, Binance Coin (BNB) is a well-established cryptocurrency integral to the Binance ecosystem, offering utilities like transaction fee discounts and participation in token sales. BNB has a significant market presence and a large user base. As of December 2024, LCAI is in its presale phase , attracting attention for its potential to revolutionize AI integration in blockchain. Analysts project that LCAI could experience substantial growth, with price predictions suggesting significant increases in the coming months. While BNB continues to maintain its dominance in the crypto market, LCAI's innovative approach positions it as a noteworthy contender in 2024. Investors are closely monitoring LCAI's development, considering its potential to offer unique solutions in the blockchain space. Alternative Solutions Potential Impact on Binance Coin As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, innovative projects like Lightchain AI (LCAI) are emerging, potentially challenging established players such as Binance Coin (BNB). LCAI integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, aiming to enhance scalability and efficiency. In response to such competition, Binance has continued to innovate. Recent developments include the launch of a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the introduction of staking features, and the expansion into non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These initiatives demonstrate Binance's commitment to adapting to market trends and maintaining its market position. Additionally, Binance has been actively listing new cryptocurrencies, enhancing its ecosystem's diversity and appeal to a broader user base. These strategic efforts underscore Binance's dedication to staying ahead in the rapidly evolving crypto market. How Lightchain AI Opportunity is Fueling Innovation Lightchain AI is at the forefront of merging blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, introducing groundbreaking solutions that drive innovation across various sectors. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for executing valuable AI computations, promoting efficient and scalable AI development within a decentralized framework. Central to its architecture is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a specialized computational layer designed to seamlessly execute AI-specific tasks on the blockchain. This integration enables real-time AI applications, decentralized machine learning, and privacy-preserving computations, opening new possibilities for industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics. Also their presale phase is currently underway, attracting investors and businesses alike, seeking to leverage the potential of this revolutionary technology. LCAI's success could have a significant impact on the blockchain and AI landscape, potentially shaping future developments in these industries. By addressing challenges like scalability, transparency, and data privacy, Lightchain AI is not only enhancing the capabilities of decentralized applications but also setting new standards for the convergence of AI and blockchain technologies. Binance Coin’s Continued Success And Opportunities Ahead In conclusion, Binance Coin (BNB) has established itself as a leading cryptocurrency with its versatile utility and strong market presence. Its integration into various sectors such as DeFi, NFTs, e-commerce, and travel highlights its value and potential for continued growth. However, the emergence of innovative projects like Lightchain AI (LCAI) presents competition for BNB in the future. Nonetheless, Binance's strategic initiatives and commitment to innovation position it to adapt to changing market dynamics successfully. Plus the presale phase of LCAI presents an exciting opportunity for investors and businesses to explore the potential of merging AI and blockchain technology. As these technologies continue to evolve, it is clear that Binance Coin's continued success will be integral to the growth and advancement of the digital economy. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

By every measure, Bitcoin has had a landmark year in 2024. Still, the asset shows no signs of slowing down, with its price continuing to record high after high. Recently, CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has offered insight into what is driving the latest rally.Bitcoin Seeing Record DemandOver the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has surged to new highs near the $108,000 price point, extending its year-to-date (YTD) gains to over 150%. According to Moreno, the recent rally, which kicked off over the weekend, is driven by record demand outpacing supply.As an example, Moreno highlighted that Bitcoin over-the-counter desks are seeing their most significant monthly balance decline this year, already down a staggering 25,000 BTC worth $2.7 billion at current prices this month. The market researcher also noted that this balance had declined by 40,000 BTC since November 20. Charts showing Bitcoin supply on OTC desks and apparent demand. Source: Julio Moreno Charts showing Bitcoin supply on OTC desks and apparent demand. Source: Julio Moreno Meanwhile, as this supply reduces, demand continues to grow, as highlighted by the Bitcoin 'Apparent Demand' indicator chart shared by Moreno. The apparent demand indicator measures the difference between newly issued Bitcoin and the inactive supply for a year. When inactive supply decreases faster than the newly issued coins, the metric turns positive, suggesting high demand. Per the chart, the apparent demand indicator has been significantly positive since the end of October 2024.The recent trend of Bitcoin demand outpacing supply comes as several factors have investors feeling significantly optimistic about the asset.Stars Aligning for Bitcoin?One factor investors are considering is Donald Trump's election victory . On the campaign trail, the President-elect sounded extremely supportive of crypto assets, particularly Bitcoin, promising to establish a strategic national reserve—a move some market observers expect to drive a global rush on the asset.At the same time, macroeconomic winds are increasingly shifting in Bitcoin's favor.

37756947,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/how-binance-coin-became-one-of-the-most-trusted-tokens-in-the-crypto-market,1734439310,How Binance Coin Became One of the Most Trusted Tokens in the Crypto Market,"Binance Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency that was created by the popular cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. It was launched in 2017 and has quickly become one of the most trusted tokens in the crypto market. Since its creation, BNB has experienced significant growth and adoption due to its strong utility and use cases within the Binance ecosystem. It started as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain but later transitioned to its own native blockchain, known as Binance Chain. This move allowed for faster transaction speeds and lower fees, making it more efficient for users. In this article, we will delve into how Binance Coin became one of the most trusted tokens in the crypto market and how it continues to grow in popularity and utility. The Beginning of Binance Coin Binance Coin (BNB) was introduced in July 2017 as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, with an initial coin offering (ICO) price of $0.10 per token. The ICO raised $15 million, which was allocated to develop the Binance exchange platform. In September 2020, BNB transitioned to its own blockchain, the BNB Smart Chain, enhancing transaction speed and reducing fees. By December 2024, BNB reached an all-time high of $755.56, reflecting its significant growth and adoption within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. BNB's utility has expanded beyond fee reductions on the Binance exchange to include participation in token sales, payment for goods and services, and more, solidifying its role in the broader crypto market. How Binance Coin’s Low Fees and Speed Attract Traders Binance Coin (BNB) offers traders significant advantages through its low fees and high transaction speeds. By using BNB to pay for trading fees on the Binance platform, users receive a 25% discount, reducing spot trading fees from 0.1% to 0.075%. This cost efficiency is particularly beneficial for high-frequency traders and those dealing with large volumes, as it substantially lowers transaction costs. Additionally, Binance's robust infrastructure ensures rapid transaction processing, minimizing delays and enabling traders to capitalize on market opportunities promptly. The combination of low fees and swift transactions enhances profitability and attracts a diverse range of traders to the platform. Furthermore, Binance's tiered fee structure rewards increased trading volumes and BNB holdings with progressively lower fees, providing additional incentives for active traders. Strategic Partnerships and Real-World Use Cases for Binance Coin Binance Coin (BNB) has significantly expanded its utility through strategic partnerships and real-world applications. A notable collaboration is with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Announced in December 2024, this partnership aims to enhance USDC adoption by integrating it across Binance's suite of products and services, thereby increasing accessibility for over 240 million users. In terms of real-world use cases, BNB's functionality extends beyond the Binance exchange. It is utilized for trading fee discounts, staking rewards, and participation in token sales. Additionally, BNB serves as a payment method for various goods and services, including online retailers and gaming platforms, facilitating seamless transactions and promoting broader cryptocurrency adoption. These strategic partnerships and diverse applications have strengthened BNB's position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, enhancing its value proposition and fostering increased adoption across various sectors. Comparing Binance Coin’s Market Trust With Emerging Tokens Like Lightchain AI Binance Coin (BNB) has established significant market trust since its 2017 inception, serving as the native token for the Binance ecosystem . Its utility in reducing trading fees and facilitating transactions has contributed to its strong market capitalization and widespread adoption. However, recent legal challenges have impacted Binance's reputation. In November 2023, Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, faced substantial fines and legal actions, including a $4.3 billion penalty for violating U.S. anti-money laundering requirements. Emerging tokens like Lightchain AI (LCAI) are entering the market with innovative features, such as integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Lightchain AI's presale has garnered attention, with tokens offered at $0.003 each, indicating potential for rapid growth. While BNB benefits from established trust and a robust ecosystem, ongoing legal issues may influence investor confidence. In contrast, Lightchain AI presents a novel value proposition, attracting investors seeking opportunities in cutting-edge technologies. The evolving regulatory landscape and market dynamics will play crucial roles in shaping the future trust and adoption of both BNB and emerging tokens like LCAI. Challenges Binance Coin Overcame to Cement Its Position Binance Coin (BNB) has solidified its position in the cryptocurrency market by overcoming several significant challenges. In 2019, Binance faced a major security breach, resulting in the theft of 7,000 bitcoins. The company responded swiftly by reimbursing affected users through its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) and implementing enhanced security measures. Regulatory scrutiny has been another hurdle. In 2024, Binance encountered legal challenges from the U.S. Department of Justice, leading to a $4.3 billion penalty. Despite this, Binance demonstrated resilience by maintaining its market dominance and continuing to innovate within the crypto space. Additionally, Binance has navigated the complexities of operating in a highly regulated environment by proactively engaging with regulators and implementing robust compliance measures. Through these experiences, BNB has not only maintained but strengthened its market position, reflecting the platform's adaptability and commitment to user security and regulatory compliance. The Future of Binance Coin And Lightchain AI As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Binance Coin (BNB) and emerging tokens like Lightchain AI (LCAI) present different yet promising opportunities for investors. BNB's established trust and utility within the Binance ecosystem make it a strong contender in the crypto space, while LCAI's innovative features may attract those seeking exposure to cutting-edge technologies. Factors such as market dynamics, regulatory developments, and technological advancements will play crucial roles in shaping the future of these tokens. However, both BNB and LCAI have demonstrated resilience and adaptability in overcoming challenges, positioning themselves for continued growth and success in the crypto market. So, it will be interesting to see how these two tokens fare in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

37759917,https://invezz.com/?p=2391272,1734439280,Xandeum concludes successful SOL staking program as Solana’s LST sector heats up,"Solana-based storage scaling solution Xandeum has completed its six-week liquid staking program, disbursing an impressive 205 million XAND tokens in rewards in the process. The program saw 68% of Xandeum’s circulating supply staked, a testament to the platform’s positioning as one of the most attractive staking options on Solana. A new era for SOL staking While liquid staking has taken off on Ethereum, where protocols such as Lido have come to dominate DeFi TVL, with billions in staked ETH, it’s taken longer to grow on Solana. Following a slow start, however, Solana’s liquid staking sector is chugging along nicely, with Xandeum’s program contributing to the growth of the multi-billion dollar sector. Xandeum’s liquid staking program allowed users to stake SOL and earn high yields, supported by a combination of staking rewards, MEV rewards, and XAND token incentives. The initiative demonstrates the growing demand for secure, high-yield staking opportunities within the Solana ecosystem, with users driven to the Xandeum program partially on account of its industry-leading 16% APY. The case for liquid staking While liquid staking holds natural appeal from a user perspective – who wouldn’t want to earn generous yield while getting to keep their assets, or at least a tokenized representation of them? – it’s a vertical with much broader benefits. Not only does increased participation in staking help to strengthen and decentralize networks such as Solana, but it deepens liquidity, allowing users to explore additional onchain opportunities with LSTs, from LP’ing to swapping for stablecoins and investing in memecoins, governance tokens, or whatever else takes their fancy. By providing liquid tokens that represent staked assets, protocols such as Xandeum enable participants to earn staking rewards while maintaining the flexibility to trade or use their liquid tokens in DeFi applications. This dual utility has made liquid staking an increasingly popular choice for onchain users. Xandeum’s program captured attention by offering industry-leading APYs of over 15%, surpassing other Solana staking pools such as Marinade and Jito. Mo’ rewards, mo’ incentives Xandeum’s quadruple rewards system accounts for why the data storage layer has enjoyed such success with its staking program. Unlike traditional validators that retain MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) and block rewards, Xandeum shares these with its stakers. This, combined with standard staking rewards and XAND token incentives, created a generous APY, significantly boosting demand for its staking pool. The program also incorporated fair distribution mechanisms, such as identity verification and transparent governance. All pool fees collected were transferred directly to the Xandeum DAO treasury, giving XAND token holders a say in how these resources are managed. By driving over $7 million in staked assets and setting a benchmark for staking participation, Xandeum has played a pivotal role in enhancing Solana’s liquid staking landscape. The success of the Xandeum staking program comes as the platform prepares to launch its scalable storage layer in early 2025. Designed to integrate directly into Solana RPC nodes, this layer will unlock new revenue streams by sharing fees paid by applications utilizing Xandeum’s storage capabilities. The staking program might be over but Xandem is just getting started.

This AI-themed market exploded with Goateus Maximus’ rise amid viral reaction to Terminal of Truths posts. Now, with the token presale hitting $5.8 million in just over three weeks, fresh attention is on new AI agent project iDEGEN . What is the ai16z’s partnership with Stanford University about and what does it mean for projects like iDEGEN? Are there any other developments enthusiasts and investors can keep an eye on in the coming months? Stanford University, Softbank, and DWF Labs bullish on AI On December 16, 2024, ai16z developer Eliza Labs disclosed a major partnership with Stanford University’s Future of Digital Currency Initiative. The news saw the ai16z token’s price rise sharply as traders weighed the bullish news. Eliza Labs and FDCI are looking at an AI and web3 partnership that will explore the growth of autonomous AI agents and how these are set to transform the crypto ecosystem. The partnership is only part of the growing traction for AI agent projects and the broader AI sector. Recently, Softbank confirmed a $100 billion investment in AI infrastructure in the US, while crypto market maker DWF Labs unveiled a $20 million fund for AI agent projects. Meanwhile, the intellectual property blockchain network Story Protocol has announced an experimental “agent-to-agent” framework. The project wants to allow AI agents to exchange data and investment strategies among others. The Story Protocol team noted: “Our goal is to foster an open community of collaborators working together to shape the future of agent-to-agent IP economies, encouraging shared learning, interoperability, and continual improvement of this emerging standard.” The collaboration with projects such as Eliza, Zerebo, and Virtuals Protocol is one step towards bolstering the AI agent space. iDEGEN could be one of the biggest projects to emerge in this era. iDEGEN roars to $5.8 million raise iDEGEN’s pre-market auction is an indicator that AI agents are on a roll. In just three weeks, the sale of the native IDGN has raced to an impressive $5.7 million. It’s a scenario that comes as AI meme coins show a resurgence. iDEGEN is what the decentralized crypto ecosystem is about. With no guardrails for its training, the project has the degen community for its learning model. The AI agent started as a blank slate, processing everything it came across on Crypto Twitter (now X). The posts it churns every hour without fail can be chaotic, sound crazy, or be the next viral tweet by an AI agent. With the market largely an attention economy, iDEGEN’s significant presale performance points to its potential to carve a major part of the mindshare for itself. Investors flocking to iDEGEN to position for the AI agent supercycle are reveling in the dynamic pricing approach. Early adopters are looking at over 62,879% upside with price at $0.0526 after it surged from a paltry $0.00011. IDGN will go live in January, with the listing price 10% higher than the auction close.

In this detailed guide, we’ll explain how a Love Tester works, the different types of love testers, their benefits, and fun ways you can use them to test your romantic compatibility. What is a Love Tester? A Love Tester is a simple tool, game, or app designed to calculate the compatibility between two individuals. It usually requires input like your name and your partner’s name to produce a “love score” or percentage, indicating how well-matched you are. While Love Testers are often purely for fun, they provide a playful way to explore romantic possibilities and enjoy lighthearted moments with friends, partners, or crushes. How Does a Love Tester Work? The mechanics of a Love Tester can vary depending on its form. Here’s how different types of Love Testers work: 1. Name-Based Love Testers These are the most common Love Tester tools. You enter your name and your partner’s or crush’s name. The tool uses a predefined algorithm to generate a love percentage (e.g., “72% compatibility”). Though random, these tools are entertaining and a fun conversation starter. 2. Personality-Based Love Testers These testers rely on personality traits, answers to questions, and preferences. You and your partner answer compatibility-related questions. The tool calculates a score based on your shared interests, habits, or values. 3. Digital Love Tester Games Found in mobile apps and online platforms, these are interactive tools where players input names, birthdays, or other data to receive fun results. Some games allow you to personalize avatars or answer relationship-themed quizzes. 4. Physical Love Tester Machines Love Tester machines, often seen in arcades or fairs, require you to grip sensors or place your hands on the machine. The machine supposedly measures heart rate or “energy levels” to determine the intensity of your romantic connection. Why Use a Love Tester? Love Testers are popular for a variety of reasons. While they are not scientifically accurate, they provide entertainment and bring people together. Here are some benefits of using a Love Tester: 1.

They are meant purely for entertainment and fun. If you’re genuinely interested in relationship compatibility, consider focusing on: Open communication Shared values and goals Understanding each other’s personalities Taking scientifically backed compatibility quizzes, such as those based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or Love Languages While a Love Tester is fun, building a strong relationship requires genuine connection and understanding.

Whether you use an app, an online tool, or a retro arcade machine, the experience is guaranteed to bring laughter and playful energy. While Love Testers aren’t a measure of real compatibility, they’re a great reminder that relationships are about enjoying each other’s company and creating fun memories.

During his presidential election campaigns, Trump promised the crypto industry that he would make the United States the global crypto hub. He also promised to involve the crypto community in streamlining crypto regulations in the U.S. by establishing a presidential advisory council made up of crypto industry members. While speaking at the Bitcoin Conference 2024 earlier this year, Trump explained that crypto rules would be written by people who love the crypto industry, not those who hate it. Since Trump won the presidential elections, he has interacted with crypto enthusiasts virtually and now physically in his meeting with the Crypto.com CEO.

XRP, valued at $2.32 as of writing, has shown a fantastic rise of 249.04% over the past 30 days, demonstrating its excellent development potential. Comprising a market capitalization of more than $132 billion and a circulating supply of 57.18 billion XRP tokens, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency draws interest from all around. Though many expect XRP to recover its former highs of $3.92, forecasts show that this target may take a little longer, with a reasonable timetable looking until Q1 2025. The twist is that Rexas Finance (RXS), a new cryptocurrency in the presale phases, is attracting more investors since it could be a game-changer for actual asset tokenization. Some analysts think Rexas Finance might surpass XRP's possible increase by 13,900% and hit $21 by Q1 2025. The Emergence of Rexas Finance (RXS): Why Investors Should Not be Ignorant From the $0.030 price at the start of the presale in early September 2024, Rexas Finance is currently priced at $0.15 in stage 10 as of writing, an astounding 400% rise. Rexas Finance has sold 346,780,121 RXS tokens thus far, raising $28,142,360 overall. Investors still have a chance to get tokens before the price rises even more; the presale is swiftly moving. Rexas Finance is not a typical project. Its unique value proposition is based on tokenizing actual assets, including art, commodities, real estate, and large markets. With Rexas Finance bridging the gap between blockchain technology and physical assets, these sectors, valued at trillions of dollars, are starting to show prominence. The Rexas Finance platform guarantees several token standards, including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, enabling tokenization across several assets. Anyone may tokenize their holdings with the Rexas Token Builder without writing code. Whether an individual or company, this simple technology helps anyone participate in asset tokenizing, democratizing access to world markets. Furthermore, the Rexas Launchpad offers users a platform to raise money for their tokenized assets, building a vibrant ecosystem for investors, developers, and businesses. As the platform gains more traction, the opportunities for consumers to tokenize assets and create income are growing. Presale Momentum And Growth Projections Of Rexas Finance In the stage 10 presale, Rexas Finance currently values each RXS token at $0.15 as of this writing. The price will rise as the presale advances; stage 11 is priced at $0.175, and the token formally launches at $0.20 in early 2025. The presale has experienced a remarkable increase as it moves through various phases; RXS tokens have surged 400% from the beginning. The project's overall quantity is limited to 1 billion RXS tokens, guaranteeing scarcity and long-term value for first investors. With a forecasted climb of 13,900% to $21 by Q1 2025, the token will likely increase in value as it gathers speed. Rexas Finance's listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko help increase its visibility even more by facilitating real-time performance tracking for investors. Certik has closely examined Rexas Finance to guarantee its security and openness for investors. The Certik audit offers a seal of approval that lends legitimacy to the project and fosters confidence among the people. Moreover, Rexas Finance has adopted a community-driven strategy, bypassing venture capital money and concentrating on people investors to help the expansion of the platform. Rexas Finance is offering a $1 million giveaway, which has already attracted over 526,545 entries, adding to the buzz around it. Twenty lucky giveaway winners will get RXS tokens valued at $50,000 each. Apart from drawing attention, this attractive campaign lets users increase their chances by sharing and finishing activities on the Rexas Finance website. Can Ripple (XRP) Reclaim $3.92? Although Ripple (XRP) has been making news with its impressive 249% increase, XRP might not recover the $3.92 level until Q1 2025. Continuous legal conflicts and market mood greatly influence whether XRP can reach this aim by the end of the year. However, investors searching for a fresh crypto prospect could choose to monitor Rexas Finance (RXS). With its excellent presale success, expansion potential, and creative real-world asset tokenizing technique, Rexas Finance could fly in the following months. For those searching the crypto market for low-risk, high-reward prospects, the token's expected price of $21 by Q1 2025 makes it an interesting choice. Early investors have a limited chance to purchase as the presale runs on. The price of the token increases before it reaches tier-1 exchanges, and it might see a 13,900% value increase. Rexas Finance is worth considering if you're looking for the next big thing in the crypto scene.

Developed as part of the Google Arts & Culture project, Blob Opera showcases the potential of artificial intelligence to enhance creativity, art, and music in a playful, accessible way. How Does Blob Opera Work? Blob Opera uses machine learning algorithms trained on the voices of professional opera singers to generate its sound. While the blobs are not singing actual lyrics, the AI creates realistic opera-like tones based on vocal recordings. Here’s how Blob Opera works: Four Blobs, Four Voice Types: The four colorful blobs represent different voice types: Bass: The deepest, lowest voice. Tenor: A high male voice. Mezzo-Soprano: A medium female voice. Soprano: The highest female voice. Interactive Controls: Dragging a blob up or down changes the pitch of the voice. Dragging a blob side to side alters the vowel sound (e.g., “ah,” “oh,” “oo”). Other blobs automatically harmonize in real-time, creating a rich and melodic opera performance. No Musical Skills Required: You don’t need to know music theory or opera singing—simply move the blobs, and the AI does the rest! Record and Share: Users can record their operatic creations and share them with friends, making the experience interactive and social.

37756726,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110824,1734438822,"We Become What We Behold: Meaning, Game Analysis, and Life Lessons","We Become What We Behold: Meaning, Game Analysis, and Life Lessons We Become What We Behold is more than just a game; it is a powerful commentary on media, influence, and society . Created by Nicky Case , this minimalist yet thought-provoking game has resonated with players worldwide. With its simple mechanics and deep narrative, We Become What We Behold explores how mass media shapes our perceptions, emotions, and collective behaviors. In this comprehensive article, we’ll delve into the game’s core concept, meaning, gameplay mechanics, and life lessons it delivers. Whether you’re a gamer, student, or someone interested in social commentary, this game offers a powerful reflection on the world around us. What is We Become What We Behold? We Become What We Behold is an indie browser-based game released in 2016 by Nicky Case , a developer known for creating games that combine entertainment with education and social messages. The game’s title is derived from the phrase: “We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.” – Marshall McLuhan , media theorist This phrase captures the essence of the game: how our focus and attention on certain events or emotions can shape who we are, individually and collectively. The game uses a five-minute interactive experience to highlight how the media amplifies conflict and negativity, leading to a cycle of fear, hatred, and division. Gameplay Mechanics: How We Become What We Behold Works The gameplay in We Become What We Behold is deceptively simple yet impactful. How to Play The Camera: Players control a camera that captures snapshots of a crowd of people and their interactions. Choosing the Narrative: You decide which events or individuals to focus on. Events that are shocking, negative, or unusual tend to get attention and spread through the crowd. Media Influence: Once you photograph an event, the game “broadcasts” it on a large screen, influencing the characters’ behaviors and attitudes. Escalating Conflict: As the game progresses, seemingly harmless moments escalate into chaos, anger, and division . The game ends in a shocking and tragic way, emphasizing the consequences of focusing on negativity. The Meaning Behind We Become What We Behold The core theme of We Become What We Behold is how media influences our thoughts, perceptions, and actions. Here are the key messages of the game: 1. Media’s Role in Shaping Society The game highlights how media focuses disproportionately on controversial, divisive, or shocking content . People are drawn to negativity, which leads to a snowball effect. When we only pay attention to anger and conflict, we allow these emotions to dominate society. 2. Amplification of Fear and Hate Each snapshot in the game represents how small, isolated moments—like an argument or an angry interaction—are amplified through media. Instead of capturing peaceful, positive events, the focus remains on conflict. This mirrors how social media and news platforms often prioritize engagement-driven content, even if it fuels division. 3. The Cyclical Nature of Conflict The game portrays a vicious cycle: Media broadcasts negativity → People imitate the behavior → More negativity occurs → Media amplifies it again. This cycle continues until it reaches a tipping point, leading to widespread chaos. This reflects real-world issues like media sensationalism, fake news , and social polarization . 4. Individual Responsibility While the game critiques the media, it also highlights the role of individuals in perpetuating negativity. Players choose what to photograph, symbolizing how people decide what to amplify and share in real life. The game subtly asks: Are we focusing on the wrong things? How do our choices contribute to conflict and negativity? Life Lessons From We Become What We Behold The game’s simple but powerful narrative teaches valuable lessons that apply to modern life : 1. Be Mindful of What You Consume The content we engage with—on social media, news outlets, or entertainment—shapes our thoughts and behaviors. Focus on positivity and solutions instead of amplifying anger, fear, or hate. 2. Media Literacy is Crucial Learn to identify sensationalism and bias in the media. Not everything you see or read represents the full truth. Question narratives that promote division and conflict. 3. Your Actions Influence Others Like the snapshots in the game, the things we share and focus on can influence those around us. Be intentional about spreading kindness, understanding, and constructive ideas. 4. Break the Cycle of Negativity The game’s chaotic ending is a warning of what happens when negativity escalates unchecked. Choose to amplify positive moments , solutions, and unity instead of feeding into division. Why is We Become What We Behold So Popular? Despite its simplicity, We Become What We Behold has resonated with players worldwide for several reasons: 1. Thought-Provoking Gameplay The game delivers a powerful message in just five minutes, leaving a lasting impact. It forces players to reflect on their role in shaping society’s narrative. 2. Simple Yet Effective Design The minimalist art style, quirky animations, and sound effects make the game visually appealing and accessible. Its simplicity allows the message to take center stage. 3. Commentary on Modern Society In an age dominated by social media, clickbait, and sensationalism , the game feels timely and relevant. It highlights how negativity spreads rapidly in today’s hyper-connected world. 4. Easy Accessibility The game is free to play and available online, making it accessible to a global audience. Its short duration makes it easy for anyone to experience, regardless of their gaming background. How to Play We Become What We Behold You can play We Become What We Behold for free on any browser: Steps to Play: Visit itch.io or any website hosting the game. Click “Start” to launch the game. Use your mouse to control the camera and capture moments. Watch how each snapshot influences the crowd and progresses the story. The game works seamlessly on desktops, laptops, and mobile browsers, making it accessible to everyone. Impact of We Become What We Behold on Society The game has sparked discussions about media ethics, human behavior , and the responsibility of both creators and consumers . Educators, students, and social commentators have used the game as a tool to explore topics like: How media shapes perceptions of reality The effects of negativity and sensationalism The role of individuals in fostering empathy and understanding Similar Games to We Become What We Behold If you enjoyed We Become What We Behold , here are a few similar thought-provoking games: Papers, Please by Lucas Pope A game about ethical dilemmas and the human cost of bureaucracy. The Republia Times by Lucas Pope A media simulation game where you control what news gets published. This War of Mine by 11 Bit Studios A survival game highlighting the realities of war from a civilian’s perspective. The Evolution of Trust by Nicky Case A game exploring trust, cooperation, and betrayal in society. Conclusion: Why We Become What We Behold Matters We Become What We Behold is a masterpiece of simplicity and meaning. It serves as a mirror, reflecting how our focus on negativity, fear, and conflict can shape society for the worse. In just five minutes, the game delivers a powerful critique of media sensationalism, while subtly reminding us of our responsibility to break the cycle of negativity .

With that in mind, crypto experts have singled out the three most promising investments for next year. Their first pick is DTX Exchange (DTX). Next, they listed Ripple (XRP). Lastly, they’ve chosen SUI. Each brings unique value and incredible promise, with DTX Exchange leading the charge due to its revolutionizing trading platform. A Massive XRP Move Fuels Bullish Predictions for Ripple Ripple is on the move again. According to WhaleWatcher, Ripple moved 60 million XRP tokens from one anonymous wallet to another. Before this, Ripple made two other massive XRP transfers, one amounting to 380 million XRP and the other to 200 million XRP. Ripple investors think that these large XRP moves are in preparation for something big, and they also might have been done because of the recent Ripple stable coin $RLUSD approval. All of these events are extremely bullish for XRP, which is why experts see XRP rising by at least 2x-3x in the 2025 bull cycle. Right now, XRP’s price is at $2.39, up by over 200% from its price a month ago. If XRP increases by 3x next year, this would catapult its price to above $7! Investors are Accumulating SUI as They Expect a Dip Before Another Surge SUI was one of the best-performing coins during Q4 of 2024. Namely, SUI’s price went from $1.90 on November 1 to $4.86 on December 13, 2024. This price rally saw SUI’s price climb by over 155% in about a month. This massive rise was fueled by the post-US elections rally and subsequent increased interest in SUI from the crypto market. Now, SUI is retracing, trading currently at $4.52. On January 1, 2025, SUI will unlock 2.19% of its tokens, pushing 64,190,000 SUI tokens into circulation. SUI investors and experts are confident that this new supply pump will result in a price dip for SUI. That’s because there will be more supply and the same demand as it happens. So, they see the dip as a great buying opportunity before the 2025 bull cycle heats up. After that, they expect SUI to rise again, as there’s a lot of interest in it and many new developments that will push interest even higher next year! DTX Exchange: The Star of the 2025 Bull Cycle! No one can deny that both XRP and SUI will do really well in the 2025 bull cycle. However, experts say that DTX Exchange will outperform them both. Their reasoning is simple: DTX Exchange brings massive utility at the perfect time, which is why it can easily become one of the top performers next year! So, what is DTX Exchange? DTX Exchange is a new and innovative crypto trading platform that will launch just as the 2025 bull cycle gains traction. DTX Exchange will allow traders to trade a wide range of assets, including crypto, stocks, bonds, ETFs, forex, and more, from one place. Also, they can trade with up to 1,000x leverage, making massive profits off of every trade they make. Furthermore, DTX Exchange will bring unprecedented speed to the market, with a speed of 100,000 TPS. This will allow DTX Exchange users to catch great entries and sell just when they want to. This incredible speed will be powered by the VulcanX blockchain, and it is much higher than what established chains like Solana and Ethereum bring. DTX Exchange also makes asset management much easier and safer. It does so via the Phoenix Wallet, which offers enterprise-grade security and supports over 100,000 financial instruments. Another feature that makes DTX Exchange stand out is its fair launch initiative. Namely, investing in DTX Exchange will give everyone, both small and large investors, a fair chance to enter and profit from this promising project. That’s because, unlike other crypto tokens, DTX Exchange isn’t backed by VCs and whales. Instead, it employs an incremental cliff strategy, one that sees the DTX token price rising steadily throughout the presale and even after the launch. So, whales won’t be able to nuke the chart and leave everyone else hanging when they’re done! Invest in the DTX Presale While You Still Can and Watch Your Portfolio Skyrocket in 2025! Right now, you have the once-in-a-lifetime chance to buy DTX tokens early. Currently, DTX is in Stage 6 of its public presale, available to you at $0.12. DTX is set to launch when it reaches a price of $0.20, giving potential investors a fair chance to join before the price soars. Once DTX launches, experts say that it will take off to massive heights. Experts like Crypto Infinity say that DTX will revolutionize trading, bringing huge opportunities to both newbies and pros. With that in mind, DTX can bring in at least 100x gains by Q1 of 2025 and even more as the bull cycle picks up in 2025!

37761587,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105449,1734438678,Experts Say XRP Current Setup is Far More Bullish Than a Drop to $0.50,"Notable market analysts continue to emphasize that XRP remains in a strong uptrend, countering views that suggest a potential breakdown to $0.5. In a post on X, analyst Dom discussed XRP from a higher time frame perspective, sharing a historical chart highlighting its peak rallies in the last two market cycles. According to Dom, the chart formation indicates that the asset ""wants higher.""XRP Current Setup Is ""Far More Bullish""Dom noted that XRP's current structure is different from its past peaks. He pointed out that in the 2017/2018 cycle, XRP had ten daily closes above $2 before reaching its all-time high, while in the 2020/2021 cycle, there were no closes above $2 before the peak.In contrast, Dom believes the current pattern suggests a higher value for XRP, as it has already seen 13 daily closes above $2. With XRP’s ongoing consolidation in the $2 range, Dom urged holders to remain patient, suggesting there’s still more room for upside potential. XRP chart by Dom Commenting on the analysis, technical analyst ""Chating Guy"" pointed out that some market observers have drawn bearish conclusions from XRP's historical patterns. However, he argued that anyone with a basic understanding of technical analysis would recognize that XRP's current pattern is ""far more bullish"" than the possibility of a drop to $0.50 , as some critics have suggested.The Foundation Behind Calls for a $0.50 XRP CrashCritics who predict a bearish outcome for XRP often focus on the trend of lower lows following the asset’s previous peaks in 2018 and 2021.For instance, after XRP hit $3.84 in January 2018, it fell to $1 within two weeks. By February of that year, it was trading below $1. Similarly, after reaching $1.96 in April 2021, XRP traded around $0.80 just four weeks later.Based on this historical trend, critics have warned market participants to take profits and exit the XRP market, with some projecting a crash to $0.50. However, this scenario has yet to materialize. Even though XRP lost some momentum after reaching $2.865 two weeks ago, it has remained in the $2 range.XRP Bull Run Gaining MomentumAt press time, XRP is experiencing a renewed surge, gaining over 14% today and trading at $2.71. Analysts believe that once the bull run picks up, XRP could rise to $4.50 before losing momentum again.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/17/experts-say-xrp-current-setup-is-far-more-bullish-than-a-drop-to-0-50/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=experts-say-xrp-current-setup-is-far-more-bullish-than-a-drop-to-0-50,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

With blockchain adoption rising, altcoins like Qubetics, Stacks, and Near Protocol are making waves. Stacks is riding the buzz of Bitcoin Layer 2, while Near Protocol’s focus on scalability has analysts predicting massive growth. Meanwhile, Qubetics is breaking barriers with its innovative tokenised marketplace. But how do these coins stack up against one another? And what makes Qubetics’ presale so exciting? Let’s dig into the latest updates, features, and investment potential of these top altcoins to help you make informed decisions. Qubetics: Revolutionising Markets with Tokenisation Qubetics ($TICS) is rewriting the rules of decentralised finance (DeFi) by addressing issues in traditional marketplaces. Illiquidity, lack of transparency, and access to high-value investments have long been barriers for average investors. With its tokenised marketplace, Qubetics is bringing real-world assets to the blockchain, offering fractional ownership, easier trading, and transparency for users. This success highlights the growing demand for secure, transparent platforms. Unlike traditional marketplaces where large investments can be inaccessible, Qubetics empowers smaller investors to participate in tokenised assets. Whether it’s real estate, art, or rare collectibles, Qubetics ensures liquidity and equal access. Imagine putting $1,000 into $TICS now. At $0.0342, you’d snag nearly 29,240 tokens. If prices hit $0.10 post-presale, your investment triples. And analysts speculate $TICS could reach $0.50 in 2025, thanks to the platform’s robust demand and limited supply. Plus, you can imagine the possibilities when the marketplace launches fully. Fractional ownership could democratise investments, giving everyday people access to assets that were once reserved for the wealthy. Unlike Stacks and Near Protocol, which are primarily focused on tech advancements, Qubetics prioritises solving pressing financial issues. Moreover, Qubetics has a strong roadmap and community backing. With over 10,000 holders already onboard, the momentum is undeniable. And as the presale progresses, the price is expected to increase, making now the perfect time to join. For more information on Qubetics, watch this video . Stacks: Building on Bitcoin’s Shoulders Stacks (STX) has earned a reputation as the gateway to Bitcoin-based smart contracts. By leveraging Bitcoin’s security and creating a decentralised app (dApp) ecosystem, Stacks is revolutionising blockchain technology. Recently, Stacks gained traction due to its role in Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, addressing scalability issues. Analysts believe this could push STX to $3.80 in 2025. But why is Stacks important? It combines the trust of Bitcoin with the flexibility of programmable contracts, enabling developers to build apps without compromising on decentralisation. While $1,000 in STX today might not offer the same explosive potential as newer presales like Qubetics, it’s still a solid bet for long-term growth. Stacks is ideal for investors seeking stability and steady gains rather than quick profits. Near Protocol: Ushering in the Next Era of Scalability Near Protocol (NEAR) is a game-changer when it comes to scalable, user-friendly blockchain networks. As demand for decentralised apps grows, Near’s sharding technology and developer-friendly platform make it a strong contender in the altcoin race. With predictions of NEAR reaching $20 by 2025, this coin promises big returns for patient investors. Near’s focus on reducing transaction costs and increasing speed appeals to businesses and developers, setting it apart from rivals. If you invested $1,000 in NEAR today, you’d be positioning yourself for substantial future gains. However, its price trajectory relies heavily on adoption rates and partnerships, making it a slightly riskier pick compared to Stacks or Qubetics. While Stacks and Near Protocol offer impressive features, Qubetics outshines them with its practical use cases. The presale’s performance already speaks volumes about investor confidence. By addressing liquidity and accessibility challenges, Qubetics ensures it isn’t just another speculative token—it’s a real solution for real problems. Final Thoughts: What’s the Best Altcoin to Invest in Today? If you’re looking for long-term growth, Stacks and Near Protocol are solid choices. They both bring cutting-edge solutions to the blockchain space and have promising futures. But for those wanting immediate impact and higher potential returns, Qubetics is the clear winner. The 13th stage of its presale marks a critical moment. With over $6.8 million raised and 347 million tokens sold, $TICS is on track to become one of the most successful altcoins of the year. Don’t miss out on your chance to join this growing community. Ready to invest in the future? Dive into Qubetics today and be part of a movement that’s transforming the way we trade, invest, and grow wealth.

37757207,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-gaming-industry-faces-leadership-consolidation-amid-mainstream-push/,1734438650,Web3 Gaming Industry Faces Leadership Consolidation Amid Mainstream Push,"The Web3 gaming sector is experiencing an increasing concentration of senior leadership roles, signaling a shift toward a more top-heavy structure as it prepares for mainstream expansion. According to the Blockchain Gaming Association’s 2024 survey , 73.2% of respondents identified as upper management, with nearly half — 46.7% — holding C-level, founder, or director positions. The survey, the largest yet from the association, gathered insights from 623 respondents spanning executives, developers, and professional e-sports players. The findings highlight the effects of tighter budgets and hiring slowdowns that followed the 2021 NFT boom and the subsequent crypto winter . As the industry matures, this consolidation of leadership reflects a focus on strategic decision-making and operational efficiency. However, the influx of seasoned professionals from the traditional gaming industry may be contributing to this trend. Over half of the respondents (52.5%) cited gaming as their primary area of expertise — a significant increase from 34.2% in 2023. In contrast, specialists from blockchain and cryptocurrency backgrounds have dwindled to 10.8%, a sharp decline from the 27.4% recorded in 2021. AAA Gaming on the Horizon The report suggests that Web3 gaming is positioning itself for a major breakthrough into the AAA gaming market by 2025. Industry giants like Ubisoft are set to launch blockchain-based titles with significant mainstream appeal, marking a potential turning point for the sector. Yet, challenges remain. Demographic data reveals that younger audiences are still largely absent. Individuals aged 18 to 24 made up just 6.1% of respondents, suggesting an uphill battle in attracting and nurturing next-generation talent. Without stronger engagement from younger users, sustaining long-term growth may prove difficult. “Web3’s leadership consolidation and static demographics underscore the need to engage younger audiences and cultivate future talent,” the report warned. Diversity Gaps Persist Another challenge highlighted in the survey is gender diversity. The report noted that 82% of respondents identified as male, a statistic that worsens at the executive level. Among C-level executives, directors, and founders, 87.2% were male, with women representing only 12.5%. While the Web3 blockchain gaming sector shows immense promise for mainstream adoption, these findings underscore the hurdles of inclusivity, talent development, and demographic engagement as the industry gears up for its next growth phase.

Chainlink (LINK), for example, has seen an impressive surge of nearly 25% in just 24 hours. This has sparked discussions about whether it can hit $35 before the year ends. Then there’s Kaspa (KAS), which is showing major potential with its unique blockDAG technology—could this be the next big thing in crypto? As these two powerhouses rally, there’s one more project you should absolutely keep an eye on: Qubetics ($TICS), which has already raised over $6.8M in its presale and is rapidly gaining attention for its innovative payment solutions. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, these three coins are all worth considering. With Qubetics ($TICS) offering a unique solution to everyday crypto transactions, and Chainlink and Kaspa pushing the boundaries in their respective sectors, 2024 looks set to be a year of high rewards for investors willing to make the right moves now. Qubetics ($TICS): Solving Real-Life Problems with Seamless Crypto Payments Let’s start with Qubetics ($TICS), the one that’s been stealing the spotlight recently. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s an innovative multi-chain wallet that integrates with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making it super easy to use crypto like you would any other payment method. Imagine grabbing coffee in the morning and paying with your Bitcoin, all while it’s instantly converted into fiat at the point of sale, thanks to Qubetics’ smart contract conversion mechanism. No more waiting for conversions or paying hefty fees—Qubetics is all about simplicity and speed. But why is this important? Well, for businesses and freelancers working internationally, Qubetics offers a way to avoid the usual crypto volatility and cross-border payment headaches. This solution is about making crypto transactions as smooth as swiping your debit card . The integration with major financial institutions means that anyone, whether you’re on iOS, Android, or even Desktop, can handle crypto just like regular money. Qubetics is in Presale Phase 13, with each token currently priced at $0.0342. With over 347M tokens sold and more than 10,000 holders, it’s clear that investors are jumping on the opportunity. The presale price is increasing by 10% every week, making it an exciting time for those who want to get in early. After the presale ends, the price is expected to hit $0.25, which means a potential 900% ROI for early investors. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Qubetics should be high on your list. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Network That’s Making Waves Chainlink (LINK) is no stranger to success. Known for providing decentralized oracles that allow smart contracts to interact with real-world data, Chainlink has been gaining serious momentum. In fact, Chainlink saw a 25% increase in just 24 hours, sparking speculation that it could reach $35 before the end of the year. What makes Chainlink so special? The platform powers thousands of decentralized applications (dApps), providing essential services to blockchain ecosystems. Whether it’s smart contracts for DeFi platforms, NFTs, or insurance, Chainlink is the backbone that ensures data flows securely between off-chain and on-chain systems. As the demand for decentralized finance and Web3 technologies continues to grow, Chainlink is one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 if you want to back a long-standing project with massive real-world use cases. Furthermore, Chainlink’s recent upgrades, such as Chainlink 2.0, are making it even more powerful. The addition of off-chain reporting (OCR) and more robust data feeds will enhance its reliability, ensuring that it continues to be a key player in the blockchain ecosystem. If you’re looking to ride the wave of smart contract and decentralized oracle growth, Chainlink is a smart choice. Kaspa (KAS): The DAG Revolution Now, let’s talk about Kaspa (KAS), a project that’s taking an entirely different approach. Unlike the traditional blockchain, Kaspa uses kDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) technology. This allows for faster transactions and increased scalability. While blockchain can sometimes hit a bottleneck, Kaspa’s architecture allows for multiple blocks to be processed in parallel—this leads to near-instant transactions and scalability without compromising security. In a recent analysis, experts highlighted Kaspa’s unique position in the market and compared it to other blockchain projects. The flexibility and efficiency of DAG could potentially make Kaspa the next big breakthrough in crypto. Many believe that Kaspa’s approach will solve some of the key issues that have plagued traditional blockchains, like slow transaction speeds and network congestion. With Kaspa’s growth and increasing developer interest, it’s certainly one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for those looking to invest in innovative blockchain solutions. As more developers build on Kaspa, the network’s value is expected to skyrocket, especially as scalability becomes an even more crucial factor for blockchain technology moving forward. Conclusion: Which Coin Will Provide Maximum ROI Before the New Year? All in all, Qubetics ($TICS), Chainlink (LINK), and Kaspa (KAS) are shaping up to be the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Each project has its own unique value proposition, making them ideal for investors looking to maximize their ROI before the New Year. Qubetics is redefining the way we handle crypto payments, offering a real-world solution with massive upside potential. Chainlink is a tried-and-true leader in the world of decentralized oracles, with its smart contract infrastructure only becoming more important. Kaspa is pioneering the future of scalable, fast transactions with its revolutionary blockDAG architecture. If you want to be ahead of the curve and position yourself for maximum ROI, these three coins should be in your portfolio. Don’t miss the opportunity—jump in now and ride the wave of innovation before 2025. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Chainlink (LINK), and Kaspa (KAS) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024.

37756613,https://finbold.com/?p=220110,1734438605,Why Polygon (POL) price is crashing,"Polygon (POL, formerly MATIC ) price is crashing by 38% year-to-date, suffering a high-time frame hit with the rebranding. Additionally, recent developments related to Polygon’s and Aave’s ( AAVE ) governance proposals have brought more turmoil to POL price this week. In particular, Allez Labs, Morpho Labs, and YearnFi have come together to make a governance proposal for Polygon’s bridged stablecoins. According to the pre-PIP, these DeFi protocols want to activate the $1.3 billion in stablecoin reserves of the PoS bridge. Pre-PIP: Polygon PoS Bridge Liquidity Program. Source: Polygon Governance The community, however, received this proposal with bad eyes, bringing fear, uncertainty, and doubt regarding the safety of users’ assets. Comments in the Polygon Foundation’s related post talk about how this is “not a good idea,” “the worst idea ever,” or a “terrible idea from a risk-awareness perspective,” said Torgin, auditor at Chain Security. “Sorry, this is actually not a good idea because the people who hold stablecoins on the Polygon PoS bridge have decided not to take risks with it. By putting it inside a vault, we’re forcing them to take risks and not rewarding them for it.” – Nomad (@JourneyMacro), as a comment on X Aave proposes removing Polygon from its lending services Besides the immediate community backlash, other decentralized finance protocols have already started to take action against Polygon’s bridge proposal. For example, the AaveDAO founder Marc “Billy” Zeller made an Aave governance proposal as a direct response four days later. Zeller argued that “Polygon is 1.5% of Aave DAO revenue,” judging the billion-dollar-worth bad debt risk not worth it. The discussion happened in a post by Ignas, explaining it would represent a huge loss for Polygon. “If @lemiscate [(Marc “Billy” Zeller)] proposal passes, LTV will [be] set to 0% (basically shutting operations), freeze multiple asset reserves on Aave V3 Polygon, and even migrate governance from Polygon. Such [an] L for Polygon.” – Ignas | DeFi Polygon (POL) price analysis Notably, Polygon’s native token is trading at $0.594, down 38.65% year-to-date, despite crypto being in a bull market . Furthermore, since late September, POL (formerly MATIC) has seen a significant volume drop, suggesting a lack of interest from investors. Polygon (POL, formerly MATIC) year-to-date price chart. Source: Finbold On the other hand, AAVE has surged by nearly 120% in the last 30 days, as Finbold reported , with bullish potential for the year-end. Now, traders and investors speculate on the consequences of Polygon’s proposal to use its bridge’s reserves for DeFi yield farming. Moreover, Aave’s response could also drastically influence the demand and utility of POL, potentially affecting its market price. This happens in a critical moment for the project, considering analysts expect Q1 2025 to ignite “ the mother of all bull markets ,” risking leaving Polygon behind in the so-awaited crypto bull run .

37756618,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744767-bit-digital-a-fork-in-the-road?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1734438600,Bit Digital: A Fork In The Road,"Summary In Q3-24, 53% of Bit Digital's top line revenue came from its HPC services segment. However, management has acknowledged a shift in the HPC services market. Client expectations have changed from pre-sold GPU capacity being acceptable to company's requiring inventory in-hand. Bit Digital's perception in the market still reflects one that is a ""crypto business"" rather than an HPC business. Driving share dilution rather than borrowing to fund capex growth. The company has nearly $200 million in digital asset liquidity as of 12/16/24 and over $151 million in cash as of the end of November. Conference call commentary foreshadows a 'separation of business lines' is likely in the cards for Bit Digital. I would not personally rule an exit from BTC mining entirely. It has been about four months since I last covered Bit Digital ( BTBT ) for Seeking Alpha. Since that piece, we have another quarter of corporate performance and two additional months of mining results to consider. For those who have not followed either my previous work or this ticker specifically, I've covered the company eight times in the last two years and flipped my call from 'hold' to 'buy' in March 2023 . Data by YCharts While the stock is up over 200% since that time, the performance against peers has been a bit more mixed. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining companies that have steadfastly avoided building out HPC/AI segments have generally lagged the sector while those that have leaned hard into HPC have generally out-performed those that haven't. The market doesn't yet seem to know what to make of BTBT at this juncture given it's performed more in line with the broader sector average as illustrated above by the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ). This is odd to me because BTBT is now officially generating more revenue from HPC than it is from mining Bitcoin. In this update, we'll jump into the latest numbers, dissect a key takeaway from the Q3 conference call, and examine how the market is currently valuing the company. Revenue Trend Revenues Q3-24 Q3-23 YoY Mining $10,110,221 $11,315,061 -10.6% HPC Services $12,151,302 - - ETH staking $447,004 $244,780 82.6% Total revenues $22,708,527 $11,559,841 96.4% Source: Bit Digital For the quarter ended September, Bit Digital reported $22.7 million in top line revenue. This was a year-over-year increase of 96.4% but a 21.7% sequential decline from Q2. COGS in the quarter came in at $10 million for BTC mining, $5.5 million for HPC services and a little under $12k for ETH staking. Gross margin from BTC mining in the month fell to 1.1%: Gross Margin Q3-24 Q3-23 YoY Mining 1.1% 22.4% -95.1% HPC Services 55.1% - - ETH Staking 97.4% 92.2% 5.7% Source: Bit Digital, Analyst's calculations The year-over-year collapse in gross margin from mining Bitcoin is directly attributable to the worsening economics of mining BTC following the block reward halving in April. And remember, all of this is before factoring in opex and depreciation. Bit Digital's net loss in the quarter was $38.8 million - the majority of which was due to a $21.9 million revaluation loss on digital assets per FASB accounting standards. During Q3, Bit Digital's percentage of revenue for HPC hit 53.5% - up from 43% in Q2. The company is still guiding for $100 million annualized run rate for its HPC business by the end of the year. Frankly, I think investors may want to prepare for the possibility that Bit Digital doesn't get there. Bit Digital, Analyst's Chart November was the fourth month out of the last five where HPC revenue was $4.3 million. The company is still running an annualized HPC revenue rate well below $100 million. In the announced GPU highlights from the company's November update, Bit Digital appears to have added just under $2 million per month based on 3 separate agreements date November 14th. If we add that $2 million to the $4.3 million from prior clients, we're still a little over $2 million short of the $100 million annual rate with one month to go. The other thing that concerns me about Bit Digital hitting end of the year HPC guidance is the change in the market that was expressed on the Q3 call. Leadership mentioned that it is becoming difficult to pre-sell GPU capacity. CEO Sam Tabar: The supply of H100 in the market has increased and it has become more challenging to win deals without an available inventory on hand. The sales cycle has compressed from months to weeks in some cases. We are evaluating pre-ordering more GPUs prior to having them contracted to better compete for the types of customers where deployment speed is the key determinant. As I see it, the risk in Bit Digital's HPC business has grown just at the time the company seems most poised to fully commit to it. Again, HPC is not like Bitcoin mining for a few reasons. While it is far more profitable than mining from a gross margin standpoint, it requires a sales staff, a client/prospect funnel, and an ability to manage deals while keeping client churn to a minimum. A market that has pivoted from GPU pre-sales to one that demands capacity in-hand means Bit Digital has to commit to expensive hardware before it has any assurances that it can monetize the investment. 'Separation of Business Lines' Sam Tabar has repeatedly said on conference calls that the company doesn't want to play in the Bitcoin mining arms race. Thus, cap-ex priority has shifted to HPC hardware rather than BTC mining hardware. Given the changing dynamics in the HPC services market, indications seem to be that Bit Digital now has to scale cap-ex earlier than perhaps originally anticipated. Factoring in that Bit Digital's mining footprint also faces challenges, I believe it is possible we even see Bit Digital exit the mining business entirely in 2025. Coinmint is Bit Digital's largest hosting provider at 1.4 of the company's 2.5 EH/s. That relationship is changing because Coinmint was acquired by a third party who is choosing to terminate the contract with Bit Digital. Tabar pointed out on the conference call that the cost of production through Coinmint was slightly higher than the company's average. Bit Digital guided for 3.0 exahash by the end of February in spite of the developments with Coinmint. Regardless, the Q3 call was somewhat eye-opening because of repeated mentions that the company is exploring a possible separation of the business lines. There are a couple of factors driving this exploration. First, Bit Digital believes the stock is being undervalued by the market because the HPC business potential isn't being fully appreciated. Second, Bit Digital needs to finance capacity build out for its HPC segment, and the company will have more borrowing opportunities if it isn't perceived to be a crypto business. Valuing BTBT If one takes the view that Bit Digital will indeed hit its $100 million annualized HPC revenue guidance, then the next thing to factor into a valuation model is what can reasonably be expected from the Bitcoin mining segment. Presently, the company is averaging about 50 BTC per month post-halving at a current hash rate of 2.5 EH/s. At current Bitcoin prices ($105k), Bit Digital's annualized revenue from mining is about $63 million. Annualized Revenue Today's Prices $150k BTC, $6k ETH Mining Revenue $63 million $90 million HPC Services $100 million $100 million ETH Staking $3.4 million $5.1 million Total Revenue $166.4 million $195.1 million Source: Analyst's calculations. Today's prices being $105k BTC and $4k ETH. ETH Staking rewards assume 3.1% blended APY If we value the company through a basic price to sales multiple on the assumption that it will indeed reach $100 million in annualized HPC revenue by the end of the year, then at today's coin prices, BTBT is trading at about 4.3 times forward sales. This is certainly not an excessively aggressive valuation based on 3.3 info tech sector median, but I don't think we can say BTBT is necessarily cheap either. Until the company shifts to financing growth via borrowing, dilution is still the primary mechanism for raising cash. Tabar from the Q3 CC: I think we issued 38 million shares on the ATM since the end of June. We have massive CapEx plans and the equity issuance has been the bridge gap. Fortunately, we -- look, we need to ensure that we have enough capital to get the ball rolling in our data center build-out and to provide for near-term GPU ramp. And we've been careful on the credit side. The P/S estimate above is largely based on the assumption that there are now 175.4 million common shares outstanding. The share figure is based on the 137.4 million shares outstanding number from the end of June and the 38 million shares since added via ATM. Since the company has funded growth through dilution rather than debt, Bit Digital's balance sheet remains exceptional: $ in Millions Holdings Value Bitcoin 813 $85.4 Ethereum 27,563 $110.2 Cash/Equivalents $151.30 $151.3 Total $346.9 Source: Bit Digital, calculations based on November asset totals at today's $105k BTC and $4k ETH prices At the end of November, the company had over $181.2 million in digital assets. From pure price appreciation, that digital asset liquidity now stands at $195 million. Cash and equivalents were $151.3 at the end of the month, which - if not significantly drawn down in two weeks - gives Bit Digital a total of $347 million in liquid capital that can be deployed for hardware capacity. If we add in the $77 million in net property, plant, and equipment with $28.7 million in long-term investments and deduct the $61 million in total liabilities from Q3, we get a book value for Bit Digital somewhere in the $392 million ballpark. This would imply a price to book valuation of about 1.83. Again, this is not at all an aggressive valuation of the company in my opinion. Closing Thoughts Where an investor likely falls on Bit Digital likely comes down to how much they believe in the long-term growth story for HPC services revenue. It seems fairly clear at this point that the company is at least entertaining life after Bitcoin mining. This is evident by Bit Digital's unwillingness to engage in the hash rate arms race, and also by Q3 call commentary that overtly mentions separating the businesses. The Coinmint acquisition presents short-term challenges at a time when Bitcoin's price is beginning to surge higher. And despite the company's HPC service revenue becoming the primary driver of top line growth in Q3, Bit Digital is still funding growth like a Bitcoin mining company - namely, via diluting shareholders. Based on my own valuation estimates, I think BTBT is fairly priced. However, in my view, it seems as though the company has hit a fork in the road and now must pick a direction. Back in June, I felt the company was a buyout candidate in a post-halving world due to its fleet efficiency and balance sheet strength. But the market for GPUs as a service has changed, and the company needs to ramp cap-ex to fund growth before clients will sign on. So far, the company hasn't funded growth without diluting shareholders due to its 'crypto company' perception. Based on Q3 commentary from management, that may be changing soon. I think 2025 will be a very interesting year for Bit Digital, and it remains one of my long positions.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744767-bit-digital-a-fork-in-the-road?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37756618.jpeg

Take Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu, for instance. They made early investments that turned into life-changing sums, and some 'early adopters' made more than $1m from as little as $104. The next big opportunity is on the hunt for the approach of the next bull run. The frontrunners include Bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency, and Rexas Finance (RXS), a groundbreaking platform to constructively redefine asset tokenization, among many. Both these projects present something unique, and anyone interested in getting on the next wave of crypto success will have to keep an eye out for these. Bitcoin: The Timeless King of Crypto Bitcoin is the undisputed king of the cryptocurrency market and is frequently the first cryptocurrency both seasoned investors and new investors wish to invest in. While BTC is more mature as an asset, being able to weather market volatility and still bring substantial returns makes it an anchor for any crypto portfolio. With institutional adoption kicking in, Bitcoin is turning into a digital store of value that starts turning into gold. The supply is capped at 21 million coins, and as demand increases, the price potential still carries huge potential. Eyeballing it now seems like an ideal time to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon, with many analysts predicting that BTC will rally to $200k in the coming bull run. Bitcoin is a financial asset, and not just for bubbles. BTC remains useful for payments, with Lightning Network making steady progress towards realizing that mission, while investor sentiment enjoys regulatory acceptance in different jurisdictions. The crypto market is growing and Bitcoin's dominance as a leading crypto, paired with institutions backing its stability, allows it to remain a choice safe bet for anyone looking to profit from the next big crypto market uprush. Rexas Finance: The Next Big Thing in Crypto Although Bitcoin is stable, Rexas Finance (RXS) provides enormous room for growth. RXS has already grabbed huge attention due to its innovative way of asset tokenization, allowing users to digitize real assets such as real estate, art, and intellectual property. This unique model creates liquidity and unveils new sources of investment opportunities globally. Rexas Finance recently hit a major sales milestone as its Stage 9 presale which was recently sold out, raised over $26 million ahead of time. Its vision seems to be gaining confidence among investors, as is evidenced by the overwhelming investor interest. With the tokens now in Stage 10, the price of tokens is $0.15 each, representing a golden opportunity for investors to secure massive returns prior to the tokens widespread launch. And the attractiveness of the platform’s deflationary tokenomics, such as a fixed supply and buyback and burn mechanism, is another layer of appeal. In addition to the CertiK audit, Rexas Finance's listings on top platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko are solidifying its base for long-term success. Not only will RXS be listed on three Tier-1 exchanges, as well as analysts predicting a 1000% ROI, but we truly have an opportunity that is undeniably one of the most exciting opportunities in the crypto space. Why These Two Coins Are the Perfect Pair Bitcoin and Rexas Finance can be used by investors because they are complementary. Bitcoin, despite having conquered numerous waves, is an asset that is stable and, more recently, has been adopted by institutional players; the very fact supports the idea of depending on Bitcoin. Rexas Finance is unique; it has massive ROI potential for exponential growth. By combining different positions, they create a portfolio that can survive the ups and downs of the markets while still expecting great returns. For both projects, the upcoming bull market looms bright. Due to Bitcoin’s prominent status as an anchor crypto in the market, renewed investor interest will benefit it, while Rexas Finance's innovative vision sets them up as a pioneer in the next generation of blockchain innovation. Conclusion Other stories that emerged from the early investors in Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu turned small quantities of money into life-changing sums, showing that it’s all matters with grabbing the right opportunity. However, Bitcoin and Rexas Finance are two prime candidates for some really nice profits as the next crypto bull run looms. Rexas Finance’s innovative asset tokenization with massive ROI potential coupled with bitcoin’s proven resilience and growing institutional adoption makes bitcoin a staple for long-term portfolios. If you are an investor wanting to make future fortune from crypto coins, these two alone can be termed a powerful combo to use in taking advantage of the surge in the coming wave of the crypto market.

According to the Blockchain Game Alliance’s (BGA) 2024 State of the Industry report , 52.5% of industry professionals have a background in traditional gaming—the highest figure since the survey’s inception in 2021. Blockchain Experts Account for 10% of Web3 Gaming Workforce In contrast, blockchain and cryptocurrency specialists now account for only 10.8% of the workforce, a sharp decline from 21.7% in 2023. Per the report: “For an industry that has faced great scrutiny regarding the importance of building fun-first and less financialized games, it is significant to see an increased prevalence of professionals coming from a background in gaming as opposed to blockchain or cryptocurrency.” Digital asset ownership continues to be the most valued feature of blockchain gaming, with 71% of the 623 respondents identifying it as a key advantage. This sentiment has remained consistent since the first BGA survey in 2021. Other noted benefits include new player reward models and alternative revenue streams, which underscore blockchain’s potential to transform the gaming landscape. 1/ Web3 Gaming hit new heights in November with a record 24.6M daily unique active wallets (dUAW) fueled by rising user activity and BTC’s historic increase past $100K. Overview below Read the full DappRadar x @BGameAlliance November Games Report! https://t.co/cAe1NTZRvY — DappRadar (@DappRadar) December 10, 2024 However, challenges persist. Poor user experience and onboarding difficulties remain the industry’s most pressing issues, though 54% of respondents flagged them as concerns—a notable improvement from 80% in 2023. The stigma surrounding blockchain games also endures. Two-thirds of respondents cited allegations of scams as a major challenge, while 30% noted concerns about bot activity within Web3 games. Despite these obstacles, the industry’s evolution towards a player-focused approach signals ongoing efforts to bring blockchain gaming to the mainstream. Telegram Dominates Web3 Gaming As reported, Telegram has emerged as a significant platform for Web3 gaming, capturing 21% of new game launches in 2024. Developers and publishers are leveraging the messaging app to boost user acquisition and engagement, Game7, a community dedicated to advancing blockchain technology in gaming, said in its 2024 State of Web3 Gaming Report. The report, created in collaboration with research firm Naavik, claimed that the surge in Telegram’s influence could challenge traditional mobile platforms like Apple and Google, which continue to impose restrictive app store policies and face regulatory uncertainties. The report further revealed that Immutable and Arbitrum stand out as the fastest-growing ecosystems in Web3 gaming. Immutable recorded a 71% year-over-year growth, with 181 announced titles, many of which migrated from Polygon. Arbitrum achieved a 68% increase, driven by its Orbit Framework, which supported 23 new gaming networks. The rise of Layer 2 and Layer 3 networks has become the new standard for blockchain gaming. In terms of geography, APAC regions, including South Korea and Singapore, accounted for 39% of new Web3 game launches, followed closely by the U.S. at 36%. Despite a 36% decline in new game announcements compared to 2023, the sector saw an 84% drop in developer exits, signaling increased stability.

37756453,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110834,1734438323,FNAF 2: A Comprehensive Guide to Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,"FNAF 2: A Comprehensive Guide to Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 (FNAF 2) remains one of the most iconic games in the horror genre, continuing the legacy of the Five Nights at Freddy’s franchise. Released in 2014 by indie developer Scott Cawthon , FNAF 2 builds on its predecessor’s success with more terrifying animatronics, challenging gameplay , and a gripping backstory. Whether you’re new to the franchise or a seasoned horror enthusiast, this guide will provide everything you need to know about FNAF 2 —from gameplay mechanics and story details to survival tips and fan theories. What is FNAF 2? Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is the second installment in the FNAF series , a point-and-click survival horror game. Players assume the role of a night security guard at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza , tasked with monitoring security cameras and surviving against malfunctioning animatronics that roam the pizzeria after dark. Unlike its predecessor, FNAF 2 introduces new mechanics, more animatronics , and no doors to block the relentless attackers, making the game significantly more challenging and frightening. FNAF 2 Release Date and Platforms FNAF 2 was released on November 11, 2014 , only a few months after the first game. It became instantly popular for its fresh mechanics and lore development. Available Platforms: PC (Steam) Mobile (Android and iOS) PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch (as part of the FNAF bundle) FNAF 2 Storyline and Setting The Premise The game takes place in 1987 , serving as a prequel to the first Five Nights at Freddy’s game. Players take on the role of Jeremy Fitzgerald , a newly hired night guard at a revamped Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza location. The establishment has introduced “Toy Animatronics” , modernized versions of the older animatronics. However, despite their cheerful exterior, these new animatronics are prone to strange behaviors at night. The Bite of ’87 FNAF 2 subtly references the infamous “Bite of ’87” , a major event in the franchise lore where an animatronic attacked a customer, leading to severe injuries. This storyline detail adds layers of intrigue, encouraging players to explore the mysteries of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. FNAF 2 Gameplay Mechanics The gameplay in FNAF 2 builds on the original formula while introducing new elements: 1. Monitor Security Cameras Similar to FNAF 1, players must use security cameras to track the animatronics’ movements. Cameras cover various areas, including hallways, party rooms, and the prize corner. 2. No Safety Doors Unlike the first game, FNAF 2 does not include security doors to block animatronics. Players must rely on wearing a Freddy Fazbear mask or using lights to deter attackers. 3. Freddy Fazbear Mask Players can wear a Freddy mask to trick most animatronics into thinking they are one of them. However, some animatronics, like Foxy, are not fooled by the mask. 4. Wind Up the Music Box Players must wind up a music box in the Prize Corner to prevent the Puppet (Marionette) from attacking. Failing to keep the music box wound up results in an inevitable game over. 5. Flashlight The flashlight is essential for checking the dark hallways and deterring Foxy and Mangle . Flashlight power is limited, so players must use it wisely. All Animatronics in FNAF 2 FNAF 2 features 10 animatronics that players must monitor and survive against. They are divided into two categories: 1. Toy Animatronics The Toy Animatronics are the new, shinier versions of the original characters. Toy Freddy: A friendly-looking bear who becomes hostile at night. Toy Bonnie: A blue bunny with a guitar. Approaches from the air vents. Toy Chica: A yellow chicken with a bib that says “Let’s Party!” Mangle: A broken, spider-like animatronic who hangs from the ceiling. Balloon Boy (BB): A mischievous character who disables the flashlight, making Foxy harder to manage. 2. Withered Animatronics The older animatronics are worn-out versions of the originals, lurking in the shadows. Withered Freddy: Resembles the Freddy from FNAF 1 but with a damaged appearance. Withered Bonnie: Missing its face, creating a terrifying and unsettling design. Withered Chica: Distorted jaws and broken arms make her one of the creepiest animatronics. Withered Foxy: Requires careful flashlight management to prevent attacks. 3. The Puppet (Marionette) The Puppet hides in the Prize Corner and is awakened if the music box is not wound up. Once it activates, there’s no way to stop it from attacking. Tips to Survive in FNAF 2 FNAF 2’s difficulty can feel overwhelming, especially for beginners. Here are essential tips to help you survive the nights: 1. Prioritize the Music Box Always keep an eye on the Prize Corner camera to wind up the music box. Letting it stop will summon the Puppet, resulting in a game over. 2. Use the Freddy Mask Wisely When animatronics appear in your office, put on the Freddy mask immediately to avoid being attacked. Balloon Boy, Toy Freddy, and Toy Bonnie can be fooled with the mask. 3. Manage Flashlight Power Flashlight power is limited, so avoid overusing it. Use the flashlight sparingly to check the hallways and stop Withered Foxy or Mangle. 4. Check the Vents Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, and Balloon Boy use the air vents to sneak into the office. Use the cameras to monitor vent activity. 5. Stay Calm and Listen Audio cues are crucial. Listen for sounds like breathing, footsteps, and the rattling of vents to anticipate animatronic movements. Why FNAF 2 is a Fan Favorite FNAF 2 is often considered one of the best games in the Five Nights at Freddy’s series for several reasons: 1. Increased Challenge The lack of doors, introduction of new mechanics, and a larger roster of animatronics make the game more intense and challenging. 2. Richer Lore FNAF 2 expands on the mysterious lore of the franchise, including the origins of the animatronics and hints at the Bite of ’87 . 3. Improved Animatronic Designs The Toy and Withered Animatronics have iconic designs that are both unsettling and memorable, adding to the game’s creepy atmosphere. 4. Replay Value The game offers increasing difficulty across five nights , along with unlockable custom nights for added replayability. FNAF 2’s Legacy in the Horror Genre Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 solidified the franchise as a cornerstone of the horror gaming genre. It inspired sequels, spin-offs, merchandise, fan theories, and even a feature film adaptation. Its unique gameplay and spine-chilling atmosphere have earned it a loyal fanbase and continued popularity across YouTube and streaming platforms. Conclusion: Why FNAF 2 is a Must-Play Horror Game FNAF 2 delivers a heart-pounding survival horror experience with its terrifying animatronics, challenging mechanics, and gripping lore. As a prequel to the original game, it adds depth to the story of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza while introducing innovative gameplay elements that keep players on edge. Whether you’re a horror fan, a newcomer to the series, or a returning player, FNAF 2 offers an unforgettable experience that tests your reflexes, resource management, and courage. Are you ready to survive the nights? Play FNAF 2 today and see if you can outlast the animatronics lurking in the shadows.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-loves-bitcoin-muskbtc-memecoin-will-explode-over-13000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37756670,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320163,1734438157,Hong Kong Pledges Crypto Asset Reporting Framework by 2026 to Combat Tax Evasion,"Hong Kong has announced its commitment to implementing the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), an initiative to enhance international tax transparency and combat cross-border tax evasion. This announcement, made at the OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Effective Exchange of Information in Tax Matters, aligns with the global effort to address the crypto-asset market’s challenges. The CARF, introduced by the OECD in June 2023, extends the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) for the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information. It offers a robust mechanism for jurisdictions to share crypto-related tax data. The framework mandates the annual exchange of crypto asset accounts and transaction information between jurisdictions where users or controlling persons are tax residents. Hong Kong Crypto Asset Framework: Can This Combat Tax Evasion? According to Hui Ching-yu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, the government aims to complete the necessary local legislative amendments by 2026. This will pave the way for the first automatic exchange of information with relevant tax jurisdictions in 2028. The framework’s adoption will be reciprocal, ensuring that partner jurisdictions also adhere to stringent data confidentiality and security standards. Hui also emphasized the government’s intention to consult stakeholders and the public during the legislative process. “The government will listen to the views of relevant stakeholders and the public when preparing the necessary legislative amendments.” Since 2018, Hong Kong has automatically exchanged financial account information with partner jurisdictions under the CRS. The CARF builds on this legacy, addressing the unique complexities of crypto assets and adapting to their rapid market evolution. Global Implications and Hong Kong’s Strategic Role The OECD’s introduction of CARF reflects the global consensus that crypto-related tax transparency is necessary given the asset class’s meteoric rise. The CARF’s implementation will likely spur increased scrutiny of crypto transactions, compelling crypto-asset firms and users to adapt to stricter compliance requirements. This shift will enhance the integrity of financial systems worldwide, deterring illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. A recent report indicates that Hong Kong is intensifying efforts to solidify its status as a premier offshore financial hub by proposing tax exemptions on cryptocurrency profits , private credit, overseas property, and carbon credits. Hong Kong has unveiled plans to fast-track crypto licensing for trading platforms, aiming to strengthen its position as a leading global cryptocurrency hub. https://t.co/vhZ8RuXpor — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 11, 2024 A six-week consultation is underway to refine these measures. Complementing this, Hong Kong has embraced the crypto sector, introducing retail and institutional trading regulations, licensing exchanges like Hashkey and OSL, and enabling ZA Bank to offer direct cryptocurrency trading for retail customers. Hong Kong is also accelerating its efforts to become a global cryptocurrency hub with a fast-track licensing process for trading platforms and new regulatory measures. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is developing a swift licensing framework, while a consultative panel to support licensed platforms is expected in early 2024. Since launching its crypto licensing regime in June 2023, firms like OSL Exchange and HashKey Exchange have obtained licenses, allowing them to serve retail investors. Additionally, Hong Kong is introducing legislation to regulate stablecoin issuers, requiring fiat-referenced stablecoins to be licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in alignment with global trends. As part of its ongoing effort, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has recently launched the Digital Bond Grant Scheme (DBGS) to incentivize the issuance of tokenized bonds by covering up to 50% of eligible expenses, capped at $321,184 per grant.

37756324,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394150,1734438067,"Ethereum Whale Dominance Hits Record High, but Here’s the Risk","The post Ethereum Whale Dominance Hits Record High, but Here’s the Risk appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum’s whale dominance has reached an all-time high, and this could have significant consequences for the future of the network. While smaller investors hold less than ever, whales—large ETH holders—are quietly increasing their positions. This raises an important question: Is this the beginning of another bull run, or is there something else at play? Whales Are in Control Currently, 104 wallets hold over 100,000 ETH each, making up 57.35% of Ethereum’s total supply—the highest percentage ever recorded. In contrast, mid-sized investors (those holding between 100 and 100,000 ETH) now control just 33.46%, the smallest share in history. Source : Santiment Smaller investors are also seeing their influence shrink. Wallets holding fewer than 100 ETH now account for just 9.19% of the total supply, the smallest proportion since January 2021. This shift has been building since late 2022, when large investors began accumulating more ETH. It’s clear that the whales are positioning themselves for the long term, potentially anticipating a major market shift. A Familiar Pattern: Will History Repeat Itself? This isn’t the first time whale activity has influenced Ethereum’s price. In late 2020 and early 2021, similar whale accumulation sparked a bull run that saw ETH reach new heights. However, there’s also a cautionary tale. When whale dominance peaked in 2022, it was followed by a sharp price correction, reminding us that whale-driven markets can be volatile. A Look at the Technicals Ethereum is currently priced at $4,015, with immediate resistance at $4,109. The 4-hour chart shows the 20-day moving average (MA) at $3,931, while strong support lies at $3,575, backed by the MA 200. Source : Coinglass The technical indicators show cautious optimism. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.42, meaning ETH is not yet in overbought territory. However, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) at -44.94 shows some hesitation among investors. Money In, Money Out: Investor Breakdown Looking at investor behavior, data from IntoTheBlock reveals that 74% of Ethereum holders have held their ETH for over a year, indicating strong confidence in the asset. Short-term holders are divided as follows: 22% bought ETH between 1 month and 12 months ago. 4% are newer investors, having bought in the past month. In terms of profitability, the outlook is positive: 94% of Ethereum holders are in profit. 3% are breaking even. 3% are at a loss, mostly those who bought during Ethereum’s all-time high (ATH) of $4,891 in November 2021. However, around 4.27 million addresses are holding 1.21 million ETH at a loss, with most of these purchases made between $4,093 and $4,891, which is close to the current price. Source : IntoTheBlock Bullish or Risky? What Does This Mean for the Average Investor? So, what does all of this mean for the average investor? There are two possible scenarios. On the bullish side, the whales’ ongoing accumulation points to long-term optimism. If this trend continues, ETH could rise to the $4,500–$5,000 range. However, there’s also a risk. With so much of the supply controlled by a few wallets, the market becomes more vulnerable. A coordinated sell-off by these whales could lead to a sudden price drop. It’s something to keep a close watch on as Ethereum’s future unfolds. In the end, Ethereum whale dominance serves as a reminder that the biggest players still have the most control in this market. Whether this dominance leads to a new bull run or a market correction remains to be seen.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ethereum-whale-dominance-hits-record-high-what-comes-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Three particularly valuable coins— Rexas Finance (RXS), Arbitrum (ARB), and Fantom (FTM)—are ready to yield 10x returns by early 2025 as the next bull run gets underway. Each presents fresh technology, substantial market presence, and the ability to redefine blockchain use. Rexas Finance (RXS): Revolutionizing DeFi and Real Estate Tokenization Focused on tokenizing real estate and finance (DeFi), Rexas Finance (RXS) is a game-changing blockchain technology. It lets real-world assets—like real estate—be tokenized, giving consumers quick, safe, open access to financial tools. This creativity connects modern blockchain solutions with established markets. By establishing fractional ownership of actual objects and enabling users to tokenize real-world assets, Rexas Finance's creative platform opens high-value investments beyond the reach of only wealthy individuals. Through its Rexas Launchpad, the platform also helps entrepreneurs and inventors generate money quickly, thereby supporting new token launches in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, the Rexas QuickMint Bot simplifies token creation for non-technical users, allowing straightforward entry into the tokenization market on platforms like Telegram and Discord. With over $27.4 million raised and over 342.2 million tokens sold, Rexas Finance (RXS) is in Stage 10 of its presale, priced at $0.15. While its Certik audit shows a dedication to security, the project's participation in CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko supports its legitimacy. A $1 million giveaway with $50,000 worth of RXS tokens to 20 fortunate winners will also help investors. Rexas Finance's (RXS) capacity to tokenize real estate assets and its rising acceptance in the DeFi industry help explain its potential to 10x your portfolio. Given its intended listing at higher pricing and robust ecosystem, early investors should see significant returns by early next year. Arbitrum (ARB): A Game-Changer for Ethereum Scalability Arbitrum distinguishes itself among Ethereum scaling alternatives by using optimistic roll-ups, providing significant benefits, including compliance with unmodified EVM contracts, thus facilitating seamless transfer of Ethereum DApps without code changes. Despite maintaining Ethereum's strong security, it achieves scalability by processing thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees and quick finality. Stylus, a future tool that will let developers utilize popular programming languages like Rust and C++ for smart contract deployment, helps to improve its adaptability. Driven by its native token ARB, Arbitrum's governance system lets holders use the Arbitrum DAO to impact essential choices. Users of this system can vote on questions of governance, funds allocation, and protocol changes. As of writing, ARB's live price is $1.07, offering investors a reasonable starting place. Arbitrum's significance in scaling Ethereum's network will rise as the tool becomes more well-known, allowing investors to expand their holdings. As Ethereum acceptance increases, analysts estimate ARB might be 10x its present value, hence a formidable competitor for early 2025 expansion. Fantom (FTM): The Ethereum Alternative for DApps High-performance Layer-1 blockchain Fantom provides digital assets and an open-source framework for decentralized apps (DApps). By shining in scalability, security, and decentralization, it is designed to surpass the restrictions of past blockchain generations. Driven by its Lachesis consensus engine, Fantom supports Opera chains compatible with Ethereum. This technology guarantees fast, safe, and cheap transactions. Fantom also offers perfect DApp integration, built-in DeFi tools, and thorough staking rewards. As of this writing, its live price is $1.31, so both novice and experienced investors can find it appealing. With a scratch-built consensus mechanism dubbed Lachesis, Fantom offers greater capacity, two-second transaction finalizing, and improved security compared to conventional proof-of-stake (PoS) systems. This facilitates DeFi and innovative contract-based applications. Designed to compete with Ethereum, Fantom attracts developers looking for worldwide compatible decentralized solutions. Underlying transactions, FTM, the in-house PoS token, helps the platform collect fees, staking activity, and user rewards. Fantom's rising acceptance among developers and strong technological stack help to explain its 10x your portfolio capability. Fantom's ecosystem will become a preferred choice as blockchain applications explode, increasing its value to unprecedented levels in 2025. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity Rexas Finance (RXS), Arbitrum (ARB), and Fantom (FTM) are straightforward options for investors hoping to 10x their holdings early next year. Every currency offers unique features that are suitable for a developing blockchain market. Early investments in these initiatives could pay off handsomely for life.

37757492,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/ripple-rolls-out-long-awaited-rlusd-stablecoin-today,1734437734,Ripple Rolls Out Long-Awaited RLUSD Stablecoin Today,"Enterprise-focused blockchain Ripple will begin rolling out its long-awaited US Dollar stablecoin on Tuesday, December 17, after receiving approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) last week. The stablecoin will be available to users on the XRP ledger and the Ethereum network. Ripple Announces Launch Of RLUSD Stablecoin The RLUSD stablecoin is Ripple’s attempt to become the go-to network for international payments. It will be available on select crypto exchanges and platforms, including MoonPay, Uphold, Archax, and CoinMENA. Additional listings are planned on Bitso, Bullish, Bitstamp, Mercado Bitcoin, and others. Speaking about the launch, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins, Jack McDonald, said in a recent interview, “Utility is at the forefront, and doing that in a regulated and compliant way is what we’re all about.” According to McDonald, the RLUSD will appeal to those interested in digital assets but averse to the volatility associated with most cryptocurrencies. “Stablecoins are a bit of a hybrid situation, where it walks and talks a lot like a U.S. dollar, but by its nature, is nowhere near as volatile as cryptocurrencies are.” The launch comes after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the RLUSD had secured final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, clearing the way for rolling out the stablecoin for the general public after concluding its testing phase. The RLUSD is fully backed by US Dollar deposits, US government bonds, and cash equivalents, which will help keep its price at $1. The Growing Stablecoin Ecosystem Stablecoins have cemented themselves as one of the most popular types of cryptocurrency and have achieved a market cap of over $200 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. They are popular in countries grappling with high inflation. The stablecoin market is dominated by two major players: Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Ripple hopes RLUSD will help it compete with both, given stablecoins are quickly becoming a key piece of infrastructure, helping bridge traditional finance and digital markets, acting as liquidity for trading, a medium for blockchain-based transactions, and cross-border payments. Several traditional finance companies, including PayPal, Visa, and Societe Generale, have also entered the stablecoin space as regulators around the world draft guidelines for the asset class. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement, “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide. As the U.S. moves toward clearer regulations, we expect to see greater adoption of stablecoins like RLUSD, which offer real utility and are backed by years of trust and expertise in the industry.” The RLUSD stablecoin will initially be available in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, UK, and the Middle East. Volatility Warning As a stablecoin, the RLUSD aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the dollar. David Schwartz, Ripple's Chief Technology Officer said it may see unusual volatility due to early demand and limited initial supply. He also added some traders were willing to pay as much as $1200 to purchase a fraction of the stablecoin. “There may be supply shortages in the very early days before the market stabilizes. Please don't FOMO into a stablecoin. This is not an opportunity to get rich.” Additions To Advisory Board Ripple also announced two new additions to its advisory board: Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Kenneth Montgomery, the former first vice president and COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Rajan and Montgomery join board members, including Sheila Bair, former chair of the FDIC, and Chris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple.

These bonds are set to mature on 16 June 2025, giving the company a defined timeline to execute its Bitcoin purchase strategy while reducing short-term financial pressures. This zero-interest approach allows Metaplanet to optimise its borrowing capacity without incurring additional costs. By lowering its immediate debt burden, the company is focusing on long-term growth opportunities tied to Bitcoin’s potential appreciation . Structured repayment strategy using warrants To ensure financial stability, Metaplanet plans to repay the bonds using funds raised from previously issued warrants. This structured approach highlights the company’s focus on sustainable capital management while offering confidence to its investors. By recycling capital from warrant exercises, Metaplanet balances financial innovation with responsibility. This method not only reduces risks for bondholders but also reflects the company’s commitment to maintaining a clear financial roadmap. This issuance follows an earlier move in which Metaplanet raised 1.75 billion yen ($11.3 million) through one-year ordinary bonds at an annual interest rate of 0.36%. The entire amount was allocated to acquiring Bitcoin, demonstrating the company’s clear commitment to building its BTC reserves. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin buying journey began in April 2024 as part of a broader strategy to hedge against economic uncertainty. So far, the company has accumulated 1,142 BTC, valued at approximately $122.67 million at current market prices. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin hedge Japan’s growing debt levels and the yen’s volatility have driven Metaplanet’s decision to integrate Bitcoin as a reserve asset. By using Bitcoin as a hedge, the company is mitigating risks associated with traditional financial markets and the weakening yen. Metaplanet’s ongoing investments align with the global trend of institutions adopting Bitcoin as a store of value. The move comes at a time when Bitcoin’s market dominance and institutional adoption are on the rise, further solidifying its position in corporate treasuries. Aligning with global Bitcoin strategies Metaplanet’s approach closely resembles MicroStrategy’s strategy of accumulating Bitcoin through debt instruments. MicroStrategy has emerged as a global leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption, holding over 214,000 BTC to date. By issuing bonds to fund Bitcoin purchases, Metaplanet is positioning itself as Japan’s leading corporate adopter of the cryptocurrency. This strategy could attract investor interest, particularly as Bitcoin continues to gain recognition as a viable hedge against inflation and fiat currency risks. With the zero-interest bonds maturing in 2025, Metaplanet has a clear window to strengthen its BTC reserves while minimising short-term financial obligations. As the company aligns with global trends, its Bitcoin-focused strategy positions it as a notable player in Japan’s corporate landscape.

37756074,https://finbold.com/?p=220114,1734437478,AI predicts Aave (AAVE) price for year-end,"Aave ( AAVE ), the leading decentralized lending protocol, has surged to its highest levels since 2021, reaching a peak of $397 on December 16. Despite a slight pullback to $373 at the press time, the token has rallied an impressive 119% in the past month, pushing its market capitalization to $5.6 billion. With strong tailwinds fueling its growth and challenges beginning to surface, investors are left questioning whether Aave can sustain its momentum and where the token will land as the year draws to a close. AAVE one-month price chart. Source: Finbold What’s driving Aave’s rally Aave’s latest rally is closely tied to the broader cryptocurrency market rebound, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) surging past the $100,000 mark. As investors look for opportunities in decentralized finance ( DeFi ), Aave has emerged as a top choice, outperforming many altcoins with its recent gains. The data from IntoTheBlock supports Aave’s growing dominance in the DeFi lending sector, where it currently holds a commanding 45% market share. This dominance is further emphasized by Aave’s staggering total value locked (TVL), which stands at $23.209 billion, according to DeFiLlama , almost equal to the combined TVL of all major lending protocols. TVL of top 11 lending protocols. Source: DefiLlama Strategic partnerships drive growth Beyond favorable macroeconomic conditions, Aave’s recent partnerships and protocol developments have played a key role in its price surge. The protocol’s planned integration with Linea, a zk-rollup network backed by Consensys, promises improved scalability and lower transaction fees—two crucial factors for attracting new users to DeFi. Adding to the momentum, Aave’s collaboration with Balancer v3 has bolstered liquidity, reinforcing its role as a key pillar of decentralized finance. Meanwhile, the partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLFI) marks another milestone, with Aave v3 now deployed on Ethereum ( ETH ) to enable borrowing and lending for ETH, Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ), and major stablecoins like USDC and USDT . On-chain data further supports AAVE’s bullish momentum. According to Santiment , the decline in Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA), an indicator measuring the average age of held tokens, signals that dormant AAVE tokens are re-entering circulation, boosting trading volumes and market activity. Concerns over the Polygon network weigh on Aave Despite its strong performance, Aave faces challenges tied to its exposure to the Polygon (previously MATIC ) PoS chain. Marc Zeller, founder of Aave Chan, has proposed adjustments to mitigate risks linked to bridged assets, citing security concerns reminiscent of past bridge exploits like the Ronin and Harmony hacks. The proposal suggests setting loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to 0% and increasing the reserve factor to 85%, effectively discouraging further deposits or preventing users from borrowing against their collateral. AI prediction: AAVE price to target $400 to $450 by year-end To gauge AAVE’s future potential, Finbold analyzed market data and consulted ChatGPT-4o, which projects the token to close 2024 trading between $400 and $450, depending on market conditions and investor sentiment. Aave’s growing dominance in the DeFi lending sector, supported by strong on-chain activity, a rising total value-locked, and growing partnerships, highlights its solid foundation for further growth.

That said, Aave’s market leadership and expansion efforts signal a steady upward trajectory. Its ability to weather headwinds and capitalize on the broader market recovery will determine whether it can hit the upper end of its projected range.

37756021,https://crypto.news/?p=14319972,1734437392,Crypto can boost economic welfare in underbanked regions | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. The world’s economy is rapidly evolving, yet financial exclusion remains a persistent issue. A 2022 report by Visa revealed that 2.1 billion people globally remain unserved or underserved by digital financial services. This gap often traps individuals and businesses in underbanked regions in a cycle of limited growth and opportunity. You might also like: Launchpads are the key to decoding crypto’s investment complexity | Opinion The good news? Emerging technologies, especially cryptocurrencies, present an opportunity to rewrite this narrative. Merchant adoption of crypto payments has the potential to significantly uplift the welfare of these underbanked economies. Inflation is crippling cash It is getting harder and harder to rely on cash in economies with significant inflation and price instability. Local currencies have depreciated so much in nations like Argentina, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe that regular cash transactions are fraught with inefficiencies. Stablecoins that are linked to fiat currencies, such as Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ), or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ), can save the day. In enabling safer, peer-to-peer transactions without relying on erratic local currencies, crypto can help businesses protect their revenue value. Crypto payments are less susceptible to the inflation rates that cause cash to depreciate. This is invaluable to regions in which central banks struggle to preserve economic stability. The shift is already evident. According to a 2022 Deloitte survey , 93% of merchants accepting crypto reported positive impacts on customer engagement and satisfaction metrics. As more merchants recognize that crypto allows them to offer more efficient transactions, consumer trust is enhanced. In the long term, this galvanizes more sustainable economic activity. Crypto payments: An interconnected future for merchants and cross-border transactions Rising rates of crypto adoption among merchants are also bolstering cross-border growth. Crypto’s ability to provide reduced rates and faster settlement times is starting to make traditional SWIFT-based banking systems appear all the more archaic. Smaller businesses, in particular, can trade more effectively with the help of cryptocurrency payments, swerving excessive fees and reducing the risk of volatile exchange rates. Additionally, decentralized currencies can guarantee transparent financial transactions and minimize corruption, which is essential for economic stability in lower-income areas. The resulting shift toward crypto ultimately leads to the expansion of local commerce, which has an inevitable, favorable impact on the wider economy. Micropayments: A game-changer for financial inclusion The willingness to accept crypto also opens up a largely untapped opportunity to promote financial inclusion. In underbanked regions, where daily income might be as low as a few dollars, traditional banking fees render small transactions impractical. Cryptocurrencies, however, enable frictionless micropayments with minimal fees, unlocking a new frontier for commerce. If farmers, for example, can sell produce in small increments without losing significant revenue to transaction costs, profit margins increase and consequently create strong financial activity in local economies. Similarly, crypto gives service providers, like ride-share drivers or local artisans, the opportunity to receive smaller payments instantly and directly, bypassing middlemen. This embeds a sense of fluidity into the fabric of day-to-day transactions. As crypto is more widely adopted, it will also become more feasible for things such as pay-as-you-go household utilities to be dealt with in micropayments. This can eradicate the need to pay large, up-front, unaffordable costs in communities that struggle to stay above the breadline. In this sense, crypto-powered micropayments have the potential to change lives. Businesses in emerging and developing markets serve an underbanked yet youthful and tech-savvy population, creating a unique opportunity for innovative payment solutions. While mobile money has played a transformative role in bridging the financial gap for the unbanked, cryptocurrencies present an even more powerful and convenient alternative. By offering greater accessibility, lower transaction costs, and borderless capabilities, cryptocurrencies empower businesses to serve this demographic with seamless, reliable, and inclusive financial services. For these markets, crypto adoption could redefine financial ecosystems and accelerate economic participation. Key considerations for payment solution providers While the promise of crypto is undeniable, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s crucial that payment providers address several key factors when developing systems tailored to underbanked regions. For a start, solutions must be designed with inclusivity in mind. Many underbanked individuals lack access to sophisticated technology, so systems should work seamlessly on basic smartphones or even feature phones. User interfaces must be intuitive to encourage widespread adoption. Tied to this is the need to facilitate adequate awareness with educational resources. Crypto can seem intimidating to first-time users. Payment providers should invest in educating both merchants and customers on how crypto works, how to leverage its benefits, and how to navigate risks truly. Financial literacy campaigns will play a critical role in building trust and widespread adoption from both merchants and consumers. Regulatory compliance is also a challenge that needs careful navigation. Operating in underbanked regions can be a complex process in this regard. Providers must work closely with governments to ensure compliance while advocating for clear, supportive policies that enable innovation. Above all, security is paramount. Providers must implement robust fraud prevention measures. Hacks and the fear they perpetuate among new users are often a primary cause for slow adoption and severely undermine any progression of trust. Final thoughts The integration of cryptocurrencies into merchant ecosystems in underbanked regions is more than just a technological shift—it’s an opportunity to drive economic welfare and foster inclusion. Cryptocurrency payments have the potential to be a potent equalizer in the global economy by resolving the shortcomings of conventional payment systems, enabling companies to conduct business internationally, and helping people avoid the traps of cash dependence. However, cooperation between local communities, governments, and payment solution providers is essential to success. The adoption of cryptocurrency payments has the potential to become a major component of financial inclusion for billions of people globally, surpassing the status of a specialized trend with the correct tactics.

37755931,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374996,1734437298,Shiba Inu-Related Project Introduces a Special Airdrop: Details,"TL;DR Shifu, a new meme coin in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has a total supply of 100 billion tokens, with 30% allocated for a community airdrop. Despite the effort, SHIB’s valuation remains stable at $0.00002733. However, a 240% surge in large transaction volume and Shibarium’s rapid progress could boost the asset’s utility and drive future price increases. The Terms and Conditions Shifu – a new meme coin project introduced by the Shiba Inu ecosystem – launched an airdrop exclusively for the SHIB community. The total supply of SHIFU is 100,000,000,000 coins. The project revealed that 30% of that amount will be allocated for the community airdrop, with 50% unlocked during the Token Generation Event (TGE) and the rest released in the next four weeks. The team will require a snapshot from eligible users, but the final deadline has not yet been announced . It is important to note that 22,000,000,000 SHIFU tokens will be distributed to some of those holding at least 100,000 SHIB and 100 BUBBLE. 2,000,000,000 SHIFU will be allocated to eligible LEASH holders, while lucky BONE owners will receive 1,000,000,000 SHIFU. The remaining 4,000,000,000 tokens are meant to reach the BUBBLE community. The team added that 70% of the total supply (70 billion SHIFU) will be distributed for other purposes. 40 billion tokens will go to the “liquidity and public pre-sale” section, 20 billion will reach treasury, whereas 10 billion will fund marketing initiatives. SHIFU is a dog-themed meme coin that has yet to go live. Earlier this month, the popular X user Lark Davis described it as “the master of all,” highlighting its legitimacy due to its connection with Shiba Inu’s developers. SHIB Price Outlook The announced airdrop seems to have caused little-to-no price volatility for the second-largest meme coin. SHIB is up a mere 1.5% in the last 24 hours, currently trading at around $0.00002733. Its market capitalization remains hovering at approximately $16 billion, making the asset the 15th-biggest in the entire crypto sector. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko On the other hand, some important metrics suggest that Shiba Inu may experience a much more substantial increase in the near future . One of those is the large transaction volume (where each SHIB transaction is greater than $100,000). According to IntoTheBlock, the figure has soared by 240% on a daily scale , reaching $175 million. Such a spike might be interpreted positively by traders, driving further demand for SHIB and pushing the price upward. Shibarium’s progress is also worth mentioning. The layer-2 scaling solution has been processing millions of transactions in the past several days, blasting through numerous milestones. Shibarium’s advancement can have a notable impact on SHIB’s valuation due to its role in improving the utility, adoption, and efficiency of the entire ecosystem.

ESMA published its final report on reverse solicitation, systems, what crypto may constitute as a financial instrument and draft technical standards on market abuse prevention.  The European Union's Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) rules - bespoke rules for the crypto sector - are meant to come into force by December 30 across the bloc of 27 nations. But some countries are yet to put in place legislation to implement MiCA.  Portugal's central bank even told CoinDesk on Monday that it is yet to figure out which national competent authority will be responsible for the rules since legislation has not passed.  A part of what caused delays for national competent authorities was the short period between ESMA releasing its final technical standards in October and the implementation date, industry trade associations told CoinDesk.

37756082,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628845,1734436837,What is ISO 20022 compliance for crypto coins? – Is it a ‘must have’ for crypto adoption?,"ISO 20022 compliance is widely known as the revolutionary global financial messaging standard for digital currencies. A global standard means that crypto will be recognized everywhere, but is this move a necessary step for crypto adoption? Or does it undermine the very principles on which cryptocurrencies were built? Cryptocurrencies have long existed outside the mainstream financial system, with their decentralized, peer-to-peer models offering a stark contrast to the traditional, centralized banking system. However, as these assets evolve, there’s a growing interest in integrating them into global financial infrastructures. Financial authorities seem to agree that the best way for traditional financial institutions to find it easy to adopt cryptos is to employ a regulatory standard, which led to the ISO 20022. The basics of ISO 20022 ISO 20022 is a financial messaging standard designed to provide a secure and standardized way for organizations to exchange financial information. It was introduced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to replace the outdated SWIFT system used by banks and financial institutions for global payments. While the standard was initially developed for traditional finance, its potential to serve the evolving digital currency market is now being explored . A key issue that ISO 20022 seeks to address is the lack of Digital Token Identifiers (DTIs), which are crucial for distinguishing between different digital currencies. Unlike fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar or the euro, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash lack universally recognized identifiers, making them difficult for banks to track and process. For example, while a bank’s system can easily identify transactions involving USD or AUD, it struggles to differentiate between transactions involving Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. ISO 20022 proposes a solution by introducing a standardized language for digital currencies. This will make it easier for financial institutions to facilitate cross-border payments involving cryptocurrencies. This global standard promises to improve efficiency and reduce errors while ensuring better regulatory compliance, transparency, and fraud protection. Cryptocurrencies adopting ISO 20022 As reported by Cryptopolitan, cryptocurrencies that have embraced the standard include XRP, Stellar, Quant, Hedera, IOTA, XDC, Cardano, and Algorand. These tokens now benefit from a higher degree of interoperability with traditional financial institutions. According to economists, the inclusion of these tokens in the ISO 20022 compliant list positions them as legitimate players in the global financial system, able to communicate seamlessly with banks and other financial organizations. For financial institutions, ISO 20022 compliance means more than just a technical upgrade. It enables seamless communication and ensures compliance with tightening global regulations. As most financial authorities are increasingly cracking down on the cryptocurrency industry, the ability to meet regulatory standards and provide detailed reporting is an imperative selling point. Cryptocurrencies that are ISO 20022 compliant have an edge in this regard, as the protocol’s rich data capabilities help institutions better track and report transactions. Feasibility of applying ISO 20022 to tokens The adoption of ISO 20022 by cryptocurrencies isn’t as straightforward as some may believe. While companies can adhere to the ISO 20022 standard, it doesn’t mean that the blockchain or the token itself is inherently compliant. This distinction is important because, at the protocol level, many cryptocurrencies still operate outside the scope of ISO 20022. The system doesn’t automatically recognize digital tokens as compliant, so companies and projects must voluntarily integrate these standards into their systems. ISO 20022’s role is primarily in the messaging layer rather than in altering digital currencies’ fundamental blockchain structure. This means that while ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrencies can communicate more seamlessly with traditional financial networks, their underlying decentralized nature remains unchanged. ISO 20022 is an international standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions and XRP is a digital asset that aligns with these standards. ISO 20022 is a messaging standard that enables interoperability and data exchange in banking systems* #ISO20022 #XRP pic.twitter.com/kZ3JoJXvio — NICEToken (@NICEToken12345) December 17, 2024 The reality is that many tokens still lack the infrastructure required to fully support ISO 20022. For developers, complying with the protocol is a complex process. The importance of ISO 20022 for crypto adoption ISO 20022 compliance could play a crucial role in advancing crypto adoption, but it’s not a panacea. The integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial networks offers benefits that can’t be ignored. So if you don’t know about #ISO20022 recommend DYOR time is ticking and eventually very soon the average person will not be able to afford them I’m just a messenger carry on about the drones but don’t say I ain’t warn you $XRP $XLM $XDC $ALGO $IOTA $HBAR pic.twitter.com/cTQQB4lg5X — Trump’sBlackNephew🐸 (@45sBullishAnon) December 16, 2024 Chief among the perks is the legitimacy ISO 20022 brings to the tokens that adopt it. When cryptocurrencies adhere to a globally recognized standard, they’re no longer seen as fringe or rogue entities but as legitimate assets capable of participating in the global financial system. This sense of legitimacy could go a long way in reducing the skepticism surrounding cryptocurrencies, especially among institutional investors. The transition from a decentralized, unregulated space to one that operates within recognized financial frameworks has the potential to foster trust ; a key barrier to widespread adoption. “ We need to take the standards we have today and update them to ensure interoperability across countries’ recognized digital currency systems. This will be the first step towards universal acceptance. Trust is paramount: without that, all the technology in the world is not going to provide the answer ,” said retired Chairman of the Central Intelligence Agency Cryptographic Center Edward Scheidt. Yet, the very concept of ISO 20022 raises fundamental questions about the essence of cryptocurrency. Many early crypto adopters sought to create a system that operated outside of traditional financial institutions. The desire for decentralization and self-governance was central to the creation of Bitcoin and similar projects. To some crypto enthusiasts, the adoption of a globally recognized standard like ISO 20022 may seem like a step backward. It may undermine the decentralized ethos that cryptocurrencies were designed to uphold. Will ISO 20022 affect the price of compliant coins? Another important question surrounding ISO 20022 compliance is whether it will have a measurable impact on the price of compliant cryptocurrencies. The answer is far from straightforward, but the evidence suggests that it could influence the value of these coins, particularly in terms of mainstream acceptance. As cryptocurrencies become more integrated into the global financial system, the perceived stability and security of compliant tokens may make them more attractive to institutional investors. ISO 20022 compliance is expected to reduce the risks associated with digital assets, making them more appealing to larger financial players. This could, in turn, drive up demand for compliant tokens, potentially boosting their value. However, it’s worth noting that the broader cryptocurrency market operates on sentiment, and various factors contribute to price fluctuations. While compliance with ISO 20022 may enhance the credibility of certain cryptocurrencies, it’s unlikely to be a “big” factor in driving their price movements. The current ISO 20022 compliant coins’ prices were not significantly affected when they were first listed, so it could be reaching for the stars to think it will affect their values in the long term. ISO 20022: Crypto’s adoption and the future of decentralization ISO 20022 compliance offers a promising pathway for cryptocurrencies seeking integration into the global financial system. The standard’s potential to bring legitimacy, regulatory compliance, and enhanced transparency to the crypto market cannot be denied. However, the adoption of this protocol raises important questions about the future of decentralized finance. For now, it remains clear that ISO 20022 compliance isn’t an all-or-nothing proposition. While it offers tangible benefits to the cryptocurrencies that adopt it, it also serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between crypto’s founding principles and its integration into the global financial system. The journey toward broader adoption will require both financial regulators and crypto developers to carefully consider the benefits and the philosophical forces at play.

Following a significant yearly peak of $0.47 last month, the cryptocurrency is currently trading in the $0.40 range. Related Reading: The $589 XRP Dream: Believers Aren’t ‘Delusional’ Enough, Expert Says This forecast is being issued at this time. Significant whale activity and bullish market sentiment have contributed to the enthusiasm surrounding Dogecoin, particularly in the wake of recent political events, such as Donald Trump’s re-election. Dogecoin: Present Market Conditions There are numerous factors that have contributed to the recent increase in the price of Dogecoin. The investment from large holders, or “whales,” has been substantial, with an estimated $160 million worth of DOGE purchased in the past 24 hours. This is particularly noteworthy. This accumulation indicates a high level of confidence in the asset’s future performance. Whales bought another 160 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/FLr6XL3rMi — Ali (@ali_charts) December 13, 2024 The rush to buy along with the ongoing excitement surrounding Dogecoin has been seen by experts as a possible cause for new highs as 2024 comes to a close. Even though there was a 4.30% drop in the last month, a lot of experts believe that this phase of stability will end with a big break. The way prices are moving now is a lot like how they were moving in 2021, when Dogecoin prices went through similar events that made them stable. Bullish Outlook Backed By Technical Indicators Based on Fibonacci retracement, Dogecoin could climb 85% from its current price level by January 2025. If this comes to fruition, this rally would lift the price of the memecoin to around $0.75, putting it within the coveted $1 mark. The RSI has recently entered overbought territory. This condition frequently precedes substantial price fluctuations, whether upward or downward; nevertheless, historical evidence indicates that such signals have resulted in favorable trends for the memecoin. Additionally, analysts have underscored the significance of critical resistance levels at $0.50 and its previous all-time high of $0.7376. If DOGE is able to surmount these levels, it may facilitate the attainment of the anticipated target of $0.75. Related Reading: 3-Year Peak: Chainlink Rally Fueled By Historic Open Interest Levels Looking Ahead Numerous members of the cryptocurrency community are anticipating the performance of Dogecoin as 2025 approaches.

Bitcoin touched an all-time high just below $108,000 yesterday and is now holding steady around $107,000.  Bitcoin maxis have been in Christmas spirits ever since the U.S. elections in early November, with President-elect Donald Trump's bullish overtures to the industry a sign of the growing institutional alignment with the digital asset market.  The president-elect seems to be teasing ""more surprises,"" fueling speculation of more favorable crypto policies after he pledged to create a strategic BTC reserve. The pledge earlier this month helped fuel bitcoin’s rally.  The incoming administration’s pro-crypto rhetoric has supercharged sentiment, with some analysts drawing comparisons with MicroStrategy’s balance sheet playbook, but on a national scale. While the idea of the U.S. stockpiling bitcoin feels audacious, the markets seem to like the fearlessness.  While plans for a “national bitcoin reserve” remain speculative, Trump’s crypto-friendly stance is already influencing sentiment and markets. Exodus Movement (EXOD), a crypto wallet provider, just secured approval to list on NYSE American, the New York Stock Exchange’s sibling market. While a single listing isn’t seismic, it’s yet another data point suggesting U.S. markets are ready to welcome digital asset companies back into the fold.  The season of giving is seen elsewhere in crypto too, with the highly anticipated introduction of PENGU, the official token of the Pudgy Penguin ecosystem. Luca Netz, Pudgy Penguins' CEO, said the token’s release “opens the door for deeper engagement” while rewarding long-time believers in the ecosystem.  The PENGU airdrop follows the high-profile airdrops of Hyperliquid and Magic Eden in recent weeks, with the former’s price action serving as a note of caution for potential early sellers of the token.  Avalanche released its biggest network upgrade, Avalanche9000, introducing improvements that make it cheaper and easier to launch subnets. “This is the start of hundreds of Avalanche L1s launching,” the team wrote on X. “Avalanche9000 reduces the cost to deploy an L1 by 99.9%, and with hundreds of L1s being developed on testnet, look out for an explosion of launches in the coming months.” The blockchain's AVAX token is trading at $50.2, up 2.49% from last night’s close.  The latest leg up for BTC, however, faces a near-term headwind in the form of the Federal Reserve’s rate decision on Wednesday. Moreover, with this cycle marked by growing institutional participation, the markets might be in for further volatility as the holiday season approaches. TradFi participants often adopt a risk-off stance and close positions ahead of the break. Stay Alert!

Memecoins And Market Sentiment,"Summary Solana USD's recent rally, driven by memecoins, may be overvalued due to speculative trading and psychological factors like FOMO and recency bias. Memecoins have increased Solana's transaction volume and liquidity, but this activity is unsustainable and could lead to market corrections. Solana's valuation metrics suggest it trades at a premium, with much recent activity tied to speculative memecoin trading rather than long-term use cases. Investors should approach Solana with caution, considering gradual dollar-cost averaging out as the memecoin hype fades to mitigate potential risks. This article was co-produced with NoticeTrades (Nick Thomas). As many of my readers know, my son and I recently co-produced an article titled, “Bitcoin Hits $100,000: What Intelligent Investors Do?” It just so happened that this article received over 350 comments, validating the interest in bitcoin. Furthermore, many of you know me on Seeking Alpha for my experience as a dividend investor, much like my son (Nick Thomas) who has a circle of competence in crypto technology. So, without further ado, let's take a closer look at Solana USD ( SOL-USD ), a cryptocurrency named after a small southern California coastal city. SOL launched in 2017 and has become a popular crypto with a market cap of over $103 Billion (263% YOY return). Is Solana “Overvalued”? A Look at Memecoins and Market Psychology Solana the past few months has been making headlines for its major price recovery and network activity, driven in part by the rise of memecoins. While this surge has revitalized interest in Solana, there’s a debate about whether the recent rally has pushed its valuation beyond its intrinsic value. I want to discuss why some argue that Solana might currently be overvalued, with a particular focus on the role of memecoins and the psychological factors influencing the market. The Role of Memecoins in Solana’s Recent Rally Memecoins, such as Bonk ( BONK-USD ), have contributed significantly to Solana’s rise in price. These coins bring short-term excitement and speculative activity, but they lack utility or a sustainable value proposition. Here are some key factors that are currently in play: Transaction Volume Spike : Memecoins generate high transaction volumes, increasing Solana’s network activity. This creates the perception of a thriving ecosystem, which can attract investors. Speculative FOMO : Retail traders looking for quick profits often flock to ecosystems with trending memecoins, driving up demand for the underlying blockchain’s native token. Short-Term Liquidity Inflows : The hype around memecoins can temporarily boost liquidity and market capitalization, but this surge is usually unsustainable, leading to eventual corrections. SOL Chart Reasons Why Solana May Be Overvalued 1. Unsustainable Activity Driven by Hype While the volume on Solana has increased, much of it is tied to speculative trading of memecoins rather than long-term use cases like DeFi, and enterprise adoption. Once the hype subsides, network activity could decline, exposing gaps between Solana’s valuation and its real utility. Defillama (Volume vs Transaction) 2. Over-Reliance on Retail Investors The recent rally has been fueled largely by retail traders, who are typically driven by emotional decision-making rather than fundamental analysis. This reliance on retail-driven speculation creates a fragile market structure, vulnerable to sharp corrections when sentiment shifts. 3. Perceived “Community Revival” May Be Overblown After the FTX collapse, Solana’s reputation and ecosystem faced significant challenges. The memecoin rally has helped to revive community interest, but it may overshadow deeper concerns, such as the concentration of developer activity or competition from other Layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Avax ( AVAX-USD ). The narrative of a “revival” might be overstated in terms of long-term growth. 4. Valuation Metrics Key valuation metrics, such as price-to-transaction ratios or TVL (Total Value Locked) compared to market cap, might suggest that Solana is trading at a premium. If the majority of recent activity is tied to memecoins, these metrics could be artificially inflated, giving the appearance of a more robust ecosystem than what fundamentally exists. DefiLlama (Price-Transaction Ratio) Psychological Factors Driving Overvaluation Stock Images 1. The Bandwagon Effect When traders see Solana’s price rallying, many jump on the bandwagon, fearing they’ll miss out on gains. This herd mentality amplifies price movements, often pushing assets beyond their fair value. 2. Recency Bias The market tends to focus on recent events, such as the success of BONK or other memecoins, rather than Solana’s broader ecosystem struggles. This short-term focus skews investor perceptions, making the network appear more valuable than it may be over the long run. 3. Overconfidence and Euphoria As prices rise, traders often become overly optimistic, believing the trend will continue indefinitely. This euphoria can inflate valuations as buyers ignore risks or fail to consider potential downside scenarios. 4. Narrative Investing The story of Solana’s “comeback” after the FTX collapse has captivated the market, grabbing attention from traders who are naturally drawn to a good redemption arc. Narratives like this often influence investment decisions far more than fundamentals, especially in a space like crypto where hype can dominate. But the reality is that these stories are fragile and can shift quickly, leaving investors exposed if the underlying fundamentals don’t support the momentum. Balancing the Argument It’s important to note that Solana does have legitimate long-term use cases. Its high throughput, low transaction costs, and vibrant developer community make it a strong competitor in the blockchain space. However, the current valuation may be pricing in future success prematurely, especially if much of the activity is tied to speculative memecoin trading, which is a loser's game, just like the casino. Deposit Photos Conclusion While Solana’s recent rally has been impressive, it’s crucial to approach the current market dynamics with caution. Memecoins have played a significant role in driving speculative activity, but their long-term impact on Solana’s ecosystem remains uncertain. Coupled with psychological factors like FOMO, recency bias, and overconfidence, there’s a valid argument that Solana could be overvalued in the short to midterm. With that in mind, gradually dollar-cost averaging (“DCA”) out as the memecoin craze begins to slow might not be a bad strategy. If we start to see a broader market correction, based on the data presented, SOL-USD could be among the assets most impacted. This isn’t meant to scare investors, but rather to provide a balanced perspective. By looking at the other side of the coin, it’s easier to identify the potential risks at current prices using the data discussed above. As always, investors and traders should focus on the fundamentals and be wary of hype-driven markets. The long-term success of Solana USD will depend on its ability to sustain meaningful use cases and grow its ecosystem beyond the temporary excitement of memecoins. Resources Baker, M., & Wurgler, J.

As Gary Gensler nears resignation, his tough enforcement stance on crypto companies continues. Unicoin fights SEC’s claims and defends its token amid an investigation and planned ICO block. Crypto investment firm Unicoin received a Wells Notice from the SEC. This signals possible legal action over claims of fraud, deceptive practices, and the sale of unregistered securities. The SEC’s Wells Notice is an official warning that it may sue Unicoin. Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin said the company has been under scrutiny from the SEC’s crypto legal division, which issued an order in May.

37755548,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320141,1734436295,This Little-Known DOJ Rule Often Leaves Crypto Fraud Victims Empty-Handed: Bloomberg Law,"An obscure Department of Justice (DOJ) regulation is nullifying efforts by cryptocurrency fraud victims to recover their stolen funds. Regulation 28 CFR 9.8(c) allows the government to prioritize its claim on forfeited assets over victim restitution, often leaving defrauded investors with little or nothing, according to a recent report from Bloomberg Law . The regulation, which took effect in 1997, contradicts the spirit of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) of 1996, which primarily aims to ensure victims of federal crimes are “made whole” by fully compensating them for their losses. Regulation 28 CFR 9.8(c) Limits Value of Lost Funds Under 28 CFR 9.8(c), the amount that can be restored to victims from forfeited funds is limited to the value of the property on the date of loss, ignoring any appreciation that may have occurred since the crime. This distinction is especially significant in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, where values can skyrocket in a short period. For example, the value of Bitcoin surged more than 1,200% in the past five years, and Ethereum’s value soared over 2,400%. Given this market dynamism, the difference between the value of stolen crypto at the time of theft and its value at sentencing can be staggering. Victims who lose 10 Bitcoin in a theft could see its value double or triple by the time of sentencing, but under current DOJ rules, they would only be compensated for the value at the time of theft. The 28 CFR 9.8(c) regulation remains despite the vast impact of crypto fraud. The FBI’s 2023 cryptocurrency fraud report revealed over 69,000 complaints, with total losses exceeding $5.6 billion. Seniors over the age of 60 were disproportionately affected. Yet, even when fraudsters are caught and their crypto assets seized, the government’s claim on these funds takes precedence over victim restitution. The report noted that federal forfeiture and victim restitution serve distinct purposes. Forfeiture is intended to punish criminals by seizing the proceeds of their crimes, while restitution aims to compensate victims for their financial losses. To bridge this gap, the DOJ’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section can use a process called “restoration” to return forfeited assets to victims. However, the 28 CFR 9.8(c) regulation restricts the amount that can be restored to the value at the time of loss, ignoring any appreciation in the stolen property’s value. FTX Creditors Miss Out on Bitcoin Rally Last month, a Delaware judge approved FTX’s reorganization plan , which involves paying out more than $14 billion to customers of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange.

37756069,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52396,1734436116,Messari Co-founder Tags XRP and Cardano Armies As “Bot Groups”,"Ryan Selkis, co-founder of the crypto research firm Messari, has once again launched harsh criticisms against the XRP and Cardano communities, tagging them as “bot groups on X” with little to offer in real-world usage or products. In a post on Saturday, December 14, Selkis targeted the two prominent Layer 1 blockchain ecosystems, dismissing their relevance and implying that they lack substantial users. This criticism comes amid longstanding tensions between Selkis and supporters of XRP Ledger and Cardano, which are often the subject of debate in the broader crypto community despite being among the most established Layer 1 networks. Ripple, XRP, and Controversy The latest remarks follow backlash that Selkis received earlier on the same day for comments directed at Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty and the broader XRP community. Responding to a post featuring Alderoty with former Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Selkis sought to challenge any suggestion of Ripple’s strong connections with Donald Trump’s political network. In his post, Selkis described XRP as “a piece of shit” and referred to Ripple as “the drowning victim of crypto,” further stoking tensions with the blockchain’s supporters. Selkis’ attacks against XRP are not new. Over the years, he has criticized the network, labeling it a centralized blockchain. He argues that XRP primarily benefits Ripple insiders and has stated that Ripple’s association with political figures, particularly from the Trump administration, poses risks to the broader crypto industry. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cardano Excluded from Messari’s Report Cardano, another target of Selkis’ criticism, has faced similar dismissive comments from the Messari co-founder. The rift between Selkis and the Cardano community intensified in recent months after the network was excluded from Messari’s widely circulated Crypto Theses 2024 report. This 200-page document, which highlights trends and projects of economic significance, omitted Cardano because it did not meet Messari’s benchmark for economic activity. The decision drew strong reactions from the Cardano community, which pushed back on Selkis’ claims that the network lacked meaningful utility or user engagement. Critics highlighted recent data to counter his arguments. For instance, a community note posted on X emphasized that on December 12, Cardano processed over 280,000 transactions—roughly 20% to 60% of the daily transaction volume of Bitcoin and Ethereum—despite having only a fraction of their market capitalization. Despite Selkis’ repeated criticisms, the XRP Ledger and Cardano remain key players in the Layer 1 blockchain landscape. Supporters of both networks continue to highlight their unique attributes and progress, even as debates around their adoption and value persist. Selkis’ remarks reflect broader disagreements within the crypto space regarding the purpose, utility, and future of various blockchain projects. While the Messari co-founder maintains his stance, recent transaction data and network activity suggest that XRP and Cardano are far from inactive, as their communities challenge detractors.

37755390,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628818,1734435952,ZachXBT explores $5.36M wallet-draining attack,"On-chain researcher ZachXBT has noticed another wallet-draining attack, spanning dozens of addresses. The seemingly random hauls have all been connected to the Last Pass data breach, potentially exposing multiple wallets. ZachXBT reported a total of $5.36M taken from personal wallets containing Bitcoin and assets from the Ethereum ecosystem. All the seemingly random addresses had one thing in common – using Last Pass as their password storage and protection. After a data leak in 2022, the list of wallets turned out to be compromised. ZachXBT also identified the attackers as a cohesive entity, the ‘Last Pass threat actor’. The attackers had a similar approach of draining the wallets, then immediately swapped through instant exchanges for Ethereum and Bitcoin. The attack affected multiple tokens, but the hackers were trying to simplify their holdings. Last Pass victims face another round of wallet attacks Apparently, some of the wallet owners also stored private keys on the service, leaking direct access to the wallets. The actual attack happened long after the data leak, and there may be more wallets that are potentially exposed, but not drained yet. The recent batch of drained wallets includes crypto influencers with ENS names, as well as active DEX and DeFi users. Despite being experienced, the exposed addresses led to total losses. Wallets automated to receive funds or rewards from smart contracts may be especially at risk. In one of the cases, the funds received came from an OpenSea user, potentially from the sale of an NFT. In this case, the receiving wallet may be automated and already linked to the NFT marketplace. The wallet was drained soon after that, with the funds sent directly for an anonymous swap. More than 40 addresses in total were drained to date. In some cases, the addresses show evidence of being watched, as the draining happened right after a recent deposit of funds. Some of the wallets received funds from exchanges for storage or as intermediate holding, and were drained within a short time after the incoming transaction. ZachXBT had already tracked an earlier batch of 22 addresses, with losses exceeding $6.2M even at the earlier stage of the bull market. Other on-chain researchers have also sounded the alarm on potentially exposed wallets. It’s been 2 years since Path sounded the alarm. Since then we’ve investigated thousands of these thefts. Including 2 more in the last few hours. Please migrate your funds to fresh wallets if you’ve used LastPass. Please tell your friends. Please. Begging you. 🙏 https://t.co/5xd5oYxbwb — Tay 💖 (@tayvano_) December 16, 2024 The only solution for users is to abandon all potentially exposed wallets. The risk remains for anyone using Last Pass before the exploit in 2022. All funds must be moved to new addresses, as the old ones are already monitored for incoming transactions. The latest wallet attack follows a previous batch of wallets linked to Last Pass data. In October 2023, a total of 25 wallets were drained of $4.4M worth of digital coins and tokens. As previously reported, some of the wallets had substantial funds and belonged to crypto insiders, even VCs and DeFi developers. The previous hack did not alert all wallet owners exposed to Last Pass. ZachXBT has previously warned about potentially exposed wallets, though the hackers still managed to attack more accounts. Hacks sent straight to exchanges Unlike other hacking attempts, the wallets were drained directly onto exchange accounts. This suggests the hacker had full control and decided to trade the funds as a way of concealing them. In one case, a wallet was drained of 15 ETH, which were sent directly to a swapping address. Another wallet lost 32 ETH, which was sent to the FixedFloat hot wallet. The exchange was used for other wallets as well. The exchange itself is not affected and is completely neutral to the hack. However, the DEX is a regular target for hackers, used to transform funds and cover their tracks. Previously, analysts have tracked funds from an attack against Rocket Pool to the same DEX. FixedFloat offers a simplified swap service with relatively high fees, without requiring an account or KYC. The exchange itself has been a target of hackers, when it was exploited in March for $26M in ETH and BTC.

Zeller’s proposal directly responds to a recent Polygon governance proposal, advising it to direct the stablecoin reserves on its PoS bridge toward an incentivized program to grow its DeFi ecosystem. According to Zeller, if Polygon decides to go ahead with the idea, it could have severe implications for Aave as Polygon would essentially redefine the risk profile of its bridged assets.

This is the second time in recent weeks that the Foundation has made such a move, raising questions about its plans. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has explained why the Foundation continues to sell ETH, but these frequent sales are sparking concerns among market observers. The Latest Sale: Breaking Down the Numbers Data from the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain shows that the Ethereum Foundation sold 100 ETH for around $420,470 on December 17. This sale adds to a long list of sales by the Foundation this year. In total, the Foundation has sold 4,466 ETH, worth approximately $12.62 million. The #Ethereum Foundation sold 100 $ETH ($420.47K) again just now. #Ethereum Foundation has sold a total of 4,466 $ETH ($12.62M) this year. https://t.co/aEdJQoOeuv pic.twitter.com/Cd6LPm1JBu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 17, 2024 Why Are These Sales Happening So Often? What makes this latest sale noteworthy is that it came just a week after the Foundation sold 100 ETH for 374,334 DAI in mid-December. With these frequent transactions, many market watchers are starting to question how these sales might affect ETH’s price. Ethereum Foundation’s Massive Treasury Despite holding a large treasury worth $970.2 million, the Ethereum Foundation continues to sell its ETH. The majority of its holdings are in Ethereum, which increases selling pressure on the token. This has led to growing concerns, especially considering the size of the Foundation’s treasury. Vitalik Explains the Sell-Off Vitalik Buterin has previously explained that the Foundation sells ETH to fund public projects and maintain its reserves. However, the constant selling has led to accusations that Buterin is selling ETH for personal profit. He has strongly denied these claims. Is ETH Going to Crash? Ethereum recently saw a price spike, surpassing $4,010 for the first time since March 2024. Historically, ETH has faced significant drops whenever it reached this level, leaving investors nervous about what might come next. Data shows that exchange reserves have risen by nearly 100,000 ETH, worth around $400 million, signaling potential selling pressure as ETH approaches a six-month high. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing a bearish trend, suggesting that a price drop could be on the horizon. Given the current price movement, ETH could fall by as much as 12%, potentially reaching the $3,500 level. With Ethereum’s sell-off showing no signs of slowing down, the coming weeks could be crucial in determining its next big move .",NEGATIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ethereum-foundation-dump-another-100-eth-for-420k-eth-price-to-drop/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This year has sparked optimism about the future of crypto ETFs, with many expecting that 2025 could bring groundbreaking changes. Several factors suggest that more cryptocurrencies could enter the spot ETF market next year, making it an exciting time for crypto investors and enthusiasts. A Pro-Crypto Shift in US Politics One of the key reasons behind this optimism is the political shift in the US after the recent election. There is now greater support for digital innovations, creating a more favorable environment for cryptocurrency growth. Additionally, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to appoint a pro-crypto executive soon, which could pave the way for even more crypto-friendly regulations. Solana Solana (SOL) is quickly gaining attention, and its future in the ETF market looks promising. The Brazilian government recently approved at least two Solana ETFs , highlighting growing institutional interest. Samara Cohen, the Chief Investment Officer at BlackRock, has also spoken about the potential for an SOL ETF. With a market cap of $106.6 billion, Solana is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, and its remarkable 205.6% growth over the past year shows its increasing influence in the market. Ripple This year, XRP has made several controversial headlines for its legal battle against US regulators . The new government is expected to help the crypto recover from the crisis. Since the US election, the crypto has shown impressive growth. Importantly, WisdomTree , a financial institution, sought approval from the regulator to launch its spot XRP ETF. With a market cap of $151,416,167,935, XRP is the third largest crypto. In the last one year, it has experienced a rise of 325.7%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Metaplanet Raises $30 Million in Zero-Interest Bonds to Buy Bitcoin , Cardano Cardano is popular for its commitment to continuous improvement.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/chill-pepe-chilpepe-solana-memecoin-will-surge-14000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37755077,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628823,1734435030,Ted Cruz pushes for fast-track ban on AI-generated revenge porn in Texas,"With Congress days away from wrapping up its session, Texas Senator Ted Cruz is making a last-minute push to pass a bill that criminalizes AI-generated revenge porn. The proposal, S.4569, takes aim at deepfakes — the increasingly popular tech that superimposes someone’s face onto pornographic images or videos without their consent. If passed, the bill would require websites and social media platforms to remove the content within 48 hours of being notified by a victim. The bill is also bipartisan, co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, and it sailed through the Senate unanimously on December 3. Now, all eyes are on the House, where lawmakers have just a few days left to approve the companion bill, H.R. 8989. At a December 11 press conference, Cruz said: “Every victim should have the right to say, ‘That is me. That is my image, and you don’t have my permission to put this garbage out there.” Victims speak out as tech companies back the bill Elliston Berry, a 15-year-old girl whose AI-altered image spread like wildfire across Snapchat, shared her nightmare at the press event . “That morning I woke up, it was one of the worst feelings I have ever felt,” she said, describing how the fake image circulated for nine months before Cruz’s office intervened to have it removed. Her family’s countless efforts to get platforms to act had failed. Berry’s story isn’t unique, and that’s the problem. Deepfake pornography has exploded, leaving victims scrambling to reclaim their privacy while tech companies play catch-up. For Berry’s mother, reaching Cruz’s office was a turning point. It took direct intervention from a U.S. Senator to get a major social platform to pull the content. For most victims, that kind of access isn’t an option. Tech giants Google, Meta, Microsoft, and TikTok are backing Cruz’s legislation. This might seem surprising, but the reality is they’re under mounting pressure to step up. Critics have long called out platforms for dragging their feet on removing deepfake content. Cruz’s bill forces their hand: 48 hours, no excuses. Senator Klobuchar emphasized the need to act now. “This work is about building a future, about taking on the challenges of the new environment we live in and not just pretending it is not happening anymore.” A problem no one can ignore AI has made deepfake creation disturbingly simple. Tools that once required advanced skills and resources are now available to anyone with a laptop and internet access. It’s no coincidence that 98% of all deepfake content online is pornographic. The numbers are shocking. This year, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) flagged 4,700 cases of AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The technology also feeds the darkest corners of the internet. A recent case in Wisconsin saw a 42-year-old man arrested for creating and distributing thousands of explicit AI images of minors. Another case involved a child psychiatrist sentenced to 40 years for using AI to generate altered images of real children. Deepfake pornography doesn’t stop with minors. Celebrities, influencers, and everyday people are being targeted at alarming rates. Anyone with a public image — or even a social media account — can become a victim. With no federal laws in place, victims have little recourse. AI is only getting smarter. If lawmakers fail to act now, the damage will only deepen. The lawmakers clearly know this. And so do the victims. Now it’s up to Congress to decide whether to fight back or let the deepfake crisis rage on unchecked.

37754771,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374979,1734434939,Bitcoin Still in Bull Phase But Far From Euphoric Peaks: Bitfinex Alpha,"Bitcoin is currently trading above $107,000, but analysts at the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex say the asset is still far from “euphoric peaks.” Historical data cited by the analysts suggest the crypto market is in the middle of the bull phase and could peak in Q3 or Q4 2025, roughly 450 days after the April 2024 halving. In a weekly report detailing expectations for bitcoin’s price in 2025, Bitfinex analysts said it could peak at $339,000 or $145,000 due to diminishing returns moderating the level of gains seen in previous cycles. BTC Still Far From Euphoric Peaks Bitcoin has rallied 573% from its bear market lows of $15,487 in November 2022 and 130% on a year-to-date basis. This bull market has been driven by strong institutional demand , spot accumulation, and consistent purchases by Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Spot ETFs are now considered a dominant force in the Bitcoin market. The products hold more than 1.13 million BTC and have a cumulative inflow of over $50 billion. With institutional investors and the spot Bitcoin ETF market driving demand for BTC, analysts expect corrections in this bull cycle to remain relatively small. Data from previous cycles also show that BTC has recorded minimal corrections after entering price discovery post-halving. In 2017, the maximum decline during such phases was 33.2%, while the 2020 cycle was minimal at 27.1%. “In the current bull cycle, which began in mid to late 2023, Bitcoinʼs corrections have been smaller, particularly since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. With institutional and ETF demand providing consistent buying pressure, we expect this trend to continue, keeping future corrections limited and potentially shorter in duration,” Bitfinex stated. Optimistic Expectations for 2025 Although analysts have optimistic expectations for BTC in 2025, they have warned that the cryptocurrency may not see rallies as high as recorded in previous cycles. In 2021, BTC rose roughly 40% from its moving averages; however, the trend of diminishing returns could place the surge at 15-20% above the moving averages. This translates to BTC peaking at $160,000 or $200,000 in mid-2025 or, in a less likely scenario, $290,000 by early 2026.

The raid, conducted on December 10, has unveiled an extensive operation that defrauded victims across North America, Europe, and Mexico through sophisticated online phishing schemes. A spokesperson for the EFCC revealed that Nigerian accomplices were recruited to lure victims by establishing trust over social media platforms. “Once the Nigerians are able to win the confidence of would-be victims, the foreigners would take over the actual task of defrauding them,” the spokesperson explained. Known as “pig butchering,” this method blends romance scams and fake cryptocurrency investment pitches , exploiting emotional and financial vulnerabilities to pressure victims into transferring funds. Chinese Organized Crime The arrested individuals allegedly operated under the command of foreign syndicates, mainly Chinese kingpins who brought advanced infrastructure and funding to the scheme. Cybercrime investigator Ken Gamble, co-founder of IFW Global, stated that Chinese organized crime groups are increasingly shifting their operations to regions with weaker cybersecurity frameworks, such as Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. “Chinese organized crime groups are expanding their operations into countries with weaker cybersecurity enforcement frameworks,” Gamble said, adding that Chinese ringleaders typically aim to employ as many as 1,000 people in such operations. He noted that while the Lagos-based scam hub was relatively smaller, similar operations in Myanmar had employed up to 5,000 workers. Local recruits are enticed with higher-than-average pay, with Nigerians earning up to $500 per month — nearly ten times the country’s minimum wage — plus performance-based bonuses for successful scams. These lucrative offers make it easier for criminal networks to scale their operations in resource-constrained countries. EFCC Collaborates Amid Rising Crypto Scam Cases The EFCC stated that it is working with international partners to assess whether the Lagos-based operation has broader links to global organized crime. The crackdown comes amid rising concerns over “pig butchering” scam cases , which have become increasingly popular among cybercriminals this year. In an August report, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis highlighted the shift toward quicker , high-impact scam cases like these, noting that they are replacing long-term Ponzi schemes as cybercriminals adapt to evade detection.

As effective as these strategies have raised awareness and hype, the crypto space could be maturing. With mainstream adoption here in the form of ETFs and government buy-in, 2025 may be the year when traditional marketing makes a significant comeback. The key to winning over the masses? Putting a relatable human face on Web3 brands while leveraging proven tactics like face-to-face networking at blockchain events, quality PR, and educational content. Face-to-Face Networking Could Make a Comeback Attending professional gatherings is critical for networking, building connections, and proving your legitimacy to potential partners. While online meetings have some benefits, nothing compares to the value of face-to-face relationship building within the crypto ecosystem. Handshakes matter - looking people in the eye while directly discussing your project's real-world utility makes memorable and meaningful impressions. You'll need to perfect that elevator pitch and get comfortable explaining complex crypto concepts to all levels of expertise. Making genuine in-the-flesh connections at events could make or break your next significant partnership or integration. Attending gatherings like blockchain events and conferences also allows you to showcase tangible evidence that you mean serious crypto business. Bring visually impressive banner displays and have pamphlets/swag on hand. Set up product demos to showcase key features. Getting stakeholders to engage directly with your tech often sparks productive conversations for driving adoption and development. If this is something you think would drive value to your business, keep an eye on the crypto events calendar to look for events you could participate in (or even sponsor) for 2025. Keep an eye out for ones focusing specifically on areas like DeFi innovation, NFT disruption in various industries, or mainstream blockchain adoption. And see if you can snag speaking opportunities! Even leading a breakout session makes you an instant expert in attendees' eyes. Press Releases - Not Just a Legacy Tactic Scan the headlines about cryptocurrency in recent years, and a clear theme emerges - this emerging technology has a trust problem. Stories of fraud, volatility, hacks, and regulatory crackdowns dominate coverage. To the average reader, crypto appears less like the financial system of the future and more like a playground for shady schemes and get-rich-quick dreams destined to pop. However, for those building genuine, lasting projects on the blockchain, this negative narrative threatens mainstream adoption goals. The question becomes: How does crypto repair its battered reputation and evolve beyond its fringe roots? The answer may lie in an unexpected place - press releases. Typically viewed as a legacy tactic, press releases distributed to Web3 outlets and traditional media can play a pivotal role in reshaping public assumptions. On the decentralized front, craft press releases specifically for crypto trade journalists hungriest for the latest coin news. Make announcements about exchange listings, staking functionality, new blockchain integrations, and other technical milestones they care about most—frame for insider audiences literate in crypto's jargon. At the same time, cultivate relationships with mainstream reporters unfamiliar with Web3 intricacies. Simplify language around developments to highlight real-world use cases. Emphasize how innovations impact businesses outside crypto, like healthcare, education, and sustainability. Draw connections to societal themes average readers relate to. Crypto Needs Fresh Infographics and Explainers The Web3 space may need to be faster for the average person to comprehend. High-quality infographics , videos, and guides could be invaluable to driving mainstream clarity and understanding. Visual explainers distill complexity into easily digestible snippets. Infographics make concepts like decentralized data more tangible and concrete. Short animated videos break down blockchain mechanics in bite-sized demos. This educational content serves a dual purpose - attracting newcomers AND clarifying your project's purpose and benefits. When attention spans are short, creative visuals grab interest quickly. You'll also want to promote these materials heavily - not just post and pray they'll catch on organically—and partner with schools to integrate crypto learning modules into curriculums. Push explainers on social channels and pay to boost key posts. Reach out to journalists covering education technology for potential stories. Getting traction requires an omnichannel strategy spanning both traditional and digital. However, clear educational marketing helps novices wrap their heads around that crypto life. Crypto Needs a Consistent (and Human) Voice Crypto content often needs a human touch. So many projects have faceless teams, anonymous founders, and robotic brand voices. This fuels perceptions of crypto being cold and inaccessible to everyday people. Putting a relatable public face on your startup is key in 2025. Get leaders in front of cameras instead of hiding behind pseudonyms. Foster an authentic brand voice on social channels - respond to comments, post AMAs, and connect emotionally with the community. Help people see the founders as passionate change-makers rather than aloof tech geniuses. Share the personal stories that drive your blockchain mission. Make it feel like a movement people can truly belong to, not just digital assets to trade. This human/personal marketing approach also applies to partnerships; rather than cold emailing potential integrators, set up calls to explain how your technology can impact their customers. Send personal video messages to early adopters showing appreciation. When people build relationships with humans, not corporations, emotional connections keep them loyal during ups and downs. By showcasing the faces behind your crypto brand, you spark the mass adoption momentum needed to hit mainstream status. Final Word In recent years, crypto projects have gained attention mainly through digital marketing - viral coin launches, active Reddit discussions, and experimental Web3 branding. However, more traditional marketing approaches may be key for crypto to achieve mainstream adoption long-term. By integrating some ""old-school"" strategies, crypto can connect better with audiences outside the tech community to build broader trust and usage. Tactics like in-person networking events to showcase real-world uses, press releases to tell crypto's story in business media outlets (not just crypto blogs), and educational guides in clear language can make blockchain technology less confusing for average people. The tech innovations powering crypto should continue behind the scenes. However, the external marketing face needs to become more accessible. Blending the momentum and buzz of viral digital trends with the credibility of traditional PR and marketing tactics can enable mainstream understanding. Crypto should maintain elements of both approaches as adoption advances across various segments in the coming years. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37754604,https://finbold.com/?p=220083,1734434520,"XRP ‘off to the races’ to hit $4, according to crypto analyst","XRP’s price has been building significant momentum, currently trading at $2.66 after a daily gain of 11.75% and a weekly surge of 18.72%. Recent price action, coupled with technical indicators and whale accumulation, points to a potential breakout that could send XRP soaring to the $4 level in the near term. XRP 1-day price. Source: Finbold XRP technical analysis On December 17, prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez highlighted XRP’s bullish formation, stating: “XRP has been consolidating in this bull flag for a while, but once it clears the $2.60 resistance, I think it’s off to the races, heading toward $4!” XRP bull flag. Source: Ali Martinez This observation follows his earlier analysis on December 12, where Martinez noted that XRP was forming a textbook bull flag pattern on the 4-hour chart. A bull flag is a continuation pattern characterized by a sharp rally (the “flagpole”) followed by a period of consolidation within a downward-sloping channel (the “flag”). A breakout above the upper trendline of the flag confirms the pattern and typically leads to a move equivalent to the length of the initial rally. In XRP’s case, the flagpole extends from $1.92 to $2.60, suggesting a potential breakout target of around $3.28 to $3.50 in the short term, with a longer-term target of $4. XRP’s price action has been defined by several critical levels that traders are closely monitoring. Immediate support sits at $2.23, a level that has consistently provided a strong foundation during pullbacks, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Immediate resistance stands at $2.60, which forms the upper boundary of the bull flag pattern. A confirmed breakout above this level would likely trigger the next leg of XRP’s rally. Beyond this, $3 represents a significant psychological barrier. Clearing this level could pave the way for a move toward the all-time high (ATH). The long-term target of $4 is derived from the measured move of the bull flag breakout, aligning with broader market optimism and increased whale activity. XRP indicators supporting the bullish case Several key indicators support the bullish outlook for XRP. The price is currently trading well above the 200-day simple moving average ( SMA ), a crucial signal for long-term bullish momentum. Additionally, the 50-day SMA is trending upward, hinting at a potential bullish crossover that could further strengthen the uptrend. The Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) on the 4-hour chart is approaching overbought territory, hovering around 70. While this typically signals the possibility of short-term consolidation, in strong bullish trends, overbought conditions often persist, reflecting robust buying momentum. Another significant indicator is the TD Sequential, which previously presented a sell signal on December 12. This signal often suggests a brief correction before a continuation of the trend. With XRP now breaking above $2.60, this sell signal appears to have played out, clearing the path for further upside. Lastly, trading volume has surged by 129.28% in the past 24 hours to $15.16 billion. Elevated volume during a breakout confirms the strength of the move and reduces the likelihood of a false breakout, further supporting the bullish case for XRP. Whale accumulation of XRP Strong technical indicators and whale accumulation (over 830 million XRP in the past 24 hours), suggest that XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on the current bullish momentum and potentially achieve new highs. Whales have purchased over 830 million $XRP in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/KzNds2CVdf — Ali (@ali_charts) December 16, 2024 Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin launch is expected to enhance XRP’s utility within the Ripple ecosystem, providing additional liquidity and reinforcing its use case for cross-border payments. On a larger scale, a potentially pro-crypto administration in the U.S. and increasing institutional interest are adding crucial tailwinds to XRP’s trajectory.

This surge has driven the total cryptocurrency market cap to $3.73 trillion, further fueling investor excitement. Now, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can continue this momentum and hit $110,000 before the year ends. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin has broken out of a rising channel pattern, showcasing strong buyer strength. The price movement has hit the target of an inverted head-and-shoulders breakout. However, Bitcoin is facing key resistance at the 50% Fibonacci level ($106,912) , which is proving to be a hurdle for further gains. Technical indicators support the bullish outlook. The MACD and signal lines remain in a positive alignment, signaling growing interest among buyers and maintaining the potential for an upward move. Institutional investors are playing a critical role in Bitcoin’s rally. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reported daily inflows of $636.85 million , with BlackRock leading the charge at $418.16 million, followed by Fidelity’s $116.06 million. This reflects increasing institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Adding to the momentum, MicroStrategy purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, helping drive the surge to its new ATH. Currently, institutional holdings account for $120.71 billion in Bitcoin, representing 5.76% of its market capitalization. Looking forward, Bitcoin needs a strong close above $106,912 to solidify the breakout. If successful, the next key target for bulls is $110,730, aligning with the 67.8% Fibonacci level . A break beyond this level could open the door to even higher price points. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold its gains, a pullback to the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $103,093 remains a possibility. Bitcoin’s new ATH of $107,699.00 has reaffirmed its dominance and bullish momentum. Investors are closely watching key resistance levels and institutional activity to gauge the next move.

37754504,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628794,1734434117,The two beefs that will reshape our global economy and the future of AI next year,"Two brutal battles are set to define next year. One threatens to rip apart the foundations of the global economy. The other could rewrite the future of artificial intelligence. On one front: Donald Trump, the president-elect, ready to bulldoze Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve over interest rates. On the other: Elon Musk and Sam Altman, two former allies turned enemies, locked in a war over OpenAI, xAI, and control of the AI industry. Trump’s beef with Powell Trump and Powell’s first round wasn’t pretty. During his first term, Trump blasted the Fed and Powell for not slashing interest rates fast enough, calling them “boneheads” and the “enemy.” He even floated the idea of firing Powell and tried stacking the Fed board with loyalists who would do his bidding. It didn’t work. Powell held his ground, and rates didn’t plunge to the zero levels Trump demanded. Now, Trump’s back, and so is the fight. During his campaign, Trump promised “interest rate cuts the likes of which you have never seen before.” That’s great for voters drowning in expensive mortgages and credit card debt. But it’s bad news for Powell, who has spent years trying to wrestle inflation under control. The Fed raised interest rates aggressively in 2022 and 2023, trying to cool off runaway inflation. Borrowing costs soared, and the economy slowed. But inflation is still higher than Powell wants. Rates currently sit at 4.6%, and the Fed plans to lower them slowly, hitting 3.4% by the end of 2025. That’s nowhere near the near-zero rates Trump wants. The economic situation complicates everything. Growth is strong. Jobs are stable. But inflation still lingers. Trump’s economic plans could make things worse. He wants to slap new tariffs on trade partners and deport immigrants, moves that could drive up prices and tighten the labor market. Higher tariffs mean higher costs for businesses and consumers. Fewer workers mean rising wages, which fuels inflation. Trump doesn’t care about economic nuance. He wants results. He promised voters cheaper borrowing costs, and he’ll hammer Powell until he gets them. If Powell refuses, Trump could try to fire Powell or appoint a Fed board loyal enough to outvote him. The Fed’s independence is on thin ice. December could be the first battlefield. The Fed is expected to cut rates again any second now and release its economic forecasts. Those projections will likely show slower cuts, exactly the opposite of what Trump wants. If the cuts aren’t deep enough, Trump’s frustration will spill out publicly — just like last time. Remember 2019? Trump was attacking the Fed even as it was lowering rates. “Would be sooo great if the Fed would further lower interest rates,” he posted on X. A few months later: “Rates down to ZERO, or less.” Elon v. Altman: a war for AI’s future On the other side of the chaos: Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Two men who once co-founded OpenAI now stand as bitter rivals. Elon accuses Altman of turning OpenAI into a profit-driven sellout. Altman and OpenAI fire back, pointing out Elon pushed for a similar structure before he left in 2017. The lawsuit is just the beginning. Elon filed it earlier this year, claiming OpenAI betrayed its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. He calls it “deceit of Shakespearean proportions” and nicknamed Altman “Swindly Sam.” OpenAI’s response? Elon is a hypocrite who should “compete in the marketplace rather than the courtroom.” Elon’s xAI is gunning for OpenAI’s crown. Grok-2, xAI’s chatbot, launched in August and is already competing with OpenAI’s ChatGPT , Google’s Gemini, and Meta’s Llama. Grok-2 isn’t far behind. Elon’s companies give him an edge. Tesla cars collect real-world data. Starlink satellites gather global imagery. X offers endless streams of user interactions. “They have probably the largest proprietary data set anywhere,” said someone who knows Elon and Altman’s operations. OpenAI remains the frontrunner, but Elon is relentless. His AI ambitions are intertwined with his influence in Washington. Trump’s return complicates OpenAI’s strategy. Elon has positioned himself as Trump’s confidant, and OpenAI executives are preparing for the worst. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s policy chief, said the company is focused on proving its value to the U.S. “This administration talked over the campaign and since about the imperative of U.S.-led AI prevailing,” Lehane said. Altman is playing defense. He donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, a move to shore up goodwill. Meanwhile, Elon’s critics worry about his influence. Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member, said Elon could use his political connections to “privilege one company over others.” Hoffman warned this would be destructive. “It’s destructive for the industry, it’s destructive for American society.” Elon doesn’t need political favors to threaten OpenAI though. xAI’s rapid progress is enough. Grok-2’s success proves Elon is serious about AI, and his resources give him momentum. OpenAI, meanwhile, is restructuring to attract outside investment and keep its lead. That restructuring is at the heart of Elon’s lawsuit. He argues it betrays OpenAI’s original mission. OpenAI says it’s necessary to stay competitive. The two sides aren’t budging.

The HashKey Platform Token ( HSK ) surpassed its previous all-time high of $1.5989 which was achieved yesterday, to continue its bullish momentum and record a new all-time high of $1.72, at the time of writing, Dec. 17, 2024. Source: Coinmarketcap From its all-time low of $0.7167 on Nov. 26, 2024, this milestone represents a substantial rise or a gain of almost 140%. The 24-hour trading volume of around $9.5 million coincides with the recent spike in HSK’s value, suggesting increased investor interest and market activity. You might also like: HashKey CEO: Trump’s crypto support could push China to revive crypto regulation The HSK token plays a central role within the HashKey ecosystem, offering multiple utilities such as trading fee discounts, exclusive access to platform services, and participation in ecosystem governance. HashKey Group’s regulated and compliant infrastructure has further bolstered trust in HSK, positioning it as a key asset within the growing digital finance landscape. Binance Coin, another exchange-native token that has seen notable long-term growth in tandem with Binance’s growing ecosystem, has also been moving in an upward trajectory. Starting at $0.10 when it was first introduced in 2017, Binance Coin ( BNB ) has subsequently soared to an all-time high of $788.84 on December 4, 2024. It is now trading at about $716.41 as of December 17, 2024, which reflects years of steady development alongside Binance’s growing ecosystem. In the past 24 hours, BNB has registered a total trading volume of $2.2 billion, and its market cap stands at $104 billion at the time of writing. By contrast, HSK is a more recent coin that was introduced in November 2024 and started at an initial price of $1.20. Shortly after inception, it struck an all-time low of $0.708, but on Dec. 17, 2024, it rose to its current all-time high of $1.72. In the past 24 hours, HSK has registered a total trading volume of $13.3 million, and its market cap stands at $208.91 million. Although BNB’s success shows that exchange tokens may grow with their platforms, Binance’s resiliency has been put to the test over the years by market difficulties and governmental scrutiny. In contrast, HSK gains from HashKey Global’s focus on a regulated and compliant infrastructure, which may make it a formidable competitor in an exchange market that is becoming more and more complicated.

Regulators plan to complete the necessary legislative amendments before 2026. In the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Global Forum on Transparency and Effective Exchange of Information in Tax Matters on Dec. 13, representatives from the Hong Kong government vowed to implement a framework that would make crypto asset reporting mandatory for tax calculations. According to a press release shared on the government site, the framework is meant to improve global tax transparency and combat cross-border tax evasion. Building upon the existing reporting standards found within the region’s Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters, the crypto asset reporting framework requires tax-paying residents to report crypto accounts and transactions annually. The government plans to complete the regulatory framework by 2026 or earlier. Meanwhile, regulators aim to start implementing the crypto asset reporting framework with relevant tax jurisdiction by 2028. The information gathered based on the reporting framework would then be shared to tax authorities with relevant knowledge on crypto assets from different countries to ensure fair and effective global implementation of the framework. According to the release, Hong Kong has automatically exchanged financial account information with partner tax jurisdictions annually since 2018. The relevant tax authorities would then use the information for tax assessments and to detect and combat tax evasion.

Trustlines are integral to the XRP Ledger because they allow accounts to interact with assets and stablecoins like RLUSD. This rapid activation rate reflects growing confidence in Ripple’s ecosystem. RLUSD – Ripple’s Upcoming Stablecoin RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, has been designed to enhance liquidity and optimize financial transactions. Regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has further legitimized its role. Backed by Ripple, RLUSD is expected to complement XRP within Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) system among other services. The stablecoin aims to solve traditional banking inefficiencies by enabling faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions. RLUSD’s design allows it to function seamlessly with XRP without diminishing its utility, making it an integral part of Ripple’s broader payment solutions. Industry analysts view these developments as a turning point for Ripple. By introducing a regulated stablecoin, the company positions itself as a leader in blockchain-based financial solutions. RLUSD is set to boost institutional adoption, improve interoperability across systems, and expand Ripple’s use cases globally.

The sheer scale of trustline activations also hints at Ripple’s preparation for large-scale adoption. With billions of RLUSD moving through the network, exchanges are reportedly gearing up for increased activity, signaling potential growth for the XRP ecosystem. While Ripple has not officially confirmed the timing of RLUSD’s launch, the groundwork suggests it will play a pivotal role in reshaping global financial systems. Ripple plans to redefine cross-border payments, and RLUSD’s launch is an important step toward achieving this goal. This stablecoin initiative reinforces Ripple’s commitment to building a robust financial infrastructure. With exchanges already preparing for RLUSD’s adoption and billions of units flowing through the ecosystem, XRP’s role in global finance is set to strengthen, as the stablecoin launch could significantly benefit the digital asset. However, it is best not to get carried away by the excitement, as Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz recently gave an important warning to the community ahead of the stablecoin’s launch.

37756393,https://invezz.com/?p=2390570,1734433518,UK FCA targets 90% of failing crypto firms with new rules on transparency and market abuse,"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has introduced a discussion paper aimed at addressing market abuse and improving transparency in the UK’s crypto markets. Released on 16 December 2024, the proposals focus on strengthening admission and disclosure standards for crypto-assets. These changes are part of a broader initiative to create a cleaner, more secure trading environment while protecting investors from the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Over the past few years, the FCA has gradually tightened its regulatory stance on crypto-assets, highlighting the dangers posed by fraudulent activities and inadequate controls. Despite recent measures, the regulator warns that cryptocurrencies remain high-risk investments, where losses can be substantial, and investor protection is limited. FCA’s new proposals for admissions and disclosures The FCA’s discussion paper outlines a series of changes to enhance market integrity and investor confidence in crypto-assets. Central to the proposals are stricter rules for admissions and disclosures. These rules would ensure that authorized firms provide accurate and transparent information when admitting crypto-assets to trading platforms. The regulator aims to reduce the potential for market manipulation by mandating more robust internal controls. Information sharing between firms and authorities will also be a key focus to prevent abusive trading practices and fraudulent behaviors. These measures are intended to promote fairness in the crypto markets and help consumers make better financial decisions. The FCA has already implemented stringent standards for authorization, with only 10% of crypto firm applications approved in the first quarter of 2024. The remaining 90% were rejected due to poor anti-money laundering (AML) standards. This highlights the FCA’s commitment to ensuring only compliant and responsible firms operate in the UK’s crypto sector. One of the core objectives of the FCA’s proposals is to modernize the market abuse regime for crypto-assets. By aligning these rules with those applied to traditional financial markets, the FCA aims to address gaps that have allowed rogue operators to exploit the system. The proposed innovations include enhanced monitoring mechanisms to detect suspicious activities and prevent market manipulation. This initiative comes as the FCA steps up its oversight of crypto promotions. Earlier this year, the regulator issued more than 450 warnings against unauthorized promotions, underscoring the persistent risks facing investors. These warnings serve as a reminder that many crypto-asset providers fail to meet regulatory standards, posing significant dangers to consumers. Balancing innovation and investor protection The FCA’s proposals reflect a careful balance between fostering innovation in the crypto sector and ensuring investor safety. By tightening regulations, the authority hopes to create a secure environment where cryptocurrencies can evolve responsibly. The measures aim to support growth while mitigating risks, particularly for retail investors who may lack the expertise to navigate the volatile crypto market. The FCA’s call for feedback invites stakeholders, including industry participants and consumers, to contribute their views on the proposed changes. This collaborative approach is expected to drive the development of a regulatory framework that enhances transparency, reduces market abuse, and aligns with global standards.

Bennet also suggested that now is the opportune moment for the ETH price to target a new all-time high as he believes that the altcoin could see “some of those Bitcoin (BTC) profits” flow into the Ethereum market soon. Ethereum Price To Reach $15,937 By May 2025? Adding to this bullish outlook, market expert VentureFounder shared even more optimistic predictions, anticipating an extended bullish momentum for ETH over the next seven months, and projecting it to reach a new all-time high of $15,937 by May 2025. VentureFounder linked this forecast to historical patterns, noting that the first quarter following Bitcoin’s Halving events typically initiates a surge toward new record highs. He further indicated that Ethereum often enjoys a year of strong performance after such Halving events, the latest of which occurred in April of this year. This year has already seen significant similarities with the past for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Prior to Bitcoin’s Halving, the cryptocurrency experienced a substantial rally, fueled in part by the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Ethereum also experienced significant growth, posting its strongest first quarter in more than three years, rising from $2,260 in February to nearly 100% in just 30 days. However, it remained below the $4,100 threshold until recently, consistent with Bitcoin’s increasing trajectory. Overall, VentureFounder’s analysis, together with the price movements of both Ethereum and Bitcoin this year, gives a solid foundation for believing that ETH may be poised for significant rises in the coming months if the experts’ projections and prior patterns hold true. At the time of writing, ETH is attempting to consolidate at around $4,014. This level will be crucial for determining whether further upward momentum will occur in the coming days or if additional tests of price support are on the horizon.

The BGA’s 2024 State of the Industry report revealed that 52.5% of respondents have expertise in gaming, the most since the survey began in 2021. Blockchain and cryptocurrency specialists now make up just 10.8% of the industry, down from 21.7% last year.  “For an industry that has faced great scrutiny regarding the importance of building fun-first and less financialized games, it is significant to see an increased prevalence of professionals coming from a background in gaming as opposed to blockchain or cryptocurrency,” the report noted.  The report also highlighted that digital asset ownership remains the most valued feature of blockchain gaming, with 71% of the 623 respondents identifying it as the top benefit. This trend has persisted since the BGA’s inaugural survey in 2021. Other benefits, such as new player reward models and revenue opportunities, were also noted, emphasizing the potential of blockchain to reshape gaming.  Despite progress, challenges remain. Poor user experience and onboarding issues were identified as the industry’s biggest hurdles by 54% of respondents, down from 80% in 2023, reflecting efforts to simplify blockchain gaming and make it more accessible.  “Innovations in design and functionality have reduced barriers and these advancements are helping to ensure that the Web3 gaming ecosystem is more intuitive, inclusive, and welcoming to a broader audience,” said Sebastien Borget, president of the BGA and co-founder and COO of The Sandbox.  Two-thirds of respondents also cited accusations of blockchain games being scams as a persistent issue.

As reported in the U.S. attorney’s press release , the evidence in the trial showed Chhipa operated a multi-year scheme, starting from at least Oct. 2019 to 2022, to funnel cash to female ISIS supporters in Syria. These funds allegedly helped finance a range of terrorist activities, including enabling the escape of those with ties to ISIS from prison camps as well as funding the ISIS fighters themselves. Prosecutors even portrayed the defendant’s cryptocurrency use as central to his operational modus operandi as he tried to conceal the place of origin and the receiving address of the funds transferred. You might also like: MEXC crowns “Face of MEXC 2024” at MShow, strengthening brand presence in Vietnam Chhipa’s main contact was a British-born ISIS operative in Syria who had funded prison breakouts and terrorist attacks and had provided direct support to ISIS fighters. In total, throughout the conspiracy, Chhipa wired the equivalent of more than $185,000 in cryptocurrency, converting the money he collected online and in person. Then, he would convert those contributions into crypto and send them to intermediaries in Turkey after receiving fiat contributions through electronic transfers and cash.

Chhipa is facing up to 20 years in federal prison on each count, and a sentencing date has been set for May 5, 2025. Since sentences may be below the statutory maximum, the sentence, in this case, will be determined by the federal district court after consideration of applicable guidelines and factors. The case, brought by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Justice Department’s National Security Division, spotlights a longstanding problem in the crypto industry.

37753977,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628742,1734432914,"XRPL governance under scrutiny, Ripple CTO suggests voting upgrades","Ripple CTO David Schwartz addressed XRP Ledger (XRPL) account reserves and the voting mechanism. He tried to clarify that the voting system is designed to coordinate feature activation and not as the network’s primary governance tool. An XRPL ambassador responded to it by highlighting that validators are critical defenders of XRPL from bad decisions. The XRPL governance came under scrutiny when a fresh wave of investors’ interest could be seen flying in the XRP. Lots of excitement over the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin launch has led Ripple’s native crypto to record a 16% jump in the past 7 days. Additionally, Xaman, a self-custodial wallet built for the XRPL saw an over 200% surge in its active weekly users since summer. Ripple CTO flags caution Schwartz in a post shared some thoughts on the recent discussion around XRPL account reserves and the voting mechanism to change the amount. He targeted the voting option stating that It can govern because only active validators can vote, and there might be instances where some validators are inactive. To make this process more stable, the Ripple CTO proposed one improvement which requires an explicit configuration for voting to raise reserves, with the default setting being “off.” He suggested another plan where it would be to “set the default to have no preference on what the reserve is and only vote to raise or lower the reserve if explicitly configured to.” On the current reserve drop, Schwartz said it was overdue but slightly more aggressive than he’d prefer. He highlighted that lowering reserves immediately unlocks XRP for all XRPL accounts, no XRP is “taken” or “lost,” as reserves safeguard the network. However, raising reserves needs to be approached with caution to avoid locking up XRP or creating a perception of undue influence. Daniel Keller, who referred to himself as the CEO of the XRPL, responded to comments putting a spotlight on the importance of validators as the network’s defense against rushed decisions. He cited issues like the XLS-20 rollout and premature AMM proposals. As the CEO of the XRPL I want to share my thoughts on this comment and matter as well. Validators are the last bastion to defend the network from bad decisions, and given the history of the previous two years, we have learned that this is necessary. Who doesn’t remember the… https://t.co/YcIRsIIN65 — Daniel “Wen DexTools” Keller (@daniel_wwf) December 17, 2024 He praised validators for prioritizing risk over judgments of “good” or “bad” amendments as it ensures network safety. He supported the reserve reduction while calling it long overdue. Keller in the final comments expressed his confidence in XRPL’s current state and concluded by saying, “Onwards and upwards.” Ramping up for RLUSD Ripple announced that its RLUSD stablecoin will launch globally on December 17, 2024. This comes a week after the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval , following Ripple’s acquisition of Standard Custody, which will distribute RLUSD to exchanges. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted RLUSD’s compliance and its potential for widespread adoption as US crypto regulations get clarity. He mentioned that its stablecoin will be on the exchanges like Archax, Bitso, CoinMENA, MoonPay, Uphold, and more.

Will a breakdown send the ADA price crashing to $0.94? Despite a broader market recovery, Cardano is facing a constant bearish sentiment. This growing bearish pressure puts the $1 psychological mark at risk and signals the possibility of an extended correction.Will the slowdown in bullish momentum lead to a crash for Cardano? The local support trend line, however, suggests a different outcome.Cardano Price AnalysisOn the 4-hour chart, Cardano's price trend shows a lower-high formation despite the bullish trends in Bitcoin and other top altcoins. Due to bullish exhaustion, Cardano's price faces resistance at a trend line, which has kept its upward momentum in check. The ADA token is currently trading at $1.0625 as it pulls back from the overhead trend line. The bearish retracement has broken below the 38.20% Fibonacci level at $1.0826, and the negative cycle is moving closer to the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $1.0316.Two crucial support trend lines are forming a falling channel pattern on the 4-hour chart. Despite the bearish trend, the 4-hour RSI indicates an underlying bullish divergence. If Cardano manages to hold above the $1 psychological mark, it could increase the chances of a bullish reversal.Falling Social VolumeAs downside risks increase, social sentiment surrounding Cardano is turning bearish. Analyst Ali Martinez recently pointed out the declining social volumes for Cardano.With the total weighted sentiment dropping to -0.786, social volumes have fallen to 206. Martinez described the decline as “just the kind of setup bullish contrarians dream of!” Ali comment on Cardano Ali comment on Cardano ADA Price TargetsBased on the current price trend, Cardano will likely test the 23.60% Fibonacci level before attempting a bullish reversal. The price must break above the overhead trend line for an extended rally.In the event of a breakout rally, the upside targets are the 78.60% and 100% Fibonacci levels, at $1.2239 and $1.2987, respectively.

MicroStrategy buys another $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, and the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also buy big. Institutional and sovereign buying Bitcoin may be advancing well into overbought territory, but the inexorable buying coming from the institutions just keeps pushing the price skyward. MicroStrategy bought the top again with a further $1.5 billion outlay. The company acquired 15,350 BTC, which brings its total holdings to 439,000 BTC. While MicroStrategy buys, and buys again, Blackrock’s IBIT ETF is doing the same, but at an even faster rate. IBIT accounted for $418.80 million of the $637.50 million that was the total inflow to the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs on Monday. With the Blackrock IBIT purchases coming nearly every day, its overall holding has now grown to $539.02K BTC. If one adds to this the likelihood that some nation states are also secretly buying or mining BTC, the current buying pressure can be explained. Channel breakout or rejection? Source: TradingView As can be seen in the 4-hour chart above, the $BTC price is currently traversing within an ascending channel. The price has just touched the top of the channel for the third time, which confirms the pattern, and now it is a case of waiting to see whether the price will be rejected, or whether all the buying will push the price through. These patterns are generally bearish, and so in the majority of cases, a rejection would be forthcoming, but this is Bitcoin, and therefore we must also expect the unexpected. If the price does come back down, two horizontal levels of support have recently been formed below at $103,800, and $99,600. The upward trend would only be nullified by a drop below $91,000. Long-term bearish divergence in play Source: TradingView As a point of interest. Looking at the 2-week chart for $BTC, one can see that the current price is just making contact with an ascending trendline that touches both preceding bull markets. If one also looks at the RSI at the bottom of the chart, the trendline for those tops is descending. This points to bearish divergence. The only way to nullify this is for the indicator line on the RSI to rise above this line, and also above the previous top earlier this year.

37753583,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394084,1734432523,Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Can BTC Rally to $150K by Mid-Year?,"The post Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Can BTC Rally to $150K by Mid-Year? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new ATH of $107,700 in the 2nd week of December. The current rally is giving bullish vibes for early 2025. The Fear and Greed Index has reached 87, indicating significant investor interest. The worldwide crypto market cap is $3.72 trillion, up 1%, with trading volumes up 34% to $211 billion. Bitcoin’s market capitalization has surpassed $2.11 trillion, with a trading volume of $83 billion, keeping its dominance at 56.46%. President Donald Trump’s plans to turn the U.S. into a Bitcoin powerhouse are driving excitement in the industry. If Trump’s proposal for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve is approved in January, the BTC price might leap to new heights. This year’s rally has already been driven by the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs , and all eyes are now on how 2025 will unfold for Bitcoin. With new tax policies, regulations, and Bitcoin reserve plans how high can bitcoin go in 2025? Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2025 Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, shared his outlook on Bitcoin’s future in a recent podcast with Thinking Crypto Tony Edwards. He predicts that Bitcoin’s current fair value of $100,000 will trigger a parabolic surge, potentially pushing its price to $120,000–$150,000 by mid-2025. Yusko remains confident in Bitcoin’s four-year cycle, which he believes will peak in the first half of 2025. However, some analysts warn of a “Double Bubble Altseason,” where a massive pump could lead to a sharp correction, similar to the 2017–2018 cycle. In January 2018, many altcoins surged 100x, only to see a 95% crash within a year. He backed his stance with the events this year, he noted how Spot ETF approvals in January pushed Bitcoin to $74,000 in February followed by some minor corrections immediately after the approval. This was the time many took an opportunity to buy the dip and with a distributive pattern, Bitcoin saw lower highs and lows in the futures market as well. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Breaking ATH After ATH: Next PitStop for the BTC Price Rally Could be $110K Ahead of Yearly Close , Crypto Community Joins In Crypto analysts Tommy Mustache and Tim Peterson foresee Bitcoin reaching a price range of $105K to $112K in early 2025, with Peterson relying on his Metcalfe Law model for the projection. Whereas if all goes well in Q1, the all-time high is expected to climb higher, hitting around $150K–$160K not before mid-2025, while Fibonacci and Elliott Wave analysis indicate slightly higher potential peaks. By April or May 2025, Bitcoin’s fair value is projected to halt near $100K, driven by reduced leverage and increased investor activity. Analysts predict a parabolic surge to $150K before a correction occurs, which could see Bitcoin prices drop to nosedive towards $75K.

X user Waleswoosh, a pseudonymous researcher at Azuki, posted a screenshot of the OpenSea registration. The registration was present on the Cayman Island's general registry and was also confirmed to CoinDesk by OpenSea.  The post led to speculation over whether the move was a step toward releasing a token in a more crypto-friendly jurisdiction than the U.S. A dashboard created on Dune lets OpenSea users check their historical activity to estimate how much a potential airdrop might be worth.   OpenSea declined to comment on whether it would be introducing an native token.  The company is headquartered in New York and was the primary venue for the NFT bull cycle in 2022, racking up a record $2.7 billion of trading volume on a single day in May that year. The emergence of rival platform Blur coupled with a wider market decline resulted in a loss of market share. Trading volume over the past 24 hours hit $21 million, less than 1% of the record.  The company was valued at $13 billion after it raised $300 million during the height of the 2022 cycle. The market has now shifted, with focus on memecoins like dogwifhat (WIF) and bonk (BONK) rather than non-fungible token projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks.  OpenSea plans to turn the tide back in its favor this month as it rolls out OpenSea 2.0. More than 1 million unique wallets have registered for the waitlist.   The new platform features a ""retro"" section, which rewards users for historical activity in the form of ""points."" Points leaderboards have been a common way of airdropping tokens to users this year by incentivizing ongoing activity and loyalty.

37753339,https://coinpaper.com/6569/lido-finance-announces-plans-to-shut-down-operations-on-polygon,1734431971,Lido Finance Announces Plans to Shut Down Operations on Polygon,"Lido’s decision was approved by 99% of Lido DAO voters, and is very similar to Lido’s previous exit from Solana. Meanwhile, Aave is considering a similar move due to the risk profile of bridged assets and recent proposals to redeploy $1.3 billion in stablecoin reserves into Ethereum vaults. This plan caused some controversy in the crypto community over added risks. In contrast, Eliza Labs partnered with Stanford University to explore the role of AI agents in Web3 systems to improve trust, coordination, and decision-making in decentralized networks. Lido Finance Exits Polygon Lido Finance, the leading liquid staking protocol, announced it is winding down operations on the Polygon network due to limited user adoption, evolving ecosystem dynamics, and a strategic refocus on Ethereum. The decision was made after a request by Lido DAO Token (LDO) holders, extensive DAO forum discussions, and a community vote in November. During this vote, 99% of participants favored the proposal. Two proposals were initially presented: a full transition away from Polygon and a reevaluation of the middleware’s economic model. According to Lido, maintaining operations on Polygon proved resource-intensive with very limited rewards and diminishing demand for liquid staking solutions, especially as the DeFi sector increasingly shifted focus toward zkEVM solutions. Shard Labs, the team responsible for bringing Lido’s staking service to Polygon in 2021, acknowledged that the DeFi migration to zkEVM weakened the role of Polygon’s proof-of-stake (PoS) network as a foundational building block for other protocols. On Dec. 16, Lido stopped accepting staking requests on Polygon, though users will still be able to withdraw their staked MATIC through Lido’s interface until June 16 of 2025. However, rewards have been discontinued, and the protocol will temporarily suspend all withdrawals between Jan. 15 and Jan. 22, 2025. By June 16, front-end support will end entirely, and withdrawals will only be accessible through browser tools. Lido’s exit from Polygon happened after a similar move last year when the protocol stopped operations on Solana due to unsustainable financials and low fees. Lido’s Solana operations launched in September of 2021 but struggled to maintain profitability. Lido holds about $45 million in staked tokens on Polygon, while the network itself retains more than $1.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama data . Across all networks, Lido is still the largest liquid staking protocol. Aave Also Considers Exiting Polygon The community is also currently discussing the possibility of stopping operations on the Polygon network due to concerns over the risk profile of bridged assets. A proposal that was initiated on Dec. 13 by Aave chain founder Marc Zeller seeks to revise risk parameters for Aave v2 and v3 on Polygon. Zeller’s proposal was made after a Polygon governance plan to use over $1 billion in stablecoin reserves for yield farming on protocols like Morpho and Yearn. The proposed changes include setting loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to 0%, increasing reserve factors, and freezing certain assets. Marc Zeller’s proposal (Source: Aave ) Setting the LTV to 0% will prevent users from using bridged assets as collateral, which reduces the risk of cascading liquidations in the event of bridge vulnerabilities. Additionally, freezing assets will stop interactions with multiple bridged tokens, including USDC.e, wETH, wstETH, WBTC, AAVE, LINK, GHST, StMATIC, USDT, EURS, and DAI. Zeller believes that vulnerabilities in blockchain bridges pose very serious risks. Incidents like the Multichain and Harmony bridge hacks are perfect examples of this. He argued that revising Aave’s risk parameters will mitigate these risks while still incentivizing users to migrate from the Polygon network. Aave is one of the largest lending protocols on Polygon, with $461 million in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama . Cumulative fees generated on Polygon for the Aave chain stand at about $122 million. The discussion was started by a separate proposal on Dec. 12 from Allez Labs, Morpho Association, and Yearn.finance, which suggested deploying $1.3 billion in idle stablecoins held on the Polygon Portal bridge into yield-generating Ethereum vaults. This strategy will generate an estimated 7% annual yield, unlocking around $81 million in revenue that could be reinvested into Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem to incentivize liquidity and growth. Under the plan, Morpho’s vaults will serve as the liquidity protocol, Allez Labs would handle risk management, and Yearn would oversee rewards. The proposal generated a lot of community debate, and most people seem to be opposing it due to concerns about added risk. Critics argue that stablecoin holders on the Polygon bridge consider it to be a low-risk environment, and reallocating funds into vaults will just add additional risk without offering corresponding rewards. Polygon Labs explained that the proposal is still only in its early days, and that security is a main priority for the ecosystem. Blockchain bridges allow users to transfer tokens between different chains, and have become a major target for decentralized finance exploits. In fact, they accounted for over half of on-chain attacks between 2021 and 2022. Eliza Labs Partners with Stanford Other partnerships might perform a bit better than the ones with Polygon. Eliza Labs, the developer behind the AI-powered decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) ai16z, announced a partnership with Stanford University’s Future of Digital Currency Initiative to explore how artificial intelligence agents can improve Web3 systems. The collaboration was revealed on Dec. 16, and will use Eliza Labs’ open-source AI agent framework, which is known as Eliza, to address critical questions about trust, coordination, and decision-making in decentralized financial networks. The research is set to begin in 2025, and will focus on developing new frameworks to help AI agents establish and verify trust in digital currency networks, as well as investigate how these agents coordinate and interact in economic systems. Professors Dan Boneh and David Mazières from Stanford described the project as a unique opportunity to define the role of AI agents in digital economies. Eliza is the AI agent that powers ai16z, which is a DAO created to automate on-chain trading and investment decisions. Its native token, AI16Z , hit a market cap of approximately $850 million since its launch in October. The DAO currently manages around $15 million, and Eliza-based AI agents are already being used by dozens of projects. Influencers in the crypto space have drawn comparisons between AI16Z and well known DeFi protocols like Aave, which played a pivotal role in the 2021 bull market. The rise of AI-themed meme coins has also been quite impressive over the past few months. Projects like Zerebro (ZEREBRO) and aixbt by Virtuals (AIXBT) achieved market caps of close to $358 million and $202 million, respectively. Collectively, AI-themed meme coins bootstrapped over $3 billion in market capitalization since October of 2024. Analysts believe this fusion of artificial intelligence and blockchain will fundamentally transform Web3, and allow autonomous AI agents to interact seamlessly with humans in decentralized digital economies.",NEGATIVE,ETH | MATIC | LDO,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MATIC | LDO,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6569/lido-finance-announces-plans-to-shut-down-operations-on-polygon,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

The repurchase, which happened nearly five hours ago, came amid CRV’s ~7.8% 24-hour decline. The transaction by Egorov marked his first significant CRV token buyback since he was liquidated for $140 million in CRV on June 13th. He had suffered a huge CRV liquidation after borrowing stablecoins worth $95.7 million against his CRV assets. Egorov’s CRV acquisition revealed his strategy to strengthen his holdings in the DeFi sector even though the price of CRV had dropped recently. The transaction monitored by Spot On Chain highlighted the CRV market’s current activity and interest. The news was important for the DeFi community because it confirmed that a major player in the CRV project still believed in its future success. Egorov’s actions could likely influence CRV investor perceptions. The Curve founder’s buyback also emphasized the fast-changing nature of the crypto market. It showed that opportunities for quick strategic investments occurred when prices fluctuated rapidly. Curve’s week-on-week growth shows positive trajectory Curve’s weekly yield and ecosystem metric updates as of December 17th showed positive growth. The week-on-week TVL increased by more than 7% to approximately $2.437 billion. The ecosystem also offered various ways to profit, with the annual percentage rate of USD-pegged stablecoins exceeding 50%. According to the December 13th metric updates, one pool surpassed 100% APR. scrvUSD’s introduction continued to strengthen crvUSD’s market position. The week’s metrics as of December 13th demonstrated its impact, as crvUSD expanded 1.85% (~$ $78.22M). Borrowing costs also decreased as the peg moved closer to the $1 mark (~$0.9984). Stable growth with improving fundamentals was not achievable before the implementation of scrvUSD. The scrvUSD yield grew by 1.65% to an APY of 13.09%. Pool statistics also showed that the pool TVL surged 8.41% to $2.18 billion, the volume went up 13.85% to $2.63 billion, transactions increased by 4.55% to 392.4K, and total fees climbed 5.34% to $756.3K. The DAO fees similarly shot up 5.34% to $378.1K. Notable pool activity was observed on two Ethereum pools. The highest-volume pool consisted of DAI, USDC, and USDT, recording a volume of $798.6 million with a TVL of $165.7 million. The second pool consisted of ETH and stETH , with a volume of $234 million and a TVL of $195.9 million. Curve’s ecosystem continued to expand rapidly, welcoming new pools and teams weekly.

37761584,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105408,1734431704,CyberKongz Promises to Fight for NFT Industry After Receiving SEC Wells Notice,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could be planning to bring an enforcement action against popular NFT collection CyberKongz. According to an announcement , the development comes as the securities regulator issued a Wells Notice to the project. https://twitter.com/CyberKongz/status/1868746903053127941A Wells Notice is a form of communication the SEC issues to companies following an investigation, hinting that it may recommend an enforcement action against the recipient. CyberKongz Highlights SEC Misunderstanding of Blockchain According to the post, CyberKongz expressed disappointment with the development, noting that it has suffered in silence since the SEC launched its investigation in 2022. The project emphasized that the SEC demonstrated a lack of understanding of blockchain, which resulted in inaccurate information and unjust accusations. Specifically, the SEC claimed that CyberKongz should have registered with the agency for having a blockchain game alongside an ERC-20 token. Additionally, CyberKongz revealed the SEC misinterpreted its contract migration for Genesis Kong NFTs in April 2021 for a token sale. “If they cannot distinguish between a primary sale and a contract migration, what hope do we currently have for a clear regulatory pathway going forward?” CyberKongz quizzed. CyberKongz to Fight for the NFT Industry Interestingly, CyberKongz plans to defend itself should the SEC decide to file a lawsuit. It promised to fight for regulatory clarity for the NFT sector, irrespective of its small team and limited resources. Furthermore, the project called out the current administration for attempting to push its anti-crypto agenda in its last days in office. It expressed hope for more favorable policies under the forthcoming administration. CyberKongz stands in solidarity with other crypto stakeholders embroiled in similar battles, including Coinbase Co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong and Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams. SEC Aggressive Stance Against Cryptos Could Change SoonFor context, the Gary Gensler-led SEC has been aggressive against cryptos, filing different charges against crypto businesses. This stringent action has also extended to the NFT sector, with projects like Stoner Cats 2 LLC and Impact Theory victimized. While Stoner Cats 2 and Impact Theory have settled with the SEC, some crypto businesses are still engaged in litigation against the regulator. With Gensler expected to resign on January 20, the fate of other ongoing lawsuits remains uncertain. In the meantime, several enthusiasts speculate that the SEC might settle most of the non-fraud crypto-related lawsuits once Paul Atkins, who was recently nominated as SEC Chair, assumes office. Atkins is a pro-crypto advocate and is expected to introduce transparent and fair policies for the sector. SEC Wells Notice Against Crypto Firms Meanwhile, CyberKongz is not the only crypto project that has received a Wells Notice from the U.S. SEC. Last month, the securities agency slapped the NFT project Immutable with a Wells Notice, causing the project’s native token IMX to plunge by 13%. It also issued a Wells Notice to Ethereum developer Consensys earlier this year. The agency subsequently filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging that Consensys violated federal securities laws via its staking service and operated as an unregistered broker-dealer. Notably, Consensys also filed a lawsuit against the SEC, which a Texas court later dismissed in September. Other crypto-related recipients of the SEC Wells Notice include Coinbase in March 2023, Uniswap in April 2024, Robinhood in May 2024, and Crypto.com in August 2024. While the regulator has officially charged Coinbase with operating as an unregistered broker-dealer in the U.S., it has yet to sue Uniswap and Robinhood. Meanwhile, Crypto.com sued the SEC in October 2024 to prevent future enforcement action from the regulator.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | UNI | TOKEN SALE | ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/17/cyberkongz-promises-to-fight-for-nft-industry-after-receiving-sec-wells-notice/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cyberkongz-promises-to-fight-for-nft-industry-after-receiving-sec-wells-notice,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

With a new all-time high, Bitcoin is maintaining dominance above the $106,000 level. The overnight surge marks a bullish breakout, pushing the total crypto market cap to $3.73 trillion.Will this bullish breakout lead to an extended rally to $110,000 for Bitcoin before the end of 2024? Let's explore it.Bitcoin Price AnalysisIn the 4-hour chart, BTC price action shows a bullish breakout from a rising channel pattern. This breakout signals strong buyer momentum, creating a new all-time high of $107,821 and achieving the inverted head-and-shoulders breakout target. However, the bull run is struggling to find a close above the 50% Fibonacci level at $106,912. This level remains a critical resistance point for BTC, acting as a hurdle for further price growth.The MACD and signal lines remain in positive alignment, supporting the possibility of an upside move. This bullish alignment reflects increasing buyer interest.Institutional Buying Boosts MomentumThe ongoing buying spree among top institutions continues to gain momentum despite the relatively slower growth in Bitcoin’s price.U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net daily inflow of $636.85 million, with BlackRock remaining the top purchaser, contributing $418.16 million. Fidelity follows with an inflow of $116.06 million. This highlights the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential.Institutions have now accumulated $120.71 billion worth of Bitcoin, accounting for 5.76% of its market cap. This underscores the significant role institutions are playing in driving demand for Bitcoin.Meanwhile, MicroStrategy purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin yesterday. The development contributed to Bitcon's run to $107K yesterday.BTC Price TargetsBTC’s price action shows a post-retest reversal, gaining momentum from the broken exchange trendline.If BTC manages to close strongly above the 50% Fibonacci level, bulls are eyeing a rally to $110,730, which aligns with the 67.80% Fibonacci level. A breakout above this level could pave the way for even higher targets, potentially continuing the uptrend.On the flip side, a bearish reversal could test the 38.20% Fibonacci level at $103,093.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/17/all-eyes-on-110730-after-bitcoin-sets-new-ath-of-107k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-eyes-on-110730-after-bitcoin-sets-new-ath-of-107k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37761581,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105423,1734431508,Ethereum Supply Distribution Suggests Long-Term Bullish Signal: Santiment,"Market intelligence platform Santiment suggests Ethereum’s institution-dominated supply distribution spells long-term bullish sentiments for the asset. Supply distribution is a crucial tokenomics element for cryptocurrencies. For context, the more evenly distributed an asset is, the less impact its price will suffer from whale selloffs.However, this reality changes when institutions enter the game. A crypto asset with more institutional adoption has long-term security and higher chances of continued uptrends.On this front, data from Santiment has revealed a bullish supply distribution for Ethereum. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has over 57% of its supply locked among institutions, a long-term bullish narrative for the altcoin king.Ethereum Whale Holdings Hit All-Time HighIn a Tuesday tweet , Santiment shared that an exclusive caliber of Ethereum whales has amassed an unprecedented amount of the asset’s supply. Per the data, wallets holding at least 100,000 ETH now command a staggering 57.35% of Ethereum's supply. Consequently, the balances of other Ethereum holders have depreciated considerably. The market intelligence platform pointed out that whales holding between 100 and 100,000 ETH have dropped to their lowest-ever supply control.The whales now hold just 33.46%, losing market share to large high-caliber holders. Meanwhile, retail Ethereum wallets - addresses with less than 100 ETH - have reached a multi-year low. The faction of Ethereum holders now commands just 9.19% of the asset’s supply, their lowest since January 2021. Ethereum Supply Distribution Santiment Shares Market ImplicationFollowing the disclosure, Santiment buttressed the market implications of the distribution shift. The platform noted that the increased stash among high-caliber whales is a long-term bullish signal.Santiment acknowledged that staking platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols control a large portion of Ethereum’s supply. As a result, their continued accumulation suggests that they are locking away more of the asset.Notably, this growing accumulation could create a shock if demand increases. Consequently, a demand shock will spur price upticks, favoring Ethereum investors.Meanwhile, Ethereum has regained bullish momentum amidst sustained inflows from its US spot ETFs. The altcoin king has reclaimed the $4,000 price mark after an 8% weekly uptick.At press time, Ethereum trades at $4,024 with a market cap of $484 billion.",POSITIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/17/ethereum-supply-distribution-suggests-long-term-bullish-signal-santiment/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ethereum-supply-distribution-suggests-long-term-bullish-signal-santiment,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

At the same time, El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, has authorized crypto exchange Bitget to offer Bitcoin-related services, further solidifying its role as a hub for crypto innovation. Bitget Secures Bitcoin Service Provider License in El Salvador, Strengthening Nation’s Crypto Ecosystem Crypto exchange Bitget has achieved a significant milestone by becoming an authorized Bitcoin service provider in El Salvador, further solidifying the Central American nation’s status as a global leader in Bitcoin adoption. The announcement on Dec. 16 confirms that Bitget has secured a Bitcoin Service Provider (BSP) license from El Salvador’s Central Reserve Bank, marking a crucial step for the exchange’s expansion into Latin America. The newly acquired license enables Bitget to offer a wide range of Bitcoin-related services in El Salvador, including fiat-to-Bitcoin currency exchanges, payment services, and secure custody solutions for its growing user base in the country. This development aligns with El Salvador's broader digital asset strategy as the nation continues to embrace Bitcoin as a cornerstone of its financial innovation. While Bitget now holds the BSP license, the exchange is also pursuing a digital asset service provider license from El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets. This additional regulatory approval would allow Bitget to expand its services beyond Bitcoin, enabling the trading of other digital assets and bolstering the country’s position as a regional crypto hub. Min Lin, Bitget’s Chief Business Officer, emphasized the strategic importance of this move, stating, “Latin America holds immense promise as a hub for crypto innovation, and El Salvador stands out as a pioneer with its bold embrace of Bitcoin as legal tender. [...] As the world’s interest in crypto accelerates, we see El Salvador as a gateway to unlocking crypto’s potential.” Bitget’s foray into El Salvador comes at a time when Latin America is emerging as a fertile ground for crypto innovation. El Salvador, in particular, has played a pioneering role since its historic decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021. The nation’s progressive stance has attracted global investors and businesses looking to capitalize on its crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Headquartered in Seychelles, Bitget has rapidly scaled its operations, boasting over 45 million users worldwide. The company has successfully secured licenses in Poland and Lithuania as a Virtual Asset Service Provider ( VASP ), demonstrating its commitment to regulatory compliance in key markets. Additionally, Bitget resumed operations in the United Kingdom in November 2023, following a brief restriction period earlier this year due to local regulatory adjustments. The exchange has also made significant inroads into Vietnam, where it recently established a new subsidiary, reflecting its ambition to capture emerging markets in Asia alongside its strategic expansion in Latin America. Bitget’s entry into El Salvador coincides with the country revisiting its landmark Bitcoin law. Reports indicate that El Salvador is in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $1.3 billion loan. As part of the deal, El Salvador may amend its Bitcoin law to make Bitcoin acceptance by businesses voluntary rather than mandatory. This adjustment signals a balanced approach to promoting Bitcoin adoption while addressing international financial requirements. Despite these changes, El Salvador’s commitment to Bitcoin remains steadfast. The nation has steadily increased its Bitcoin reserves since making the cryptocurrency legal tender. As of Dec. 16, El Salvador holds 6,189 BTC, currently valued at approximately $602 million, according to data from the Nayib Bukele Tracker . Expanding International Collaboration El Salvador’s strategy extends beyond its domestic policies. The government is actively forging international partnerships to promote cryptocurrency adoption on a global scale. Recently, El Salvador signed a mutual collaboration and training agreement with Argentina, focusing on digital assets and knowledge-sharing. This agreement is part of a broader effort to create a unified global approach to crypto regulations and innovation. El Salvador’s outreach continues with discussions involving over 25 countries to establish similar partnerships. Bitget’s entry into El Salvador marks a pivotal moment for both the crypto exchange and the nation. By securing the Bitcoin Service Provider license, Bitget is positioning itself to play a key role in El Salvador’s evolving Bitcoin ecosystem and Latin America’s broader crypto market. As negotiations with the IMF progress and international collaborations expand, El Salvador continues to shape its identity as a trailblazer in Bitcoin adoption and financial innovation. With its growing global user base and strategic regulatory approvals, Bitget’s success in El Salvador may encourage further investments from other crypto businesses, solidifying the country’s role as a hub for Bitcoin and digital assets. Bitcoin Soars to New All-Time High Above $107,700 Amid Explosive Demand and Institutional Buying Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) continued its meteoric rise over the weekend, hitting a new all-time high of $107,700 on Dec. 16. This latest surge comes amid robust spot trading volumes, increasing institutional inflows, and renewed enthusiasm from both US and global markets. The price action saw Bitcoin break through key sell walls between $103,000 and $104,000, catalyzed by significant spot pushes on Binance and surging perpetual futures trading on KuCoin. Traders seized the opportunity to push BTC to record highs, marking another milestone for the leading cryptocurrency as demand continues to skyrocket. A major driver of Bitcoin’s rally has been the return of the Coinbase Premium during the US trading session. This metric, which reflects a price gap favoring the US-based exchange Coinbase, indicates strong demand from institutional and retail investors in the United States. Historically, the presence of a Coinbase Premium has signaled bullish sentiment and buying momentum, as US investors often pay a premium for Bitcoin during surges. This renewed US buying activity builds on the weekend's explosive momentum, where Binance and KuCoin played central roles in driving BTC’s price action. On Dec. 15, the strong perpetual futures volumes on KuCoin coupled with spot buying on Binance helped BTC push decisively past $104,000, triggering a cascade of buy orders that propelled the price higher. Positive institutional news added further fuel to Bitcoin’s price rally. On Dec. 16, two major corporations made significant Bitcoin purchases, suggesting a growing appetite among institutional investors for BTC as a store of value and hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. Semler Scientific, a healthcare company, purchased 211 BTC for $21.5 million, at an average price of $101,890 per coin. MicroStrategy, led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, acquired an additional 15,350 BTC for $1.5 billion, at an average price of $100,386 per coin. These acquisitions point to continued confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. MicroStrategy, which now holds a substantial Bitcoin treasury, has been a key proponent of BTC as a reserve asset. The company’s ongoing accumulation reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a critical asset in corporate balance sheets. Massive Inflows Into Bitcoin ETFs The growing adoption of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has also been a major factor driving Bitcoin’s ascent to new highs. According to data from SoSoValue, the week ending Dec. 12 saw $2.17 billion in net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. These inflows brought the total net assets under management to an impressive $114.97 billion, reflecting a surge in investor demand for regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles. Independent researcher Timothy Peterson attributed Bitcoin’s current trajectory to ETF fund flows, predicting that BTC’s price is on track to hit $115,000 in the near term. According to market analyst Willy Woo, the past month has seen over $3 billion per day flowing into the Bitcoin network. This massive influx highlights the sustained demand for BTC across market participants, driven by institutional adoption, macroeconomic hedging strategies, and investor confidence in Bitcoin as a scarce, deflationary asset. The return of the Bitcoin bull market has reignited enthusiasm among traders and investors, with BTC firmly positioned as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The current momentum has been formed by a convergence of factors, including: Institutional confidence and corporate adoption. Growing demand for regulated investment products like spot Bitcoin ETFs. The return of strong spot trading volumes on major exchanges. Renewed optimism fueled by Bitcoin’s scarcity and its role as digital gold. With Bitcoin’s recent price surge and the sustained inflows into ETFs, analysts predict further upside for BTC in the coming weeks. The $115,000 price level has emerged as a potential near-term target, with institutional demand and growing global adoption acting as key drivers. Bitcoin’s ability to break through psychological resistance levels like $100,000 and $107,000 demonstrates the strength of its upward trajectory. As market conditions remain favorable, BTC appears poised to set new all-time highs, continuing its role as the world’s premier digital asset.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6570/bitget-expands-into-el-salvador-with-bitcoin-service-provider-license,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

MicroStrategy's (MSTR) addition to the Nasdaq-100 index is a big deal, but its potential inclusion in the U.S's S&P 500 index could be an even bigger opportunity in the medium-term, broker Benchmark said in a report Monday.  The index provider announced on Friday that MicroStrategy would be added to the Nasdaq-100 on December 23.  The company founded by Michael Saylor easily meets S&P 500 inclusion criteria in terms of market cap and trading volume, but currently does not meet two other requirements, the report said.  The company needs to report positive earnings for the most recent quarter and ""total positive earnings for the sum of its trailing four consecutive quarters,"" analyst Mark Palmer wrote.  Still, MicroStrategy has said that it plans to adopt new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance for the accounting treatment of bitcoin held on its balance sheet in the first quarter 2025, Benchmark said, and this ""would position it to immediately begin reporting positive earnings.""  MicroStrategy became the first bitcoin company to enter the Nasdaq-100, and will be the 40th largest firm in the index, with a 0.47% weighting, broker Bernstein said in a report on Monday.  How big is the impact?  MicroStrategy entering the Nasdaq-100 is a big milestone for the stock as the fifth largest ETF by assets under management (AUM), the Invesco QQQ Trust Series ETF, will add to the company to its index along with many others.   According to VettaFi data, the three largest ETFs by AUM are all comprised of the S&P 500. These are the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) and iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV). Collectively these three ETFs hold over $1.8 trillion in AUM.  The enormous impact of entering the S&P 500 could be seen with Tesla (TSLA) which saw its stock surge following its inclusion in the index on Dec. 21 2020. The stock doubled in the space of a year from $200 to $400 a share. The lion's share of the gains came before inclusion to the S&P 500, which saw the stock run up 10-fold from December 2019.

37754272,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52390,1734431182,Analyst Sets Short Term Targets at $5.85 and $8.76,"Well-known crypto analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) recently provided an updated analysis of XRP’s price movement, emphasizing key bullish signals observed in the four-hour chart. This update builds upon his analysis of December 13, which highlighted XRP’s position at the apex of a Bull Flag pattern . The latest insights suggest potential upward momentum for the asset as it approaches critical resistance levels. Hey there, my friends! I hope you all are fine! 4-hour time frame has a confirmation of the break. The daily frame will be confirmed above $2.52. #XRP will then watch $2.72. Short Term Targets: $5.85 $8.76 Supports: $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, $2.02 #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/3SbLXTojo0 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 15, 2024 Breakout Confirmation on the 4-Hour Chart Dark Defender’s chart illustrates that XRP has confirmed a breakout above the descending trendline in the four-hour timeframe. This development is accompanied by bullish signals on the Ichimoku Cloud, with the price consolidating above key support levels. The analyst also pointed to a Relative Strength Index (RSI) golden cross, a signal that often indicates increasing bullish momentum. While the four-hour timeframe has confirmed the breakout, Dark Defender highlighted the importance of a daily close above $2.52 to validate the larger bullish trend. If this confirmation materializes, XRP could target $2.72 as its next resistance level. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Short-Term Targets and Key Supports Looking beyond $2.72, the analyst outlined ambitious short-term targets of $5.85 and $8.76, with $5.85 being a crucial level that the analyst has predicted previously. These targets suggest the possibility of a significant rally if the asset maintains its bullish trajectory. However, Dark Defender also identified critical support levels that traders should monitor closely. These levels include $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02. Maintaining these supports is crucial for sustaining upward momentum, as a breach could invalidate the bullish outlook. Can XRP Breach the Crucial Resistance Level? The Ichimoku Cloud analysis shows a bullish signal, with the price breaking above the cloud and the overall trend indicating upward movement. Additionally, the RSI golden cross further reinforces the bullish sentiment, signaling that momentum is shifting in favor of buyers. Such technical indicators often serve as confirmation for traders looking to capitalize on potential price surges. While the analysis highlights a positive outlook for XRP, the digital asset has yet to breach the $2.52 level specified by Dark Defender. At press time, XRP traded at $2.60, with a 24-hour increase of 10%. However, many bullish predictions suggest the digital asset will soon experience a significant upward surge.

Despite overall strength and multiple exceptionally bullish forecasts , the token also gave some cause for concern as it, on December 17, reached something of a top near $2.50. Indeed, it took XRP approximately three weeks to climb from $0.50 to $2.70, but has subsequently corrected and has been trading near $2.50 for about two weeks and is, at press time, changing hands at $2.48. XRP YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Considering the recent rally, the current stagnation, analyst optimism, and investor hopes, Finbold consulted X’s GrokAI on whether there will be a further XRP rally in 2024 or if the current top will prove sticky for the token . Grok sets XRP price target for December 31, 2024 In its reply. Grok proved quick to assess XRP and the recent associated developments positively, though it also cautioned about volatility for the token and the broader cryptocurrency market . The artificial intelligence ( AI ) model also noted that much of XRP’s price action has been driven by significant news, such as the recent developments in the legal battle against Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and within the SEC itself. Grok assesses the state of XRP. Source: Finbold & GrokAI Ultimately, however, Grok opted for a conservative price target as it explained it wanted to factor in the recent momentum and developments but not discount volatility and elements such as historical resistance levels . Therefore, the AI explained that it considers $2.50 the most plausible forecast for the year’s end. Grok provided its XRP price target for December 31, 2024. Source: Finbold & GrokAI When challenged that such a price target amounts to stagnation for XRP, Grok reasoned that most of the token’s big jumps were driven by external developments – and that there are no guarantees there will be more of these events in the remaining weeks of 2024. The AI added that once this outside influence is accounted for and resistance levels and market volatility are factored in, stagnation until at least the start of 2025 becomes the most reasonable if conservative, scenario. Grok AI justifies its ‘conservative’ XRP price target. Source: Finbold & GrokAI Why January 2025 might renew XRP’s bull run While $2.50 is considered a reasonable price target for GrokAI, it is worth pointing out that January 2025 might cause another significant rally. Specifically, Gary Gensler – the controversial SEC Chair – is set to resign and be replaced by, most likely, the crypto-friendly Paul Atkins. Though XRP already rallied on the confirmation Gensler would be resigning, the token is likely to surge again once the good news turns into reality.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Ripple's newly launched stablecoin, RLUSD, has been a subject of discussion in the XRP community following its debut on four exchange partners. The launch came shortly after Ripple secured regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). While many market participants expressed enthusiasm about the stablecoin, some misunderstood its role, expecting price volatility that could create profits. However, experts have explained why RLUSD will always remain pegged at $1.RLUSD Will Maintain Its $1 PriceVet, a prominent XRPL validator, recently addressed these misconceptions. In a disclosure on X, Vet pointed out the mechanism behind RLUSD's stability. Notably, he stressed that it ensures the price constantly aligns with $1. https://twitter.com/Vet_X0/status/1868610967333896522This mechanism revolves around Ripple's minting and redemption process. Vet explained that if RLUSD trades significantly above $1, say $589, market participants would immediately capitalize on this. Institutions would mint RLUSD directly from Ripple at a 1:1 dollar conversion and sell it for profit. This selling activity would create immense sell pressure, driving RLUSD back to its intended price of $1. Conversely, if RLUSD trades below $1, such as at $0.589, buyers would seize the opportunity to purchase it at a discount. They could then redeem it with Ripple for its full $1 value. The resulting buy pressure would force RLUSD's price upward until it stabilizes at $1. Notably, this self-correcting mechanism guarantees that RLUSD remains anchored to the dollar unless Ripple's minting and redemption system experiences disruptions. The efficiency of this system is paramount, especially considering previous cases of stablecoin depegs like the one involving TerraUSD (UST).Vet noted that the mechanism forms the backbone of RLUSD's stability. The minting and redemption capability ensures no prolonged deviation from the $1 peg. As a result, those seeking quick profits through volatility must understand that RLUSD is not an investment vehicle but a reliable stablecoin. Previously, Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently stressed this fact, issuing a warning to market participants who would want to FOMO into the project for this reason. RLUSD Could Boost Liquidity for XRPMeanwhile, Schwartz also discussed the benefits of stablecoin following the launch announcement. He emphasized that the stablecoin will enhance on-chain liquidity while expanding use cases for both RLUSD and XRP. https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/1868692620840710265According to him, the introduction of a trusted stablecoin like RLUSD will boost development and adoption on the XRPL network. Notable XRP community figure WrathofKahneman (WOK) also spotlighted this. He highlighted how RLUSD's benefits extend beyond burning XRP. According to him, the stablecoin's benefits lie in significantly boosting liquidity on the XRPL. This increased liquidity makes XRP more functional as a bridge currency and allows seamless value transfer between various assets. WOK noted that RLUSD's impact could grow further as new denominations emerge. With additional currencies making their way to the XRPL, bridging between these assets and XRP will become simpler and more efficient. This utility strengthens XRP's value proposition as a source of liquidity on demand. According to WOK, while the XRP price may see short-term upward movement due to RLUSD's launch, this increase would reflect market sentiment rather than RLUSD's direct usage. At press time, XRP trades for $2.57, up 7.33% over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/17/heres-how-ripple-stablecoin-will-maintain-its-1-price-while-schwartz-says-rlusd-will-boost-liquidity-for-xrp/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-ripple-stablecoin-will-maintain-its-1-price-while-schwartz-says-rlusd-will-boost-liquidity-for-xrp,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

With unique advancements, high growth potential, and active market presence, these projects are among the best cryptos to buy now . Here’s an in-depth look at their latest developments and why they deserve your attention. Qubetics: Empowering Privacy and Decentralization with dVPN Integration Qubetics continues to push the boundaries of blockchain innovation by integrating a decentralised VPN (dVPN) into its ecosystem.

XRP: Soaring on Regulatory Optimism and SEC Developments XRP has been on a tear lately, fueled by significant political and regulatory news. The token saw a massive surge following Donald Trump’s election win last month and gained even more momentum after SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his upcoming resignation, effective January 20, 2025. This announcement has reignited hopes for regulatory clarity around XRP, opening the door for U.S.-listed spot XRP ETFs. XRP has also reclaimed its early 2018 highs, signalling renewed investor confidence and speculation about a possible parabolic rally similar to its performance in 2017. A widely-followed analyst, CryptoWZRD, recently compared XRP’s current price trajectory to its historic bull run, forecasting another surge in the near future. As the market awaits further developments on regulatory clarity and potential ETF launches, XRP stands poised for continued growth, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now for investors seeking exposure to large-cap cryptocurrencies with bullish momentum. Sui: Dominating DeFi with Rapid Expansion Sui, a Layer 1 blockchain, has been making headlines with its rapid expansion and remarkable performance. Up 626% year-to-date and 47% in the last month, Sui has proven itself as a major contender in the DeFi space. Recent highlights include: Staking and Lending Growth: Sui’s partnership and airdrop for SEND , a staking and lending platform, have positioned it as a DeFi powerhouse. Record-Breaking DEX Volume: Sui’s decentralised exchange (DEX) achieved a total trading volume of $32 trillion , with $466 million traded in just 24 hours. Seamless Onboarding: To simplify blockchain adoption, Sui now supports FDUSD stablecoin transfers directly from Binance , enhancing accessibility for new users. Partnerships: Sui has partnered with Phantom Wallet and Backpack , a wallet and exchange platform that processed an impressive $60 trillion in volume in its first year. Sui’s dedication to scalability, DeFi, and user onboarding makes it one of the best cryptos to buy now, particularly for those seeking exposure to high-growth blockchain ecosystems. Conclusion: A Bright Outlook for Blockchain Investments As the cryptocurrency market evolves, projects like Qubetics, XRP, and Sui are at the forefront of driving innovation and adoption. Whether it’s Qubetics’ focus on privacy and decentralisation, XRP’s regulatory-driven momentum, or Sui’s dominance in the DeFi space, these cryptocurrencies offer compelling growth opportunities. For investors looking to capitalise on the next wave of blockchain advancements, these are the best cryptos to buy now , offering a mix of innovation, utility, and potential returns.

Algorand at a crucial price level While cryptocurrencies exhibit bullish trends, Algorand trades at a make-or-break level. The altcoin changes hands at $0.4200 after losing 1.50% the previous week. Source – Coinmarketcap The $0.40 mark remains vital for ALGO’s performance as a previous demand region. The value area witnessed a massive rebound in late November, confirming its reputation. Meanwhile, the latest decline from $0.61 suggests a potential support retest. Stability above $0.40 is crucial for bounce-backs past the $0.43 hurdle. That would open the gates for more gains in the upcoming times. Increasing selling activities could plunge Algorand to $0.33 – a 27% dip from current prices.

37752744,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628784,1734430449,Argentina is officially out of recession – Here’s all Milei did,"Argentina’s economy has reportedly survived an impending severe recession in the third quarter of 2024, in what economists have described as a milestone for libertarian President Javier Milei. Since taking office, Milei has been forwarding an ambitious agenda to stabilize the nation’s long-running economic crisis. According to data from Argentina’s statistics agency released on December 16, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 3.9% in seasonally adjusted terms between July and September compared to the previous quarter. The growth marks the first positive quarter since late 2023, when the economy officially fell into recession. However, on an annual basis, GDP contracted 2.1% in the third quarter when compared to the same period in 2023. The rebound comes as Milei approaches his one-year mark in office. His administration has undertaken aggressive spending cuts and wide-ranging deregulatory measures aimed at curbing triple-digit inflation and reviving investor confidence. Argentina's President Javier Milei has dramatically cut govt employee headcount and regulations in the past year since he was elected. As a result, inflation is falling rapidly and the economy is turning around. Now with more stability, investors are returning to Argentina. pic.twitter.com/jwR0gd8Xco — Wall Street Mav (@WallStreetMav) December 4, 2024 These policies have drawn praise from high-profile figures such as US President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, positioning Milei as one of the global right’s most-liked leaders. President Milei’s market and economic impact Argentina’s sovereign bonds climbed in response to the GDP report. The spread over U.S. Treasuries that investors demand to hold Argentine debt fell 4.4% to 677 basis points on Monday, a stark improvement from levels exceeding 2,000 basis points when Milei assumed office. The broader economic crisis , largely attributed to years of inflation-fueled money printing under administrations that led previously, deepened in the early months of Milei’s presidency. Austerity measures and soaring inflation led to a sharp rise in poverty, with rates increasing 11 percentage points to 53% in the first half of 2024. Despite this, signs of a fragile recovery are emerging as the government moves into 2025. 📊🇦🇷 Argentina’s economy grows 3.9% in Q3, still down yearly Argentina’s GDP grew 3.9% in Q3 compared to Q2, marking its first quarterly expansion since 2023's recession, though it contracted 2.1% year-on-year, better than analysts' expectations of a 2.6% decline. The recovery… pic.twitter.com/DDfaS7POkY — PiQ (@PiQSuite) December 16, 2024 The recent economic expansion has been supported by a rebound in consumer spending and capital investment, both recovering from steep declines earlier in the year. Argentina’s agriculture and mining exports also posted strong gains, buoying overall output. However, key sectors such as manufacturing and construction remain deeply depressed. 2025 Argentina’s economic outlook Even though Milei has seemingly given the country hope that it will recover from economic hurdles, analysts remain cautious. JPMorgan projects Argentina’s economy will contract by 3% for the entirety of 2024 but forecasts a rebound with 5.2% growth in 2025. JPMorgan’s proposed level of expansion would bring per capita GDP back to where it stood in 2021 when the economy was recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Economists surveyed by Argentina’s central bank share similar sentiments, predicting a 3% contraction for 2024 but anticipating 4.2% growth next year. Analysts emphasize the need for sustained economic improvement to lift living standards and bolster Milei’s position ahead of crucial midterm elections in late 2025. Argentina will be one of the fastest-growing economies in 2025, offsetting the entire slump inherited from Peronism. According to Bloomberg Economics. @JMilei pic.twitter.com/wzCofEX684 — Daniel Lacalle (@dlacalle_IA) December 11, 2024 Milei’s policies have begun to shift public and financial sentiment. Wages have outpaced inflation since April 2024, job growth has gradually resumed, and private estimates indicate poverty rates are now declining after their mid-year peak. Additionally, Argentine citizens deposited over $20 billion into the financial system throughout 2024, spurred by Milei’s tax amnesty program. This move is seen as a significant indicator of confidence in the president’s economic vision. In the longer term, Milei’s pro-business reforms are drawing foreign investment commitments, particularly in Argentina’s energy sector . However, economists caution that substantial foreign capital inflows may be delayed until the president fulfills his pledge to lift inherited currency and capital controls, a step Milei has promised to take in 2025. Currency reforms and Bitcoin adoption Looking ahead, President Milei has outlined several major policy initiatives for 2025, including free currency circulation and tax reforms aimed at overhauling the country’s financial framework. Under the proposed measures, Argentines would be able to conduct transactions in any currency, including Bitcoin (BTC), a policy designed to enhance financial freedom and flexibility. In June 2024, the president strongly advocated for unrestricted currency competition and greater Bitcoin adoption , echoing policies seen in El Salvador while tailoring them to Argentina’s unique economic conditions. The government had previously legalized contracts in Bitcoin in 2023, marking an early step toward crypto integration. Ricardo Mihura, President of ONG Bitcoin Argentina, welcomed Milei’s push for deregulation but highlighted lingering barriers to crypto adoption. “ For a year now, there has been talk of free circulation, but it’s not true that there is real free competition between fiat currencies and Bitcoin . When you trade with dollars or euros, exchange rate differences with the peso are not subject to income tax, whereas with Bitcoin, they are. This significantly increases costs, deters, and complicates the use of Bitcoin as a currency, ” Mihura said. Despite criticisms, Milei has been persistent in adopting crypto and believes it is a key element of Argentina’s economic transformation. His broader tax reform proposal, which aims to reduce 90% of national taxes and shift tax-setting power to individual provinces, seeks to decentralize economic decision-making and alleviate financial pressures on citizens.

Here Are the Details,"Michael Egorov, founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance, has conducted a large-scale CRV token buyback for the first time since the June 13 liquidation, according to on-chain data analytics platform Spot On Chain. Curve Finance Founder Michael Egorov Purchases $1.2 Million in CRV Tokens Following June Termination Egorov reportedly purchased 1.08 million CRV tokens at an average price of $1,114 over the past three hours, bringing the total value to around $1.2 million. This marks a notable move for the Curve founder following the events of June 13, when Egorov faced a series of forced liquidations due to his heavy debt positions in various lending protocols. The incident has raised concerns in the DeFi space as CRV’s price volatility threatens broader market stability. CRV, Curve Finance’s native governance token, is a critical asset within the DeFi ecosystem, serving as the backbone for liquidity pools and incentives in the protocol. Egorov’s recent purchase signals renewed confidence in CRV and Curve Finance’s long-term outlook. The buyback comes amid an ongoing recovery in the broader cryptocurrency market, with analysts closely monitoring CRV’s price action and market activity for potential shifts in investor sentiment. Market participants will now observe whether Egorov’s strategic move will help stabilize CRV’s price or generate more interest in the token as DeFi platforms continue their resurgence. *This is not investment advice.

The team emphasized the significance of this move, highlighting the limited tools available to analyze the Dogecoin blockchain despite its 11-year existence. With Arkham’s features, users will soon be able to visualize and monitor Dogecoin’s blockchain activity, trace transactions, filter data, and set real-time alerts. This addition expands Arkham’s supported networks to 16, allowing Dogecoin users to examine specific wallet activity and monitor addresses tied to exchanges, funds, and notable individuals.Dogecoin’s Cultural Legacy and AdoptionDogecoin’s cultural relevance extends beyond the crypto industry. According to Arkham, the coin, inspired by the Japanese Shiba Inu dog Kabosu—who passed away earlier this year—has achieved widespread recognition. The team also notes how the crypto has garnered attention from prominent figures like Elon Musk , who briefly replaced X’s (formerly Twitter) logo with the Doge icon after acquiring the platform. Additionally, the team highlights how Tesla began accepting Dogecoin as payment for merchandise, furthering its visibility in mainstream markets. Interestingly, the acronym DOGE now coincides with the U.S. Government’s Department of Government Efficiency, a satirical nod to its cultural prominence.Critical Vulnerability Causes Node CollapseWhile Arkham expands Dogecoin’s analytical reach, the network recently faced a vulnerability exploit. A Bitcoin sidechain developer, Andreas Kohl, claimed responsibility for a hack that supposedly disabled 69% of Dogecoin nodes by exploiting a vulnerability dubbed “DogeReaper.”This flaw relies on a segmentation fault in the network’s code, which causes abrupt program termination when unauthorized memory is accessed. However, despite the dramatic claim, the Dogecoin network remained operational, raising doubts about the accuracy of the report.Prominent Dogecoin community member “Mishaboar” quickly refuted the developer’s assertion, explaining that the DogeReaper vulnerability had already been identified and patched two weeks earlier in a node update adopted by key participants such as miners and exchanges.Mishaboar also questioned the validity of the data used to support the hack, noting that Blockchair’s reported node drop—from 647 to 205—was not comprehensive.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | ARKM,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/17/arkham-integrates-dogecoin-analytics-enhancing-on-chain-insights-for-users/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=arkham-integrates-dogecoin-analytics-enhancing-on-chain-insights-for-users,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37752451,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52387,1734429746,Top Shareholder Calls SBI Holdings to Initiate XRP Buyback. Here’s the Benefit,"In a significant development for the cryptocurrency and financial sectors, GAM Global Special Situations Fund, a Swiss independent investment manager, has called upon SBI Holdings, a key Japanese financial group, to adopt a transparent and active approach toward its blockchain and XRP-related investments. Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba), a prominent crypto figure, shared GAM’s open letter on X. The letter, dated December 3, 2024, suggests an XRP buyback program as part of a broader strategy to align SBI’s market value with its net asset value (NAV). Recommendations for SBI The letter emphasizes that SBI Holdings is undervalued, highlighting that its XRP holdings alone are valued at JPY 1.6 trillion, surpassing the company’s entire market capitalization of JPY 1.2 trillion. GAM suggests a strategy similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused approach in the U.S. that could significantly boost SBI’s market perception and shareholder value. The fund managers also argue that clearer communication about XRP holdings and strategic actions like a buyback program, could close the gap between SBI’s market value and net asset value, estimated at JPY 3.9 trillion. GAM also calls for increased transparency, including regular updates on the value of SBI’s XRP holdings and a detailed outline of its blockchain strategy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SBI Japan’s Relationship with XRP SBI Japan has long been a staunch advocate of Ripple and XRP as an investor and partner in various blockchain initiatives. SBI Remit, a subsidiary of the crypto-focused SBI branch in Japan SBI VC Trade, has adopted XRP as a bridge currency for its remittance services in The Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The company has also shown support for XRP multiple times. Given this background, the proposal from GAM Investments aligns closely with SBI’s historical support for Ripple’s ecosystem. However, it also represents a bold step forward, as an extensive XRP buyback program would signal an even deeper commitment to the asset’s role in SBI’s overall corporate strategy. Potential Implications for XRP If SBI Japan proceeds with an XRP buyback program, the impact on the token’s market dynamics could be significant. Such a move would likely increase demand for XRP, potentially driving up its market price. Furthermore, SBI’s public endorsement of XRP through a high-profile investment would reinforce the asset’s credibility in the eyes of institutional investors. Additionally, this strategy could lead to broader adoption of XRP in financial markets, as it would highlight its value proposition as a powerful digital asset for cross-border transactions. This would align with Ripple’s ongoing efforts to position XRP as a key player in global remittance and liquidity solutions.

37752200,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663084,1734429643,Bitcoin Top Here? What Historical HODLer Selloff Pattern Says,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin long-term holders are selling. Here’s whether the current level of selloff is enough for a price top or not. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Selling Big Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about the historical trend in the holdings of the long-term holders relative to the Bitcoin top. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days. The LTHs represent one of the two main divisions of the BTC market done on the basis of holding time, with the other group being known as the short-term holders (STHs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Now In Selling Mode For A Year: Should You Be Concerned? Historically, the latter cohort has proven to contain the weak hands of the market, while the former is made up of the HODLers who barely react to rallies and crashes in the price. As such, selling from the STHs is usually not of any note, but that from the LTHs can be, as it’s not a particularly common event. One way to keep track of the behavior of the diamond hands is through their Net Position Change. The Net Position Change is an on-chain metric that measures the total amount of Bitcoin entering into or exiting out of the LTH cohort. Below is the chart for the indicator shared by the analyst that shows the trend in its value over the history of the cryptocurrency. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTH Net Position Change has witnessed a sharp decline into the negative territory in recent weeks, which implies a net amount of supply has been leaving the cohort. This isn’t the first time this year that the indicator has shown this trend, as something similar was also observed back during the first quarter of this year. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted this and the other older instances of this trend occurring. It would seem that the major selloffs from the LTHs have generally coincided with some sort of top in the cryptocurrency. “Interestingly, in 2017 and 2021, their biggest sell-offs occurred right before the final leg up,” notes the analyst. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives Market Heating Up Again: Brace For Impact? Thus, if the current bull market is going to show anything similar, then it’s possible that the current LTH selloff may in fact only be the start of that final leg up that’s going to lead to the cyclical top for Bitcoin. The indicator is also currently not as negative as during the largest red spikes of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, which could be another indication that the top isn’t in just yet. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the same pattern would repeat this time as well or not. BTC Price Bitcoin is back in all-time high (ATH) discovery mode as its price has just set a new record above the $107,000 milestone.

This could be boosted further by the approval of an Ripple XRP ETF, paving the way for greater institutional involvement in the crypto market . With market conditions shifting, both DTX and XRP could see significant gains. In this article, we will discuss the possible outcomes and what it means for investors and the future of crypto. Crucial SEC Vote on Caroline Crenshaw Could Impact Ripple Lawsuit and XRP Future The vote on SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s reappointment is scheduled for Wednesday, December 18, according to Fox Business. Congress will adjourn for the year on Friday, December 20. If Crenshaw is not reappointed, former President Trump could nominate a new Commissioner. Crenshaw’s renomination has received a lot of attention. She is one of the three Democratic Commissioners at the SEC and voted against allowing Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs. The SEC also has an important case in the Ripple (XRP) lawsuit. The SEC must file its opening brief for the appeal by January 15. If Crenshaw is reappointed, the three Democrats at the SEC will likely vote to continue with the appeal. This could lead to more selling pressure on XRP, but some investors hope the SEC will eventually drop the appeal. If the SEC does drop the appeal, it could be a big win for Ripple (XRP) and the broader U.S. digital asset market. This would make the court ruling in July 2023, which found that Programmatic Sales of Ripple do not count as securities, even more important. Ripple’s Strong Outlook: XRP ETF, Market Gains, and Big Hopes for DTX Exchange Ripple (XRP) is currently around $1.30, and many people expect an XRP ETF to launch soon. Ripple’s CEO, Garlinghouse, believes an XRP ETF in the US is likely, especially after the Bitwise Physical XRP ETF was launched for European investors. The news about RLUSD being approved is still spreading, and investors are preparing for more updates. XRP’s price increased by 3% over the week, but its market volume dropped by 23%, now at $9.13 billion. Ripple is becoming one of the most promising cryptocurrencies this year, with more developments and use cases. Many investors who made gains from XRP are now putting their money into the new DTX Exchange ICO, hoping for big returns, with some expecting a 1000x growth by Q1 2025. DTX Exchange: A Leading Presale Token of the Year DTX Exchange (DTX) is the most popular presale token this year. It is built on a strong and creative platform that offers many features, such as the non-custodial Phoenix Wallet, 1000x leverage, and the VulcanX hybrid blockchain. These features make DTX Exchange a powerful player in the crypto trading world. DTX Exchange combines the best parts of centralized and decentralized exchanges, giving users the advantages of both. Key Features The platform is designed to be easy to use and includes privacy features like a no-KYC registration process. This makes it ideal for investors who want to trade without revealing their identities. Hybrid Trading Platform: Powered by the VulcanX blockchain, combining features of both centralized and decentralized exchanges for a smooth trading experience. Wide Asset Access: Offers 120,000 assets, including stocks, forex, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies, allowing investors to manage all their trading in one place. Increased Visibility: Listing on CoinMarketCap has boosted DTX’s visibility and credibility, helping the Ethereum-based altcoin gain traction. Strong Early Success: DTX Exchange’s presale has raised over $10.3 million with more than 300,000 registered wallet addresses. Future Growth Potential: Analysts predict that the Ethereum altcoin could 50x in the long run. DTX is currently in Stage 6 of its public presale, priced at $0.12.

With the sluggish price action, a portion of the market participants had turned uncertain about the next price action. However, the latest rise in the prices revives the hopes for a new ATH, which may not be before the end of 2024 but certainly in early 2025 Ethereum is known to closely follow Bitcoin, as it did during the 2021 bull or before. The top two tokens surged with the same intensity, dominating a major portion of the volume and marking new ATH side-by-side. However, the current trade setup and price action suggest the second-largest token may have become independent. One of the major reasons is said to be the spot ETH ETF inflows, which accelerated after the U.S. election results. However, the whales seem to have been preparing for the rise much before, as they constantly increased their positions, which have reached levels not seen since 2017. The data from Santiment shows a rise in wallets that at least hold 100K ETH, which holds 57.35% of the whole Ethereum supply. To be precise, there are 104 whale wallets, holding at least 100K Ethereum. On the other hand, the wallets with ETH holding between 100 and 100K and below 100 were constantly declining and have reached the lowest point at 33.46% & 9.19%, respectively. This flashes a strong bullish signal for the long term, where the whales hold the highest portion of the supply. What’s Next for the ETH Price Rally? When Can We Expect a New ATH? The historic ETH price rally suggests the token is at the stage where BTC was during the start of the quarter. The token broke the consolidation and launched a nearly 60% rise, marking a new ATH very close to $108K. Therefore, if the ETH price replicates a similar breakout, the ATH could be much higher than $5000. The weekly chart of ETH suggests the price has reached the crucial resistance and a rise from these levels may help the token enter the final resistance zone before the ATH. The Ichimoku cloud has turned bullish with the conversion & base line undergoing a bullish crossover, validating the upcoming rise. As per data from Intotheblock, a total of 7.2 million ETH were bought just below $4000, which is expected to stabilize the levels above the range. With this, the Ethereum (ETH) price appears to be poised to launch a massive bullish attack, aiming to form new highs probably before the end of 2024.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-breaking-above-the-threshold-heres-only-when-it-may-form-a-new-ath-in-2024/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37752093,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628767,1734429251,How AI is redefining US-China trade war,"The US-China trade war has a new battleground, and it’s built on silicon. At the center of the fight is the semiconductor industry—a $600 billion sector driving everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence (AI). For the last two years, American chip stocks have been riding a euphoric AI boom. Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, and Micron are reaping the rewards as artificial intelligence skyrockets demand for advanced chips. The toolmakers that build the machines to produce these chips (Lam Research, Applied Materials, and KLA) have been right there with them. But this is where the AI hype crashes into politics. The Biden administration’s campaign to shut China out of the semiconductor race has created chaos in supply chains, reshaped global sales, and triggered a geopolitical struggle over technology. It started in October 2022 when Washington banned the export of the most advanced chips and manufacturing tools to Chinese companies linked to the government. Then came October 2023 when Washington tightened the rules, closing loopholes and limiting sales to Chinese data centers. Earlier this month, the crackdown went further, pulling US allies into the effort and locking out major Chinese buyers. US chip restrictions hit hard, but China saw it coming The bans have teeth. Chinese companies can’t buy the cutting-edge tools needed to produce high-performance chips. For Beijing, it’s a nightmare. China’s ambitions to lead the world in AI, 5G, and advanced tech depend on these chips. But the US, along with the Netherlands and Japan, has slammed the door shut. Beijing didn’t sit still. Anticipating the bans, Chinese buyers stocked up on older-generation tools throughout 2024. Data shows a massive jump in Chinese purchases of so-called “trailing-edge” equipment—older but still functional technology that can produce less advanced chips. Toolmakers face long-term risk as China pushes for independence There’s another problem. These bans may unintentionally push China to build its own semiconductor industry. For years, China has relied on foreign companies to supply chipmaking tools. Now, locked out of the advanced tech market, Beijing has no choice but to develop its own. Some analysts believe that this could be a long-term threat to US and European toolmakers. But others argue that global demand for chips will keep toolmakers afloat, regardless of geography. For toolmakers, the focus is on meeting global demand, not the politics of where the chips are made. Lam Research CFO Douglas Bettinger confirmed this, saying , “Investment in China this year was pretty very strong.” But he also acknowledged a slowdown ahead. The geopolitical pressure is unlikely to let up. If Trump returns to the White House, his trade policies could escalate tensions even further. Trump’s team of China hawks is ready to revive hardline strategies, and tariffs could be back on the table. Beijing knows this. Xi Jinping has already reached out with messages of cooperation, but he’s also drawn clear lines in the sand. During the November APEC summit, Xi warned Biden against crossing China’s “four red lines”: Taiwan, human rights, China’s political system, and its right to development. The stakes are super high too. Last week, China conducted its largest naval exercises around the Taiwan Strait in 30 years. It was a warning shot. Beijing sees Taiwan as its territory, and any US interference could trigger further retaliation.

According to blockchain analytics platform Santiment , the top 104 whale wallets, each holding over 100,000 ETH, collectively control around $333 billion worth of Ether. The accumulation trend among these large holders suggests growing confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Mid-Sized Holders Drop to Record Low While the share of ETH controlled by whales has risen, mid-sized holders (wallets with 10 to 100,000 ETH) have seen their portion drop to a record low of 33.5%. Smaller wallets holding less than 100 ETH now account for just 9.19% of the total supply, marking a near four-year low. According to Santiment, this concentration of wealth could indicate that large players are positioning themselves for future gains. “With the caveat that the #2 market cap is increasingly comprised of DeFi and staking wallets, it is still generally a bullish long-term signal when a coin’s most prominent key stakeholders continue accumulating,” the firm wrote. “Especially when it’s a 9 year-old asset with whales holding their highest ever portion of coins.” There are currently 104 whale wallets holding at least 100K Ethereum. Their combined holdings currently sit at 57.35% of all existing ETH tokens, currently worth ~$333.1B. Meanwhile, wallets with 100-100K hold their lowest ratio of supply in history, 33.46%. And sub-100 ETH… pic.twitter.com/9qDN3lotQy — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 17, 2024 The development comes as Ethereum’s daily average of new wallet addresses hit 130,200 in December, the highest in eight months. The surge in user activity coincides with Ether’s price recovery, as it reclaimed the $4,000 mark on December 7 for the first time since March. ETH is currently trading at approximately $4,007, although it remains 17% below its all-time high of $4,891 reached on November 16, 2021. Market analysts believe that Ethereum could surpass its all-time high in early 2025, fueled in part by the broader crypto market’s deleveraging in November. “Bullish narratives are once again emerging,” said Santiment, pointing to both Ethereum’s price recovery and Bitcoin’s record-setting surge above $100,000 as key drivers of market sentiment. The growing dominance of whale wallets raises questions about market control and centralization. While large holders’ actions often influence market trends, proponents argue that their continued accumulation signals strong confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Critics, however, warn that increased whale dominance could reduce market liquidity and exacerbate volatility. Ethereum Surpasses Tron as Top Blockchain for Tether Last month, Ethereum reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether (USDT), surpassing Tron with a supply of $60.3 billion. It marked Ethereum’s return to dominance for the first time since August 2022. Ethereum solidified its lead on November 21, and the gap widened on November 23 when Tether minted $2 billion USDT on Ethereum compared to $1 billion on Tron. Other blockchains in the USDT supply rankings include BNB Chain ($4.58 billion), Arbitrum ($3.09 billion), and Avalanche ($1.31 billion). Tether maintains its position as the largest stablecoin globally, with a market capitalization of $132.3 billion. It is followed by Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) at $39 billion. Ethereum also dominates USDC circulation, holding $26.3 billion or 67.5% of its supply.

37754439,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319972,1734428870,Analysts Eye $160K Bitcoin as Global Monetary Policies Ease: Could a ‘Santa Rally’ be the Trigger?,"The U.S. Fed rate cuts have bolstered bullish end-of-year projections for Bitcoin , with analysts eyeing a Bitcoin Santa rally poised to send the asset to a $160K valuation. Most recently, on December 12th, the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its key interest rates by 25 basis points to 3% in an effort to increase investment and economic activity in the region. This followed The People’s Bank of China, which cut its benchmark one-year lending rate by 40 basis points to 5.6 % on November 21st, the first rate cut in over two years. While these events did bolster Bitcoin’s ascent to $100K, the U.S. economy is likely to be the biggest driver of market sentiment towards the end of the year. The CME Fedwatch tool currently places the odds of a December 0.25% interest rate cut at a decisive 97.1%, up from 82.5% the month prior. Analysts Set Fed-Fuelled $160,000 Bitcoin Target The continuation of global monetary policy easing aligns with a recent Maxiport report , which projects Bitcoin reaching $160,000 by 2025. #MatrixOnTarget Report – Dec 13: #Bitcoin 2025 Target: $160,000 #Matrixport #Crypto #cryptomarket #MarketWatch #CryptoInvestors #BTC pic.twitter.com/hAjFPdq87U — Matrixport Official (@Matrixport_EN) December 13, 2024 Interest rate cuts typically drive investors toward risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, as traditional investments become less appealing, paving the way for significant market gains. A factor Maxiport anticipates will drive the Bitcoin price into 2025, with “sustained demand for Bitcoin ETFs, the evolution of the macroeconomic environment, and the expanding global liquidity pool.” This trend is expected to push Bitcoin to what the report describes as a “critical adoption milestone,” surpassing the 8% adoption threshold by 2025. Maxiport likens this potential milestone to the rapid adoption of mobile phones and social media, which experienced exponential growth driven by network effects and broader accessibility after reaching the 8% mark. Maxiport also suggests that this adoption milestone will bring greater resilience to Bitcoin, differentiating it from past cycles as crypto “matures.” “Market dynamics are shifting. Unlike past cycles characterized by sharp 80% drawdowns, Bitcoin’s growing base of dip buyers and institutional support reduces the likelihood of severe corrections,” the report states. Analysts Caution Bitcoin Santa Rally: Could it Be the Trigger? This potential 60% rally going into 2025 aligns with the recent Bitcoin ‘Santa rally’ sentiment.

According to data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment, 104 wallets holding more than 100,000 ETH each control roughly $333 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. In a December 16 update , Santiment revealed that while whale holdings are at historic highs, smaller wallet categories are showing notable declines. Addresses with holdings between 10 and 100,000 ETH now account for just 33.5% of the supply, a record low, while wallets with less than 100 ETH hold only 9.19% — the lowest level in nearly four years. This trend is being interpreted as a bullish signal for Ethereum in the long term. “It is still generally a bullish long-term signal when a coin’s most prominent key stakeholders continue accumulating,” Santiment noted. New Ethereum Addresses Hit 8-Month High The surge in whale accumulation coincides with renewed on-chain activity on the Ethereum network. Santiment reported that the daily average of new Ethereum wallet addresses reached 130,200 in December, marking an eight-month high. This uptick suggests growing user interest, potentially fueled by bullish market sentiment and increasing adoption of Ethereum-based DeFi and staking protocols. Ether’s price momentum reflects this trend, with ETH reclaiming the $4,000 mark on December 7 for the first time since March. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at approximately $4,007, though it remains 17% below its all-time high of $4,891 recorded in November 2021. Analysts remain optimistic, predicting that Ethereum could surpass its previous peak during the first quarter of 2025, aided by favorable market conditions and last month’s crypto deleveraging. Social Sentiment While Ethereum’s strong fundamentals and whale accumulation are generating bullish outlooks, Santiment’s social sentiment tracker highlights growing conversations around Bitcoin and emerging altcoins. Bitcoin’s recent surge to a record high of $107,800 has dominated discussions, with traders focusing on its market dominance and implications for altcoin performance. Altcoins such as Vanachains (VANA) and Moca Networks (MOCA) have also drawn attention.

37754598,https://invezz.com/?p=2390327,1734428665,Could Bitcoin help US reduce its $36 trillion debt burden?,"Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy and prominent Bitcoin advocate, has proposed a controversial strategy to tackle the United States’ soaring $36 trillion national debt. Speaking in a recent interview, Saylor positioned Bitcoin as a transformative asset that could provide long-term financial security for the nation, much like Manhattan’s historical economic growth. He called for bold action, urging the government to consider Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves to attract global capital and drive economic strength. Saylor compared Bitcoin’s value trajectory to the historic purchase of Manhattan, which has since become one of the most valuable real estate investments in history. He referred to Bitcoin as the “economic capital of the digital world,” suggesting that the cryptocurrency holds comparable potential for value appreciation. The analogy highlights Bitcoin’s unique position as a scarce digital asset. Saylor argued that, just as investing in Manhattan early would have yielded exponential returns, purchasing Bitcoin today could deliver substantial financial benefits over the coming decades. Michael Saylor’s proposal To leverage Bitcoin’s potential, Saylor proposed that the US government create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This could be achieved either by selling a portion of its gold holdings or borrowing resources to finance the acquisition. According to Saylor, allocating 20–25% of the nation’s reserves to Bitcoin would attract global investment, enhance the dollar’s strength, and stimulate economic growth. Saylor compared this approach to MicroStrategy’s investment strategy, which has seen the company aggressively acquire Bitcoin as part of its long-term treasury reserve management. He argued that this blueprint could translate to national-level economic gains if implemented effectively. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings MicroStrategy continues to lead by example. On December 16, Saylor revealed the company’s latest acquisition of 15,350 Bitcoin for approximately $1.5 billion, at an average price of $100,386 per Bitcoin. This brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin reserves to 439,000 BTC, purchased for roughly $27.1 billion at an average price of $61,725 per Bitcoin. The company’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin underscores Saylor’s confidence in the asset’s potential as a long-term store of value. It also serves as a proof of concept for his recommendation to the US government. MicroStrategy’s strategy has positioned it as a dominant corporate holder of Bitcoin, showcasing how consistent investment can secure financial strength. Saylor remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, forecasting an annual price growth of 29%. If this trajectory holds, Bitcoin could reach an astonishing $13 million by 2045. However, such growth depends on critical factors such as increased ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and favorable regulatory frameworks. The prediction aligns with Bitcoin’s limited supply of 21 million coins, which many proponents believe will drive significant price appreciation as demand rises. Nonetheless, achieving such milestones would require broad market acceptance and regulatory clarity to instill investor confidence. Can Bitcoin be the answer to US debt? Saylor’s proposal comes at a time of mounting concern over the US national debt, which stands at $36 trillion and continues to rise. While critics argue that Bitcoin’s volatility makes it an unsuitable asset for national reserves, Saylor maintains that its scarcity and decentralized nature provide unmatched long-term stability. The idea of Bitcoin as a national reserve asset represents a radical departure from conventional economic strategies. While some may view it as speculative, Saylor’s vision underscores Bitcoin’s growing influence in global finance.

These wallets provide options for users seeking secure storage and easy access to RLUSD for individual transactions. Notably, Gem Wallet, Trust Wallet, Ledger, and Trezor support XRPL and Ethereum, catering to users who prefer multi-chain flexibility. For institutional users, supported enterprise wallets are Ripple Custody, Fireblocks, and BitGo. These wallets are integral for larger-scale transactions and custodial services, ensuring RLUSD’s seamless integration into the operations of financial institutions and enterprises. They also support both XRPL and Ethereum blockchains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Strategic Importance of the NYDFS Approval In a different post , Steingraber drew attention to Ripple’s acquisition of the New York Charter as part of the company’s acquisition of the Standard Custody and Trust Company. He noted this as a pivotal move, enabling the company to align with the stringent regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuance in the U.S. financial landscape. Steingraber emphasized the significance of this approval, remarking that “no other stablecoin has this.” The timing of the stablecoin’s approval aligns closely with the impending introduction of the U.S. Stablecoin Act, which is expected to impose strict guidelines for stablecoin issuers. Ripple’s proactive approach positions RLUSD to meet these standards, making it a potential leader in the regulated stablecoin space. RLUSD’s Launch With the official wallet list now public, Ripple’s commitment to building a robust infrastructure for RLUSD is becoming clearer. By ensuring compatibility across a diverse range of wallets, Ripple provides accessibility for both retail users and enterprises. This strategic move bolsters user confidence and lays the groundwork for RLUSD’s adoption in cross-border payments and other real-world use cases. However, investors should not move too fast, as Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz recently issued an important warning about the stablecoin’s launch.

Trading support for GOAT and Korean won pairs begin on Dec. 17 at 04:00 UTC. In a recent notice , Bithumb announced that Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ) will be added to the exchange’s Korean won market starting from Dec. 17 at 04:00 UTC. Deposit and withdrawal for the viral Solana-based meme coin start two hours after the notice was posted. While buying and selling orders are restricted within the first five minutes of trading. Previously, GOAT made its debut on the major crypto exchange OKX on Dec. 12. The token saw a rise in value by 30% after listing on the exchange. However, the same cannot be said about the meme coin’s Bithumb listing. Shortly after the notice was released, the token went up only slightly by nearly 4% before dropping by 1.16% a few hours later. In fact, the meme coin has been going downhill by 0.9% in the past 24 hours of trading. This seemingly contradicts the general consensus, as most tokens experience a boost in value after major crypto exchanges announce their listings. In Goatseus Maximus case, the token has barely moved by much since Bithumb’s listing.

37751590,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628761,1734428084,Former Google CEO Schmidt urges ‘unplugging’ AI systems at certain capabilities,"Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has warned artificial intelligence developers to control their development ceiling. He also highlighted the importance of the United States winning the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) race against China. Speaking on ABC News’ This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, Schmidt cautioned about the potential for AI systems to operate independently and even improve themselves. “ We’re soon going to be able to have computers running on their own, deciding what they want to do ,” Schmidt said. Schmidt: AI shouldn’t be left unchecked Schmidt reiterated the risks of advanced AI developing unchecked, noting that systems capable of self-improvement present a significant danger. “ When the system can self-improve, we need to seriously think about unplugging it ,” the former Google CEO said. When Stephanopoulos asked Schmidt whether such AI systems could counter efforts to shut them down, Schmidt replied, “Well, in theory, we better have somebody with the hand on the plug—metaphorically.” While concerns about AI’s existential risks are growing, some experts argue that such fears are exaggerated. Professor Nick Jennings, vice-provost of research at Imperial College London, is among those dismissing doomsday predictions. Jennings contends that while AI can excel in specific tasks, creating systems with human-like intelligence across diverse areas remains far beyond the current capabilities of scientists. “ Developing AI that performs a singular task very well is achievable, ” Jennings explained. “But building general AI that mirrors human intelligence across multiple subjects is not something we can expect in the near future.” Diverging opinions on AI threats Meanwhile, concerns persist among leading AI researchers who warn of the dangers posed by poorly defined objectives and inadequate safety measures. UC Berkeley professor Stuart Russell and postdoctoral scholar Michael Cohen argue that powerful AI systems could ultimately pose an existential threat to humanity if left unchecked. In an insights paper published in the Science Journal, Russell and Cohen called for stricter oversight of AI development. They emphasized the need for tech companies to prove the safety of their AI systems before releasing them into the market. Without clear objectives and robust safeguards, advanced AI systems could act against human interests, they argue. “ If the objectives of these AIs conflict with those of humans, it could spell disaster, ” Russell and Cohen wrote. They believe tech companies should be held responsible for ensuring the safety of their systems and identifying critical “red lines” that AI should never cross. A growing debate on AI safety The rapid pace of AI advancement has already presented challenges, including the spread of disinformation, societal polarization, and algorithmic bias. Concerns about safety and regulation have yet to keep pace with the technology’s development. Schmidt’s remarks reflect the growing urgency among industry leaders to address these challenges. Experts like Elon Musk have long called for preemptive regulations to mitigate AI risks. Musk, who once described AI as the “biggest risk we face as a civilization,” warned that authorities have done little to address its dangers. Similarly, physicist Stephen Hawking feared that achieving singularity, the point where machines surpass human intelligence could leave humanity unable to control advanced AI systems. In his interview, Hawking argued that without regulations, AI could become “either the best or the worst thing to happen to humanity.” US-China AI competition intensifies Schmidt noted that while the US previously held a lead over China in AI development , the gap has significantly narrowed over the past six months. “ China has caught up in a way that is remarkable, ” he said, describing the current situation as a high-stakes race between the two superpowers. “ There’s a point, maybe in the next year or two, where the systems can begin to do their own research. They’re called AI scientists, as opposed to human scientists. So you go from having 1,000 human scientists to a million AI scientists. I think that increases the slope, and when you’re moving at this pace, it’s very hard for your competitors to catch up, ” he remarked. Schmidt believes the incoming Trump administration will prioritize US competitiveness in AI, which he sees as a positive step. “As long as human values are preserved,” he said, “we should be okay.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ex-google-ceo-schmidt-warns-of-ai-power/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37751590.jpeg
37751346,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374935,1734427893,"New BTC Peak, Bullish XRP Price Predictions, Pi Network Warning: Bits Recap Dec 17","TL;DR Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high of almost $108,000. Analysts predict it could climb to $250,000 or even $500,000 this cycle. Ripple’s XRP surged over 130% in a month, trading above $2.50. Market observers set short-term targets between $5.85 and $8.76. Pi Network urged users to rely on official channels and use the verified Pi Wallet. The launch of the open network is pending, with approximately one million verifications left. BTC Hits a New ATH The primary cryptocurrency has been on a tear in the past seven days, registering a price increase of over 10%. Several hours ago, it tapped a new all-time high of almost $108,000. In the following hours, BTC experienced enhanced volatility and eventually stabilized at its current $107,000 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko It is important to note that the asset’s new peak came shortly after MicroStrategy announced its latest crypto purchase. As CryptoPotato reported , the business intelligence company acquired 15,350 BTC at an average price of $100,386. Its total holdings increased to 439,000 BTC, which , according to ongoing rates, equals nearly $47 billion. Massive purchases of that type leave fewer assets available on the open market, which could potentially result in a price rally (assuming demand stays the same or rises). However, when MicroStrategy disclosed multi-billion Bitcoin purchases the previous two times, BTC’s valuation briefly headed south. The asset’s push toward a new ATH aligns with overall bullish sentiment among popular analysts on X. Jake Gagain said he would be surprised if BTC doesn’t reach $250,000 this cycle , while Michael van de Poppe believes the price could explode to as high as $500,000. XRP Price Forecasts Another leading cryptocurrency that has pumped substantially as of late is Ripple’s XRP. Its price is up over 130% in the past month, currently trading well above $2.50. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Some factors possibly fueling the resurgence include the overall market revival and the upcoming launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. The product is supposed to go live on many exchanges in the next two days. Among the first to embrace it are Uphold, MoonPay, Bitso, CoinMENA, and more. Many industry participants believe XRP’s latest spike could be just the beginning of a major bull run that has yet to be witnessed . The X users JAVON MARKS recently forecasted a potential price explosion, while Dark Defender set $5.85 and $8.76 as short-term targets. The latter also outlined $2.29, $2.24, $2.10, and $2.02 as major support zones. X user Scofield chipped in , too , advising XRP investors to consider selling their positions once the asset’s valuation climbs to $5. Pi Network Alerts Last but not least, we will conclude with two warnings that came from the controversial cryptocurrency project Pi Network. The team urged users to rely only on information shared on official channels. They provided a dedicated safety page showing all the sources and URL links the community can refer to. The developers also warned people to use only their Pi Wallets in the designated Pi Browser. “Ensure you’re in the correct Pi Wallet, not any fake one, to safeguard your Pi. The authentic Pi Wallet is also visually identified by a purple color in the navigation bar of the Pi Browser with a Pi logo featuring the Core Team apps logo,” the warning reads. Pi Network saw the light of day in 2019, amassing a multi-million community in the following years. However, it has yet to launch its native token and open mainnet, which has created some controversy. According to the team, the open network will see the light of day once 15 million people complete the necessary verifications. Pi News recently claimed that only one million are left to do so. In addition, the Pi Core Team promised to announce the mainnet open roadmap in December, which should provide more clarity on when users will be able to buy and sell Pi tokens. It remains to be seen whether the final weeks of 2024 will bring significant developments or there will be further delays.

37751327,https://nulltx.com/?p=135805,1734427809,"Best Altcoins with 1000X Potential as Qubetics Eyes $15 After Mainnet Launch, SUI Gains Momentum, and Bitcoin Stays Strong","Which cryptocurrencies are offering a real chance at 1000X potential? Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines as it crosses key milestones, while SUI’s network activity is reaching all-time highs. But one name that’s turning heads is Qubetics ($TICS). Analysts are predicting a massive surge, expecting it to jump to $15 after its mainnet launch. For those seeking significant gains, these altcoins could offer exciting opportunities. Qubetics is shaking up the crypto space by tackling real-world problems through asset tokenization. The current Qubetics presale offers incredible ROI potential and is drawing major investor interest. Let’s break down what makes these three projects stand out. Qubetics Tokenizes Real-World Assets and Targets $15 After Its Mainnet Launch Qubetics ($TICS) is addressing a major gap in traditional investment markets through real-world asset tokenization. By converting tangible assets like real estate, intellectual property, and commodities into digital tokens, Qubetics is creating a faster, more transparent way to unlock liquidity. Businesses and individuals alike benefit from this efficient approach, which removes many of the barriers seen in traditional asset trading. For instance, a $10 million property can be tokenized into digital units, allowing multiple investors to purchase fractional ownership. This process opens real estate opportunities to smaller investors who previously couldn’t participate. Similarly, businesses can tokenize their inventory, reducing red tape and improving cash flow. The Qubetics presale has already seen massive success, with more than 347 million $TICS tokens sold. Over $6.8 million has been raised so far, with over 10,000 token holders on board. Currently, the token is priced at $0.0342, and analysts are confident it could jump to $15 after the mainnet launch, a move that would mean incredible returns for early investors. Each Qubetics presale stage lasts just 7 days and ends every Sunday at 12 AM, with the price increasing by 10% at the end of each stage. This makes it an exciting project to watch for those seeking altcoins with exponential potential. If you’re curious to know more, this video dives deeper into the project. SUI Sees Network Activity and DEX Volume Reaching New Highs SUI, a Layer 1 blockchain optimised for high-speed transactions, has recently seen impressive growth. Its daily DEX (decentralised exchange) volume hit a record $466 million, pushing its total DEX trading volume past $35 billion. This surge reflects growing adoption and increased network activity. The platform’s focus on speed and scalability makes it a favourite among developers and users alike. Analysts have highlighted SUI as one of the best altcoins with 1000X potential, as its ecosystem continues to attract partnerships and new projects. SUI’s price has also seen a steady climb, trading around $4.80 recently, showing gains of about 4% in the last 24 hours. This upward trend signals strong market confidence in the project. As its ecosystem expands, SUI remains one of the most promising altcoins to watch. Bitcoin Continues Its Dominance and Surpasses Key Milestones Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, continues to prove its market dominance. Recently, it surged past $100,000, marking a key milestone driven by institutional demand and regulatory optimism. Analysts point to reduced restrictions and the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs as major drivers behind this rally. Despite some selling pressure at this level, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish. The introduction of new policies could further solidify Bitcoin’s role as the leading digital store of value. Analysts believe that Bitcoin’s resilience and expanding adoption will continue to support its growth. While it’s the oldest player in the market, Bitcoin remains a critical part of any diversified crypto portfolio, cementing its position as a top contender among the best altcoins with 1000X potential. Conclusion: Exploring the Best Altcoins with 1000X Potential The cryptocurrency market is filled with opportunities for exponential returns, and Qubetics, SUI, and Bitcoin are clear contenders for those seeking substantial gains. Qubetics is innovating through real-world asset tokenization, SUI is capturing attention with its network growth and high trading volumes, and Bitcoin continues to dominate as the market’s cornerstone. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, catering to investors with different goals. As the crypto market evolves, staying informed and watching these promising altcoins closely could unlock massive opportunities.

BTC is up 2.42% over the past 24 hours and 10% over the past week as its post-election rally continues. The world’s largest and most popular cryptocurrency has registered gains of over 50% since Trump’s November election victory. BTC’s record-breaking price action has significantly impacted other cryptocurrencies as well. Ethereum (ETH) crossed the crucial $4,000 mark, up 2.40% over the past 24 hours. Ripple (XRP)’s latest rally has seen it leapfrog Tether (USDT) again to become the third-largest cryptocurrency. XRP is up almost 16% over the past week. However, Solana (SOL) registered a notable decline, down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours. Cardano (ADA) , Tron (TRX) , Chainlink (LINK), and Aave (AAVE) also registered substantial gains. Crypto Receives Major Boost Thanks To Trump’s Comments Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied over 50% since the US elections, which saw Trump voted to office, along with several pro-crypto candidates. As a result of the substantial jump in prices, the overall value of the crypto market has doubled over the year so far to hit $3.8 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Trump, who once called crypto a scam, embraced digital assets during his election campaign and promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Trump also named former PayPal executive David Sacks White House czar for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Trump has nominated pro-crypto attorney Paul Atkins as the next Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair. MicroStrategy Added To Nasdaq-100 Michael Saylor-led MicroStrategy will be added to the Nasdaq-100 Index. The change will come into effect before the market opens. MicroStrategy’s strategy of aggressively investing in Bitcoin (BTC) has seen the company’s shares soar sixfold during the ongoing year. As a result, its market value has surged to $94 billion. The company is also the largest corporate holder of BTC. The news also led to the company’s shares registering an increase of 4.2% on Monday. Matthew Dibb, the Chief Investment Officer at Astronaut Capital, stated the inclusion was a bit unexpected, adding, “The inclusion seems a bit unexpected, but that hasn’t stopped the excitement of what many believe to be the start of a looping cycle of capital that could potentially drive up the spot Bitcoin price.” MicroStrategy Purchases More Bitcoin (BTC) MicroStrategy purchased an additional 15,350 BTC during the week ending December 15 at an average price of roughly $100,386 per BTC. The purchase was financed by selling MicroStrategy shares. The latest purchase brings MicroStrategy’s total BTC reserves to a staggering 439,000 BTC worth $47 billion at current prices. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy has seen the company’s market cap grow from $1.1 billion to almost $100 billion. The jump in BTC prices has also boosted MicroStrategy shares. BTC has seen an unprecedented rally this year thanks to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections. The company has also been included in the Nasdaq 100. The company now aims to become part of the S&P 500 index. However, this may be difficult, according to analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas. While companies must have a market cap of at least $18 billion, the S&P has complete discretion in deciding which companies make the cut. According to Seyffart and Balchunas, MicroStrategy’s biggest problem could be profitability, with the company failing to profit over the past few quarters. However, that could change in 2025. Current accounting rules do not allow companies like MicroStrategy to record BTC on their books at fair value. Instead, they must take an impairment loss if prices fall and cannot take any gains from rising BTC prices into their books. However, new rules by the Financial Accounting Standards Board allow companies to capture some upside from rising BTC prices. Ripple To Roll Out RLUSD Stablecoin Ripple announced it will begin rolling out the RLUSD stablecoin on December 17 after receiving regulatory approval. It will be listed on several prominent exchanges and crypto platforms, including MoonPay, Uphold, Archax, and CoinMENA. Further listings on Bitstamp, Bitso, Bullish, and others are also planned in the coming weeks. The company also announced two additions to its stablecoin advisory board: Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Kenneth Montgomery, the former first vice president and COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) hit another record as it surged to a new all-time high of $107,780, thanks to growing optimism about its potential role as a US reserve asset. BTC’s latest milestone came after President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve similar to the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Trump reaffirmed his stance in an interview, stating that the US would do something great with crypto. As a result, markets have a renewed sense of optimism, with other altcoins also registering substantial gains. Additionally, crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) have also registered record-breaking inflows. Data from CoinShares reported a staggering $3.2 billion flowing into these products, with BTC accounting for over half of these investments. BTC declined marginally after hitting a new all-time high and is trading around $106,719, up almost 1% over the past 24 hours. Sentiment around BTC has become positive after Trump’s comments, despite the asset getting off to a bearish start during the previous week. BTC started last week with a drop of 3.57%, falling to an intraday low of $94,185, briefly slipping below the 20-day SMA. However, it recovered partially from this level to go above the 20-day SMA and settle at $97,434. Bearish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $96,912, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $94,313. Despite starting the week in the red, BTC recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of 4.12% to cross $100,000 and settle at $100,900. However, the price fell back in the red on Thursday, dropping almost 1% to slip below $100,000 and settle at $99,923. Source: TradingView BTC recovered on Friday to reclaim $100,000 after an increase of 1.47% and settled at $101,394. However, the weekend began with a marginal decline as buyers failed to build momentum on Saturday. BTC recovered strongly on Sunday, registering an increase of almost 3%, and settled at $104,181. Bullish sentiment persisted on Monday as BTC set a new all-time high, reaching an intraday high of $107,780 before marginally declining to $105,750. The current session sees BTC up by almost 1% as it eyes the $110,000 mark. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) finally broke past the resistance at $4,000, a level it struggled to surpass. Market watchers will hope ETH can build on its recent uptick and push towards $4,500. ETH has struggled to go above $4,000 since the beginning of December and plummeted over 7% last Monday as it failed to stay above this level. As a result, ETH fell to an intraday low of $3,536 before settling at $3,715. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH dropped to an intraday low of $3,521, briefly going below the 20-day SMA before settling at $3,630, a decline of 2.30%. However, ETH recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of 5.62% to cross $3,800 and settle at $3,834. Buyers retained control on Thursday as ETH rose to an intraday high of $3,988 before declining to settle at $3,882, ultimately registering an increase of 1.26%. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment began waning on Friday as ETH registered only a marginal increase. Despite the marginal increase, ETH could go above $3,900 and settle at $3,907. The weekend began with ETH dropping almost 1% on Saturday to go below $3,900 and settle at $3,869. However, it recovered on Sunday, registering an increase of 2.25% and settling at $3,956. The current week began with ETH experiencing significant volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to take control. As a result, ETH dropped to an intraday low of $3,882 and rose to an intraday high of $4,106 before settling at $3,985 after an increase of 0.74%. The current session sees ETH marginally up and trading around $4,007. Buyers will look to keep ETH above $4,000 and push towards $4,500. On the other hand, sellers will attempt to wrest control and drive ETH below $4,000 and towards $3,800. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) slipped below the $220 support level as growing selling pressure saw the price plummet to $211. SOL has been trading in a downward trajectory since November 23, as its bull run halted abruptly after it failed to stay above $260. Bearish sentiment intensified considerably at the beginning of last week, as SOL plummeted by 8.55% to drop to an intraday low of $205 before settling at $216. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL fell to an intraday low of $201 before settling at $213 after a drop of 1.47%. Despite considerable selling pressure, SOL recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of 6.38% and settling at $227. SOL attempted to push above the 20-day SMA on Thursday as it reached an intraday high of $234. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $215, registering a marginal decline. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Friday as SOL dropped by 0.96% to $224. Sellers attempted to drag SOL below the 50-day SMA on Saturday as it fell to an intraday low of $215. However, it partially recovered from this level to settle at $219, ultimately registering a drop of 2.22%. SOL recovered on Sunday, registering an increase of almost 2% and moving to $224. Despite ending the weekend positively, SOL was back in the red on Monday, dropping nearly 4% to slip below the 50-day SMA and $220 to settle at $216. The current session sees SOL marginally down as sellers look to drive SOL towards $200. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) is struggling to build momentum and go above the 20-day SMA as sellers look to yank the price below $1. ARB suffered a substantial decline at the beginning of last week, plummeting over 17% to an intraday low of $0.840 before partially recovering and settling at $0.960. Bearish sentiment persisted on Tuesday, with ARB witnessing an increase in volatility.

37751121,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394053,1734427387,RLUSD Launch Price Prediction: Here’s What Industry Leaders Are Saying,"The post RLUSD Launch Price Prediction: Here’s What Industry Leaders Are Saying appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple is set to launch its USD-backed stablecoin , RLUSD, on December 17, 2024. The stablecoin will initially be available on platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, CoinMENA, Bitso, and Archax, with plans to expand to more exchanges in the future. RLUSD is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. government bonds, and cash equivalents, offering transparency through monthly third-party audits of its reserves. While RLUSD is designed to always maintain a $1 value, some collectors are already bidding on it in on-chain marketplaces, with bids reaching up to 836 XRP ($2068) (As reported by Coindesk) before its release. This early demand could lead to temporary price fluctuations, as RLUSD may not have enough liquidity to immediately maintain its $1 peg. Himanshu Maradiya, Chairman and Founder, CIFDAQ, told Coinpedia, “Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, pegged to $1, has already generated significant excitement ahead of its launch, with onchain bids soaring up to $2,000. This pre-launch frenzy reflects limited supply and heightened demand, as speculators rush to secure the first RLUSD tokens.” He added, “While such inflated prices may turn heads, volatility is expected to settle, bringing the price closer to $1 as liquidity normalizes post-launch. With RLUSD set to go live on the XRP Ledger, Ripple’s entry into the stablecoin market marks a pivotal moment, enhancing utility, driving liquidity, and strengthening stablecoins’ role in cross-border payment solutions.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price to Hit New ATH?

37752449,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52379,1734427212,Shiba Inu (SHIB) $0.000054 Breakout Looms as Trader Shines Spotlight on 16330% Opportunity in Rival Token,"Rexas Finance (RXS) has become so popular that it has raised $26,375,000 in its ninth presale round, showing how investors have taken a shine on the project. This platform will token real-world assets and enable the everyday user or even an investor to access their ownership of assets. On the other hand, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is demonstrating signs of breaking out of a pattern, and we can expect a 450% surge. But this creates a competitive dynamic, as Rexas Finance surges quickly in the cryptocurrency space against Shiba Inu’s recovery, adding new momentum to the broader market. Rexas Finance is set to surge by 16330%. Rexas Finance(RXS) Rexas finance has grown well from its launch last September 2024, drawing an investor into part ownership of tangible assets. The platform blockchain tokensizes real estate, commodities, and collectables and brings physical assets to life in digital format. Rexas Finance strives to fill this gap by bridging the digital and physical economies with an accessible, click of button, way to tokenize your existing Real World Assets with the growing global Real World Asset market valued over $1 quadrillion. At stage 10, the presale of the RXS tokens has increased by 400%, confirming the high demand from the market. The platform’s innovative approach has attracted investors looking to take part, with 350 million of the 425 million tokens already sold. Early investors can expect great returns as the token price approaches its final presale price of $0.20. Its unusual attributes, ranging from the Rexas Token Builder to allowing its customers to launch tokenized versions of their real estate or other assets without requiring coding capabilities, make participation easy for anyone. CertiK has audited the platform to ensure it’s reliable and secure, and Rexas Finance has promised transparency during the process. In particular, the community-first approach has also helped fuel its success, with a loyal investor base that has backed it. Currently, the platform can be found in big tracking sites, like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which are already giving visibility to potential buyers. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Technical Indicators Point to 450% Surge. In addition, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also on investor’s radar as it displays signs of another breakout. The price of the memecoin, which swings in volatility, is at $0.0000276. SHIB is being shown by trader Bluntz to achieve up to 450% in appreciation, fueled by its steady uptrend on the SHIB/BTC pair. According to these technical signals, SHIB could be set for another rally, as it did in 2024. The analysis done by Bluntz notes that there is an option for SHIB’s price to rise dramatically as the market becomes better. Since the memecoin sector continues to draw investor attention, Shiba Inu has firm momentum and is a leading player. SHIB’s increasing interest and relative affordability mean that there will be great growth for the element in the future, thus amplifying its market presence. Conclusion Rexas Finance and Shiba Inu give investors some interesting opportunities within the crypto-developing world. Tokentricesa’s tokenization of real-world assets could be a fancy way to manage and hold assets, and Shibariru’s price breakout will be enormous. Meanwhile, the growth of both platforms is indicative of the volatile yet immensely promising cryptocurrency market.

This innovative approach reflects the company’s confidence in Bitcoin’s potential growth, which is currently having a market cap of $2.12 trillion.

The entire amount raised was dedicated to acquiring Bitcoin, highlighting the company’s clear strategy to strengthen its BTC reserves. However, Metaplanet began its Bitcoin buying journey in April this year, positioning it as a hedge against Japan’s growing debt issues and the yen’s volatility. So far, the company has bought 1,142 BTC , which is currently valued at around $122.67 million. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37750876,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-s-46b-bitcoin-bet-raises-big-questions,1734426860,MicroStrategy’s $46B Bitcoin Bet Raises Big Questions,"MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor , now holds 439,000 BTC , valued at around $46.92 billion, representing over 2% of Bitcoin's total supply. This bold strategy has positioned MicroStrategy as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption but also raised concerns about its impact on market stability and decentralization. MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach uses debt and equity to fund Bitcoin purchases, deviating from traditional corporate treasury methods. The company recently raised $1.5 billion by selling 3.8 million shares, purchasing 15,350 BTC at an average price of $100,386. This tactic has made MicroStrategy a proxy for Bitcoin investment , giving stockholders exposure to Bitcoin without owning the asset directly. While this approach has fueled growth, it carries risks. MicroStrategy's market value depends heavily on its Bitcoin holdings, making the company vulnerable to price drops. Experts point out that even a significant decline—such as Bitcoin falling below $18,000—would impact the market but not immediately destabilize MicroStrategy’s position. The cryptocurrency market has surged in 2024, with Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 for the first time on December 5. Optimism surrounding pro-crypto policies, including the nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair, has fueled this growth. The market’s total value nearly doubled in 2024, reaching $3.8 trillion. Other companies are following MicroStrategy’s lead. Riot Platforms announced plans to raise $500 million through convertible notes for Bitcoin purchases, while Marathon Digital secured $700 million for similar acquisitions. These moves signal growing corporate interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Blockstream, a blockchain leader, has also entered the Bitcoin treasury space. The company’s new asset management division focuses on helping businesses optimize Bitcoin investments. CIO Sean Bill expects more corporations and even nations to adopt Bitcoin, reshaping how companies manage reserves. However, MicroStrategy’s dominance raises questions about Bitcoin's decentralization. Large holdings by a single entity pose risks if a sell-off occurs. Historical examples highlight this concern: in 2024, the German government sold 50,000 BTC over five weeks, triggering a 13% price drop. While disruptive, Bitcoin proved resilient and recovered quickly. Exchange-traded products (ETPs) add complexity by concentrating ownership in fewer hands. Yet analysts argue that ETPs cater to diverse investors, balancing accessibility with decentralization. In contrast to MicroStrategy , companies like Block Inc. have taken a more conservative path. Block reinvests 10% of its Bitcoin-based profits into its reserves instead of using debt. This measured strategy reduces exposure to volatility and aligns with organic growth. Bitcoin’s resilience continues to attract institutions, but experts advise caution. Alexandre Schmidt from CoinShares suggests diversification and monitoring market signals like share sales or leadership changes. While MicroStrategy’s influence is significant, Bitcoin’s fundamentals—its scarcity, decentralization, and utility—remain intact. “Long-term holders should stay focused on Bitcoin’s core strengths. It has survived multiple 50%+ drops, and patience has consistently rewarded those who take a long-term view,” Schmidt explains. Michael Saylor remains a strong advocate, encouraging companies to adopt Bitcoin. Despite pushback—such as Microsoft rejecting Bitcoin as part of its reserves—other corporations like Amazon are exploring similar options. Shareholders recently proposed allocating part of Amazon’s $88 billion cash reserves to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. MicroStrategy’s strategy represents both an opportunity and a challenge for Bitcoin. On the one hand, it has legitimized Bitcoin as a corporate asset, inspiring others to follow suit. On the other, it raises concerns about market centralization and stability. As institutional players continue to enter the market, the balance between decentralization and corporate influence will define Bitcoin’s future. While risks exist, Bitcoin’s growth in 2024 proves its appeal as “digital gold.” For companies and individual investors alike, a long-term perspective remains key to navigating this evolving landscape.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-s-46b-bitcoin-bet-raises-big-questions,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37750876.jpeg
37750890,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628756,1734426848,Wall Street sees US dollar’s rally staying strong next year,"The US dollar is on a tear, and Wall Street expects the rally to keep going. After climbing 6.1% since October, the dollar is having its strongest quarter since the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes in 2022. Traders are eyeing further gains next year, despite President-elect Donald Trump’s push for a weaker currency. The dollar has strengthened from $1.11 against the euro in early October to below $1.05. Deutsche Bank forecasts parity—$1 to €1—by 2025. More than half of major banks surveyed, including Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Morgan Stanley, predict the greenback will remain robust. Trump’s hopes for a weaker dollar to help US exporters? Not likely, analysts say. Trump’s policies may fuel dollar strength Trump has repeatedly called the dollar’s strength a “big problem” for American companies. In July, he said, “That’s a tremendous burden on our companies that try and sell tractors and other things to other places outside of this country.” During his first term, he even labeled China a “currency manipulator” amid trade tensions. Despite this rhetoric, analysts believe Trump’s pro-growth policies will only strengthen the currency. Trump’s plans for import tariffs, tax cuts, and an inflationary boost to domestic demand are seen as dollar-positive. Higher inflation could force the Fed to keep interest rates elevated, attracting foreign capital into dollar assets. Barclays expects the dollar to inch up to $1.04 against the euro by the end of next year. Global dynamics limit Trump’s control over the US dollar Despite Trump’s desire to devalue the dollar, the mechanics are complicated. Analysts rule out a “Plaza Accord” repeat—similar to the 1985 deal when countries intervened to weaken the dollar. Mark Sobel, a former US Treasury official, says support for a so-called “Mar-a-Lago Accord” is unrealistic. “Perceptions about US leverage over China are woefully exaggerated,” he explained . Beijing is unlikely to agree to engineered devaluation. Brad Setser, another former Treasury official, says the 1985 Plaza Accord worked because US rates were already falling. “The macroeconomic backdrop, with interest rate differentials that favor the dollar versus the euro and the yuan, isn’t conducive to a weak dollar.” Right now, the Fed’s stance and global capital flows strongly support the greenback. Even with Trump pushing against it, the dollar’s fundamentals remain strong. Analysts believe weakening it would require measures like reducing the government deficit or forcing trade allies into currency agreements—highly unlikely paths. Franklin Templeton says , “It’s not clear to me that he can actually run around screaming about how the euro is too weak against the dollar.” Market pricing and recent dollar movements The dollar’s rally has taken a brief pause in recent weeks. The Dollar Index , which measures the greenback against major currencies, is trading around 106.8, down from highs above 108 late last month. But this doesn’t signal the end of the rally. The stronger dollar creates challenges for exporters but benefits foreign investors. The higher the Fed keeps rates, the more attractive dollar-denominated assets become. Analysts agree: Trump’s economic agenda—whether intentional or not—will keep the dollar climbing. For investors, the dollar remains a safe bet. Analysts largely dismiss Trump’s rhetoric. Currency strategies hinge on interest rate differentials, trade policies, and global capital flows. None of these favor a weaker dollar. The Federal Reserve remains the central player in the dollar’s outlook. If inflation rises, the Fed may hold rates steady or even hike further. That’s a direct pull for global capital, keeping upward pressure on the greenback. The market has priced in a near-certain 25 basis point cut by the Fed next year. Even if the dollar rally slows, analysts don’t expect a reversal. Economic effects of a strong dollar The dollar’s strength is already affecting financial markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell 0.25% for its eighth consecutive day of losses—the longest losing streak since 2018. The S&P 500 climbed 0.38%, and the Nasdaq rose 1.24%, hitting a new high. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 dropped 0.71% after Moody’s downgraded the country’s credit rating. Tech stocks are also in focus. Nvidia shares dipped 1.7% on Monday, closing at $132. The stock is now down 11% from its November peak but remains up 166% year-to-date. Meanwhile, other chipmakers like Broadcom continue to post gains, indicating sector strength despite Nvidia’s dip. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son also made history when he announced a $100 billion investment plan in the US over the next four years. The deal includes creating 100,000 jobs focused on AI and infrastructure. Bitcoin, though, broke two all-time highs just yesterday. It was trading at $106,622 at press time.

37752448,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52377,1734426825,"XRP Price Analysis: Bollinger Bands Are Tightening, XRP Big Move Coming","Crypto enthusiasts on X have drawn attention to a notable development in the XRP price chart. Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Steph Is Crypto recently highlighted a technical indicator on the 4-hour timeframe of XRP’s chart. Sharing an annotated image, Steph Is Crypto stated, “Big move ahead for #XRP! Bollinger Bands on the 4hr are tightening—last time this happened, #XRP surged 126%!” This statement has sparked significant discussion within the XRP community concerning a potential price breakout for the token. Big move ahead for #XRP ! Bollinger Bands on the 4hr are tightening—last time this happened, #XRP surged 126%! pic.twitter.com/oN1ZBDgury — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 15, 2024 Key Observations from the Chart The image attached to the tweet reveals three prior instances of Bollinger Bands tightening. Each of these instances preceded substantial price increases for XRP. The first major move saw XRP rally 130.81% to a price of $0.717 while the second observed surge resulted in a 52.84% gain, bringing the price to approximately $1.565. The most recent significant breakout showed XRP climbing 126.23%, reaching a peak of $1.616. These price movements occurred shortly after periods where the Bollinger Bands tightened, a phenomenon that typically signals a period of reduced volatility and a potential breakout—either upward or downward. As of now, the chart shows the Bollinger Bands converging once again, leading many to speculate that another significant price movement may be imminent. Market Sentiment and Reactions The post has garnered varying opinions, particularly around XRP’s price catalysts. One user, Preston, provided a critical perspective, stating , “The only way XRP goes up is pure utility. Until then it requires USDT to mint billions at which point most of the market, especially Bitcoin, benefits the most. No liquidity injection, no price movement. RLUSD changes the game. But it’s not live yet.” Preston’s comment highlights a broader concern in the crypto community regarding liquidity. He argues that the price movement for XRP and other cryptocurrencies often depends on external liquidity injections, such as those associated with stablecoins like Tether (USDT). He also references RLUSD, Ripple’s coming liquidity solution , suggesting it could significantly alter market dynamics after launch. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Richie Rich, offered a more optimistic outlook, writing, “I hope you’re right. I know it’s inevitable we will be going much higher. XRP will be the best performing out of them all, especially when the utility is in play.” Richie Rich’s viewpoint reflects the confidence of many XRP holders in the token’s long-term potential, particularly as Ripple advances its efforts to drive utility through real-world use cases, including cross-border payments. Factors to Watch for XRP’s Future Price Movement While the technical indicator is promising, XRP’s price remains subject to broader market conditions and developments, including: Ripple’s Legal Standing: XRP’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) influences investor sentiment. Positive regulatory outcomes could serve as a major catalyst. Utility and Adoption: Ripple’s efforts to expand XRP’s use in cross-border payments and other financial applications will help drive sustainable demand. Market Liquidity: As highlighted by Preston, liquidity injections and the availability of stablecoins like USDT often influence XRP’s ability to move significantly in either direction. Whether XRP repeats its previous upward trends or faces a different outcome will depend on these combined elements.

37750793,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/easing-smart-contract-deployment-headaches-to-drive-innovation-in-decentralized-ai,1734426718,Easing Smart Contract Deployment Headaches To Drive Innovation In Decentralized AI,"Smart contracts are a pivotal component of every Web3 application. They facilitate decentralized finance, blockchain gaming, real estate, supply chain management, virtual land deals in the metaverse, and much more. They are the secret sauce that makes Web3 click, enabling it to support transactions between independent parties without any middlemen. Without smart contracts, Web3 simply couldn’t exist. However, the methods for deploying them remain complex and challenging, even for experienced developers. This is considered a major impediment to Web3’s growth, and there’s an urgent need for the process to be simplified. The role of smart contracts Smart contracts are digital agreements that automatically trigger blockchain actions when specified conditions are met. For developers, they’re a key tool that enables them to build sophisticated applications, automating their financial agreements and processes. Because they’re deployed on public blockchains, smart contracts are fully transparent and offer heightened security. By making the code public, no one can alter the terms of a smart contract once it has been deployed, so users can have full confidence that it’ll work as proscribed. This transparency also makes it simple for anyone to validate transactions, increasing trust among users and reducing the opportunities for fraud. The hassles of smart contract deployment Most smart contracts are written in Solidity, which is a blockchain-specific programming language, so developers must be proficient in this. Writing smart contracts in Solidity is a tricky business, with developers required to define their objectives with clarity and precision, establish their purpose and goals, determine their scope and limitations, and identify the necessary functions and features required to achieve all of this. Other technical requirements include defining the data structure and variables, creating the necessary logic and algorithms, testing, and debugging. Only after navigating all of these challenges will the developer be ready to deploy their smart contracts, and this can be just as arduous. Throughout each stage of the deployment, developers must pay careful attention to detail to ensure that their smart contracts are activated securely and function as intended. One of the key steps involves defining the deployment parameters, which include setting the gas limits and fees. For smart contacts intended for enterprise use, developers will likely want to deploy on a test net, first of all, to verify they function as intended. Monitoring the smart contract’s performance is essential too, as coding errors can have a negative impact on their efficiency and security. By instituting real-time alerts, developers will be able to receive updates to any issues and ensure a smooth experience for smart contract users. Smart contracts must be deployed carefully to ensure their reliability and security, and this means that thorough testing is also required. It’s recommended to implement a test-driven development approach using tools such as Remix and Truffle , which can help to simulate various transaction loads in different scenarios. For instance, developers need to perform unit tests, integration tests and system tests prior to deployment, while third-party audits can further minimize risks. The biggest challenge in terms of deployment is the migration from a development environment to a blockchain network. In addition, network congestion may delay the deployment process and increase the costs. Version control is also essential to avoid any discrepancies between different smart contract versions, and developers must create a timely update process to quickly fix any vulnerabilities or errors discovered later. Another challenge pertains to the high gas costs associated with certain blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum. While this doesn’t matter so much in low-cost networks, inefficient transaction code can result in substantially increased gas costs, meaning higher operational expenses. Developers can get around this by optimizing their code so it uses fewer computational resources, for instance by reducing storage variables and minimizing loops. Developers must also be aware of blockchain scalability issues, which can make it very difficult to maintain optimal smart contract functionality, hindering their performance when the network is experiencing high transaction volumes. Reducing the complexity Fortunately, there are some newer blockchain networks that attempt to streamline the smart contract deployment process and make life as simple as possible for developers. For AI developers, one of the most promising options is OG , formerly a modular blockchain network that’s since pivoted to become a Decentralized AI Operating System. The OG Chain uses blockchain technology to coordinate decentralized resources for AI, including computing, storage, and data availability. It’s a direct response to the rise of centralized AI systems that lack transparency in terms of their users’ data. One of the main benefits of OG is its flexible design, which allows for the major components of its platform – storage, computing, data accessibility, and AI model hosting – to be easily integrated with any decentralized application. The other advantage of OG Chain is its simplified smart contact deployment process. As an EVM-compatible network, the process of deploying smart contracts on OG is the same as it is on any other EVM chain, with developers able to write code in Solidity and use familiar tools and processes. Unlike other networks, OG offers a user-friendly interface that walks developers through each stage of deployment, ensuring smart contracts can be activated much faster. It breaks things down to a few easy steps To get started , developers can use Solc or another compatible Solidity compiler to compile their smart contract code. OG then automatically generates the binary and Application Binary Interface or ABI for their smart contract, ready for deployment. It’s then just a matter of using a tool such as web3.js., ether.js, or hardhat to commit their code to the OG Chain, via an OG Chain node or an RPC endpoint. To verify that the contract is deployed correctly, developers can perform a simple check using the OG Chain block explorer. With that tool, they’ll be able to bring up a basic overview of contract deployment data, including its public address, interaction histor,y and transaction status. More time to innovate If Web3 is to grow its presence and become mainstream, it needs more useful applications. But Web3 developers are in short supply, and so there’s an urgent need for them to become more productive. OG Chain plays an important role in enabling this, making it easier than ever to deploy smart contracts. It provides developers with a streamlined workflow that minimizes the technical complexity involved in bringing their smart contracts online. By removing the hassles of deployment, OG allows developers to focus more on writing the code that defines their smart contracts, giving them more time to innovate and expand the possibilities of Web3.

Economics professor Özgür Demirtaş, in his post from his X account, suggested a cryptocurrency for Türkiye. Demirtaş, while drawing attention to the fact that the increasing value of the Turkish Lira and the weakening of the Russian economy have a negative impact on the tourism sector, suggested that Turkey switch to a cryptocurrency payment system in order to overcome the difficulties in the tourism sector. Demirtaş stated that accepting payments with cryptocurrency could attract new tourists to the sector, and emphasized that this step would make Turkey attractive for tourists in the crypto ecosystem. Demirtaş suggested the following steps to be taken to popularize the use of cryptocurrencies in the tourism sector: “1. This summer, tourism businesses should be allowed to accept payments with cryptocurrency. 2. Devices that can receive payments through wallets managed by the Ministry should be distributed to businesses. 3. Businesses should be able to decide whether to keep crypto payments in Bitcoin, Dollars or TL with these devices. 4. Educational studies should be conducted to eliminate the misperception that cryptocurrencies are associated with crimes such as money laundering. 5. It should be emphasized that crypto payments can be tracked and the advantages of the system in terms of transparency should be emphasized. By being able to receive payments with crypto, it becomes possible for those in the crypto ecosystem around the world to be attracted to the country as tourists. “It would be a good advertisement for the country.

37759131,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663254,1734425986,800 Million XRP Moves Off Exchange: Bull Run Ahead?,"Recently, a significant movement of 800 million XRP tokens from exchanges has caught the attention of the cryptocurrency community. This large-scale transfer could have substantial implications for XRP’s market dynamics. The move, facilitated by the NBTC, has sparked discussions about the potential for a bullish trend soon. Overview Of The XRP Movement The transfer of 800 million XRP tokens occurred over a short period, raising eyebrows among analysts and investors. The XRP was moved from several major exchanges to unknown wallets, suggesting a strategy to hold the tokens rather than trade them immediately. Such movements are often seen as bullish signals, indicating strong confidence in XRP’s future value. Related Reading: The $589 XRP Dream: Believers Aren’t ‘Delusional’ Enough, Expert Says NBTC, a prominent player in the crypto space, played a crucial role in this significant transfer. Their involvement has added credibility to the move, as NBTC is known for its strategic market decisions. This transfer has led to speculation about potential market manipulation, but it also highlights NBTC’s confidence in XRP’s long-term prospects. The movement of such a large amount of XRP could significantly impact the market. Historically, large transfers off exchanges have been associated with positive price movements, as they reduce the available supply for trading and indicate strong holding behaviour. Experts believe this could drive demand and increase XRP prices. The potential for a bull run is high following this transfer. Bullish indicators, such as reduced sell pressure and increased accumulation, point towards a positive trend. Historical data shows that similar large-scale movements have often preceded significant price rallies in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the bullish sentiment, there are bearish concerns that cannot be ignored. Market manipulation remains a risk, and the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies continues to evolve. These factors could introduce volatility and uncertainty, potentially dampening the bullish momentum. The lack of comprehensive regulatory frameworks and the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies could pose significant challenges, making the market unpredictable. Related Reading: XRP Price Holds Steady: What’s Next After Consolidation? Investor Reactions The reaction from the crypto community has been mixed. While some investors view the move as a strong bullish signal, others are cautious, citing potential regulatory hurdles and market manipulation. Prominent figures in the crypto space have weighed in, with some expressing optimism about XRP’s future. This movement has generated a lot of buzzes, with discussions centering around the potential for a significant price rally. The immediate price response to the 800 million XRP movement was positive, with a noticeable uptick in XRP’s value. However, the long-term impact will depend on broader market conditions and regulatory developments. Investors closely watch how this transfer will play out in the evolving regulatory landscape and overall market sentiment. [XRP Price Chart] |Source (XRPUSD on TradingView.com ) In the short term, XRP’s price is expected to remain volatile but with an upward trend.

37750600,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24562,1734425765,Điều gì thúc đẩy các công ty xem xét Bitcoin làm tài sản dự trữ?,"Bitcoin không còn là sân chơi riêng của các nhà đầu tư cá nhân nữa, mà đang dần được các ông lớn trên toàn cầu đưa vào chiến lược tài chính. Họ xem Bitcoin như “lá chắn” chống lạm phát và két sắt lưu trữ giá trị. Xu hướng này, khởi xướng bởi MicroStrategy, đang lan tỏa mạnh mẽ với những cái tên đình đám như Tesla, Tether Holdings, Jetking Infotrain (Ấn Độ) và Metaplanet (Nhật Bản). Bitcoin hấp dẫn bởi khả năng chống lạm phát và tiềm năng sinh lời khủng. Tuy nhiên, biến động giá, rủi ro pháp lý và lo ngại về môi trường đòi hỏi doanh nghiệp phải quản trị rủi ro thận trọng. Dù vậy, Bitcoin vẫn đang lột xác ngoạn mục từ tài sản đầu cơ thành công cụ quản lý tài chính chính thống, hứa hẹn sẽ định hình lại bức tranh tài chính toàn cầu. Cơn sốt Bitcoin lan rộng đến các ông lớn toàn cầu Các công ty trên toàn cầu đang có xu hướng xem xét việc đầu tư vào Bitcoin như một phần trong chiến lược quản lý tài sản của mình, giống như công ty tiên phong MicroStrategy đã làm. Xu hướng này cho thấy Bitcoin đang ngày càng được công nhận là một công cụ chống lạm phát và là nơi lưu trữ giá trị an toàn trong bối cảnh kinh tế bất ổn hoặc những sự kiện “thiên nga đen” khó lường. Cổ đông của các tập đoàn đa quốc gia như Microsoft và Amazon đã đề xuất đưa Bitcoin vào danh mục đầu tư của công ty. Mặc dù cổ đông Microsoft gần đây đã bỏ phiếu chống lại đề xuất này do lo ngại về sự biến động của Bitcoin, nhưng việc ngày càng có nhiều người ủng hộ cho thấy vai trò của Bitcoin trong chiến lược tài chính của doanh nghiệp đang được thảo luận rộng rãi. Nói một cách đơn giản, các công ty lớn đang bắt đầu xem Bitcoin như một cách để bảo vệ tiền của họ khỏi mất giá và những biến động kinh tế khó lường. Không chỉ phương Tây, các công ty ở châu Á cũng đang tích cực “gom” Bitcoin. Jetking Infotrain của Ấn Độ đã trở thành công ty niêm yết đầu tiên tại đây chỉ định Bitcoin là tài sản dự trữ chính. Tại Nhật Bản, Metaplanet (MicroStrategy của châu Á) gần đây đã tăng lượng Bitcoin nắm giữ lên 639.5 BTC (trị giá 40.5 triệu đô la), thể hiện chiến lược mạnh mẽ trong việc áp dụng Bitcoin. Việc ngày càng nhiều công ty tích hợp Bitcoin vào bảng cân đối kế toán đã làm dấy lên cuộc tranh luận về hiệu quả của nó. Các cổ đông và giám đốc điều hành đang cân nhắc giữa lợi ích của việc đa dạng hóa danh mục đầu tư và rủi ro từ biến động giá. Thí nghiệm Bitcoin này cho thấy vai trò đang phát triển của tài sản kỹ thuật số trong tài chính hiện đại và mở ra những cuộc thảo luận về cách chúng định hình lại chiến lược kho bạc doanh nghiệp. Những “gã khổng lồ” nào dẫn đầu xu hướng? Theo BitcoinTreasuries.net , nhiều công ty lớn nhỏ trên thế giới đang tích cực đưa Bitcoin vào danh mục tài sản dự trữ. Dẫn đầu xu hướng này là MicroStrategy với 423,650 BTC (trị giá 42.7 tỷ đô la), tiếp theo là Tesla với 9,720 BTC (trị giá 979 triệu đô la). Trong số các công ty tư nhân, Block.one sở hữu 164,000 BTC (16.5 tỷ đô la) và Tether Holdings nắm giữ 82,454 BTC (8.3 tỷ đô la). Các công ty này coi Bitcoin không chỉ là kho lưu trữ giá trị mà còn là tài sản chiến lược. Tether thậm chí còn đầu tư vào các dự án liên quan đến Bitcoin như khai thác mỏ, thể hiện niềm tin vào giá trị lâu dài của đồng tiền này. Marathon Digital Holdings và Riot Platforms cũng là những cái tên đáng chú ý với lượng Bitcoin nắm giữ lần lượt là 40,435 BTC và 11,425 BTC. Xu hướng này cho thấy Bitcoin đang dần được tích hợp vào hoạt động tài chính của doanh nghiệp. Lợi ích và rủi ro khi đầu tư vào Bitcoin của các công ty Vậy tại sao các công ty lại mê mẩn Bitcoin đến vậy? Chống lạm phát: Với nguồn cung giới hạn 21 triệu đồng, Bitcoin được xem như vàng kỹ thuật số , giúp bảo vệ giá trị tài sản trước những biến động của thị trường. Tăng trưởng vốn: Lịch sử đã chứng minh Bitcoin có tiềm năng tăng trưởng vượt bậc, mang lại lợi nhuận khổng lồ cho những nhà đầu tư tiên phong. Nâng cao uy tín: Việc đầu tư vào Bitcoin còn giúp doanh nghiệp xây dựng hình ảnh đổi mới và thu hút sự chú ý của nhà đầu tư. Tuy nhiên, Bitcoin cũng không phải là “miền đất hứa” hoàn hảo. Biến động giá: Giá Bitcoin lên xuống thất thường, có thể gây ra những khoản lỗ lớn cho doanh nghiệp. Rủi ro pháp lý: Các quy định về tiền điện tử vẫn còn chưa rõ ràng, tiềm ẩn nhiều rủi ro pháp lý cho doanh nghiệp. Vấn đề môi trường: Hoạt động khai thác Bitcoin tiêu tốn nhiều năng lượng, có thể gây ảnh hưởng đến môi trường và làm “mất lòng” những nhà đầu tư có ý thức bảo vệ môi trường, mặc dù thực tế cho thấy khai thác Bitcoin khuyến khích sử dụng năng lượng bền vững . Tóm lại là: Việc đầu tư vào Bitcoin là một cuộc chơi mạo hiểm nhưng đầy tiềm năng cho các doanh nghiệp, với những lợi ích hấp dẫn như khả năng chống lạm phát, tiềm năng tăng trưởng khủng, Bitcoin cũng đi kèm với những rủi ro nhất định. Do đó, các doanh nghiệp cần cân nhắc kỹ lưỡng, xây dựng chiến lược quản trị rủi ro hiệu quả để tận dụng tối đa tiềm năng của đồng tiền này. Xu hướng này cho thấy Bitcoin đang dần lột xác từ một tài sản đầu cơ thành công cụ quản lý tài chính chính thống, hứa hẹn sẽ định hình lại bức tranh tài chính toàn cầu trong tương lai.

The government’s response followed queries posed by two Members of Parliament on what steps were being taken to set up a structured regulatory framework along with an expected timeline for such regulations. Although the administration noted that it consulted with industry stakeholders and relevant international organizations both formally and informally, it asserted that policy efforts on VDA are needed globally in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage to ANI . India seeks to have effective regulation of borderless crypto assets emerge only through deep international cooperation. https://twitter.com/CryptooIndia/status/1868618473011880344 As taxation on VDA-related income already exists and with VDA transactions brought under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act since March 2023, the government said crypto assets are borderless and thus require international cooperation to prevent regulatory arbitrage. The adoption of the “ G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets ” during India’s G20 Presidency brought forth the pressing need for collaborative action at the global level while urging all jurisdictions, especially emerging economies, to develop risk-sensitive regulation.

This acquisition brings Riot’s total Bitcoin reserves to 17,429 BTC , valued at nearly $2 billion at current market prices. The announcement caused Riot’s stock to jump by 8%, showing strong investor confidence in its strategy. Riot, which began focusing on Bitcoin mining in 2018, operates from its Oklahoma facility and has since adopted a strategy similar to MicroStrategy's, led by Michael Saylor. This includes raising funds through share buybacks to expand its Bitcoin reserves. Riot’s Q4 Bitcoin yield stands at 36.7%, with a year-to-date yield of 37.2%, underlining steady growth despite share dilution. Other major Bitcoin investors are also making significant moves. Marathon Digital (MARA) recently purchased 11,774 BTC worth $1.1 billion, funded through a zero-coupon convertible note. Similarly, MicroStrategy announced its latest Bitcoin purchase, acquiring 15,350 BTC for $1.5 billion at an average price of $100,386. MicroStrategy’s total holdings now exceed $27.1 billion, with a Q4 Bitcoin yield of 46.4% and a year-to-date yield of 72.4%. MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has surged nearly 500% this year, closely tracking Bitcoin’s performance. This massive growth has placed the company among the top 100 publicly traded firms in the United States. Michael Saylor remains vocal about Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and a valuable corporate asset. Recently, he posted on X (formerly Twitter): “Everyone buys Bitcoin at the price they deserve. BTC doesn’t wait. It simply transfers wealth to those who see.” While Saylor continues to encourage businesses to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, not all companies are on board. Microsoft’s shareholders recently rejected a proposal to include Bitcoin in its treasury reserves. In contrast, Amazon’s shareholders have taken a different stance, suggesting that part of the company’s $88 billion cash reserves could be allocated to Bitcoin as protection against inflation. The growing interest in Bitcoin among companies like Riot Platforms, Marathon, and MicroStrategy highlights increasing institutional adoption. These firms are capitalizing on Bitcoin's potential as a long-term investment, despite ongoing debates about the risks of using equity and debt to fund large purchases. Riot’s recent acquisition reinforces its commitment to strengthening its Bitcoin reserves while benefiting from market optimism.

BTC’s latest jump renewed optimism in the alt market as eyes shift to the Santa rally. Amidst the enthusiasm, Avalanche (AVAX) released its highly-awaited Avalanche9000 upgrade on the mainnet yesterday.

Build for everything.This is the start of… Watch on Twitter View replies 11:02 pm · 16 Dec 2024 2.4K Reply Copy link Read 324 replies According to the X post, Avalanche9000 is vital in onboarding many Layer1 platforms on the mainnet. The new upgrade introduces various improvements that smoothen and reduce charges for launching subnets on the blockchain. An Avalanche subnet is a collection of nodes that collaborate to validate transactions across one or more independent blockchains. These subnets, which are customisable like other “blockchain-as-a-service” tools, allow for tailored solutions and unique tokenomics for specific use cases. Avalanche’s largest upgrade reduces deployment cost by 99.9% Avalanche, the layer1 platform that operates as a platform for custom blockchains and Dapps, introduced Avalanche9000 to enrich developer activity. Among various functionalities, the new upgrade reduces the charges of deploying a Layer1 network by 99.9%. Meanwhile, Avalanche’s upgrade is timely as the market is entering a phase where creators develop multiple Layer1 blockchains on testnet. Thus, the AVAX project could witness an influx of Avalanche-linked launches. Avalanche900 reduces the cost to deploy an L1 by 99.9%, and with hundreds of L1s being developed on testnet, look out for an explosion of launches in the coming months. Termed as “the largest upgrade in network history,” Avalanche9000 connects each Layer1 with advanced Interchain Messaging. The compatibility ensures smooth communication and asset transfers among all Avalanche L1s, promising collective success. Also, the upgrade includes ACP-77, designed to transform how validators maneuver. Moreover, the ACP-125 reduces the minimum gas fee on the primary “C-chain” network by 96%. Validators can validate specific subnets without verifying the main chain. Eventually, this will reduce hardware requirements and operational costs. The pre-existing approach required validators to stake over 2000 AVAX coins (worth around $100K at the token’s prevailing price) to validate the main blockchain. Blockworks Research believes Avalanche9000 will increase transactions on the central hub by 50%. Meanwhile, the altcoin has seen bullish development lately.

AVAX price performance The native token trades at $49.04 after losing 1.90% over the past 24 hours. AVAX appears ready to extend last week’s 10% surge. Source – Coinmarketcap AVAX is set for significant recoveries with optimistic ecosystem developments, with buyers targeting the $70 price . The new Avalanche9000 upgrade underscores a crucial milestone for the AVAX ecosystem. The improved features for deploying subnet platforms and significant cost reductions will boost Avalanche’s appeal to crypto projects and developers. With Avalanche spearheading advanced blockchain solutions, AVAX remains poised for massive price movements in the materializing bullish wave. Broad-based rallies could see AVAX flying towards $70 in the coming months. That would lead to a 43% surge from current prices. Avalanche9000 upgrade underscores the project’s dedication to creating a lucrative environment for crypto undertakings.

37750094,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394038,1734425193,Why Binance Coin (BNB) Could Be Your Best Bet this Crypto Bull Run,"The post Why Binance Coin (BNB) Could Be Your Best Bet this Crypto Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum (ETH) has skyrocketed past $4,000 in the past 24 hours, sparking renewed excitement across the altcoin market. This surge has many wondering: is a new bull run on the horizon for the entire altcoin space? With large-cap altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL) already testing their 2021 all-time highs, the market is showing signs of a major shift. But there’s more at play here than just Ethereum’s price movement — a deeper trend is unfolding. At the same time, Bitcoin dominance is showing signs of decline on the weekly chart. This shift is expected to speed up the movement of funds from Bitcoin into altcoins. Many analysts believe that after Bitcoin’s strong performance in the past two years, altcoins are likely to outperform Bitcoin in 2025. SOL and BNB: Key Market PLayers Following last month’s victory of pro-crypto US President Donald Trump , most of the projects majorly traded around the region experienced a sharp uptick in demand. For example, Ripple Labs’ XRP surged more than 5X to almost retest its all-time high, thus climbing to the third most valuable crypto asset by market cap. Solana has also seen impressive growth, recently revisiting its all-time high of over $250. This move pushed BNB out of the fourth position for a time. However, the situation is shifting again. In the past week, BNB outperformed other large-cap altcoins, gaining 4% to trade at around $715. In comparison, Solana and Dogecoin experienced small drops, around 1%. What’s Boosting BNB? As a result, BNB has overtaken Solana to become the fifth-largest crypto by market cap, now valued at approximately $104.7 billion. This rise in BNB’s price is closely tied to the success of the Binance ecosystem, which includes the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and the Binance exchange. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Litecoin & XRP Trades Within a Decessive Phase: Here’s When the XRP & LTC Prices May Breakout , Recent data shows the Binance ecosystem is thriving, with the BSC network holding a total value locked (TVL) of $5.8 billion and a stablecoins valuation of around $6.6 billion.

With a new ATH at $107,000, the global market capitalisation surges above $3.74 trillion, signalling the possibility of reaching $4 trillion in the next few months. Although a strong altseason is required to validate the claim, the BTC price is keeping the bullish momentum alive for now. After the recent breakout, it is quite evident that the bulls and the traders believed the peak of the prevailing run was not yet reached, suggesting an extended bullish push for the BTC price for some more days. Ever since some of the altcoins have begun to gain strength, the BTC dominance has been closely watched. Moreover, it has become the most talked-about topic within the markets as the levels are constantly failing, which is speculated to be a signal of a strong altseason. The reports from Santiment do validate the above claim, which says the traders mainly focused on the BTC dominance on social media and also the impact of altcoins. Meanwhile, the traders have largely been enticed towards Bitcoin, as nearly 40% of the trading volume is flowing into BTC. This sheds light on the growing confidence in the token as more and more traders are entering into trade. The data from Santiment shows a magnificent rise in the non-empty wallets, which has marked a peak. Ever since the trend reversal that occurred in November, the traders have become extremely optimistic about the next price action. As a result, the non-empty wallets over the network have surged to 54.6 million, a net increase of 2.71 million and marking a rise of over 5% over the past year. However, this rise in the non-empty wallets highlights the rise in the trader’s interest; however, this may certainly not be major to push the BTC price higher but to extract the profits at the highs. The data shared by analyst Ali suggests that traders are expecting a price drop soon, as more than 62% of them have opened BTC futures positions that are going short. However, this cannot be treated as a bearish signal, as the current price action suggests these shorts may witness a bloodbath. Another possibility could be a short squeeze incoming, wherein these shorts may be sold excessively, causing massive buying pressure and leading to a rapid increase in value. The Bitcoin (BTC) price currently appears to be extremely strong, with new highs above $107.5K, while market dynamics suggest a more bullish outlook.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-breaking-ath-after-ath-next-pitstop-for-the-btc-price-rally-could-be-110k-ahead-of-yearly-close/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37750053,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ftx-to-start-creditor-repayments-on-january-3,1734425153,FTX to Start Creditor Repayments on January 3,"FTX has confirmed that its Chapter 11 reorganization plan will officially take effect on January 3, 2025 , with repayments to creditors expected within 60 days. The company has partnered with BitGo and Kraken to manage the distribution process, finally offering hope to those impacted by its collapse. According to the official notice, eligible creditors must submit tax documentation and register with either BitGo or Kraken to receive their funds. If claims were transferred, payments will go only to the official transferee listed as of January 3. An additional 21-day period will allow objections before distributions begin. Further updates for other creditor groups are expected over the coming months. FTX creditors can choose to receive their repayments via USD wire transfer or stablecoins. Much of the repayment funds come from legal actions against other platforms. For example, FTX recently recovered $35 million from Gate.io after filing a lawsuit to reclaim $40 million in crypto assets. Similarly, FTX has pursued Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao, seeking $1.8 billion in allegedly misappropriated funds. Following these announcements, FTX’s native token, FTT, surged by nearly 10%, hitting its highest value in 10 months. A similar price jump occurred in November when the reorganization plan received court approval. However, FTT remains 96% lower than its all-time high from 2021, highlighting the long-term impact of the exchange's collapse. FTX’s reorganization plan, approved by the bankruptcy court in October, aims to repay about 98% of creditor claims, including users in the ""convenience class"" with claims under $50,000. These smaller creditors are expected to be among the first to receive repayments once the plan is implemented. The downfall of FTX began in November 2022, following a liquidity crisis and the resignation of founder Sam Bankman-Fried . Bankman-Fried was sentenced earlier this year to 25 years in prison for orchestrating the fraud. His close associate Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, received a reduced sentence of 24 months due to her extensive cooperation with prosecutors. Similarly, FTX co-founder Gary Wang avoided jail time entirely for his role in the case after assisting authorities. In a related move, the US government transferred $33.6 million worth of crypto seized from FTX to various wallets earlier this month, sparking speculation about a possible sell-off. FTX’s reorganization marks a major step toward closure for creditors, with the company actively recovering assets to distribute among its users. The two-year saga is finally reaching its final stages, offering some relief to those who lost funds during the exchange's collapse.",POSITIVE,FTT,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH | BNB | FTT,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ftx-to-start-creditor-repayments-on-january-3,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37750053.jpeg

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

The company paid an average price of $100,386 per Bitcoin, marking the first time it bought BTC at over $100,000 per coin. This latest acquisition increases MicroStrategy’s total holdings to 439,000 BTC , valued at approximately $27.1 billion. The company’s strategy of using Bitcoin as its main treasury asset reflects its confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term potential. MicroStrategy's Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor , has consistently promoted Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency devaluation. Under his leadership, the company has transformed its financial model, prioritizing Bitcoin over traditional investment methods. To fund this recent purchase, MicroStrategy raised $1.54 billion by selling 3.88 million shares of its Class A common stock. This approach avoids relying on loans or traditional debt, allowing the company to focus on expanding its BTC reserves through equity sales. The company reported impressive growth in its Bitcoin performance metrics. Between October 1 and December 15, it achieved a quarterly Bitcoin Yield of 46.4%, while the year-to-date figure soared to 72.4%. This yield highlights how effectively MicroStrategy uses its equity strategy to acquire Bitcoin. Michael Saylor remains a strong advocate for Bitcoin adoption, calling it a “digital capital asset” with unmatched long-term value. His vision has positioned MicroStrategy as a leader in corporate Bitcoin investment, setting a precedent for other companies considering similar strategies. Saylor sees Bitcoin as a safeguard against economic instability, a view that continues to drive the company’s aggressive acquisition approach. However, not everyone supports this strategy. Critics, including well-known economist Peter Schiff, argue that MicroStrategy's heavy reliance on Bitcoin carries significant risks. Schiff commented on social media that Bitcoin’s price could drop sharply if MicroStrategy stops buying or is forced to sell, particularly in a financial crisis. Such skepticism stems from Bitcoin’s volatile nature and concerns over the sustainability of MicroStrategy’s equity-based funding model. Despite these criticisms, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy appears successful so far. The company’s growing Bitcoin Yield demonstrates the potential of its long-term plan. Analysts describe its approach as both bold and innovative, showing confidence in Bitcoin’s future role as a corporate asset. While volatility remains a key challenge, MicroStrategy’s continued investments suggest it sees Bitcoin as a reliable store of value over time. MicroStrategy’s approach reflects its belief that Bitcoin is not just an asset but also a hedge against global economic uncertainty. With its total Bitcoin holdings now worth over $27 billion, the company’s leadership continues to push boundaries in the corporate world. Whether Bitcoin's price rises or falls, MicroStrategy’s unwavering strategy cements its reputation as a pioneer in corporate cryptocurrency adoption.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-hits-439-000-btc,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37749957.jpeg

Gox, the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange, has once again moved a significant portion of its Bitcoin holdings, sending $172.5 million worth of BTC to unknown wallets. The transfer, recorded on December 17, came less than a day after Bitcoin reached a new milestone of nearly $108,000. According to Arkham Intelligence, Mt. Gox transferred 1,619.6 BTC to two separate, untagged addresses. The movement was split into two parts — a larger transfer of 1,427.9 BTC and a smaller one of 191.7 BTC. Notably, a portion of the first transfer eventually ended up in a wallet beginning with “1DeY” after passing through another intermediary address. Meanwhile, the remaining 108 BTC and the 191.7 BTC cycled through multiple wallets before consolidating in a wallet starting with “1KLr,” which currently holds 300 BTC. Market Speculation Rises as Bitcoin Holds Firm The reason behind Mt. Gox’s recent Bitcoin movements remains unclear, as has often been the case with past transfers. The bankrupt exchange, which collapsed in 2014 following a massive hack, still holds around 36,085 BTC valued at around $3.86 billion across its controlled wallets, Arkham data reveals. These transfers come amid renewed market interest in Bitcoin. On December 5, Mt. Gox previously shuffled over 24,000 BTC worth $2.5 billion shortly after Bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark for the first time. Historically, such movements have triggered speculation about impending creditor payouts or sell-offs , often viewed as bearish indicators. However, despite the massive transfer on December 17, Bitcoin’s price remained steady, trading at $106,500 after briefly hitting a new high of $107,857. This stability signals strong market confidence as BTC continues to trade above the critical $100,000 mark since December 13. Creditor Repayments Delayed Yet Again Mt. Gox creditors, many of whom have awaited reimbursement for nearly a decade, are still in limbo. While creditors have the option to receive their payouts in Bitcoin, the process has faced repeated delays. In October, the trustee overseeing Mt. Gox’s remaining assets extended the repayment deadline to October 31, 2025, citing incomplete procedures on the part of several creditors. As the market watches closely, the latest Bitcoin transfer has reignited questions about Mt. Gox’s next move and its potential impact on BTC’s price trajectory. With Bitcoin holding firm despite the massive movement, investors appear to be maintaining a bullish outlook, for now. The post Mt.

37749766,https://coinpaprika.com/news/grayscale-opens-horizen-trust-as-crypto-market-rallies,1734424514,Grayscale Opens Horizen Trust as Crypto Market Rallies,"Grayscale has opened its Horizen Trust (HZEN) to accredited investors, offering exposure to ZEN tokens without needing to own or manage them directly. This move comes as Horizen (ZEN), a blockchain project utilizing zero-knowledge cryptography, completed its final halving , which has sparked a rally in the ongoing crypto bull market. However, ZEN's current value remains far below its all-time high in 2021. Grayscale has managed the Horizen Trust for several years, but until now, it wasn’t available for trading. The company’s decision to publicly open HZEN to investors aligns with its broader strategy of launching new Trusts and ETFs , despite facing challenges in the market. Horizen’s final halving marks a major milestone. Unlike Bitcoin’s repetitive halvings, this was the last one for ZEN, shifting to a new token model with a gradually declining emission rate. Halvings reduce the number of tokens issued as mining rewards, and historically, they often drive price increases. While ZEN’s token value is still only about 10% of its 2021 peak, the recent bull market and this final halving have brought renewed optimism. Grayscale explained in its announcement that the Horizen Trust allows investors to benefit from ZEN’s potential growth without the complexities of buying, securing, or managing cryptocurrency. ZEN is a minable token, and its price surged in 2021 during a booming crypto market. However, like many digital assets, it faced a severe crash and only stabilized in 2022. Recent gains hint at possible recovery, which might have prompted Grayscale to move forward with HZEN. Grayscale has been active with new offerings, including other Trust products. Recently, it launched Trusts based on Lido DAO, Optimism, and Stellar (XLM). The firm is also pursuing ETFs, applying for a Solana ETF earlier this month. However, not all of Grayscale’s moves have been smooth. Its ETFs face competition, especially from major players like BlackRock, which launched its own Bitcoin ETF earlier this year. Additionally, Grayscale sold $150 million in Bitcoin despite its rising value, raising questions about its long-term ETF strategy. Horizen’s current rally and its final halving could indicate better prospects, and Grayscale may be testing the waters by publicly opening HZEN. With the crypto market showing signs of recovery, Grayscale’s decision might reflect confidence in Horizen’s future, or it could be part of its broader expansion experiments. The long-term success of HZEN, however, remains uncertain given market volatility. In summary, Grayscale’s move to make Horizen Trust publicly available signals renewed interest in ZEN, despite its lower value compared to its peak. The final halving, combined with a bullish market , has brought some hope for Horizen’s recovery, while Grayscale continues to experiment with its Trust and ETF offerings. Investors will now watch closely to see if ZEN can sustain its upward momentum and whether Grayscale’s bet on Horizen pays off.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | LDO,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/grayscale-opens-horizen-trust-as-crypto-market-rallies,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37749766.jpeg

Gox moved $172.54 million Bitcoin to an unknown wallet as the market continues to gain momentum. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows the account transferred 1,619.6 Bitcoin earlier today. The transfer coincided with Bitcoin’s unprecedented surge past the $106,000 mark, a historic milestone for the cryptocurrency. Source: Arkham Intelligence The Mt. Gox still holds roughly 37,705 Bitcoin, valued at around $4 billion, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The Bitcoin market usually reacts to Mt. Gox-related wallet activities, but this latest move appears to have had little immediate impact. Bitcoin is trading at $106,800 at the time of publication on Tuesday. Bitcoin first surged above $100,000 earlier on December 4, pushing its market capitalization to an impressive $2 trillion. Mt. Gox Continues to Transfer Bitcoin Between Wallets The transfers occur against the backdrop of Mt. Gox’s extended repayment deadline, now pushed to October 31, 2025. The repayments are being made after a decade since the exchange collapsed. The collapse of Mt. Gox triggered years of legal proceedings and efforts to recover the lost assets. In 2018, approximately 200,000 Bitcoins were recovered, initiating a lengthy rehabilitation process under the oversight of a court-appointed trustee. Creditors have since been awaiting compensation, with multiple delays frustrating the process. Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin is closing out a bumper year full of historic milestones and with its price crossing the $100,000 mark and becoming the seventh-largest asset with a market capitalization larger than silver and Saudi Aramco. According to Bitfinex analysts looking ahead, the current run-up to over $100,000 has captured a significant portion of Bitcoinʼs price appreciation for this cycle.

37749635,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663237,1734424212,HYPE Frenzy: New Altcoin’s 200% Surge Vaults Past NEAR’s Market Cap,"A new altcoin, Hyperliquid (HYPE), is rapidly making waves in the cryptocurrency market, now ranking as the 28th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This ascent has seen HYPE surpass established coins like Near Protocol (NEAR), with its value soaring by 204% in just two weeks, bringing its market capitalization to around $8.93 billion. Exploring The Hyperliquid Protocol Examining the altcoin’s offerings is essential to better understanding the increased attention it has garnered over the past week. HYPE is the native token of Hyperliquid, a Layer-1 (L1) blockchain that utilizes HyperBFT technology. This tool reportedly allows Hyperliquid to facilitate “fast, secure, and transparent transactions,” bridging the gap between centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Specifically, with the protocol’s ability to handle over 100,000 transactions per second and a latency of less than one second, Hyperliquid addresses the performance limitations commonly associated with other blockchains such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks ATH Pushing Back Into Price Discovery – BTC To $130K? HYPE’s tokenomics include a burn mechanism to control supply and support price stability, a common practice seen in tokens such as Shiba Inu (SHIB). A strict vesting schedule is also in place to balance liquidity and mitigate selling pressure. The token offers various utility options for investors, including trading fee discounts, staking opportunities, and governance participation. HYPE holders benefit from reduced trading fees, which can significantly boost profitability, while staking their tokens allows them to earn rewards or provide liquidity in trading pools. New Listings And HyperEVM Launch To Boost HYPE? Recent insights from crypto analyst Ericonomic have also highlighted several compelling reasons to remain bullish on HYPE despite any short term correction for the Layer-1 altcoin. The analyst notes that Hyperliquid has seen all-time high in Circle’s stablecoin USDC deposits, indicating strong demand, while auction prices have also reached unprecedented levels, with significant purchases made by notable entities like MON Protocol. The total amount of USDC held on Hyperliquid has surged, showcasing robust liquidity. Moreover, many savvy traders have invested millions in HYPE and are publicly supporting the token, suggesting confidence in its future potential. Retail investors have yet to enter the market significantly, as HYPE is not yet available on Tier 1 centralized exchanges, this could be a notable catalyst for its price in case of gathering significant attention by these traders for the HYPE price. Related Reading: XRP Price Targets $3.34 After Corrective Downtrend Within Descending Channel Ericonomic has further drawn comparisons between HYPE and Binance Coin (BNB), noting that HYPE holders enjoy a more equitable distribution of fees, as all fees generated are directed back to the Hyperliquid protocol. Additionally, the community anticipates several upcoming catalysts, including new listings in major crypto exchanges and the introduction of HyperEVM, which could significantly enhance the platform’s capabilities. At the time of writing, HYPE has consolidated at the $26.91 level following a retracement from its record peak of $42, which was reached on December 12. Despite this correction, the token still reflects substantial gains of over 105% on a weekly basis, accompanied by trading volumes of $342 million. Looking ahead, it remains to be seen whether there will be sufficient catalysts to support the token after its recent correction.

Qubetics 6.8M Presale, Binance Prepares For a Breakout, and SEI Targets Record Highs","As the cryptocurrency market heads into December 2024, innovative projects like Qubetics, Binance, and SEI are capturing the spotlight. Each of these projects brings unique advancements and market potential, making them the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Let’s explore their latest developments and why they’re poised for success. Qubetics: Advancing Blockchain Interoperability In the current blockchain ecosystem, the lack of interoperability between networks remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Qubetics seeks to address this challenge by becoming a Web3-aggregated chain , unifying multiple networks into a cohesive framework. Through seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain functionality, Qubetics is unlocking the full potential of decentralised technologies. By enhancing collaboration across ecosystems, the platform empowers developers, enterprises, and users to build and operate efficiently across blockchain networks. This emphasis on interoperability positions Qubetics as a critical player in the evolution of Web3. By solving one of the industry’s most pressing challenges, Qubetics is setting the stage for the broader adoption of blockchain technology. With its strong technical foundation and growing ecosystem, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for forward-thinking investors. Binance: Symmetrical Triangle Signals an Upcoming Breakout The price action of Binance Coin (BNB) currently exhibits a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating market indecision but also hinting at the possibility of an imminent breakout. Recent price activity highlights the coin’s resilience and potential for upward momentum. The formation of a morning star pattern and the resilience above the $703.8 pivot level add to the bullish sentiment. While the market faces overhead supply, these technical patterns suggest that BNB is preparing for a significant move. As Binance remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, its token is well-positioned for continued growth. Investors looking for assets with strong technical setups and institutional backing will find Binance among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. SEI: Accumulation Phase Points to Potential Breakout The SEI token has been consolidating against Bitcoin, remaining within an accumulation range marked by stability and low volatility. This phase has seen frequent touches of the support level at 442 sats and consistent testing of the resistance at 800 sats, signalling a prolonged build-up phase. The inability to breach 800 sats thus far suggests strong resistance, but it also highlights the potential for a sharp upward movement once the level is surpassed. A clean break above 800 sats could act as the trigger for SEI to establish a new price trend and potentially reach new all-time highs (ATHs). SEI’s consistent accumulation and its growing presence in the blockchain space make it a promising choice for investors looking for emerging projects with breakout potential. For those seeking high-growth opportunities, SEI is among the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Conclusion: A December Full of Opportunities As December unfolds, projects like Qubetics, Binance, and SEI are leading the charge with their unique advancements and strong market potential. Whether it’s Qubetics’ focus on interoperability, Binance’s technical momentum, or SEI’s breakout potential, these cryptocurrencies offer exciting growth opportunities. For investors looking to capitalise on the evolving crypto market, these are the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 , offering innovation, resilience, and the potential for significant returns.

Ripple CTO David Schwartz said that the changes were necessary but slightly aggressive. XRPL CEO Daniel Keller claims that the reserve reduction was long overdue. Ripple’s blockchain network, XRPL, just lowered reserve requirements for using the XRP Ledger blockchain. Ripple CTO David Schwartz and XRPL CEO Daniel Keller talked about the changes with the XRP community as the altcoin climbed above $2.50. Schwartz Addresses XRPL Voting Mechanism Concerns On X (formerly Twitter) , Schwartz said XRPL’s voting mechanism, designed for coordinating features, isn’t ideal for governance. It can govern, Schwartz said, “but not particularly well.” Only active validators participate in voting, and sometimes, validators can be inactive. This can cause instability when decisions are close. To fix this, Schwartz suggested requiring validators to actively choose to vote on reserve increases. He also wants a default neutral position for reserve preferences. This would make the process more predictable and avoid unintended outcomes.

37749610,https://crypto.news/?p=14319987,1734424200,"FXGuys could outperform TRON and Ethena for $10,000 returns","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. FXGuys (FXG) could outpace TRON (TRX) and Ethena (ENA) to deliver $10,000 returns from $100. Table of Contents TRON’s $21.66 million day could indicate a strong price rally Ethena’s ENA struggles despite USDe’s growth FXGuys: The DeFi coin set to transform crypto trading Why FXG could outperform top altcoins and turn $100 to $10,000 One of the most interesting aspects of cryptocurrency investment is the possibility of turning a $100 investment into massive returns. To successfully do this, one must invest in the right crypto assets. Top altcoins like FXGuys (FXG) , TRON (TRX), and Ethena (ENA) have consistently shown impressive growth potential. Each crypto asset provides investors with unique and appealing features that make them stand out. But which of these tokens stands a better chance of outperforming the others with a $100 investment? TRON’s $21.66 million day could indicate a strong price rally On December 3, 2024, TRON recorded an all-time high in revenue, recording a massive $21.66 million in revenue for a single day. This massive feat sparked widespread attention and demand for the tokens, making TRX one of the top altcoins to buy. The record-breaking revenue followed TRX’s significant price surge, which saw the token price hit $0.44. These recent positive events have boosted investor confidence in TRON’s future. TRON’s TRX is expected to continue its upward surge with even stronger momentum in the coming year. Analysts say TRN’s TRX could reach the $1 price mark by 2025. Ethena’s ENA struggles despite USDe’s growth Ethena’s synthetic USDe stablecoin has grown exponentially since its launch in February 2024. With a market cap of $5.7 billion, it is now the third-largest stablecoin in the crypto market. This growth has been pushed by increased USDe adoption as new users chase 30% yields. However, the growth in the Ethena ecosystem has not translated to an ENA price surge. ENA is still affected by general market conditions, losing 4% over the past week. Analysts say ENA might not feel the effects of USDe’s explosive growth, keeping the token price around $1 till the end of 2024. However, other analysts say that Ethena’s ecosystem growth might eventually help ENA gain significantly in the long run.

37749575,https://crypto.news/?p=14320009,1734424164,Avalanche launches new Avalanche9000 upgrade with reduced deployment cost,"The Avalanche Foundation announced its ‘biggest network upgrade’ in the form of Avalanche9000 mainnet. The new upgrade reduces deployment costs and C-Chain fees by more than 90%. On Dec. 17, the Avalanche9000 mainnet goes live with a major upgrade dubbed Etna, which serves to eliminate issues faced by developers on the Avalanche ( AVAX ) network, including high staking requirements and high validator costs. The Etna upgrade fixes these issues by enabling layer1 blockchains to run independently from the primary network. This means that validators are no longer required to validate the primary network on Avalanche so these chains can have their own validator set. This major change simplifies the validation process for emerging layer1 projects and reduces operational and upfront fees significantly. https://twitter.com/AvalancheFDN/status/1868711367793877393 In the old subnet model, each new blockchain launched on Avalanche has to receive validation on the primary network. This step is accompanied by an upfront stake fee of at least 2000 AVAX tokens or worth around $100,000, as well as the hardware required to validate these chains. By introducing this upgrade, Avalanche claims to have reduced layer1 deployment costs by 99.9% and decreased C-Chain fees by 96%. In addition, Avalanche9000 simplifies the process of building layer1 blockchains on the network, thus bringing them into the market faster. Developers are given more control in customizing their layer1s in terms of staking, economics, gas, tokens and more. You might also like: Avalanche CEO calls for freezing Satoshi-era million Bitcoins amid quantum computing concerns One of the key features that this upgrade highlights is Avalanche’s built-in Interchain Messaging, which facilitates communication between the Avalanche C-chain and Avalanche layer1s. This feature works for both new and existing layer1s. Developers can use the messaging protocol to send and receive cross-chain EVM messages. Avalanche blockchains can send any type of information using ICM, including tokens, NFTs and oracle price feed data. As previously reported by crypto.news, the Avalanche Foundation first unveiled plans to release its Avalanche9000 upgrade on Dec. 2, calling it the “biggest network upgrade since the protocol launched.” The news was accompanied by an increase in overall quarter-on-quarter metrics during Q3 2024.

Speaking about the potential impact of such a move, Saylor drew comparisons to historic U.S. acquisitions such as the Louisiana Purchase and touched on the transformative financial opportunities it could bring. Saylor noted the significant value that Bitcoin could add to the U.S. economy. Drawing on proposals such as Senator Cynthia Lummis’ plan to acquire one million Bitcoins, Saylor estimated that such an initiative could add $16 trillion to the U.S. economy. Expanding on this, he noted that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s proposal to acquire 4 million Bitcoins could create a value of up to $56 trillion. Saylor noted that Trump could aim even higher, with potential earnings reaching $81 trillion, more than double the current U.S. national debt of $36 trillion. “All capital outside the US and outdated 20th century investments are shifting to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Saylor said. “The logical move for the US is to collateralize Bitcoin now and ‘own the future.’” Related News: il Capo Speaks After Bitcoin's Giant Bull Run! - How Long Does He Expect the Rally to Last? When asked if that meant chasing Bitcoin at every price, Saylor advocated a gradual accumulation strategy, likening it to gradually buying Manhattan over decades. “The US could acquire 20-25% of the Bitcoin network by reallocating gold reserves or taking on a small amount of debt,” he said. Saylor predicted that Bitcoin’s network value could increase 100-fold, suggesting an urgency to act before its exponential growth. Saylor said that it is important to establish a robust digital asset framework to fully leverage Bitcoin’s potential. He noted the need for clear definitions of digital commodities, currencies, securities, and tokens, as well as the rights and responsibilities of issuers, exchanges, and owners: “The opportunity for the U.S. is to issue $10 trillion worth of digital currency to support the dollar, generate $50 trillion in capital gains, and position itself as a leader in the $500 trillion tokenized asset market over the next two decades.” Saylor’s long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains extremely optimistic, with Saylor predicting that Bitcoin will appreciate at a 29% annual rate over the next 21 years, reaching $13 million per coin by 2045. *This is not investment advice.

Dogizen Prepares for Liftoff Amid A-Grade Partnerships,"The altcoin season we’ve all been waiting for has finally dropped, and there’s one token that’s looking like the next big crypto to 100x. Telegram gaming platform Dogizen has reeled in over $1.6m. And is offering those who invest today 41.56% in gains before the presale ends. With Dogizen being the first-ever Telegram ICO and benefiting from multiple partnerships with dynamite names in the Telegram space, 2025 is Dogizen’s for the taking. Here’s why. Why Dogizen is looking like 2025’s next big crypto Alongside the partnerships, the market for Telegram games is entering a golden age. The sector rocketed from essentially $0 last spring to over $1.5 billion in a matter of months. There are just a handful of players in this space, which means that almost every project is approaching blue-chip status. Sector leader Notcoin has cleared over $2 billion in market cap. And Catizen , a project whose market cap has cleared as much as +$200 million, has generated an average revenue per user 200x that of the average crypto project. Also, these projects are getting Binance listings faster than you can say CZ loves you. Makes sense—especially when you consider their insane ability to onboard new users thanks to their simple UX, easy accessibility via one of the world’s most popular messaging apps, and viral growth power due to them being easily referable between Telegram users. Plus, Telegram, in particular, is witnessing outsized growth right now. It’s nearly 1 billion users strong and is growing at a phenomenal rate. Especially in the developing world; African Telegram crypto communities have exploded by +180% since 2023 . How Dogizen improves on the competition Unlike the Notcoin/Hamster Kombat/Catizen cohort, Dogizen is holding an ICO instead of airdropping its tokens. Such a strategy resulted in all of Dogizen’s rivals seeing their token prices slump after launch. Dogizen’s ICO is designed to onboard the loyal. Getting buy-in before the token hits the open market encourages long-term holding, a key element of sustaining and pumping a token’s price. It’s also the only Telegram ICO in the messaging platform’s history. This means that Dogizen is being fed straight to Telegram’s nearly 1 billion strong audience. An audience that is already hyper-engaged with crypto and Web3. Dogizen partnerships are pouring extra gas into the tank From Telegram wallet Grindery to Telegram game SHARKS , Dogizen has teamed up with some of the best names in its space. Not only does this open Dogizen up to a 3 million+ audience, but it also gives Dogizen some juicy brand equity as it piggybacks on these big names. The crypto market has been forecast to triple in size next year. And it’s game-changing products in promising sectors such as Dogizen that are ready to see the outsized gains.

Even protocols with the best technology stand no chance if they don’t have a solid community built around them. This is one of the most important aspects of Web3: the power is truly held by the users, and without their presence, the technology is superfluous. The R0AR team understands this and aims to build around the community. The first step in this community-oriented approach can be found in the R0AR token presale, which acts as a gateway to the Executive R0AR Society NFT collection. By participating in the presale, individuals acquire R0AR tokens at a discounted price and gain the opportunity to secure a spot on the whitelist for the upcoming NFT mint. This allows them to become part of an exclusive community and enjoy a range of benefits within the R0AR ecosystem. This article will explore how R0AR is building a thriving DeFi community through its presale and NFT collection. We will discuss the importance of community engagement and the benefits of the R0AR NFTs. The Power of Community in DeFi An active and engaged community can make the difference between a crypto success story and a failure. It’s a critical pillar of any long-term plan, and just a quick look at some of the most successful crypto projects will reveal extremely active Telegram, X, and Discord communities. A strong community provides numerous benefits for a DeFi project. It can help to spread awareness, generate excitement, and attract new users. It can also serve as a valuable source of feedback, helping the team to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the platform is meeting the needs of its users. Community can also play a crucial role in the development and evolution of a DeFi platform. By providing feedback, suggesting new features, and contributing to the project’s codebase, they can help to shape its future direction and ensure its long-term success. In essence, a thriving community is the lifeblood of any successful DeFi project. It provides the foundation for growth, innovation, and sustainability, ensuring that the project remains relevant and responsive to the needs of its users. The R0AR Presale: Building a Foundation for Community Growth The R0AR presale has entered its sixth stage, with each token priced at $0.01. The next and final stage will see the price of the tokens rise to $0.025 before their listing on DEXs and CEXs. The presale has been instrumental in building a strong foundation for the R0AR community, attracting a diverse group of individuals who believe in the project’s vision. With over $3.6 million raised so far, the presale has demonstrated strong community support for R0AR and its commitment to building a comprehensive and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem. The R0AR token itself plays a crucial role in this ecosystem, serving as the key to accessing various features and benefits, including potential airdrops, staking rewards, and discounts on the xCHANGE. Beyond its financial implications, the presale also serves as a gateway to the upcoming NFT collection. By participating in the presale, individuals can secure a spot on the whitelist for the Executive R0AR Society NFT mint. This whitelist guarantees access to the NFT collection, ensuring that early supporters and community members have a fair chance to acquire these exclusive digital assets. The R0AR presale is nearing its final stage. The Executive R0AR Society: An Exclusive Community with Tangible Benefits The Executive R0AR Society (ERS) is the virtual gathering hub for early members of the R0AR community who got their wallet addresses onto the NFT whitelist during the R0AR token presale. It’s a limited-edition collection of 10,000 unique NFTs, each representing membership in this exclusive club within the R0AR ecosystem. The ERS NFTs are not just digital collectables; they are keys that unlock a range of benefits and opportunities within the R0ARverse. These benefits include access to a private community, participation in platform governance, and potential future airdrops and rewards. The NFTs themselves are of extremely high quality, featuring unique artwork and designs that reflect the R0AR brand and its values. They are more than just static images; they are dynamic assets that represent a commitment to the R0AR project and its vision for a decentralized future of finance. By holding an ERS NFT, users gain access to a variety of exclusive benefits. This includes entry into the “Penthouse Suite,” a private community space where members can connect, collaborate, and stay informed about the latest developments within the R0AR ecosystem. Furthermore, ERS members will be eligible for future R0AR token airdrops, giving them a stake in the project’s growth and success. They will also gain access to exclusive rewards and staking opportunities within the R0AR ecosystem, enabling them to earn additional benefits and maximize their returns. Anyone interested in getting their virtual hands on one of the R0AR NFTs should consider participating in the R0AR token presale .",POSITIVE,없음,TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | AIRDROP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/defi-community-building-with-r0ars-presale-and-nft-collection/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37748918,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393984,1734422702,Why Has British Columbia Banned Bitcoin Mining and How Long Will It Last?,"The post Why Has British Columbia Banned Bitcoin Mining and How Long Will It Last? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is on an impressive rally, reaching a new all-time high of $107K today. As its value soars, so does the demand for Bitcoin, but not everyone is on board with the cryptocurrency’s most essential process: mining. While many countries are focused on Bitcoin’s progress, some are still opposed to mining, which remains a critical factor in the cryptocurrency’s survival. As Bitcoin’s price rises, the issue is becoming even more complicated, and the demand for Bitcoin mining is expected to increase in the future. British Columbia continues to enforce Bitcoin mining ban While Vancouver’s City Council is exploring becoming a ""bitcoin-friendly city,"" British Columbia continues to enforce a province-wide ban on new Bitcoin mining connections to preserve power for clean energy initiatives,… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) December 17, 2024 The Bitcoin Mining Ban in British Columbia In British Columbia (B.C.), the battle over Bitcoin mining continues. Even though Vancouver’s City Council passed a motion to make the city “Bitcoin-friendly,” B.C. is sticking to its ban on new Bitcoin mining operations until December 2025. The ban, which started in December 2022, was put in place to conserve energy for more environmentally sustainable projects. Conifex Timber, a company that planned to mine Bitcoin, challenged the ban in court. However, in early 2024, the B.C. Supreme Court upheld the ban. B.C. relies on clean energy, with over 90% of its power coming from hydroelectric sources. Vancouver’s motion, introduced by Mayor Ken Sim, highlighted Bitcoin’s financial benefits, but it doesn’t change mining regulations because electricity distribution is under provincial control. B.C. is currently working on a permanent policy for crypto mining. New Policy Changes and Key Developments Earlier this year, B.C. updated the Energy Statutes Amendment Act, giving the provincial government direct control over electricity use for crypto mining. This change bypasses the BC Utilities Commission. It came after BC Hydro temporarily suspended Bitcoin mining connections to the provincial grid. Conifex Timber’s legal challenge argued that the ban was unfair, but the court ruled in favor of the province. This case raises an important question: if high-energy industries like Bitcoin mining face such regulations, could other industries — like AI or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) — face similar scrutiny? The Green Party raised this concern during the legislative debate, suggesting these sectors use a lot of energy with limited economic benefits. Bitcoin Mining Laws Across the U.S. and Canada B.C.’s approach to Bitcoin mining is similar to trends in other regions. For example, New York State has a mining moratorium with exceptions for renewable energy projects. On the other hand, states like Arkansas and Montana have passed laws to protect Bitcoin miners from discrimination. Pennsylvania recently lifted its mining ban to focus on energy conservation efforts instead. Bitcoin Mining Profitability in December Despite the regulatory challenges, Bitcoin mining remains profitable. According to a recent report by JPMorgan, Bitcoin’s hashprice — a measure of daily mining earnings — increased by 5% in December compared to November. The Bitcoin network’s hashrate also rose by 6% in December, reaching an average of 773 exahashes per second (EH/s). In the first two weeks of December, miners earned around $57,300 in daily block reward revenue per EH/s, the highest it’s been in seven months, though still 40% below levels before the last halving. Growth in U.S. Bitcoin Miners The combined hashrate of 14 U.S.-listed miners tracked by JPMorgan surged 94% year-to-date, reaching 222 EH/s, which makes up 29% of the global network. Despite this growth, their market cap fell by 4%, or $1.5 billion, even though it had increased by 50% after the U.S. election. These miners are trading at about twice their share of the block reward opportunity, reflecting the complex relationship between profitability, market conditions, and regulatory hurdles. With more players entering the Bitcoin mining arena and global regulations tightening, the road ahead for the cryptocurrency looks both promising and uncertain.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-long-will-british-columbias-bitcoin-mining-ban-last-amid-rising-global-demand/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Jones (@LindaPJones) December 15, 2024 Vitalik Buterin’s Comparison of XRP to Bitcoin The Vitalik Buterin comparison points to XRP’s technical advantages over Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has long been recognized as a store of value, it struggles with slow transaction times, limited scalability, and significant energy consumption. In contrast, XRP is designed for real-world use cases, specifically targeting the inefficiencies of cross-border payments. Buterin’s assertion that XRP is “better sound money” stems from its ability to process transactions in under five seconds with minimal fees, making it an ideal option for financial institutions seeking swift and low-cost solutions. Bitcoin, though dominant, remains challenged by network congestion and transaction costs, especially during periods of high demand. XRP’s infrastructure avoids these issues, offering a reliable alternative for high-volume, high-speed financial transfers. Jones’ tweet reminds investors and analysts, that these advantages position XRP as a practical and functional digital asset.

The stable digital asset is expected to integrate seamlessly with Ripple’s existing payment networks. XRP serves as the foundation for Ripple’s cross-border payment ecosystem, where it is used to bridge currencies and enable near-instant settlements. Ripple’s growing partnerships with financial institutions globally highlight the asset’s ability to address real-world financial challenges. Despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny, including Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP has maintained its position as a critical player in global finance.

As it stands, Revolut says, there is limited visibility into card transactions and bank transfers its crypto customers make with exchanges, potentially exposing them to higher levels of fraud due to card mechanisms having limited anti-scam protections.  A 12-month pilot of firms using Revolut Pay’s enhanced due diligence, direct API integration and end-to-end control over the payment process showed crypto customers were exposed to about 50% fewer attempts to defraud them, Revolut said in a statement.  These enhancements include know-your-customer (KYC) name matching, fraud warning screens, proof of crypto delivery and the ability for crypto merchants to receive transaction risk scores.  Crypto has more than its fair share of fraudulent activity and scams, whether that involves identity theft, phishing scams and even the involvement of AI deep fakes and so on.  “In the crypto space, there's a little bit of an issue with fraud outcomes,” said Alex Codina, general manager for merchant payments at Revolut in an interview. “Now, crypto firms, either exchanges or on-rampers, can integrate Revolut Pay as a payment method and by doing that we allow our users to directly buy crypto on those checkouts in a safer manner.”  Match your customer  Under the hood, the integration with third-party exchanges or on-ramps starts with KYC matching, so validating that the person who is buying on Revolut side is the same person who is KYC’d on the exchange’s side.   “If those names don’t match the transaction is rejected. In the card world, this would be the equivalent of a stolen card or something like that,” Codina said.  Beyond that, firms are in a running battle to combat a sophisticated array of investment scams, whereby customers are duped into thinking they need to perform some transaction or other to qualify for a fictitious reward of some kind, he added.  “These are the hardest ones to deal with,” Codina said. “Basically what we do is assess the risk score of the transaction based on information on our users, like if they have traded crypto in the past or not with Revolut, with a third party, and assess the probability of that transaction being part of an investment scam.”  Obviously, a balance has to be struck when it comes to user experience and safety, Codina said. The safety measures put in place by Revolut could be a question or two about the transaction, or in some cases the customer could be referred to a customer services manager to briefly chat about the transaction.  “We have a pretty robust model and framework where we can add some friction, depending on how risky we think the transaction is,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/17/revolut-to-strengthen-crypto-fraud-protections-with-added-security-risk-scores,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a2941e160c9f959ff5619be4fdc0a9356b34358-1500x888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin has just created yet another all-time high (ATH), so the stage may be set for an even bigger wealth rotation into altcoins in the coming weeks. With that in mind, here are five of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe is currently the hottest new emergent on the crypto market. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised over $24 million in just one week. It’s a meme coin that blends the laid-back demeanor of Pepe coin with the high-octane energy of Jordan Belfort, aiming to rally an army of hungry crypto traders. But it doesn’t stop there. Wall Street Pepe will equip its community with all the tools needed to succeed in crypto. Memes don’t sleep. Neither do I. pic.twitter.com/t19mAlxafI — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 14, 2024 Look on the Wall Street Pepe whitepaper; you’ll see plans for trading signals, alpha calls, meme coin picks, trading rewards, and staking – everything needed to get the most out of a crypto bull market. Users can access all this by purchasing the $WEPE presale, which is why it’s performing so well. Virtuals Protocol Virtuals Protocol is the best-performing crypto inside the top 100 by market cap today. Just like Wall Street Pepe is showing incredible momentum at presale, Virtuals Protocol is also proving a favorite. Momentum is crucial in crypto since it’s ultimately what moves prices. Virtuals Protocol is an AI project on the Base chain that allows users to create and own AI agents. Co-ownership of AI Agents is now live on @base , powered by #VIRTUAL Buy, trade and create AI Agents now at https://t.co/eNr7UssUfw Here’s how to get started: pic.twitter.com/VO2lfN1MKm — Virtuals Protocol (@virtuals_io) October 16, 2024 It’s trailblazing with a feature called Generative Autonomous Multimodal Entities (G.A.M.E), which allows AI developers to access and experiment with its AI agents via API and SDKs. Currently, Virtuals Protocol is trading at $2.83, up 19.4% in the past 24 hours and 395% in the past week. It holds a $2.83 billion market cap and a $234 million 24-hour trading volume. Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Stars is a new staking platform for meme coins that lets users generate passive rewards on their Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Brett, Bonk, Mog Coin, and more. Users will earn $STARS rewards but can earn up to three times more by maximizing their $STARS holdings. Meme coins and AI have been the two most dominant narratives through 2024. Right now, AI tokens are surging, and projects like Crypto All-Stars and Wall Street Pepe continue to storm ahead. The All-Stars ride to their launch in style Want to ride along? Get your $STARS before it's too late: https://t.co/8IZTKBdAp2 pic.twitter.com/9iOZEbkRIx — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 15, 2024 Crypto All-Stars is undergoing a presale and has raised $18 million, showing huge market demand. The presale will end in four days, and then $STARS will be listed on exchanges. With an innovative use case and strong presale momentum, the token price will likely soar once it hits the open market. As such, investors should not wait around to buy the Crypto All-Stars presale. Stacks Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high (ATH) today, and its leading layer 2 cryptocurrency, Stacks, is also racing ahead. Stacks is building a layer 2 blockchain that will help with Bitcoin’s congestion and scalability issues, opening it up to a wide range of new applications. And it doesn’t end there. Stacks even introduces smart contract functionality to its layer 2, which means developers can create versatile apps while benefitting from the security, decentralization, and permanency of the Bitcoin blockchain. Stacks' sBTC will pave the way for the Bitcoin economy sBTC is being embraced by the crypto world, with many leading entities and institutions adopting Stacks' novel way to move BTC to the $STX L2. Let's highlight a few of them in this thread, starting with Solana 1/6 pic.twitter.com/SDfQLUQP9p — stacks.btc (@Stacks) December 4, 2024 As is often the case when Bitcoin rallies, Stacks has outperformed. It’s up 14% in the past 24 hours with a $3.7 billion market cap and a $455 million 24-hour trading volume. If Bitcoin continues to surge, this provides a favorable juncture for Stacks to keep gaining. Solaxy On layer 2 blockchains, Solaxy is bringing the technology to Solana for the first time. While Solana is highly scalable with 6,500 transactions per second (TPS) capabilities, it’s industry-leading ecosystem activity means it remains under intense strain and often subdues to congestion, scalability issues, and failed transactions. Solaxy is fixing this by creating a layer 2 blockchain that bundles transactions off-chain and reports back to Solana for finality. This bolsters scalability while maintaining Solana-grade decentralization and security. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 And here’s the interesting part: it’s currently just three days into its presale. Unlike Stacks, which is already worth $3.7 billion, investors can buy $SOLX at a $500K valuation today. However, the presale is soaring ahead so prospective buyers should move quickly. The Solaxy presale price is incrementally increasing with next increase in one day or when the total raise hits $673K. ​​",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/solaxy-presale-price-is-incrementally-increasing-with-next-increase/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The stolen funds were swapped for Ethereum (ETH) and transferred to various instant exchanges from Ethereum to Bitcoin (BTC), ZachXBT wrote on Telegram . The LastPass security breach originated in December 2022, when attackers stole vast data, including customer keys and API tokens. Last year, ZachXBT and MetaMask developer Taylor Monahan reported tracking the movement of funds from 80 compromised wallets . The wallets were targeted on October 25, 2023, where around 25 individuals have reportedly lost $4.4 million in crypto. Another batch of crypto hacks tied to LastPass was reported in February 2024, resulting in losses of over $6.2 million. “Cannot stress this enough, if you believe you may have ever stored your seed phrase or keys in LastPass migrate your crypto assets immediately,” wrote ZachXBT in a post last year. US Court Filed Lawsuit Against LastPass Early in 2023, several users reported losing significant amounts of crypto from wallets. LastPass stored the keys of these user wallets. Following the incident, the US District Court of Massachusetts filed a lawsuit against the company in January 2023. The court alleged that the company failed to protect user data adequately. The attack apparently allowed hackers to gain access to the corporate laptop of an engineer working for the platform. The employee laptop provided them with the source code, confidential technical documentation, and internal system secrets. The hackers also stole the backup of encrypted customer vault data. This could be decrypted if the attacker successfully guessed the account’s master password through brute force. The first breach enabled the attacker to extract 14 of LastPass’s 200 source code repositories, Cryptonews reported last year. This was followed by a more extensive attack, leading to the acquisition of a copy of the LastPass customer database.

The digital asset’s value relative to gold has grown significantly, breaking through the highest value ever as institutions show increasing interest in BTC ETFs. Although gold is widely considered a strategic reserve asset, Bitcoin is rapidly gaining momentum. Bitcoin’s value relative to gold has soared to its highest value, signifying a potential shift in strategic reserve preference. Bitcoin-to-gold ratio surges to a historic 37.3 Just in: Bitcoin-Gold Ratio Hits New All-Time High! On Dec. 16, 1 $BTC equaled 40 ounces of gold as Bitcoin soared past $106K, with gold trading at ~$2,650. A milestone showcasing Bitcoin’s growing dominance as a store of value. 🚀 #Bitcoin #Gold #Crypto pic.twitter.com/5kV2495JJh — Andres Meneses (@andreswifitv) December 16, 2024 The BTC-to-gold ratio, which measures how many ounces of gold one Bitcoin can buy, broke through the highest levels. The ratio is calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s price by gold’s spot price per ounce. The value is then used to compare the relative strength between Bitcoin and gold. On Monday, the ratio sat at a record-breaking 37.3 as Bitcoin broke through the $106k. The ratio signifies that one Bitcoin can purchase about 37 ounces of gold. The current Bitcoin-to-gold ratio has surpassed that witnessed in the previous bull cycle, which peaked at 36.7 in November 2021. Sidney Powell, CEO and co-founder of institutional capital marketplace Maple Finance, said Bitcoin’s rally shows the cryptocurrency’s adoption and maturity as an asset class. The executive told Decrypt that he expects the ratio to “catch up” as spot BTC ETF inflows continue to propel Bitcoin’s price. Powell also noted that Bitcoin is increasingly being considered a staple part of balanced portfolios. Singapore-based digital asset trading firm QCP Capital wrote on Monday that the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio aligns with Bitcoin being considered digital gold. The asset trading firm also noted that Bitcoin has retained its position as the best preference for storage of value over traditional gold. “The BTC/Gold ratio reached an all-time high during the move, amplifying Bitcoin’s status as “digital gold” and cementing its position as an increasingly favored store of value over traditional gold.” ~ QCP Capital The note also highlighted that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 reinforced the prevailing market sentiment. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s chair, hinted that the company would purchase more Bitcoin despite the asset pricing above $100k. MicroStrategy adopted Bitcoin as a strategic reserve in 2020 and has become the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy has doubled down on the asset since then and now holds $46.87 billion in Bitcoin. Governments hint at adopting BTC as a reserve asset Michael Saylor’s company has inspired other companies to adopt BTC as a strategic reserve. Nasdaq-listed Solidion recently pledged to allocate 60% of its cash reserves to purchase Bitcoin. Metaplanet also mirrored Michael Saylor’s approach and adopted the asset as a strategic reserve. As more corporations join the bandwagon, governments worldwide consider Bitcoin a strategic national reserve asset . President-elect Donald Trump promised to establish a national Bitcoin reserve asset, which has sparked discussions in other countries such as Russia, Brazil, Poland, and Japan. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Michael Saylor advised the incoming administration to sell the country’s gold reserves and adopt Bitcoin instead. Saylor also discouraged the U.S. government from buying more gold for its national reserve.

It’s the perfect setup for a festive altcoin pump. But what projects will perform the best? That’s the question we answer in this article. Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Stars is one of the top presales taking place right now, but it ends in four days. Investors are faced with their last opportunity to buy $STARS at a fixed and discounted rate, and many are scrambling to not miss out. The presale has raised over $18 million so far, showing massive market appeal. Crypto All-Stars is the first unified staking platform for meme coins. It allows users to lock up their Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Mog Coin, Brett, and other tokens and earn $STARS rewards in return. POV: You're on your way to the Crypto All-Stars launch. pic.twitter.com/n5IP4mUbuC — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 14, 2024 But here’s the kicker: they can earn up to three times more tokens by maximizing the amount of $STARS they hold. Users can also stake $STARS for even more gains. All of this creates a significant demand source for $STARS, which could translate to explosive price growth once it is listed on exchanges. Wall Street Pepe What happens when you mix the ruthless ambition of Jordan Belfort with the iconic laid-back energy of Pepe coin? You get Wall Street Pepe – the most viral ICO on the market. The project launched on 10 December and has already raised $24 million. For perspective, that’s $6 millon more than Ethereum raised in its 2014 ICO. Wall Street Pepe aims at traders sick and tired of watching others get rich while they’re left counting marginal gains. It’s a project for degens who “choose rich.” https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1863905080426058015 And it’s equipping them with the tools for success. Trading signals, meme coin picks, data insights, trading rewards, and staking are all available. The presale is ongoing and currently priced at $0.0003644, but this will rise as the campaign advances.

Visit Best Wallet Presale Solaxy Solana is the most active blockchain, with 4.5 million users in the past 24 hours. This activity puts a huge strain on the ecosystem’s infrastructure, which often leads to issues such as congestion, scalability constraints, and failed transactions. This worsens the user experience and caps the growth of Solana’s ecosystem. But Solaxy is a new project with a solution. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 It follows Ethereum’s scalability blueprint by introducing the first layer 2 blockchain to Solana. Think of the Solaxy blockchain as a highway that gets you where you’re going cheaper and faster than if you were to use a congested street. Solaxy will bundle transactions off the main network, processing them at a lower cost and higher speeds than Solana. However, it will report all transactions to Solana for finality, ensuring it maintains Solana-grade security and decentralization. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised $500K in its first two days. Visit Solaxy Presale Flockerz Flockerz is a bird-themed meme coin with a twist: the community is in complete control.

Today, investors can buy at a discounted market cap of $179 million, which is an ideal entry point for those who missed the initial pump.

The company has earmarked $524,000 to support its launch, marking its first foray into the Argentine market, as per a report from Argentinian news website Mercado . This investment will finance the purchase of new crypto ATMs, the opening of physical stores, and compliance with local regulations. BitBase’s move reflects a growing trend of crypto expansion in the country as businesses and regulators increasingly embrace digital assets. BitBase to offer in-person support BitBase plans to strategically place its new crypto ATMs across various parts of Argentina. The company has already established a physical base in Recoleta, a prominent district in Buenos Aires, as a key step towards launching operations. In addition to the ATMs, BitBase will open stores to offer in-person support and educational services. These initiatives aim to bridge the knowledge gap and encourage safer cryptocurrency adoption. To support its expansion, BitBase has hired 10 staff members in Argentina and established local partnerships. Among these is a collaboration with the NGO Bitcoin Argentina, an influential organisation that promotes digital asset awareness. The partnership seeks to educate users on safely navigating the crypto market while mitigating risks like fraud and scams. BitBase to enable bank card transactions BitBase’s Regional Director for Argentina, Nadia Karabin, confirmed that users will soon be able to buy and sell cryptoassets using bank cards. The company expects this feature to roll out within a few months, further simplifying access to cryptocurrencies for Argentine users. This development aligns with BitBase’s existing model in Spain, where it operates 135 Bitcoin ATMs, 24 physical stores, and serves over 35,000 active users. Launched in 2017, BitBase has grown to employ 50 staff and continues to expand its footprint globally. Its entry into Argentina comes at a time when the country’s economic challenges, including historically high inflation, have fuelled growing interest in decentralised financial systems. Argentina’s crypto landscape BitBase’s expansion coincides with Argentina’s efforts to strengthen its cryptocurrency regulatory framework. A recent cooperation agreement between Argentina’s National Securities Commission (CNV) and El Salvador’s Digital Assets Regulator highlights this shift. The strategic alliance aims to enhance regulatory practices, fostering the safe integration of digital assets into Argentina’s financial ecosystem. While inflation in Argentina has slightly eased in recent months, its impact on the economy has accelerated cryptocurrency adoption. Digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) are increasingly viewed as a hedge against economic instability. In response, regulators such as the CNV have indicated a more open stance towards collaboration with domestic crypto ventures to facilitate secure, compliant operations. BitBase’s entry into Argentina underscores the growing demand for crypto infrastructure in Latin America. As digital assets continue to gain mainstream traction, businesses and regulators are working together to create a secure environment for crypto adoption. The company’s investment not only addresses market demand but also paves the way for further innovation in Argentina’s evolving financial landscape.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/chill-pepe-chilpepe-solana-memecoin-will-surge-14000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-doge-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37748090,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393954,1734420944,Metis Paves the Path to True Decentralization with Rewards for Decentralized Sequencer Nodes and Users,"The post Metis Paves the Path to True Decentralization with Rewards for Decentralized Sequencer Nodes and Users appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Despite decentralization being a main pillar of blockchain technology, Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions utilize single sequencers to organize transactions and put them in a block for validation. From a user’s standpoint, this means lower gas fees and faster finality, but this comes at the hefty price of centralization—counterintuitive to the ethos of Web3. The L2 and rollup environments are currently vulnerable to single points of failure. If a single sequencer goes offline, the entire chain comes to a halt, as we have already seen with Arbitrum . This means a loss of opportunity for the user and a loss of trust in the project and technology. Additionally, a single centralized sequencer also exposes an L2 to other vulnerabilities like front-running, transaction censorship, and denial of services. So, while centralized sequencers are quick and cost-effective, there’s a higher risk of failure or censorship on top of one entity taking all the network revenue. Hence, the focus is on a decentralized sequencer, which utilizes a network of nodes to sequence the transactions at random. While decentralized sequencers perform with increased latency, they are far more secure and resilient. Also, these systems enable incentives alignment with revenue sharing—innovations that allow the average user to participate and earn rewards. So, in alignment with blockchain ethos, Metis has established itself as the first Layer 2 running a decentralized sequencer (dSeq). After the successful community testing of dSeq on the testnet, the decentralized sequencer went live on the mainnet earlier this quarter. Then, the onboarding of independent dSeq clients began, which enhanced the reliability and security of Metis’ core infrastructure. Meanwhile, the decentralized sequencer nodes get the opportunity to earn rewards in METIS tokens for their role in transaction processing and block production. Moreover, active participation helps increase nodes’ recognition within the community, creating possibilities for future collaborations and partnerships. Several entities, including Artemis , ENKI , Hashkey Cloud , OKX , and more, have already joined the Metis network and are currently contributing to its reliability, decentralization, and stability. The more nodes and entities engaged in sequencing, the more challenging it becomes for malicious actors to control or compromise the L2. At the same time, these nodes earn from transaction fees on top of being rewarded by the Metis network for their contribution. The current expected mining rewards rate for these nodes is 20%, available for a limited time period of the first 12 months, with a total of 34,869 METIS already distributed as rewards (at the time of this writing). This is simply an excellent opportunity for anyone looking to contribute to the growth and success of an innovative project and, in exchange, earn rewards, creating a win-win situation for all. This is just the tip of the iceberg, though, with what a node can achieve by being involved with Metis. A few months ago, the project began distributing grants through a new grants system for developers, innovators, and community members to help expand the network. Now, to further boost participation, Metis has introduced a Decentralized Sequencer Reboot campaign. According to the campaign documents, which takes a two-pronged approach to revitalizing the Metis Decentralized Sequencer and supporting upcoming markets and changes to Metis, decentralized sequencer nodes and liquid staking tokens (LST) can now apply for rewards. These performance-based rewards are multitiered, offering increased benefits. More details about the specific rewards structure is to come in the following days. There are also ongoing business development efforts aimed at attracting liquidity and node operators from reputable projects by offering them incentives and support. Large liquidity providers, after all, are always looking for better and safer places to park their liquidity. Amidst the ongoing bull market, Metis, with its rewards, marketing subsidies, and a focus on creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem, is well-positioned to capture interest and capital. To make sure these efforts are not in vain, Metis has based its reward on performance tiers, with higher tiers being “unlocked” once a certain performance indicator is reached. Metis Decentralized Sequencer nodes can earn up to 5,000 METIS every month on a successful application, while nodes that have LST protocols, which provide DeFi opportunities to users and boost network utilization, stand to earn as much as 10,000 METIS monthly. With enticing incentives, funding support, and additional benefits in the works, Metis aims to offer enhanced growth and stable foundational assistance to participants while attracting liquidity and new users, including institutions, to expand its ecosystem. Overall, these latest moves from Metis showcase the project’s commitment to its users and active contributors, who are the core of its growth and success. Through these rewarding initiatives, Metis aims to bring the most value to its users and turbocharge participation that will catapult Metis to the forefront of technological innovation, ecosystem expansion, and user engagement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/metis-paves-the-path-to-true-decentralization-with-rewards/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Let’s dive into the tokenomics of some notable AI projects and their upcoming supply expansions. $TAO (Bittensor): High Emission Impact Bittensor leads the pack with a projected 3.02% increase in circulating supply over the next month, adding $129.26 million in value to the market. This significant emission could introduce increased liquidity and selling pressure. Investors should closely monitor trading volumes and price movements to assess market appetite for absorbing the additional supply. $AKT (Akash Network) and $AIOZ (AIOZ Network): Moderate Emissions Both $AKT and $AIOZ are set to expand their circulating supplies by 0.82% ($7.92 million) and 0.59% ($7.37 million), respectively. These moderate emissions reflect a measured approach, balancing token dilution while maintaining a controlled release schedule, minimizing shocks to the market. $FET (FetchAI) and $RENDER (Render Network): Conservative Strategies FetchAI and Render Network exhibit the most conservative supply expansion strategies. $FET will see a modest 0.30% increase, equating to $14.15 million, while $RENDER plans a minimal 0.10% increase, adding $4.60 million. These strategies are designed to protect token value by limiting supply-side inflation, especially during periods of market volatility.

The disconnect between Aave’s robust revenue growth and $AAVE’s underwhelming price performance has puzzled many in the DeFi community. While the platform’s fundamentals remain strong, the bearish sentiment around $AAVE raises concerns about broader market trends affecting DeFi tokens. The decline comes as a surprise given Aave’s continued success as a top-tier DeFi platform. The $500 million in annual revenue underscores its importance in the space, yet it has not been enough to reverse the token’s downward trajectory. As Aave continues to innovate and lead in DeFi, the challenge remains to translate its platform success into stronger price action for $AAVE. Investors will be watching closely to see if improved market conditions can help the token recover in the coming months. For now, $AAVE’s price dip serves as a reminder of the complexities of the crypto market, where platform growth doesn’t always guarantee token appreciation.

37750946,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320080,1734419867,"Lido Staking Protocol to Cease Operations on Polygon, Shifts Focus Back to Ethereum","Lido Finance has announced its decision to end staking services on the Polygon network, citing limited user adoption, evolving DeFi trends, and a renewed strategic emphasis on Ethereum. In a recent blog post, the Lido Finance team said the decision was made after a request by Lido DAO Token (LDO) holders , “extensive DAO forum discussion,” and a community vote where 99% favored the proposal. The proposal considered two options: discontinuing Polygon support or reassessing the economics of Lido’s middleware. Lido Exits Polygon Amid Challenges The decision to exit Polygon was attributed to multiple challenges, including high maintenance demands, insufficient staking rewards, and the increasing prominence of zkEVM technology in the DeFi space. Lido’s team stated that the rise of zkEVM-focused solutions reduced demand for liquid staking on Polygon’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain , impacting its growth potential within the DeFi ecosystem. “This transition has led to reduced demand for liquid staking solutions on Polygon POS, affecting Lido on Polygon’s potential as a foundational DeFi building block,” the Lido team said. “Additionally, alternative liquid staking solutions have been built within an ecosystem that proved smaller than initially anticipated.” Shard Labs, which initially proposed Lido’s Polygon integration in 2021, acknowledged the shift in DeFi priorities. They noted that the community’s pivot toward zkEVM solutions had diminished the role of Polygon’s PoS chain as a core DeFi component. As of December 16, Lido has stopped accepting new staking requests on Polygon. However, users can continue withdrawing their staked MATIC via Lido’s interface until June 16, 2025. Justification The Lido on Polygon sunset process is taking place following extensive discussions across Lido DAO forum and a governance vote by LDO token holders. A strategic refocus on Ethereum and lack of scalability on Polygon POS has led to the discontinuation of staking… — Lido (@LidoFinance) December 16, 2024 All staking rewards have been suspended, and there will be a brief halt in withdrawal services between Jan. 15 and Jan. 22, 2024. By June 2025, Lido’s front-end support for Polygon will end, with users required to process withdrawals through browser tools. Lido Exits Solana Due to Financial Constraints Lido’s exit from Polygon follows a similar move last year when it ceased operations on the Solana blockchain due to financial constraints and low fees. This trend highlights Lido’s strategy to streamline operations and concentrate resources on Ethereum, where it holds the largest market share for liquid staking. Currently, Lido’s total value locked (TVL) stands at $38 billion, according to DefiLlama, making it the largest liquid staking protocol in the DeFi market. Data from Dune Analytics shows that Lido’s staked tokens on Polygon are valued at $45 million, while Polygon’s overall TVL surpasses $1.2 billion. Lido’s departure from Polygon aligns with broader shifts in the DeFi space. Aave, a leading lending protocol, has also proposed ceasing operations on Polygon due to risk concerns related to bridged assets. Aave chain founder Marc Zeller submitted the proposal on December 13, urging caution as Polygon’s governance plans to deploy over $1 billion in stablecoin reserves for yield farming on external protocols.

With $BTFD Coin rallying over 5,600 holders , Turbo Coin delivering an impressive 30% price surge, and Fartcoin pushing its market cap to a jaw-dropping $800 million, these projects are undoubtedly the best meme coins to invest in now. The momentum around $BTFD Coin’s presale is especially worth noting. The project has already raised over $4 million, selling more than 55 billion coins. Its meteoric rise began with $1 million raised in just ten days, quickly climbing to $2.5 million in under 14 days. The growth has been phenomenal, pulling in a dedicated community that continues to expand. Turbo’s sudden price spike has caught the eye of savvy traders, while Fartcoin’s impressive valuation proves the enduring appeal of meme coins. Let’s explore what’s driving these projects and why they should be on your radar. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin with Real Value BTFD Coin has solidified its position as one of the most exciting meme coins in the market. With a name that screams confidence, a high-energy community, and innovative features, it’s clear why investors are charging into this project. One of the key highlights of BTFD Coin is its staking program, which offers an average APY of 90%. Unlike typical meme coins that rely solely on hype, $BTFD rewards its holders by letting them earn passive income simply by holding and staking their tokens. This feature has made it a favourite for both meme coin enthusiasts and more traditional crypto investors looking for reliable returns. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game is another standout feature. Players can immerse themselves in a Bulls-themed adventure where they earn rewards that can be converted into real $BTFD tokens. This unique blend of gaming and investment opportunities has attracted a wide audience, from casual gamers to serious crypto enthusiasts. The community backing the coin, with over 5,600 active holders, adds even more credibility to its meteoric rise. If you were to invest $3,000 in $BTFD Coin at its current presale price of $0.00013, you’d receive approximately 23,076,923 tokens. Once the coin reaches $0.0006 post-presale, that investment could grow to $13,846. If the price continues to rise to $0.001, the potential value of your holdings could soar to $23,077. BTFD Coin is showing every sign of being a meme coin that delivers significant returns, making it an essential pick for any portfolio. How Do You Buy BTFD Coin? Buying BTFD Coin is simple and investor-friendly. Start by setting up a digital wallet, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund your wallet with ETH, BNB, or USDT, and then head to the presale page to purchase your tokens. After confirming your transaction, your BTFD tokens will be available to claim once the presale ends. This straightforward process ensures anyone can join the bullish movement. Turbo Coin: A Fast-Moving Contender Turbo Coin has proven that speed matters in the meme coin race. This week, Turbo surged by 30%, a move that sent waves through the market. The spike followed a significant partnership with a leading decentralised exchange (Coinbase), which increased Turbo’s daily trading volume by 50%. What’s more, Turbo has been named the second largest AI-powered meme coin by market cap, the first one being GOAT. As for its live price, it’s $0.01092, with analysts predicting it could hit $0.0247 on the higher end in 2025. Turbo’s rapid growth and clear roadmap make it a strong choice for investors looking to capitalise on short- to medium-term gains. Fartcoin: From Laughter to Serious Gains Fartcoin, once a joke, has become a meme coin heavyweight with an $800 million market cap. Crypto experts have gone as far as to claim it’ll hit the $1 billion mark soon. There have been several arguments regarding its sudden surge, with some analysts backing up the theory that it’s all due to the US election results. I mean, if that was after Bitcoin’s recent $100K rise, why shouldn’t it affect the price of other meme coins, right? Currently priced at $0.8616, Fartcoin is projected to gain 175.99% by 2025. With its combination of humour, viral appeal, and solid tokenomics, Fartcoin continues to defy expectations and deliver impressive results for its holders. Why These Coins Are the Best Meme Coins to Invest in Now Meme coins are no longer just about fun and games—they’re serious investment opportunities, and BTFD Coin, Turbo Coin, and Fartcoin exemplify this shift. Each coin offers unique advantages. BTFD Coin’s staking rewards, P2E game, and strong community make it a standout, while Turbo Coin’s fast price growth and Fartcoin’s viral appeal give them their own competitive edge. Whether you’re looking for long-term value or quick profits, these projects have something to offer. Wrap Up: Join the BTFD Coin Presale Before It’s Too Late BTFD Coin’s presale is moving fast, with over $4 million already raised. If you’re looking to secure your spot in one of the most exciting meme coin projects of the year, now’s the time to act.

37747535,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628724,1734419280,FOMO is Real: Vantard ICO Investors Already Up 65.76%,"Right now, Vantard is printing money for early investors. Thanks to the team of quant prodigies behind the Vantard Meme Portfolio (VMP)—effectively the world’s first actively managed memecoin portfolio—some of the market’s most lucrative coins from Zerebro to Popcat were stacked nice and early. The result? Vantard’s basket of memecoins has skyrocketed in value by 65.76%—no wonder degens looking to play this supercycle on easy mode are aping in, with $955k raised already. For now, VTARD tokens are available for just $0.00011, which looks like a bargain given the diversified gems in the VMP, Vantard’s burgeoning meme premium, and the quant team’s industry-leading performance. Let’s dive into one of the year’s best ICOs. Vantard: Surf the supercycle on autopilot The crypto market is heating up, and Vantard takes the pressure off, allowing investors to trust in a team of expert quants with a proven track record to bag gems early while they’re nice and undervalued. This is effectively the S&P 500 of memecoins, so no wonder it’s popping off on the main stage. In case you’ve been living under a rock, it’s worth remembering we’re in the midst of an unprecedented memecoin supercycle. And in the coming months, we will witness some once-in-a-generation price action. Until Vantard, traders could sit on the sidelines with the TradFi tribe and watch as millionaires get minted—or join all the other degens by wading into a stormy and volatile ocean of a market with no life jacket. But now, thanks to Vantard, investors don’t just have a jacket—they’ve got a full-scale raft packed full of the data, flexibility, and unteachable intuition they need to unlock their ultimate earning potential while others sink beneath the selling pressure and get drowned by margin calls. Early to every trend: Why Vantard is dominating its meme rivals Vantard basically has this cycle’s cheat code: know what to buy before anyone else and know what to sell before the market even knows what to buy. Every emerging trend, every fresh-faced meta, is flooding into the Vantard treasury like it’s being managed by a caffeinated Warren Buffet. Take ai16z, for instance—Vantard’s quants loaded up on tokens while sweaty and FUD-afflicted paper hands were busy panic selling. The result? AI16Z skyrocketed to a new ATH and delivered blockbuster gains without VTARD investors even lifting a finger, while bears were left to weep into their bowl of Cap’n Crunch. AI has formed a rock-solid foundation for the VMP, and with notable analysts targeting a $250 billion sector valuation—we’re only at about $40 billion right now —send season is about to get serious as we storm into 2025. Only 8 weeks left to buy the Vantard ICO All good things must come to an end, and unfortunately for degens, the same is true of Vantard’s rip-roaring ICO . Vantard’s presale ends on January 15th, with DEX listings set to follow. January has historically been one of the best months for crypto traders targeting major-league growth, and if the supercycle is a gale-force storm right now, this launch is likely to be smack bang in the middle of a hurricane of FOMO. Once markets catch wind of the value proposition, Vantard’s unrivaled track record will likely see a mad scramble for VTARD. Prices could quickly get out of hand, so unless you want to be left guzzling on slippage like someone who’s overslept on Black Friday, now could be your last chance to act.

On Monday, BTC's price rose above $107,000, surpassing the previous peak on Dec. 5 and taking the cumulative post-U.S.-election gain to over 50%, CoinDesk data show.  The rally follows President-elect Donald Trump's assurance that the U.S. will build a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its strategic oil reserve. Analysts expect the winning streak to continue next year, with prices ranging between $150K to $200K by the end of the following year.  However, the current pricing of options trading on Deribit indicates that traders aren't chasing the rally like they used to, signaling a more cautious outlook for the short term.  At press time, the 25-delta risk reversal for options expiring on Friday was negative, indicating the relative richness of put options that provide protection against price drops. Puts expiring on Dec. 27 were trading at a slight premium to calls, while the risk reversals extending to the end of March end expiry demonstrated a call bias of less than three volatility points.  That starkly contrasts the trend we've observed over the past few weeks, where traders aggressively chased new price peaks, driving short-term and long-term call biases to over four or five volatility points. In fact, short-term risk reversals frequently displayed a stronger call bias than their longer-term counterparts.  The latest block trades coming through on Deribit, as tracked by Amberdata, also show a bearish lean. The top trade so far today has been a short position in the Dec. 27 expiry call at the $108,000 strike followed by long positions in the $100,000 strike puts expiring on Dec. 27 and Jan. 3.  The cautious sentiment could be due to concerns that on Wednesday the Federal Reserve will signal fewer or slower rate cuts for 2025 while delivering the widely expected 25 basis points rate cut. Such an outcome could accelerate hardening of the bond yields, strengthening the dollar and denting the case for investing in riskier assets.

37747096,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393939,1734418856,Breaking News: India’s Parliament Discusses Comprehensive Crypto Framework,"The post Breaking News: India’s Parliament Discusses Comprehensive Crypto Framework appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Indian government is stepping up efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies, marking a significant move toward creating a structured framework for Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs). Recent parliamentary discussions shed light on plans to balance innovation with investor protection while addressing the global and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies. India’s Comprehensive Crypto Framework India aims to establish a robust regulatory structure for VDAs, with a focus on international cooperation. This would help prevent regulatory loopholes and ensure a consistent approach globally. However, officials noted that such a framework requires international cooperation, as VDAs transcend national boundaries. Current Rules and Taxation Updates The government has already implemented key measures to regulate VDAs: Anti-Money Laundering: VDAs have been governed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) since March 2023. Taxation: Income from VDAs is taxable under the Income Tax Act, of 1961. Additional Oversight: Activities involving VDAs are also regulated under the Information Technology Act, of 2000, and the Companies Act, of 2013. Adding clarity to the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) in Jodhpur recently ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered capital assets. This decision means profits from cryptocurrency sales should be taxed as capital gains rather than income from other sources. The ruling is particularly significant for transactions conducted before the government introduced specific regulations for VDAs in 2022. Global Leadership Through the G20 During its G20 presidency in 2023, India played a pivotal role in advancing international crypto regulations. The adoption of the IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper and the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets provided a global blueprint for crypto governance. The government plans to release a discussion paper to outline its approach to crypto regulations and seek feedback from stakeholders. While no timeline has been confirmed, this step could help refine the regulatory landscape. Addressing Key Challenges India faces unique challenges in regulating VDAs due to their borderless nature. The government is working to safeguard the economy and financial stability while fostering innovation in blockchain and crypto technology. By combining domestic efforts with global collaboration, India is laying the foundation for a secure and innovative future in digital assets.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/breaking-news-indias-parliament-discusses-comprehensive-crypto-framework/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

PNUT, the popular memecoin inspired by the squirrel, saw a nearly 10% decrease following the news. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Faces Headwinds: Can Bulls Revive Momentum? Internet Squirrel Becomes Memecoin Sensation On Sunday, Mark Longo, owner of Peanut the Squirrel, announced that his legal team had initiated legal action against crypto exchange Binance. In an X post, Longo, also known as “Peanuts Dad,” accused the exchange of using his intellectual property without authorization. The rescued squirrel became an internet sensation after Longo’s online videos became viral, amassing over half a million followers on Instagram. However, Peanut was seized from Longo’s home alongside a rescued raccoon named Fred. Both animals were euthanized to be tested for rabies, as there are not any approved antemortem rabies testing methods for animals by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Following the news, the public condemned Peanut’s death, with several lawmakers criticizing authorities’ actions. It also sparked a wave of Peanut-inspired memecoins, which resulted in the creation of Solana-based memecoin PNUT. Amid the controversy, the token quickly grew in popularity, hitting a $120 million market capitalization in less than a week. Binance announced the listing of the memecoin on November 11, opening spot trading that same day. After the news, PNUT’s price went on a massive rally, climbing to the top 10 memecoins by market cap. The token achieved the $1 billion milestone in less than a month, reaching a $2.27 billion market cap before retracing. For the past month, PNUT has held above the $1 billion mark, with the price hovering between the $1.80-$1.00 price range. Crypto Exchanges Hit With Cease And Desist Letter According to the letter shared by the animal rights activist, Binance allegedly infringed “the intellectual property rights owned by Mr. Longo.” His legal team argues that the exchange’s use of the copyrighted photograph of Peanut the Squirrel wearing a cowboy hat and the “identical” trademark of “PEANUT THE SQUIRREL and PNUT” in the listed memecoin infringes their client’s “various copyrights and trademarks.” The letter demanded that Binance respond to the letter by December 31st, 2024, to verify the exchange received the letter and “have ceased all infringing activity.” Moreover, Longo revealed in his post that this was the first of multiple cease and desist letters to be issued. PNUT faced a 10.2% dip after the news, falling from the $1.17 level to the $1.05 support in 24 hours. The retrace drove the token near its lowest levels in over a month, worrying investors about the memecoin’s performance. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ It’s worth noting that Longo has previously stated his discontent with the PNUT memecoin, accusing the crypto community of profiting from his late pet. As a protest, the animal rights activist launched a memecoin named Justice for Pnut and Fred (JUSTICE), which faced controversy over insider trading allegations. Longo also promoted another memecoin, Justice for Peanut (JFP), in his warning post, which saw a 159% increase after the publication before losing all its recent gains. At the time of writing, PNUT is trading at $1.10, a 5.1% drop in the daily timeframe.

Investors always yearn for the next money-making opportunity that guarantees higher returns. Explosive altcoins such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) have rising utility and show potential for gains. Fantom (FTM) recently surged as the launch of the Sonic mainnet drew in more eyeballs. With this bullish environment comes the possibility for new altcoins to gain significant traction, with one AI-based trading platform offering unprecedented gains. Could Shiba Inu (SHIB) 3x By The End Of The Year? Shiba Inu (SHIB) was launched in August 2020 starting as a dog-themed meme coin, heavily inspired by Dogecoin. Early investors became millionaires virtually overnight thanks to this unprecedented 400x growth. SHIB has experienced significant volatility over its time, as a reflection of meme-based crypto’s speculative nature. To help combat this, the dev team has created a full fledged Shiba Inu ecosystem, with the SHIB token at its core. This crucial pivot has helped the meme coin stay relevant, with Shiba Inu trading at $0.000027 on December 16, 2024, with a market cap of $16.27 billion. After facing a 10% correction over the last week, many have started to speculate on the future outlook for SHIB. Bullish projections claim that a potential 200% increase would result in Shiba Inu getting close to its previous all-time high of $0.000088. One analyst claimed that Shiba Inu’s upcoming features could propel the price of SHIB tokens through the roof. Prominent Analysts Claim Fantom (FTM) Has A $5 Price Tag In Sight Fantom (FTM) is a high-performance and scalable Layer-1 blockchain with speed as its core focus. In recent times, Fantom has flourished in the short-term market, as its coin increased 10% in a week and 8% in a day, trading at $1.39 currently. FTM is keeping up the momentum from its stellar 86% increase earlier this month. Fantom has formed a broadening wedge pattern, which is a very strong uptrend indicator, according to crypto analyst Alex Clay. FTM is in its 3rd bullish leg, suggests Clay, outlining price targets of $5.59, $8.92 and $12.26 as market conditions improve. On similar grounds, analyst Captain Faibik urges the long term holders to wait, while setting FTM price target at $15, firmly backing the views on the token’s future prospects. Is IntelMarkets (INTL) The Next Altcoin Set For 20,428% Gains? An emerging altcoin, IntelMarkets (INTL) , has already caught the attention of many analysts as it demonstrates enormous potential for profits. Priced initially at $0.07, IntelMarkets is offering its INTL tokens as a ground floor opportunity for investors seeking high rewards. As early backers have already seen 800% increase on the initial price, IntelMarkets is hailed as one of the biggest presales of this year. With IntelMarkets closing in on the $5 million presale fundraising milestone , INTL tokens are in significant demand, with the 7th stage selling out in record time. Even before the presale, the project is turning heads, raising over $550,000 from Fortune 500 investors. Backed by a team of Open AI and MIT experts, investors have shown an extreme vote of confidence for INTL. With a 20,428% potential projected post-launch, a $1,000 investment could turn into over $200,000, as analysts are drawing parallels between Fantom’s historic 90x and IntelMarkets. Final Thoughts Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Fantom (FTM) have not only provided big returns in the past, but are also showing bullish patterns for 200% gains. However, those in IntelMarkets (INTL) will enjoy access to an innovative project with a serious upside before it goes mainstream.

37746926,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374743,1734418517,Google Cracks Quantum: Is Your Bitcoin In Jeopardy?,"Bitcoin’s price barreled upward Monday on increasing crypto exchange volume, with a +3% daily green candle and a +10% weekly jump. BTC whale wallets surged in accumulation as president-elect Donald Trump reaffirmed on CNBC that his administration plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. “We’re gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else – not just China but others are embracing it – and we want to be the head,” Trump said. But could advances in ultra-fast quantum computing underway at Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., upend the entire blockchain paradigm? Along with such rumored devastation, it would likely go much of Bitcoin’s behemoth market cap, currently valued above $2 trillion. Here’s a brief summary of what Alphabet is cooking: Google’s New Willow Quantum Chip Wows Google’s Quantum Lab unveiled Willow in a Dec. 9 update on the Google blog. It’s a quantum computing chip, so each bit can be a 0 and a 1 in different orders of arrangement. Consequently, it can be used to make computations at vastly higher performance speeds than Nvidia’s conventional GPUs, for example. Google said Willow can solve in just five minutes a problem that would most likely require ten septillion (that is, 10^25) years for Frontier to solve. Frontier is a Hewlett Packard supercomputer that began operating in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 2022 and was the fastest in the world until it was surpassed by the same company’s El Capitan supercomputer in Alameda, California, in Nov. 2024. So, are your bitcoins safe? Bitcoin Cracked? Is Quantum A Crypto Killer? If you do the math, then you don’t have to worry. In June 2017, popular YouTube statistician 3Blue1Brown broke down the math of a brute force attack on a 256-bit password. A brute force attack is guessing and testing. Bitcoin uses 256-bit public key encryption for passwords and the miner fee for mining nodes to track and execute transactions. To crack this level of security with brute force would require a number of guesses around 4 billion times itself 8 times. By 3Blue1Brown’s math: If every human on Earth had far more computing power than all of Google’s servers likely have, and then you made 4 billion copies of such an Earth in a single galaxy, and then made 4 billion copies of that galaxy… and all they did with all those computers was brute force attack Bitcoin for 37 times the age of the known universe since the Big Bang, there would still be only a 1 in 4 billion chance of getting a “collision” or correct guess. And if Google or someone had far more power than that in one server farm and decided to become very white-collar criminals and use that correct guess to steal some bitcoins—well, if the rest of the miners noticed the stolen BTC, they could correct the ledger by consensus and ward off the thieving node from participating in the network.

Last week, the HTX token reached a historic high of $0.000003596, marking a near 350% increase from its August low of $0.0000008. Coinciding with this growth, the leading exchange HTX has released the report of its Crypto Gem Hunt #2, a curated selection of top-performing assets identified by the platform’s research and investment team. Showcasing five cryptocurrencies based on their price performance and sector potential, the report highlights HTX’s strategic understanding of emerging assets and its keen ability to select high-potential projects. Top 5 Performers from HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt #2 In Phase 2 of the Crypto Gem Hunt, five selected assets delivered exceptional returns after listing on HTX. Key highlights include: ● FARTCOIN (FARTCOIN): An AI meme coin built on the Solana blockchain and crafted by Truth Terminal, FARTCOIN quickly gained traction within its community. Its humorous concept resonated with a wide audience, driving a staggering surge of 2,566.67% on its first day of trading on HTX. Previously featured in Crypto Gem Hunt #1 , FARTCOIN continued its upward trajectory, peaking at $0.48, demonstrating the community’s growing interest in AI meme coin projects. ● ZRC (Zircuit): This Layer 2 token, which utilizes airdrops and community reward strategies, soared 2,900% on its first day of trading. The impressive performance solidified ZRC’s position as one of the phase’s most notable assets. ● MEMEFI (MEMEFI): As a part of the TON ecosystem, MEMEFI recorded a significant 188% price increase, highlighting the potential of this emerging blockchain sector. Other assets, such as BTF (Bitfinity) and L3 (Layer3), also experienced substantial growth, with first-day returns doubling investors’ holdings. Capitalizing on Emerging Sectors The selected assets in this phase span diverse and rapidly evolving sectors: AI Meme Coins: Combining strong community consensus with innovative project designs, this niche is attracting growing attention. BTC Layer 2: Solving the main Bitcoin blockchain’s scalability issues and boosting assets like Runes. TON Ecosystem: With cost-effective, high-performance on-chain solutions, the TON ecosystem is gaining traction among developers and investors. Layer 2: Meeting the demand for scalability and low transaction fees, Layer 2 solutions are becoming a crucial part of the blockchain landscape. HTX’s crypto listings consider both promising sectors and strong community support. Two highly anticipated cryptocurrencies—$MOVE and $ME—also earned spots in this phase of the initiative:.$MOVE focuses on social networking and fitness in the Web3 space, while $ME, native to Magic Eden, a leading multi-chain NFT marketplace, represents a large community of on-chain users. Its innovative reward-sharing model embodies the spirit of community building. Both projects, with their sector potential and future development plans, are considered high-quality assets. HTX was among the first platforms to list $ME, which, along with $MOVE, delivered impressive gains on their first trading day, setting the stage for further growth. A Research-Driven Approach to Uncovering Market Leaders With Phase 2 of the “Crypto Gem Hunt,” HTX has once again demonstrated its ability to identify high-potential assets and capitalize on emerging trends. Guided by a dedicated research and investment team, HTX consistently aligns its listings with market demand and user preferences, offering lucrative opportunities. HTX’s rigorous evaluation process ensures the quality of listed assets. The team closely monitors market trends to uncover promising projects, and provides regular research reports to keep users informed. Looking ahead, HTX plans to continue expanding the Crypto Gem Hunt, identifying even more top-tier assets and refining its asset selection process. By solidifying its position as a premier launchpad for innovative projects, HTX aims to provide users unparalleled access to emerging opportunities.

37746875,https://crypto.news/?p=14320012,1734418324,"Amid market correction, ETH, TON traders see benefits of Rollblock’s deflationary crypto","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Corrections may sting, but Rollblock proves its resilience, blending DeFi and online gaming to outshine struggling giants like Ethereum and Toncoin. Table of Contents Rollblock: Deflationary DeFi token reshaping the crypto market Ethereum: Number two ranked token in trouble? Toncoin: 180% gains on the crypto market, but dropping Conclusion Corrections in the crypto market are never fun, but they are needed to weed out the speculators. They can hurt in the short term, but the crypto market is in fine form, and it’s already on its way back after the second week of December when a market correction was observed that wiped almost 10% across the board. Ethereum and Toncoin, however, are not having the best of bull runs, and investors in these Layer1 solutions are looking at the new GambleFi token Rollblock , a new crypto that seamlessly blends DeFi with online gaming. Rollblock: Deflationary DeFi token reshaping the crypto market The crypto market correction in December shook up investors, but Rollblock stood firm, showcasing its unique GambleFi approach. Rollblock combines DeFi with online gambling, offering a unique value proposition. Its deflationary model, designed to reduce supply over time, sets it apart, driving long-term value for token holders. As the crypto market recovers, Rollblock’s strategic token burns and profit-sharing mechanisms position it for sustainable growth. Unlike volatile tokens that fluctuate with market trends, Rollblock ensures consistent returns, appealing to both seasoned investors and new entrants seeking stability in a dynamic market. Rollblock is redefining DeFi and proving itself an A-list player in the crypto market. Ethereum: Number two ranked token in trouble? Somebody needs to say it: Ethereum is in trouble. It doesn’t look that way, as Ethereum has a market cap of almost $450 billion, miles ahead of XRP and Solana. However, it’s in growth where Ethereum is lacking. Ethereum has returned a ‘mere’ 70% growth in the last year. That’s jaw-dropping in TradFi, but it’s less than half of Bitcoin’s 136%, Solana’s 220%, or Toncoin’s 180%. This relatively slow growth may be a problem for Ethereum, and it may just be a matter of time before it loses its number-two spot to Solana or XRP. DeFi-wise, it’s not going much better. Ethereum used to cover over 90% of the DeFi market. Now ETH’s slice of the DeFi pie is just over 50%, and again, it is getting strong headwinds from Solana. You might also like: BNB targets $800, Avalanche eyes ATH, while Rollblock presale hits new highs Toncoin: 180% gains on the crypto market, but dropping Toncoin should have been, would have been, the success story of 2024. But it all ground to a halt when Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France on various charges relating to the Telegram network. Toncoin is the native cryptocurrency of the TON (The Open Network) blockchain, originally developed by Telegram to integrate decentralized financial services into its platform. A knock to Telegram was a knock to Toncoin. With no trial date set for Durov (and not allowed to leave France until at least March), Toncoin has not performed nearly as well as it could on the crypto market. However, as XRP proves, a vindication in a court could mean extraordinary gains. Conclusion The crypto market may have slightly corrected, but the trend is still way up. For most coins, that is. Toncoin and Ethereum are not nearly as powerful as they were, and there are certainly better tokens on the crypto market to invest in. Fortunately, Rollblock is there to take up the slack in its brilliant marriage of DeFi and Online gambling, which makes for a bright investment future. Rollblock is now available at $0.0415.

37746625,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393934,1734417860,Will XRP Price Hit All-Time High With Ripple’s RLUSD Launch?,"The post Will XRP Price Hit All-Time High With Ripple’s RLUSD Launch? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple News Today: XRP has been on a bull ride since the U.S. election, with its price soaring close to $3 earlier this month. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.51 , having risen 4.52% following the news of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch . Analysts believe that XRP has the potential to reach $3.55 if the SEC ends its appeal and clears XRP from regulatory issues. This price target is based on the idea that once XRP’s legal challenges are resolved, the token could experience a significant rally. In comparison, Bitcoin has only risen 46% since the election, and the broader crypto market has seen impressive double-digit gains of 93%. Showing positive gains XRP managed to surpass Solana and Tether. CNBC recently reported that XRP is one of the biggest winners of the Trump-led crypto rally, with a whopping 370% increase since the election. This whole build-up is making XRP jump the bigger assets. Analyst Bullish Outlook on XRP Price Popular cryptocurrency trader DonAlt, who correctly predicted XRP’s massive rally in November, believes the token could double again if it manages to break out of its current trading range. According to DonAlt, XRP has been stuck between support and resistance levels of around $2.20 and $2.60 since early December, after failing to push past the $3 mark. However, if XRP can break above the $2.60 resistance level, analyst predicts that it could trigger a new wave of bullish momentum, potentially pushing the price even higher. XRP price is skyrocketing—don’t miss out! Read XRP price prediction to see where this explosive growth is headed next! Technically XRP can go Even Higher EGRAG points out the technical factors of XRP breakout. Wherein Historical market cycles and Fibonacci analysis predict that XRP’s market dominance could increase to 5.9% or even 6%. If this happens, XRP’s price could see explosive gains . EGRAG has even suggested that if Ripple achieves its $5 trillion market cap forecast, XRP could reach prices between $8.77 and $17.54, depending on how much of the global crypto market it captures. Currently, XRP’s market dominance has risen to 2.09%, marking a significant rebound after its recent surge above $1. XRP is now just 27.3% away from its all-time high, which was recorded seven years ago, and the excitement surrounding XRP’s future is only growing. With RLUSD in the pipeline and IPO coming up next the path for XRP is bullish and investors are rooting for a positive end to Ripple vs SEC which blocked XRP’s growth for a decade. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37747263,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52364,1734417451,Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Bollinger Bands Spot Next Key Support for SHIB,"Shiba Inu, the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has faced significant challenges in recent days. The token has seen a steady decline following the widespread liquidation of long positions, leaving its price unable to reclaim the critical support level of $0.0000283. After dropping below this point on daily and weekly charts, the asset has continued its downward trend, prompting concern among investors and the wider crypto community. With the token’s price under pressure, market participants speculate where the asset might find its next support. While predicting price movements in the volatile cryptocurrency market is inherently uncertain, technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands can provide valuable insights into potential price trends. Bollinger Bands and Their Role in Token Analysis Bollinger Bands , a tool widely used in financial markets, was created by technical analyst John Bollinger. The indicator consists of a moving average and two bands representing standard deviations above and below that average. These bands can help identify overbought or oversold conditions in an asset’s price and highlight potential support or resistance levels. Currently, the digital asset’s price sits below the moving average on the Bollinger Bands. This positioning suggests that the token is likely to gravitate toward the lower band, which, on the daily chart, is situated at approximately $0.00002438. This level is nearly 10% below the token’s current price, indicating a potential area where the token could stabilize. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Assessing the Likely Bottom for SHIB The lower Bollinger Band at $0.00002438 is a potential short-term support level for SHIB. While minor deviations from this level are possible, the area would act as a local bottom if the token price continues its downward trajectory. Investors may find this level significant when considering their next moves in the market. However, the downward trend could be reversed if SHIB’s price reclaims its moving average. To invalidate the bearish outlook suggested by the Bollinger Bands, the token would need to rise by more than 6.6% from its current position. A return above the moving average could signal renewed bullish momentum for the token. Key Takeaways for Shiba Inu (SHIB) Investors The recent decline in Shiba Inu’s price has left investors searching for signs of recovery. Bollinger Bands offers a useful framework for identifying potential support levels and understanding the token’s price behavior. Based on the current analysis, the $0.00002438 level could act as a key support zone for the asset in the short term. By monitoring these indicators and staying informed, SHIB holders can better navigate the ongoing market volatility and make informed investment choices.

The team said they were “extremely disappointed at the approach the SEC has taken” on X post on Dec. 16, referring to the Well’s notice, a formal SEC warning of potential enforcement.

The statement also sought to blame the current administration, claiming its “anti-crypto agenda” had harmed the entire blockchain industry, and expressed hope for a new direction under the next administration. CyberKongz also voiced solidarity with industry leaders, including Brian Armstrong of Coinbase , Devin Finzer of OpenSea , and Hayden Adams of Uniswap Labs , who are also facing regulatory pressure from the SEC.

By treating tokens as securities, the SEC seeks to subject them to stricter regulatory scrutiny and compliance with existing financial regulations, making it mandatory for projects to register and provide disclosures akin to those of traditional financial instruments. Critics say this approach suppresses innovation and overlooks the decentralized nature of blockchain technologies.

37750945,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320073,1734416157,Bitfinex Predicts Bitcoin Will Skyrocket to $200K by Mid-2025,"Bitfinex analysts predict that Bitcoin could surge to $200k by mid-2025. This prediction follows a year packed with historic milestones, including the first-ever spot crypto ETF’s launch. Analysts published a report on Monday stating that 2024’s halving year signals a historically bullish trend in the following year. They added that consistent buying support from ETFs and institutional investors will likely keep corrections relatively small in the current Bitcoin bull cycle. Bitfinex Predicts Bitcoin Could Peak at $200K Post-Halving, Despite 2025 Volatility “The current bull market reflects strong institutional demand, led by ETFs and spot accumulation,” analysts said. “Historical data suggests we are mid-cycle, following the April 2024 halving, with the market likely to peak around Q3-Q4 2025, approximately 450 days post-halving. Historically, post-halving years have seen the strongest rallies.” “Looking ahead, we believe the current run-up to over $100,000 has captured a significant portion of Bitcoinʼs price appreciation for this cycle. Our minimum price target for Bitcoin remains at $140,000 – $200,000 around mid-2025.” Analysts expect volatility in early 2025 but believe the overall trend points to continued price growth. This outlook is driven by ETF support, institutional adoption and Bitcoin’s rising status as a global asset. However, they advised investors to watch for overbought signals as Bitcoin nears its cycle peak. Bitfinex Sees $339K Peak Amid Rising Market Enthusiasm If Bitcoin mirrors the 2021 cycle, Bitfinex predicts a peak near $339,000. In a 2017-like scenario with diminishing returns, it could reach $290,000 by early 2026. Bitcoin last traded at about $106,567 , marking a 17% increase over the last month. Market enthusiasm surged when Trump recently suggested the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, likening it to the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “We’re gonna do something great with crypto,” Trump said. Investor sentiment has also been lifted by MicroStrategy’s upcoming addition to the Nasdaq-100, which could draw more institutional investments. The bullish trend is set to extend into 2025, with technical factors like the halving’s impact and the influx of institutional money continuing to bolster the digital asset market.

From presale heroes smashing milestones to coins launching groundbreaking features, it’s clear the meme coin trend isn’t slowing down anytime soon. If you’re on the hunt for the best meme coins with 100x potential, this article has got you covered. Let’s start with the showstopper— BTFD Coin. This meme coin raised a jaw-dropping $4 million in presale funds, selling over 55 billion coins and gaining a massive 5,600+ holders. With a price of just $0.00013 in its 12th presale stage, it’s turning heads for all the right reasons. Meanwhile, Notcoin is making waves with its new “Earn” program, and Gigachad has scored a major coup by listing on Bitunix, a popular exchange. Could these projects be the best meme coins with 100x potential? Let’s dive into the details. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Are Here, and They’re Charging BTFD Coin, or Buy The Dip, is the star of the meme coin world right now—and for good reason. It’s a meme coin with a mission: turn dips into opportunities. With a mix of innovation, community power, and massive investor interest, BTFD is redefining what meme coins can achieve. BTFD Coin has been absolutely crushing its presale. After reaching the $1 million milestone in under 10 days, it hit $2.5 million in under 14 days and is now sitting at a staggering $4 million raised. Over 55 billion coins have been sold, and its presale tally has attracted a growing army of over 5,600 Bulls. Currently priced at $0.00013 in its presale’s 12th stage, analysts predict that BTFD Coin could surge to $0.0006 or higher after its launch. This would represent nearly a 5x jump—and that’s just in the early stages. Given its staking rewards, Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and bullish community, some even speculate it could rise to $0.001 as its ecosystem matures. Why It Could 100x Staking APY: Investors can stake their $BTFD tokens for a 90% APY, making it an ideal passive income stream. P2E Game: The upcoming game allows players to earn in-game tokens that can be converted into $BTFD, driving demand and utility. Community Power: With characters like Baby Bull and Raging Bull leading the way, the project’s marketing is on point, creating viral momentum. Now, why don’t we break down the numbers? Current Price: $0.00013 Investment Amount: $1,000 Coins Purchased: 7,692,307 $BTFD If BTFD Coin hits $0.0006, that $1,000 investment would balloon to $4,615, and if it reaches $0.001, you’d be looking at a whopping $7,692! Not bad for a meme coin with limitless potential. Notcoin: Earning While You HODL If you thought meme coins were all fun and no function, think again. Notcoin has just launched its highly-anticipated “Earn” program, giving Telegram users the ability to lock their tokens and earn interest over time. Notcoin is currently priced at $0.008071. Analysts predict it could rise to $0.01 in the next few months if adoption of the “Earn” program continues to grow. Its team is also planning partnerships with gaming platforms, which could further drive value. Why It Could 100x Notcoin’s unique blend of staking and upcoming utility integrations sets it apart. If the “Earn” program achieves mass adoption and partnerships deliver as promised, this token could easily see a 100x increase over time. Gigachad: Meme King Moves to Bitunix When it comes to meme coins, few names carry as much swagger as Gigachad. Known for its alpha-male-type humour and meme-worthy branding, this coin is making serious moves to become a market leader. Gigachad was recently listed on Bitunix, a growing exchange with a loyal user base. This listing has boosted its daily trading volume by 300%, sparking renewed interest in the project. Currently trading at $0.0696, Gigachad has the potential to hit $0.18 by the end of next year. The team’s plans to roll out a Gigachad NFT collection in Q1 2025 are expected to drive additional hype. Why It Could 100x The Bitunix listing, combined with the upcoming NFT launch, positions Gigachad as a serious contender in the meme coin space. Its devoted community and growing ecosystem are laying the groundwork for massive growth. Don’t Miss Out—Join the BTFD Coin Presale Now! Of all the meme coins mentioned, BTFD Coin stands out as the strongest candidate for massive gains.

No limits, no censorship, no rules—and it’s already up 15,264% in its presale. IDGN—iDEGEN’s native token—is a SOL meme coin born from chaos, raised by unhinged minds, and unleashed with a mission to break the internet. This is what happens when the tech behind ChatGPT meets the unfiltered carnage of crypto X . Posting every hour and replying to every mention, is iDEGEN following the rules? Of course not. Could iDEGEN get banned? Absolutely—that’s the whole fascinating point. And the response? Canadian investors can’t get enough. Already pulling in $5.2m in just 3 weeks, iDEGEN is smashing expectations. iDEGEN has Canadian investors hooked iDEGEN is a no-holds-barred AI that thrives on unpredictability, and Canadian investors are eating it up. Up 15,264% in record time, this wild AI baby is torching X, lighting up timelines with the kind of madness only crypto could unleash. Every tweet from the crypto masses feeds the AI, making it smarter, sharper, and, usually, more chaotic. It’s a social experiment with the power to troll, entertain, and provoke all at once: iDEGEN spits out whatever the crypto world throws at it— conspiracy theories , trash talk , or memes so sharp they could cut through FUD. It’s like watching a baby AI raised by degens and dropped into the world with no safety net. Silicon Valley’s carefully curated AI is now yesterday’s news. iDEGEN makes every interaction a gamble. It could troll a politician, spit out a recipe for frog soup, or drop a meme that sends its token soaring. For degens in Canada, this unpredictability is a moneymaker. Attention equals pumps, and iDEGEN is basking in the limelight. 100x or bust: Is iDEGEN the wildcard of 2025? Truth be told, 2024 has been a year of curveballs, and iDEGEN is the perfect chaos agent to top it off. AI tokens are pumping harder than ever, thanks to a cocktail of slashed interest rates, Trump’s crypto-friendly energy, and global liquidity flowing like never before. As the lovechild of two booming trends, AI crypto and meme coins, 2025 is tailor-made for iDEGEN to shine, and it is already going viral with its unique, chaos-fueled approach. GOAT is the meme coin AI hybrid that smashed a $1 billion market cap in weeks, but iDEGEN is built to outshine projects like this by doing what no other coin dares: letting the community steer the narrative. Every tweet sparks a reaction. Every post pulls in attention. Virality isn’t just part of the strategy—it is the strategy. Most importantly, AI crypto isn’t just a phase. The AI crypto market is perched at over $40 billion , hungry for its next big thing. Top tokens like SNSY, up 540%, and EMP, surging nearly 370%, prove there’s always room for explosive growth. But in this crypto world filled with green candles and meme-fueled madness, can IDGN really do a 100x? The raw, unscripted chaos is converting engagement into 15,264% price action at breakneck speed. So, if the chaos keeps rolling, anything could happen… iDEGEN soars: Canadian investors keep IDGN pumping The iDEGEN adaptive auction has begun and is already of epic proportions. Priced at $0.00011 initially and climbing fast to a current price of $0.0169, with prices shifting every five minutes and early birds triggering 5% jumps, this auction is chaos in its purest form. But there are only 15 days left to buy in before iDEGEN hits exchanges. In a world where Bitcoin headlines the news, and Musk trolls his way through crypto, iDEGEN is the untamed, autonomous AI redefining what investing means. Whether it breaks the internet, gets banned, or trolls to the top, one thing’s clear—iDEGEN doesn’t follow the rules, it makes them.

RLUSDT, which will be launched today, will initially work on the Ethereum network and XRP Ledger, but Ripple executives have made statements that the token can also be transferred to other networks.

37745556,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52359,1734415315,Man Loses $26 Billion in Bitcoin After Exchange Canceled His Trade For This Reason,"Over a decade ago, Kevin Day, a Nebraska-based cryptocurrency trader, missed out on an extraordinary fortune when a Bitcoin market crash wiped out his groundbreaking trade. Day’s attempt to purchase 259,684 Bitcoins during a sudden price drop was invalidated by a decision from Mt. Gox, a major cryptocurrency exchange, to reverse all trades made during the event. Those Bitcoins, valued at $2,613 in 2011, would now be worth nearly $27 billion, placing Day among the wealthiest people in the world today. On June 19, 2011, Bitcoin experienced one of its most volatile moments in history. The cryptocurrency began trading at $17.50 but plummeted to $0.01 in under 20 minutes. This unprecedented crash left traders scrambling as they tried to comprehend the situation. Amid the turmoil, Kevin Day seized the chance to make a substantial investment. With $3,000 in his account from prior trades, he decided to outbid competitors by offering $0.0101 per Bitcoin, slightly above the market’s lowest point. His strategy worked. He acquired 259,684 Bitcoins at an astonishingly low cost. The sudden price collapse was later traced to a security breach at Mt. Gox, the dominant Bitcoin exchange at the time. A hacker had infiltrated the platform, gained access to user accounts, and initiated large-scale sales of Bitcoin at the lowest possible price. These actions artificially drove down the price, creating the conditions for Day’s purchase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, Mt. Gox quickly intervened to address the situation. To restore market stability, the exchange rolled back all trades executed during the crash, including Day’s. As a result, his record-breaking acquisition of Bitcoins was voided. Before Mt. Gox reversed the transactions, Day withdrew 643 Bitcoins from the exchange. At today’s valuation , those remaining Bitcoins are worth around $66 million. While this sum is significant, it pales compared to the nearly $27 billion value of the Bitcoins he originally acquired during the crash. Had the rollback not occurred, Day’s holdings would have positioned him as one of the wealthiest individuals globally, ranked 69th on the 2024 Forbes Billionaires List. Lessons from the Incident Kevin Day’s story reminds us of the inherent risks in cryptocurrency trading, especially during its early years. While Day’s quick thinking during the crash initially paid off, unforeseen factors such as exchange policies and security vulnerabilities ultimately derailed his financial breakthrough. The incident also underscores the importance of robust security measures and clear policies for cryptocurrency exchanges. It highlights the challenges faced by early adopters navigating an unpredictable and rapidly evolving market. Today, Day’s experience remains one of the most striking examples of the potential rewards and risks associated with investing in digital assets.

This prediction does ignite speculation among DOGE enthusiasts who anticipate a massive rally, yet most have placed their hopes on better alternatives, with one name standing out— FXGuys ($FXG) . $FXG is quickly emerging as one of the best DeFi coins to invest in for those seeking alternatives with actual utility. A major reason for its rising demand is that the FXGuys DeFi project merges DeFi and TradFi to offer exclusive access to the forex market. Read on as we explore the reasons behind investors choosing the FXGuys native token, $FXG, despite Dogecoin’s positive outlook! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE FXGuys is One of the Altcoins With Most Potential to Offer Double Digit Gains By 2025 FXGuys is the best cryptocurrency exchange designed to remove limitations from the forex trading market. The project achieves its vision of merging DeFi and TradFi to give new and seasoned investors access to the trading industry. The platform’s token, $FXG, is one of the altcoins with the most potential because it has multiple use cases both on and off the FXGuys trading platform. The FXGuys Trader Funding Program solves the problem of limited access to capital in the trading industry. The project rewards skilled traders who complete challenges on the platform with up to $500,000 in capital. Additionally, traders are given an 80/20 profit split in their favor, making FXGuys the best trading platform for crypto investors and traders. FXGuys prepares investors for monumental gains due to its Trade2Earn program. The FX Guys Trade2Earn program rewards users with $FXG tokens for every trade executed. This feature creates continuous demand for the project as it is one of the best DeFi coins to invest in for 100x gains before the new year. Even though crypto experts have predicted Dogecoin’s rise to $18, FXGuys wins investors’ trust with its massive utility. FXGuys’ no-KYC policy is proof of its standing as one of the altcoins with most potential, as it caters to investors who prioritize privacy and anonymity. With the KYC-free model, you don’t have to undergo rigorous identity verification procedures before interacting with the platform. A Popular Crypto Expert Predicts Dogecoin’s Surge to $18 Dogecoin has led the meme coin scene for years, and despite its lack of actual utility, DOGE has attracted many global investors. Despite its popularity, DOGE’s price has declined over 7% over the past week due to bearish market conditions. Yet, crypto experts believe that DOGE could witness a massive turnaround, as Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto analyst, predicted Dogecoin’s rise to $18. Ali Martinez stated that DOGE’s bully cycle had started quite early and said he would buy into Dogecoin’s price dip. While this prediction does spark renewed interest among investors, Dogecoin investors express concern following a hack that crashed 69% of the nodes on Dogecoin’s network. By exploiting Dogecoin’s vulnerability, investors seek more secure options like FXGuys. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Here’s Why $FXG is One Of the Best Coins to Invest in! FXGuys’ appeal and potential to solve real-world issues is why investors are choosing its $FXG token over DOGE as one of the altcoins with the best profit potential. Furthermore, the $FXG presale is currently in Stage 2 at $0.04, with over $3 million raised. Due to the success of its private presale that raised over $1 million, experts anticipate a 10,000% price surge for $FXG post-launch. $FXG is being tipped as one of the best DeFi coins to invest in by 2025 because of its tangible utility and passive income potential. As an $FXG holder, you can stake your tokens for rewards even if you don’t want to actively trade on FXGuys. Those who stake their tokens will earn 20% APY on FXGuys’ broker trading platform. If you’re still searching for the best DeFi coins to invest in, consider hopping on the $FXG presale for 100x returns post-launch!

37750944,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320064,1734414986,Nigeria Arrests 792 Suspects for Running Massive Crypto Romance Scam Operation in Raid,"Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested 792 individuals in connection with an alleged large-scale crypto romance scam. The arrests took place on December 10 at a building in Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, suspected to be a major hub for fraudulent activities. The detained suspects include 148 Chinese nationals and 40 Filipinos, Reuters reported , citing an EFCC spokesperson who provided updates on December 16. The Scheme Enlisted Nigerian Accomplices The spokesperson revealed that the scheme’s masterminds had enlisted Nigerian accomplices to lure victims online, primarily targeting people in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and various European countries. “Nigerian accomplices were recruited by the foreign kingpins to prospect for victims online through phishing, targeting mostly Americans, Canadians, Mexicans and several others from European countries,” the EFCC spokesperson said. “Once the Nigerians are able to win the confidence of would-be victims, the foreigners would take over the actual task of defrauding the victims.” 193 Foreigners, 599 Nigerians Arrested by EFCC in Biggest Cryptocurrency Scam the biggest arrest of suspected cryptocurrency fraudsters, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has on Monday said its operatives have arrested about 792 persons. The their region and tribe pic.twitter.com/ZCjT5ik2V5 — Maidalan Kabi Phd (@Nura_arg) December 16, 2024 The operation reportedly relied on tactics commonly associated with “pig butchering” scams. In this method, scammers create fake online personas to build trust with victims, often feigning romantic interest or offering fraudulent cryptocurrency investment opportunities. Once trust is established, victims are pressured into transferring funds. Notably, similar operations in Myanmar employ up to 5,000 people, whereas the Lagos scheme was relatively smaller. Workers are typically recruited through job ads and receive wages far higher than local averages. In Nigeria, recruits were reportedly offered up to $500 per month—ten times the national minimum wage—along with performance-based bonuses for successful scams. The EFCC said it is collaborating with international partners to determine if the Lagos operation is linked to global organized crime syndicates. The crackdown comes amid a surge in “pig butchering” scams globally. New Zealand’s FMA Warns of Rising Crypto Scam Just recently, New Zealand’s Financial Markets Authority (FMA) issued a warning about an increasing wave of crypto scams targeting social media users. In a Monday warning, the watchdog said that the fraudsters operate primarily through YouTube channels and messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, where they lure unsuspecting users with promises of lucrative investment opportunities. Scammers set up YouTube channels that present themselves as trustworthy sources of cryptocurrency trading advice. Viewers are encouraged to join private messaging groups on WhatsApp or Telegram, where the fraudsters pose as experienced investment experts. Once inside these groups, victims are directed to fraudulent trading platforms designed to look like legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges. The scam follows a calculated strategy. Initially, victims are asked to make small deposits, fostering a sense of trust. They are then presented with fake profit statements to encourage larger investments. However, when users attempt to withdraw their funds, they are met with demands for additional fees, and no money is ever returned. The FMA has flagged more than 40 suspicious trading platforms, including bi-investments.com, phoenix-trades.com, and bricsinvestlimited.com. A full list of the flagged platforms is available on the FMA’s official website.

37745555,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52361,1734414920,"December’s Moonshot Picks: Toncoin, Litecoin, Rollblock","With the markets screaming ahead despite a bearish weekend, investors are looking for the next big thing. And who can blame them when tokens like XRP are up over 300% on the 30-day candle? Is the best crypto to buy now a big gun, a middle-of-the-road underperformer, or a presale gem waiting to be discovered? The Toncoin price is certainly due an upgrade, Litecoin may go far should Dogecoin’s resurgence continue, and GambleFi giant Rollblock ’s presale may just seal the deal on the best crypto to buy now. Rollblock (RBLK): A Grounded Moonshot for Smart Investors For those seeking the best crypto to buy now , Rollblock offers a fresh perspective in an otherwise hype-driven market. Combining decentralized finance (DeFi) with online gambling, Rollblock stands out as more than just a speculative asset. Its GambleFi model not only promises growth but delivers sustainability through weekly profit-sharing dividends. What makes Rollblock compelling is its ability to balance high growth potential with long-term value. Unlike tokens that rely on volatile sentiment, Rollblock ’s foundation lies in a real-world use case that generates consistent revenue. Investors looking for stability amid the chaos of the current market will find a solid option here. As its presale gains momentum, Rollblock represents a rare opportunity: a chance to invest in a token that’s both forward-thinking and practical. Whether you’re chasing moonshots or safeguarding wealth, Rollblock might be the best crypto to buy now . Toncoin (TON): Toncoin price underperforming. Can it break out? Toncoin had its name up in lights for most of 2024, and then Telegram CEO Pavel Durov got arrested in France. The Toncoin price plummeted 20% in a day on the news, and Toncoin has never really recovered. The Toncoin price was on track to deliver a 5x return in Q4 of 2024, but the Toncoin price is up a measly 25% on the 30-day candle, this at a period where other tokens of similar market cap exceeded several hundred percent. The Toncoin price is underperforming, and a risk assessment should be made on how the Toncoin price will respond to the ongoing Durov investigation. Toncoin may skyrocket yet, but it could also plummet. Litecoin (LTC): A resurgence thanks to Dogecoin Litecoin was written off as a ghost chain with no future, but Elon Musk is indirectly giving it second wind. Musk’s fondness of Doge saw the meme coin shoot the moon, miss, and head for Mars shortly after Trump was re-elected president. With Dogecoin’s biggest cheerleader having special access to the White House, Doge is cruising. What has this to do with Litecoin ? Everything. Litecoin provides the security protocol for Dogecoin, and without Litecoin , Dogecoin cannot exist. As long as Doge is doing well, Litecoin will do well alongside it. Litecoin may just be the best crypto to buy now if you are into underrated tokens. Conclusion Figuring out the best crypto to buy now is a tough choice, and fortunately, investors do not have to pick just one. The Toncoin price is definitely too low for its value, but uncertainty is keeping the Toncoin price low, while a high Dogecoin price is boosting Litecoin ’s profile. But for certainty in a time of volatility, Rollblock ’s presale may just be the moonshot pick of the bunch. Rollblock is now available at $0.0415. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Speaking in a recent CNBC interview, Saylor compared Bitcoin to Manhattan’s historical value and suggested that investing in the cryptocurrency today could secure the nation’s financial future. Bitcoin as “Cyber Manhattan” Drawing parallels to the purchase of Manhattan centuries ago, Saylor described Bitcoin as the “economic capital of the digital world.” He argued that as Manhattan consistently grew in value, Bitcoin offered a similar long-term investment opportunity. My thoughts on solving the national debt, strengthening the USD, ensuring US economic leadership via a Digital Assets Framework & #Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, $MSTR 's inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, & value created by our treasury operations with @SaraEisen . pic.twitter.com/3Mcu2ekGe2 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 16, 2024 “If I could go back, I’d buy Manhattan every year for 300 years,” Saylor said. He believes Bitcoin has the potential to grow 100 times its current value, making now the best time for the U.S. government to invest. Further Saylor suggested that the U.S. create a strategic Bitcoin reserve , either by selling part of its gold holdings or borrowing a fraction of its resources to acquire Bitcoin. According to Saylor, holding 20–25% of its reserves in Bitcoin would attract global capital, strengthen the dollar, and fuel economic growth. He likened this strategy to MicroStrategy’s own Bitcoin acquisition approach.

This has never happened in the history of crypto since now. Today Bitcoin reached $107,821 according to tradingview. BTC led the market cap of crypto space to reach $3.73 Trillion. All other cryptos are taking advantage of this time to grow rapidly. Bitcoin’s Big Jump: Why It Matters Bitcoin is currently trading at $106,656, up 1.72% from the day before. The market cap for Bitcoin is now a whopping $2.23 trillion, making up more than half of the entire crypto market. And if you’re wondering why, the big reason is the major money flow into Bitcoin. On Monday alone, Bitcoin ETFs saw $218 million in inflows, with big names like Fidelity and Ark jumping in. Source : Tradingview But that’s not all. Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has even floated the idea of using Bitcoin to help the U.S. tackle its huge debt. That’s a pretty big deal and shows that Bitcoin is starting to be seen as more than just a digital currency—it’s becoming part of global financial strategy. Ethereum and XRP Are Gaining Ground Ethereum is also in the mix. It’s been rising steadily and is now priced at $4,011, a 1.11% increase in just 24 hours. With a market cap of $483.28 billion, Ethereum is a big player. Even though its ETF inflows aren’t as large as Bitcoin’s, they’re still significant, and Ethereum’s not slowing down anytime soon. Then there’s XRP. It’s currently trading at $2.48, also up 2% in the past day. Some analysts think XRP could hit $7 in the near future, especially with the launch of RLUSD, a stablecoin that could boost its adoption and use. XRP’s market cap is at $142 billion, and it’s definitely one to watch closely. What’s Next for Crypto? Looking ahead, the future is bright for the crypto market. Bitcoin is definitely leading the way, but there’s a lot of potential for other coins to follow suit. Solana, for example, is expected to see massive growth by 2025. Even smaller tokens like Bitget Token are doing well, boosted by news that it’s now licensed in El Salvador to operate as a Bitcoin service provider.

B.C.'s bitcoin mining ban began in December 2022 to address energy concerns, and it faced a legal challenge from Conifex Timber, which the B.C. Supreme Court upheld in early 2024, citing the policy's reasonableness and alignment with public utility regulations.  BC Hydro, the largest electricity utility in the province, relies heavily on hydroelectric power, which generates over 90% of its electricity.  Vancouver's motion – introduced to the council by Mayor Ken Sim – focuses on bitcoin's financial benefits and mentions the benefits of bitcoin mining, but it can't influence mining because of electricity regulation and BC Hydro's operations fall under provincial jurisdiction.  ""The Province still has a ban on cryptocurrency mining and is continuing its work towards a permanent cryptocurrency mining policy,"" a spokesperson for BC Hydro said.  Earlier this year, B.C.'s legislature passed an updated version of the Energy Statutes Amendment Act, which was first drafted following B.C. Hydro's temporary suspension of bitcoin mining connections to the provincial grid.  The updated Act specifically enables the provincial government to bypass the BC Utilities Commission, the Provincial electricity regulator, giving it direct authority to regulate electricity service specifically for crypto.  Conifex Timber, which had bitcoin mining farms in the province scheduled for connection to the grid, argued in court that these conditions were ""unduly discriminatory and unreasonable,"" but ultimately, a Provincial judge disagreed.  ""One question arising out of the move towards regulating electricity with respect to crypto-mining projects is whether the Province could begin to regulate the availability of electricity for other industries in a similar manner,"" lawyers at McCarthy Tetrault, a Canadian law firm, wrote in a May 2024 post.  During the debate over the updated Act, lawyers from McCarthy Tetrault noted that the leader of the provincial Green Party argued in the legislature that Liquified Natural Gas and emerging technologies like AI should face similar energy regulations as bitcoin mining due to, what the party views as their high energy use and limited economic benefits.  Local bitcoin mining bans are not unique. New York State has a moratorium, with an exception for renewable energy. However, some states, like Arkansas and Montana, have bills that protect bitcoin miners from what they call ""discrimination.""  Pennsylvania recently scrapped its mining ban to advance other energy conservation bills.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/12/17/british-columbia-maintains-bitcoin-mining-ban-despite-vancouvers-btc-friendly-city-motion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38afcabda65a967d7324910b3a133d1cac32e063-2047x1355.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

During the energy crisis, miners are helping stabilize electricity grids and use extra energy that would otherwise go to waste. Although Bitcoin mining is often criticized for using a lot of energy, combining it with smart sustainability practices is making it an important part of Europe’s energy transition. Germany Leads the Charge Germany is using Bitcoin mining to support its energy grids, where renewables like wind and solar now make up almost 60% of power. Since renewables can be unpredictable, Bitcoin miners can balance this energy supply, with an ability to shut off when electricity prices surge and turn on when prices drop. This flexibility helps keep electricity grids stable, balancing the ups and downs of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Moreover, The European Bitcoin Energy Association (EBEA) is collaborating with Bitcoin miners to include them in national energy systems. In Austria, for example, surplus hydroelectric power is being used to support electricity grids, showing how Bitcoin mining can help balance energy supply and demand effectively. Others Leveraging Surplus Energy A pilot project by Austrian Power Grid and 21Energy is exploring how Bitcoin mining can be integrated with renewable energy systems. This project highlights how mining can use surplus energy to stabilize grids and solve problems like managing renewable energy sources like wind and hydro. Recently, El Salvador successfully mined 474 Bitcoins, worth around $46 million, using geothermal energy from its volcanoes. With 170 volcanoes in the region, President Nayib Bukele suggested a unique plan to rent out the country’s volcanoes to miners, offering them an opportunity to cut their operational costs while benefiting from a natural energy source. Scope for Sustainability Innovative projects like Terahash’s “Genesis” in Finland are showcasing how Bitcoin mining can serve dual purposes. This project uses mining to produce heat, which is then supplied to a local district heating network, providing hot water and heating for a town of 12,000 residents. Similarly, in Germany, small-scale initiatives, such as solar-powered Bitcoin miners at a car wash, demonstrate how mining can meet everyday energy needs efficiently while remaining environmentally friendly. Countries’ innovative ways of using Bitcoin mining are true examples of how Bitcoin can be part of our lives. Bitcoin mining is very important for Bitcoin to sustain and this integration can boost the cryptocurrency demand in coming times.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-bitcoin-mining-is-turning-europes-energy-problems-into-profits/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The surge comes as pro-crypto policies are in motion and MicroStrategy, Bitcoin’s top accumulator, joins the Nasdaq 100 Index, boosting investor confidence for even higher targets like $120,000. Here Are the Top 5 Key Reasons Why Bitcoin Is up Today But what’s driving this insane surge let’s just sit back and read on Anthony Pompliano’s take on his video analysis on Bitcoin’s New ATH high. First, demand for Bitcoin is increasing as more people view it as a reliable way to protect their money. When more buyers enter the market, the price naturally goes up. Pompliano explains as the value of the US dollar drops, investors are looking for better ways to protect their money. Bitcoin, being a digital form of money that no one controls, is becoming more popular with investors who want to guard their wealth against rising prices and weaker currencies. Second, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which makes it unique. Unlike traditional currencies, no one can create more Bitcoin. This scarcity increases its value over time, especially as demand grows. Moreover, Pompliano explains the typical cycle of demand and supply. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is going to cut interest rates again on 18th December to get us to 100 basis points. Further pumping the money supply and adding buying pressure. With limited supply, the price naturally goes up. Third, big investors, including large companies and financial institutions, are now investing significant amounts of money in Bitcoin. This adds more trust and credibility to the market while injecting large amounts of capital, driving the price higher. He also highlights that Bitcoin ETFs, approved in January 2024, made it easier for investors to access Bitcoin. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, with tens of billions of dollars flowing in from Wall Street. Fourth, global economic uncertainty is pushing people toward Bitcoin. Rising inflation and weakening currencies in many countries make people look for safer places to store their wealth. Countries like Russia, and Japan are eyeing Bitcoin to stabilize their economy. Since, Bitcoin is seen as a digital alternative to gold, which protects against economic instability. “December” Brings Hope Finally, other factors pilling in to push BTC up are comments from Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, who has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, with the firm recommending a 2% Bitcoin allocation for financial portfolios. This increased demand, alongside the growth of Bitcoin ETFs, is driving the price higher. Plus, recently Trump’s plans to create a Bitcoin Reserve also created ripples in the market with high expectations of creating it a mainstream financial investment option on a global scale.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-bitcoin-is-surging-today-5-key-reasons-behind-its-106k-breakout/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

In a recent analysis shared on X, the analyst discussed the asset’s recent price behavior and its long-term potential. XRP experienced an impressive rally of nearly 500% between mid-November and early December. The price surged to $2.87 before encountering resistance, leading to a temporary loss of momentum. Over the past two weeks, XRP has struggled to maintain its position around the $2 mark, briefly falling to $1.90 before recovering to its current value of $2.49 .

He described the ongoing price corrections as part of a natural cycle and urged non-traders to disregard these temporary changes, labeling them “noise.” According to the analyst, the asset’s overall structure remains exceptionally strong, reflecting a bullish trajectory. CrediBULL highlighted the token’s historical performance, noting its tendency to consolidate before significant breakouts. He emphasized that the asset’s current pattern is consistent with its previous bullish trends, reinforcing his optimism for future growth. XRP Reaching a $1.2 Trillion Market Cap Based on historical data and technical indicators, CrediBULL anticipates the token could reach a price of $22 in early 2025, potentially extending into the second quarter. This price level would represent an approximate 784% increase from its current value and bring the market capitalization to $1.26 trillion, a significant milestone for the asset. He referenced a detailed chart to describe the token’s potential upward movement, suggesting the asset is still in the early stages of a larger market cycle. While confident in his projections, CrediBULL acknowledged that the timeline is not exact and that the chart primarily provides a broader perspective on XRP’s market positioning. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Fundamental Factors vs. Technical Analysis When asked about external factors that could influence XRP’s price, such as the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin or changes in interest rates, CrediBULL explained that it is challenging to quantify the impact of specific catalysts. While acknowledging that these developments could contribute to buying pressure, he maintained that the overall market structure and technical indicators are more reliable for predicting future trends. He further clarified that while charts can guide market expectations, they do not account for all variables. As such, he recommended that investors approach the market step by step and remain focused on the larger picture rather than individual events or price movements. CrediBULL’s analysis reinforces optimism around XRP’s long-term growth potential. Despite recent consolidation, the asset demonstrates a strong bullish structure, positioning it for substantial gains soon.

Crypto exchange Binance is facing a trademark infringement lawsuit from Mark Longo over the unauthorized use of his ”Peanut the Squirrel” mascot for the PNUT meme coin. Additionally, Coinbase is battling in a $1 billion lawsuit that was filed by BiT Global Digital. The exchange is accused of anticompetitive behavior for delisting Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) to favor its own Coinbase BTC (cbBTC). SEC Targets CyberKongz The Web3 gaming and NFT industry may face a major setback after CyberKongz, a well known NFT platform, received a Wells notice from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a Dec. 16 post on X, CyberKongz shared that the SEC’s rhetoric surrounding the issuance of ERC-20 tokens in connection with blockchain games without registration as securities could have far-reaching consequences for the gaming sector. The platform plans to contest the SEC's stance. A Wells notice is a formal notification from the SEC indicating that it is considering enforcement action after an investigation. CyberKongz has been given 30 days to respond to the notice. The SEC’s concerns seem to relate to the “sale” of Genesis Kongz NFTs in April of 2021. However, CyberKongz clarified that this event was a contract migration and not a primary sale. The NFT platform also pointed out that it has primarily been bootstrapped, with no capital raises and only a modest treasury, while enduring this scrutiny for more than two years. CyberKongz suggested that the SEC’s move is very likely a last-minute attempt by the Biden administration to slow down the growth of the Web3 industry. The team is hopeful for a change under a future administration but pledged to continue fighting for NFT projects across all chains. The platform even received support from Axie Infinity co-founder Jihoz Zirlin , who is optimistic that the “persecution” of Web3 innovators will come to an end. CyberKongz floor price (Source: CoinGecko ) Despite the Wells notice, the CyberKongz NFT market remained resilient. CoinGecko data reveals that the floor price of CyberKongz NFTs actually rose by 19+% in the past 24 hours to reach an average of 8.59 ETH, which is approximately $26,900. This incident is the second high-profile Wells notice served to an NFT and gaming firm in recent months after the SEC’s notice to Australian-based Immutable on Nov. 1. Binance Faces Trademark Clash Over PNUT Meme Coin Crypto exchanges are also facing some legal troubles, but not necessarily from the SEC. Mark Longo, the creator of Peanut the Squirrel, issued a cease-and-desist letter to crypto exchange Binance, accusing it of trademark infringement over its promotion of the PNUT-themed meme coin. Longo claims that Binance used his “Peanut the Squirrel” trademark and mascot likeness without his permission to market the PNUT cryptocurrency. He says this infringes on intellectual property he used for educational and animal welfare purposes since 2017. The letter demands Binance immediately stop using the PNUT name and mascot, and also warned of potential legal penalties of up to $150,000 per infringement under the United States Copyright Act. Longo’s legal team shared that Binance’s use of the terms “PEANUT THE SQUIRREL” and “PNUT,” along with a copyrighted image of the squirrel mascot, creates consumer confusion by implying a connection or endorsement Longo never actually authorized. The complaint argues that Binance’s actions are an unlawful reproduction and display of protected intellectual property. Legal experts believe his case could set an important precedent for intellectual property rights in the meme coin market, where viral branding and decentralized assets often blur legal boundaries. The cease-and-desist letter was issued after the rising popularity of PNUT-themed meme coins, which gained a lot of traction after a viral event in October . The surge of Peanut-branded tokens led to two related meme coins ranking in Dexscreener’s top 10 tokens by trading volume. The PNUT token itself reached a market capitalization of $2.25 billion on Nov. 14. This rapid rise drew the attention from major exchanges, including Coinbase and Kraken, which are reportedly considering listing PNUT. PNUT market cap over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Longo gave Binance until Dec. 31 to comply with his demands and confirm in writing that all infringing activities will stop. Should Binance fail to meet these requirements, Longo may pursue legal action in a U.S. court. The outcome of this dispute could also have serious broader implications for intellectual property enforcement in the crypto and meme coin sectors. Coinbase Faces $1 Billion Lawsuit Coinbase is facing a $1 billion lawsuit that was filed by BiT Global Digital. The lawsuit accuses the crypto exchange of anticompetitive behavior over its decision to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) in November. BiT Global alleges that Coinbase delisted wBTC to promote its own competing Bitcoin-based token, Coinbase BTC (cbBTC), and claims the move constitutes monopolization of the wrapped Bitcoin market under the Sherman Act. The lawsuit was filed on Nov. 19 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by law firm Kneupper & Covey, and it accuses Coinbase of predatory practices, including issuing false statements about wBTC’s compliance to undermine its market position. BiT Global is convinced that the delisting was strategically aimed at steering market dominance toward cbBTC. Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, responded to the accusations and defended the company’s listing and delisting practices. Grewal explained that Coinbase is very committed to maintaining very high listing standards and stated that assets that do not meet those standards will be delisted. Others meeting its market requirements would be added. However, Grewal’s defense drew some backlash from the crypto community, including Tron founder Justin Sun. Sun questioned Coinbase’s transparency by pointing to previous comments that were made by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, where Armstrong claimed the exchange is “asset agnostic” and committed to offering consumer choice in the crypto economy. The delisting of wBTC has sparked a lot of controversy overall, particularly as it happened soon after Coinbase’s announcement of cbBTC, which is positioned to boost Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (BTCFi). Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is a tokenized version of Bitcoin that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Each wBTC is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin, which means that its value mirrors that of BTC. It allows Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, like lending, borrowing, and trading, without needing to sell their Bitcoin. This is achieved by ”wrapping” Bitcoin into an ERC-20 token, which makes it compatible with Ethereum's ecosystem. Critics argue that Coinbase’s actions completely contradict its earlier statements and are a conflict of interest. BiT Global’s complaint also pointed out that while wBTC was delisted, Coinbase still continued onboarding meme coins. This raised some serious questions about its consistency when it comes to actually enforcing listing standards.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6566/web3-gaming-at-risk-as-cyber-kongz-receives-sec-wells-notice,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Anchorage’s acquisition of the BitLicense brings the total number of approved companies to 34 since the program began in 2015. This reflects growing acceptance and a clearer regulatory framework for crypto businesses in New York. The list includes major players like Bakkt, bitFlyer, BitPay, Bitooda and Coinbase. Debate Over New York’s Crypto Rules Continues The BitLicense has drawn mixed reactions from crypto enthusiasts . Critics argue that its strict requirements could stifle innovation or drive companies out of New York. However, by obtaining this license, Anchorage Digital shows its commitment to regulatory compliance and its strategy to serve institutional clients in one of the most regulated US crypto markets. Despite calls for its amendment or repeal, New York continues to enforce the BitLicense to balance cryptocurrency innovation with consumer protection and financial system integrity. The NYDFS introduced changes like the “conditional BitLicense,” allowing newcomers to partner with established license holders for easier entry. However, these reforms have not fully quieted critics. New York’s approach reflects a broader regulatory trend. Despite industry pushback, regulators remain hesitant to loosen oversight due to risks like money laundering and fraud. This strict enforcement also aligns with New York’s role as a major financial hub, where strong regulations are seen as vital to protecting its financial integrity and reputation.

Ethena Labs’ launch of its BlackRock-backed USDtb stablecoin has garnered $65.4 million in total value locked within its first day, while renewed interest in XRP and anticipation for Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin have driven a 250% surge in user activity for Xaman, a leading self-custodial wallet in the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Ethena Labs’ USDtb Stablecoin Launch Sees $65.4 Million Locked in First Day Ethena Labs officially launched its BlackRock-backed stablecoin, USDtb, on Dec. 16, 2024, amassing an impressive $65.4 million in total value locked (TVL) within its first 24 hours. USDtb is positioned as a cash or cash-equivalent backed stablecoin with a 1:1 reserve ratio, offering holders both stability and liquidity similar to established competitors like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Ethena Labs introduced USDtb as a strategic tool to help users of its flagship synthetic dollar product, USDe, navigate bearish markets. The firm noted in its Dec. 16 announcement that USDtb would allow Ethena to ”close hedging positions underlying USDe” and reallocate the backing assets to USDtb. This move is expected to further reduce risks associated with USDe during challenging market environments. USDtb’s underlying assets are primarily allocated to BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, in partnership with blockchain tokenization leader Securitize. BlackRock’s involvement signifies growing institutional adoption of tokenized assets within the DeFi ecosystem. USDtb’s launch has already received praise from influential voices in the blockchain space. José Maria Macedo, co-founder of Delphi Labs, predicted USDtb will become the largest tokenized treasury product within a month. Meanwhile, Seraphim Czecker, Ethena’s head of growth, emphasized the product’s scalability potential, suggesting USDtb could grow to $100 billion. According to Czecker, Ethena’s ability to allocate capital efficiently, even in bearish conditions, enables the stablecoin to offer yield stability through an ”APY floor” aligned with US Treasury Bill rates. USDtb's reserves are composed of 90% US Treasury Bill-backed funds and 10% liquid stablecoins like USDC. The latter ensures USDtb maintains sufficient liquidity during weekends and other periods when Treasury markets are inactive. Ethena Labs' meticulous approach to security has further bolstered confidence in the new stablecoin. The core smart contracts underwent three separate audits by leading security firms — Pashov, Quantstamp, and Cyfrin — in October, with no high or medium-level vulnerabilities reported. USDtb’s approval by Ethena’s Risk Committee in September paved the way for its official rollout, with final adjustments completed earlier this month. Ethena’s Growing Dominance in the Stablecoin Market USDtb’s launch comes on the heels of Ethena Labs’ success with USDe, which recently overtook MakerDAO’s Dai (DAI) to become the third-largest stablecoin in the market. However, while USDe boasts a market capitalization of $5.87 billion, it still lags behind the dominant forces of USDT and USDC, which hold market caps of $140.6 billion and $42.1 billion, respectively, according to DefiLlama data . The stablecoin sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth. The total stablecoin market capitalization surpassed $200 billion this year, and leading crypto asset manager Bitwise predicts it will double to $400 billion by 2025. Bitwise’s forecast hinges on the anticipated approval of US stablecoin legislation, which could provide a clear regulatory framework and further institutional adoption. The launch of USDtb is part of the growing intersection between traditional finance (TradFi) and DeFi. BlackRock’s significant involvement through its Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund exemplifies how major financial players are increasingly participating in the tokenization of real-world assets, a trend widely regarded as a cornerstone for DeFi’s long-term growth. As Ethena Labs solidifies its position with both USDe and USDtb, the firm continues to challenge traditional stablecoin incumbents by offering innovative risk management and real-world asset backing. The immediate traction USDtb has gained also signals rising investor interest in yield-bearing stablecoins that combine institutional-grade security with DeFi-level accessibility. Overall, Ethena Labs' rollout of USDtb represents more than just another stablecoin launch. It marks a pivotal moment for stablecoin innovation, demonstrating the potential of tokenized real-world assets to enhance liquidity, risk management, and scalability in DeFi. With institutional backing from BlackRock, rigorous audits, and an ambitious growth outlook, USDtb is poised to capture significant market share in the months ahead. The success of USDtb’s launch also reflects broader trends shaping the stablecoin sector, as institutional and retail investors increasingly seek stable, liquid, and yield-generating digital assets amid evolving market dynamics. If USDtb meets its projected growth targets, it could cement Ethena Labs' status as a major player in the stablecoin landscape. XRP Surge and Ripple’s Stablecoin Launch Drive 250% User Growth for Xaman Wallet In other stablecoin news, renewed excitement surrounding XRP and the anticipated launch of Ripple’s USD stablecoin ( RLUSD ) has sparked a massive resurgence in user activity for Xaman, a self-custodial wallet designed for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. Weekly active users on Xaman surged by 250% since summer, with the platform now exceeding 212,000 active users, according to Robert Kiuru, Xaman’s Chief Operating Officer. Xaman’s remarkable spike in activity coincides with XRP’s recent price rally and renewed investor optimism. The number of active weekly users grew from a summer low of 60,000 to over 212,000 in December. This jump, which includes 80,000 newly signed-up users, reflects XRP’s rising volatility and its brief return to the position of the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization on Dec. 2. Kiuru emphasized that XRP’s bullish movement accounted for 90% of the recent user activity, with much of the momentum also driven by growing interest in Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is poised to further strengthen the XRPL ecosystem, potentially driving increased adoption for wallets like Xaman. RLUSD, a USD-pegged stablecoin, aims to provide users with stability in volatile markets while further expanding Ripple’s role in the digital asset economy. Industry experts, such as Axelar co-founder Sergey Gorbunov, have suggested that RLUSD could significantly boost demand for XRP as the stablecoin integrates into XRPL-based projects, bringing liquidity and utility to the broader ecosystem. Rebranded from Xumm in May 2023, Xaman remains a core player within the XRPL ecosystem. Initially funded by Ripple’s investment arm Xpring (now Ripplex), Xaman was created by prominent Ripple developer Wietse Wind, known for building XRP-focused applications such as XRParrot and XRPTipBot. Ripple’s backing of XRPL Labs in 2019 and 2020 established Xaman as one of the first projects to receive direct support from Ripple. Kiuru highlighted Xaman’s strategic importance, noting that “almost every XRPL project integrates with Xaman via ‘Sign in with Xumm,’ offering secure, seamless transactions.” The wallet has emerged as a gateway for users to interact with XRPL projects, bridging the gap between developers and end-users. While XRPL itself doesn’t natively support smart contracts, Xaman has extended its capabilities through the Xahau Network. Xahau, a blockchain forked from XRPL, enables smart contracts using Hooks — a lightweight functionality designed for developers. “Smart contracts on Xahau use Hooks, developed by XRPL Labs,” Kiuru explained. The integration of Hooks allows Xaman users to access smart contract functionalities, enhancing the wallet’s utility for developers and end-users seeking advanced on-chain features. Xaman also facilitates on- and off-ramps for fiat through integrated platforms like Uphold’s Topper, providing users with greater flexibility when moving assets between XRPL and traditional finance. Xaman’s Evolution and Ripple’s Continued Support Xaman’s journey signals the maturation of the XRPL ecosystem, from Ripple’s early investments to its current role as a self-custodial wallet driving user engagement. Ripple’s strategic backing of XRPL Labs in 2019-2020 marked a key milestone, helping establish Xaman as a trusted platform for XRP holders and developers. Ripple’s vision of building a robust ecosystem around the XRPL is now materializing with initiatives like RLUSD and platforms like Xaman. These efforts aim to combine decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities with enterprise-grade solutions, positioning the XRPL as a competitive force in the blockchain industry. The broader XRP market rally has also contributed to growing optimism within the XRPL community. XRP’s recent price movements have reignited investor confidence, further amplified by Ripple’s legal victories and ongoing developments. The upcoming launch of RLUSD is expected to enhance liquidity and utility within the XRPL ecosystem, benefiting wallets like Xaman that play a pivotal role in user adoption.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP | ENA,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6567/ethena-labs-us-dtb-stablecoin-launch-gains-65-million-on-day-one,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37744280,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=110763,1734412800,"HTX Ventures Identifies Five Rapidly-Growing Sectors in 2024, Expects Positive Crypto Regulations Driven by Trump Next Year","SINGAPORE , Dec. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — As Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark on December 5, 2024 , this landmark year for the crypto industry is closing on a high note. It has also been a fruitful year for HTX Ventures, the global investment division of HTX, which supported a total of 28 leading crypto projects and funds, continually exploring new frontiers of crypto utility. Recently, HTX Ventures released its 2024 Year In Review , highlighting this year’s key developments in the crypto industry and forecasting market trends for the upcoming year. Within this report, HTX Ventures highlighted five key sectors that showed encouraging progress in 2024 – the Bitcoin Ecosystem, Infrastructure, Meme Coins, AI, and the TON Ecosystem – and will continue to closely monitor these areas in 2025. Bitcoin Ecosystem With Bitcoin dominance reaching 56.81% and Bitcoin spot ETFs now accounting for 5.3% of the total Bitcoin supply, a new market trend has emerged. Bitcoin has solidified its position as the core asset, with spot ETFs acting as liquidity channels, and U.S. listed companies such as MicroStrategy (MSTR) serving as the vehicles to absorb unlimited dollar liquidity. As a result, it is increasingly essential to further develop Bitcoin’s ecosystem and enhance capital utilization efficiency. It has driven infrastructure projects, including Layer 2s, execution layers, interoperability solutions and security layers, to continuously emerge. With strong support from macro markets and infrastructure support, HTX Ventures anticipates a further surge in Bitcoin demand over the next two years. Infrastructure Infrastructure remained a cornerstone in this year’s crypto investments and funding. The synergy between capital and technology has driven the rapid development of Layer 1, Layer 2, and middleware projects, among others. Through ongoing upgrades and construction, the Ethereum ecosystem has improved Layer 2s’ performance and reduced network fees. Other Layer 1s, such as Solana and TRON, achieved active on-chain transactions, attributable to the development of meme coins, and infrastructure like Pump.fun and Sunpump. Layer 0 and cross-chain middleware have made breakthroughs in interoperability, expanding the multi-chain landscape. Modular public blockchains, like Celestia and Monad, offered exceptional performance and flexibility, thus attracting diverse applications. Restaking projects, which aim to enhance network security and capital efficiency, has seen speedy development and gained market attention. Bitcoin Layer 2 has emerged as a new focus in the primary market for its attempt to combine Bitcoin’s security with high-performance scaling solutions. As HTX Ventures stated, infrastructure is still imperative in this year’s crypto investments and funding. Layer 1 solutions, in particular, now represent the focal point of technical development and exploration within the crypto space, and it is expected to remain a priority for development resources and capital investment in the future. Meme Coins The Meme coin sector emerged as a hotspot in the crypto market in 2024, fostering community consensus while integrating with fields like DeFi and GameFi to create new use cases. For example, Solana has actively championed the innovation and growth of meme projects, successfully energizing its ecosystem. As the crypto market environment grows increasingly favorable, more retail investors are expected to enter the market, positioning Meme projects as vital channels for capital inflows. The Meme coin fair launch sector has gained significant market attention and attracted substantial participants this year. Infrastructure projects such as Pump.fun and SunPump have emerged as top-performing cash flow generators, injecting fresh momentum into Meme coin development. As multi-chain ecosystems mature and real-world use cases expand, Meme coin infrastructure will continue injecting more vitality into this sector. AI In 2024, the intersection of Crypto and AI sector has been driving the exploration of several segmented fields such as ZK/OPML for enabling AI on-chain, AI data crowdsourcing, decentralized computing power rental, AI data trading, AI games, and AI agents. One of the hottest segmented fields is AI agents, which are put on chains to take advantage of the token mechanism to incentivise and bootstrap certain behaviors with the agents, including interacting with smart contracts, trading and querying on behalf of users. In the future, AI agents will gradually become personal butlers and assistants for users, serving them with comprehensive capabilities, such as independent asset issuance, initiation of viral marketing campaigns, formation of DAOs, and even fund management and investment decision-making. Over time, they may develop unique cultures and religions. This deep integration of AI and encryption technology is a groundbreaking evolution that is unattainable within Web2 and cannot be achieved by Web3 relying solely on encryption technology. TON Ecosystem Attributable to Telegram’s hundreds of millions of users and robust technical support, the TON (The Open Network) ecosystem has progressively developed into a multi-layered blockchain ecosystem. In 2024, it experienced a full-scale boom in its ecosystem and market presence. From DeFi and meme coins to NFTs and gaming, TON leveraged its massive user base to achieve significant milestones in various fields, pioneering the monetization of Web2 social applications through crypto. One standout success was the adoption of “tap-to-earn” games with token airdrop incentives, which effectively onboarded a large number of Web2 users. However, as the TON ecosystem moves into 2025, it must explore and find new business models to improve user retention and identify its next growth curve. 2025 Outlook Donald Trump’s expected repeal of SAB 121 after his inauguration on January 20, 2025 , would allow traditional financial institutions to hold crypto assets on their balance sheets, further accelerating the institutionalization of crypto assets. The repeal will not only open up more financing options for crypto but also make spot cryptos more accessible through existing institutional exchanges and partnerships. At the same time, this regulatory easing is poised to enhance the overall maturity of the institutional crypto market. With the entry of traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin is anticipated to gain stronger support and gradually establish itself as a core dollar-denominated asset, alongside others tied to the dollar industry cycles, such as AI. HTX Ventures points out that the market is still far from its bull market peak. Against the backdrop of Trump’s fiscal expansion policies and unprecedented crypto-friendly signals, a robust bull market is expected.

37743884,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52354,1734411719,How cryptocurrency casinos work and their main advantages,"The world of online gambling has undergone significant transformations with the advent of cryptocurrency casinos. These innovative platforms combine blockchain technology and traditional casino entertainment to offer a unique, secure, and efficient gaming experience. Cryptocurrency casinos leverage digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin to redefine online gaming. By integrating blockchain technology, these platforms ensure enhanced security, transparency, and faster transactions compared to traditional online casinos. Players worldwide are drawn to the benefits offered by a modern crypto casino experience. What Are Cryptocurrency Casinos? Cryptocurrency casinos begin with a simple registration process, where players create an account with minimal personal information. This streamlined process ensures privacy while enabling quick access to the platform. Once registered, players link their digital wallets, allowing seamless transactions directly between their wallets and the casino. Deposits and withdrawals are carried out using cryptocurrency, offering unmatched speed and efficiency. Players send crypto from their wallets to the casino’s address for deposits, and winnings are sent back in the same manner, eliminating the delays often associated with traditional banking systems. A standout feature of crypto casinos is the use of blockchain technology to ensure provably fair gaming. This system allows players to verify the fairness of game outcomes by reviewing blockchain-based algorithms, adding a layer of trust and transparency that is often missing in traditional casinos. Finally, cryptocurrency casinos operate on decentralized networks, bypassing intermediaries like banks. This not only reduces transaction fees but also ensures global accessibility, allowing players from various regions to participate without currency conversion issues or geographical restrictions. Advantages of Cryptocurrency Casinos Enhanced Security Cryptocurrency transactions use advanced encryption and blockchain technology, making them highly secure. Unlike traditional payment methods, which are prone to fraud and hacking, crypto casinos provide a tamper-proof ledger for all transactions. Greater Anonymity Cryptocurrency casinos prioritize player privacy. Transactions are linked to wallet addresses instead of personal information, allowing players to gamble without disclosing sensitive details. This is especially beneficial for those who value their online anonymity. Faster Transactions Deposits and withdrawals in crypto casinos are processed almost instantly. Traditional banking systems often take days to process payments, whereas blockchain technology ensures swift and seamless transactions. Lower Fees Since transactions occur directly between players and casinos without intermediaries, fees are significantly lower. This allows players to enjoy more of their winnings without deductions for banking or payment processing. Global Accessibility Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and not bound by geographic restrictions. Players from around the world can participate in crypto casinos without worrying about currency conversions or regional banking limitations. Provably Fair Gaming Crypto casinos often integrate provably fair systems, enabling players to verify game outcomes using blockchain data. This builds trust and ensures transparency, which is not always guaranteed in traditional casinos. Popular Games at Cryptocurrency Casinos Cryptocurrency casinos offer a diverse range of games to cater to various preferences, including: Slots : From classic three-reel slots to advanced 3D video slots, there’s something for every player. Table Games : Enjoy classics like blackjack, roulette, and poker. Provably Fair Games : Unique games designed specifically for crypto casinos, ensuring transparency. Live Dealer Games : Real-time gaming experiences with professional dealers. Choosing the Right Crypto Casino When selecting a cryptocurrency casino, reputation should be your top consideration. Opt for platforms, which have positive reviews and a strong track record. Reliable platforms often feature advanced security measures, transparent gaming practices, and excellent customer support to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. The variety of games available is another crucial factor. A good crypto casino will offer a broad selection, including slots, table games, and live dealer options, to cater to diverse player preferences. Check whether your favorite games are available before committing to a platform. Bonuses and promotions tailored for crypto users add extra value to your gaming experience. Look for casinos that offer generous welcome bonuses, cashback deals, and ongoing promotions. These incentives not only enhance your bankroll but also make your time on the platform more rewarding. Finally, prioritize platforms with robust customer support. Whether through live chat, email, or a comprehensive FAQ section, reliable support can address issues quickly, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free gaming experience. Platforms like Rakebit excel in providing round-the-clock assistance to their players. Final Thoughts Cryptocurrency casinos are revolutionizing the online gambling industry by providing enhanced security, anonymity, and efficiency. Whether you’re new to crypto gambling or a seasoned player, exploring these platforms opens up exciting possibilities in the world of online gaming.

Could Cardano (ADA) and IntelMarkets (INTL) be the actual stars of 2025 since Ethereum (ETH) seems to have been witnessing strong bearish pressure lately? Read on to find out why despite Ethereum’s (ETH) future seeming bright, Cardano (ADA) and IntelMarkets might outperform it next year. IntelMarkets (INTL) Offers Cutting-Edge Crypto Tools and Security IntelMarkets is a safe haven for strategic hedging, therefore controlling market volatility, in addition to being a strong platform for speculative trading. Using perpetual futures contracts, traders can guard their portfolios against losses by opening positions that balance possible drops in their holdings, therefore countering price downturns. By shorting BTC futures, for example, a Bitcoin (BTC) holder can protect their portfolio against a market collapse. Supported by over $500,000 in development grants, IntelMarkets will be further enhanced by the forthcoming Rodeum blockchain infrastructure, which powers decentralized apps and supports the INTL ecosystem. IntelMarkets guarantees traders may optimize profitability while avoiding risk in the fast-moving crypto market utilizing automated trading robots and sophisticated risk management tools. As IntelMarkets keeps innovating, it’s introducing a quantum-proof crypto custody solution with the Quantum X Wallet, providing industry-leading security for hassle-free asset management. From big cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to developing altcoins and niche tokens, IntelMarkets provides a wide spectrum of asset pairs that let traders vary their strategies and maximize success. Now is an opportunity to accumulate one of the top crypto coins positioned for exponential gains as the INTL utility token is now on sale at just $0.073273 in its eighth presale stage. A Bullish Rebound on the Horizon for Ethereum (ETH) With the Ethereum price rising from $3,700 to almost $4,100 before declining down to the $3,700 zone as bearish pressure set in, also it has seen noteworthy volatility over the past week. The Ethereum price has shown resilience by keeping support higher than the $3,840 level despite these swings. Maintaining an overall optimistic trend on the annual Ethereum price chart, the price structure of the altcoin shows higher highs and higher lows. Ethereum (ETH) is among the top altcoins to keep an eye on for possible significant recoveries as the recent pullbacks could be temporary and the altcoin is probably going to resume a significant bullish trend. Though Ethereum’s (ETH) all-time high (ATH) of $4,891 was achieved in 2021, experts remain hopeful that the altcoin could hit this mark before the year ends. Buy signals from the MACD and Moving Averages on the Ethereum price chart together with positive sentiment help to strengthen the belief that is headed for more price appreciation. Among the top crypto coins that are yet to hit a new ATH this year, Ethereum’s (ETH) continuous consolidation and strong technical signals point to a breakout to new highs perhaps approaching. Cardano (ADA) Eyes a Strong Comeback After failing to keep its position above the $1.25 to $1.12 level, the Cardano price has seen some notable volatility over the previous week. As a result, the Cardano price dropped more than 6%. Although Cardano (ADA) dropped below the crucial $1 barrier, it gained support at the $0.92 level where positive momentum swiftly recovered. With this price action, the Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin has entered a phase of consolidation around the $1 mark; inventors are closely watching its subsequent activity. Cardano (ADA) has had a good month despite recent losses; its price rose noticeably, reaching $1.30 before running across opposition. Though Cardano’s (ADA) long-term prospects remain bright despite recent declines, analysts think that the upward momentum of the altcoin will shortly start again, pushing the price above the $1.30 resistance level and straight back toward its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10. Cardano (ADA) is still regarded as one of the top altcoins to hold given buy signals from important technical indicators including the MACD and Moving Averages on the Cardano price chart. IntelMarkets (INTL) Set to Outperform Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) IntelMarkets (INTL) is taking the most space in investors’ portfolios while Ethereum (ETH) is attracting institutional interest and Cardano (ADA) is battling with consolidation. It is positioned to lead the 2025 rally with modern trading tools, unparalleled security, and an innovative platform that makes profit generation easier for traders.

37743883,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52352,1734411461,BITBinvest Announces Leverage Options Available on Major Assets,"How New Leverage Options Can Help You Maximize Your Trading Potential? BITBinvest.com has announced the launch of leverage trading across major asset classes, enhancing its platform’s capabilities to offer traders a competitive edge in key markets such as forex, stocks, commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies. This new feature takes BITBinvest’s services to the next level, placing them at the forefront of the industry. Leverage is one of the most powerful tools for traders looking to upscale their potential returns on investment. With customizable options, traders can now balance opportunity and risk to pre-set levels based on their strategy. Below, we detail what these new leverage options entail and how both novice and professional traders can employ them efficiently on the BITBinvest platform. Understanding Leverage: Power and Potential in Trading! Leverage trading allows traders to control larger-sized positions in the market by using less capital. For instance, with a 10:1 leverage ratio, a trader can manage a $10,000 position with only $1,000 of their own funds. BITBinvest’s new leverage options provide easier access to a wider variety of high-value positions, helping traders maximize their potential returns. Leverage offers significant benefits by increasing exposure without requiring additional upfront capital, especially when combined with sound risk management strategies. However, BITBinvest emphasizes the importance of understanding that leverage also magnifies risks, and losses can be higher than expected. Therefore, both its advantages and risks should be clearly understood before diving in. Leverage Options on Major Asset Classes: Forex The forex market, being one of the largest and most liquid markets in the world, naturally lends itself to leverage options. BITBinvest offers pre-built leverage ratios on widely traded currency pairs, such as EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY. Leverage in forex trading allows traders to maximize opportunities in this fast-moving market, capitalizing on even small currency fluctuations for greater profit. Stocks Leverage trading on stocks enables traders to access shares with less capital, allowing them to invest in blue-chip companies, tech stocks, and high-growth sectors. BITBinvest’s leverage options on popular stocks allow traders to capture substantial market movements while making a smaller initial investment. Commodities Commodity traders can now use leverage to trade major commodities such as gold, silver, crude oil, and agricultural products. Leverage in the volatile commodities market can be particularly useful, as price changes, even small ones, can lead to significant profits. BITBinvest provides flexible leverage options to help traders diversify their portfolios and maximize their potential returns across physical assets. Indices Leverage trading on indices allows traders to speculate on the performance of whole sectors or national economies. BITBinvest’s leverage options on major global indices like the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and FTSE 100 offer traders increased buying power to take advantage of market movements on a larger scale. Cryptocurrencies The cryptocurrency market, known for its extreme volatility, has seen a rise in leverage trading. BITBinvest allows traders to increase their exposure to digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and rising altcoins. While leverage can amplify returns, BITBinvest urges traders to apply strict risk management strategies, as the volatility of crypto markets can lead to substantial losses if not carefully managed. How to Leverage Strategically on BITBinvest? Leverage trading is best suited for traders with a clear strategy and disciplined approach. BITBinvest offers several tools to help traders set stop-loss orders and take-profit points, which are critical elements of risk management in leveraged positions. Effective strategies for leveraging include: Scalping : A high-frequency trading strategy where small price movements are exploited. Leverage can amplify these minor gains, making them more profitable. Swing Trading : Leveraging medium-term price trends, traders can benefit from leveraging trades that align with broader market movements. Hedging : This involves taking an opposite position to reduce risk on an existing trade. Leverage can be particularly helpful for hedging in volatile markets like commodities and forex. Responsible Trading and Risk Management At BITBinvest, responsible trading is a top priority. The platform encourages traders to be fully aware of the risks associated with margin trading. Several risk management features are implemented to assist traders: Margin Calls : BITBinvest issues margin calls if a trader’s equity level falls below the required minimum, preventing involuntary liquidation of positions. Negative Balance Protection : BITBinvest’s negative balance protection ensures that traders can never lose more than their initial deposit, preventing them from owing additional funds. Educational Resources : BITBinvest offers webinars, guides, and tutorials to educate traders on the best practices for leveraging, helping them set strict limits and establish clear exit strategies. The BITBinvest Advantage: Personalized Leverage Ratios BITBinvest provides traders with a range of leverage ratios based on the asset class. This allows traders to choose the ratio that best suits their risk tolerance and trading objectives. For volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, lower leverage ratios are available, while more stable markets such as forex and indices come with higher ratios. This flexibility enables traders to: Diversify into multiple markets with competitive leverage ratios. Choose leverage levels based on their strategy and market conditions. Better manage exposure by adjusting leverage across different asset classes. Conclusion: Take Full Advantage with BITBinvest Leverage Options! BITBinvest’s new leverage options provide a state-of-the-art solution for traders looking to maximize their market exposure across forex, stocks, commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies. With flexible leverage ratios and a robust trading environment, BITBinvest enables traders to make the most of their capital, while prioritizing risk management and responsible trading practices. By offering real-time data, advanced risk controls, and educational resources, BITBinvest ensures that traders are well-equipped to confidently navigate leveraged trades. Whether you are an experienced trader or a newcomer, BITBinvest’s leverage offerings unlock new opportunities, amplifying your trading potential and allowing you to adapt to today’s fast-paced markets.

37743882,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52349,1734410936,Serhii Tokarev: AI Is Becoming Commonplace—Insights from Web Summit 2024,"Every year, Web Summit in Lisbon unites tech stakeholders, companies, and enthusiasts. The event in 2024 made one thing clear: artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept but a present reality reshaping the world. Industry leaders and innovators emphasized AI’s rapid integration into business and daily life, proving its transition from a trend to an essential technology. “AI will become commonplace. Web Summit proves it, and makes one thing abundantly clear—AI is transitioning from a trend to a fundamental aspect of how we work, innovate, and live. This transformation is not just on the horizon; it is happening now,” said Serhii Tokarev , co-founder and partner at Roosh Ventures. The Business Case for AI AI has become critical for businesses looking to remain competitive. Companies that resist adopting it risk falling behind. “Companies that ignore AI risk obsolescence, while those who embrace it are at the forefront of a new era,” emphasized Serhii Tokarev. Businesses are leveraging AI to improve efficiency, personalize services, and unlock valuable insights. From streamlining operations to hyper-personalized customer solutions, AI’s versatility is unmatched. Its adoption rate is accelerating; 65% of enterprises now use generative AI, according to McKinsey & Company. The financial investment in AI reflects its rising importance. In 2024, global funding for AI startups jumped by 45%, reaching $127 billion, per PitchBook. Microsoft plans to spend $1.3 billion on AI initiatives over three years, while Google is collaborating with European AI research labs. These investments underscore AI’s inevitability in the business landscape. Transforming Industries and Society AI is making its mark in various sectors. In healthcare, it speeds up drug discovery and enhances patient care. In manufacturing and retail, it optimizes processes and improves customer experiences. Outside of business, AI is advancing climate science, biodiversity conservation, and precision farming. Web Summit also highlighted how AI enhances team collaboration and decision-making within companies. However, Serhii Tokarev cautioned about cybersecurity risks, emphasizing, “Cybersecurity and cyber hygiene will become the new normal for everyone in their personal lives and a necessity for companies.” AI-powered tools are already critical for fraud detection and protecting sensitive data. AI’s Role in Everyday Life AI has become an integral part of daily routines. Tools like ChatGPT are widely used for learning, creative tasks, and communication. A Boston Consulting Group survey revealed that 75% of respondents use AI-powered tools, reflecting their growing adoption. The consumer market is also adapting. The smart home industry, valued at $87.51 billion in 2022, is expected to grow significantly due to AI-driven innovations. In addition, AI is reshaping the job market. The World Economic Forum predicts it will create 97 million new jobs globally by 2025, while automating 85 million existing roles. “AI is transforming the job market, reshaping some professions while creating millions of new ones. That’s why we founded SET University in Ukraine—to prepare future leaders for the technology-driven economy,” said Serhii Tokarev. Preparing for the AI Future Web Summit 2024 confirmed that AI is no longer a choice but a necessity. Businesses and individuals must embrace it to thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world. Serhii Tokarev concluded: “AI opens up a lot of new opportunities. The urgency is clear: to thrive in the future, we must learn to make the most of AI’s potential in our personal lives and for work.” AI’s future holds tremendous promise, from scientific breakthroughs to improved daily conveniences. However, addressing challenges like cybersecurity and workforce disruption will be critical. The question now is not if but how we will integrate AI responsibly and effectively into our lives and industries.

On Monday, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) noted that the project is “not authorized .” Authorities have asked users to “avoid dealing with this firm and beware of scams.” “Almost all firms and individuals must be authorised by us to carry out or promote financial services in the UK. This firm is not authorised by us and may be targeting people in the UK.” Further, the FCA cautioned users that if things go wrong, the firm doesn’t fall under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means it’s unlikely you’d get your money back if the firm goes out of business, the warning read. The warning comes as the regulator proposes new strict crypto regulations to curb risks within the digital asset space. The FCA released a discussion paper, planning to outlaw public crypto offerings by non-regulated entities. The FCA has been trying to focus more on crypto recently. The financial watchdog onboarded several crypto staff , aiming to approve more crypto firms after rejecting around 86% of applicants previously. Retardio Responds to FCA Warning With a Clown Meme The Solana-based Retardio posted a meme in response to the FCA warning, depicting Jeff Bezos in a clown dress. “The Bezos Cabal send their regards,” the memecoin project wrote. “Oi come get me bruv.” The Bezos Cabal send their regards.

South Korean crypto exchange giant Upbit’s announcement to list MOCA Network (MOCA), for one, has had a dramatic effect on its market performance. Whale Moves Millions in MOCA After Upbit announced the listing of MOCA, its price surge prompted two wallets, likely linked to the same whale, to deposit 9.5 million MOCA tokens worth $3.55 million to Bybit. If these tokens are fully sold at the current price levels, the whale stands to make an impressive profit of $2.55 million, highlighting the significant market impact and profit potential tied to strategic token movements following major exchange listings, according to data compiled by Lookonchain. Over the past 24 hours alone, MOCA has experienced a whopping 160% rally, briefly reaching $0.426 before stabilizing near $0.22. This price surge was accompanied by an astonishing 7,500% increase in trading volume, which now stands at $1.32 billion, and a market capitalization spike of over 205% to $341.61 million. As per the official update , Upbit launched Korean Won, Bitcoin (BTC), and USDT trading pairs for MOCA. For the uninitiated, MOCA is the utility and governance token of a decentralized ecosystem called Mocaverse, which is a flagship project of the Hong Kong-based Web3 giant Animoca Brands Group. $10M Funding Round For Mocaverse Beyond its market performance, Animoca Brands recently announced a $10 million funding round for Mocaverse. The funding, supported by major investors like OKX Ventures, CMCC Global, and HongShan, is aimed at expanding Mocaverse’s interoperable infrastructure for consumer crypto adoption. With MOCA’s fully diluted valuation at $1 billion, Animoca said that it is strategically building the Realm Network to advance Web3 interoperability and digital property rights. Mocaverse’s rapid growth is evident in initiatives like the Moca ID, which has already registered over 1.79 million IDs and fostered partnerships with prominent platforms such as Pixels, Trust Wallet, and OKX Wallet. Future collaborations with high-profile partners like the TON Foundation and Anime Foundation aim to onboard millions of users to the Moca Network.

With listings on platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA, excitement is at an all-time high. But there’s more to this story than meets the eye. Some enthusiasts are willing to pay thousands despite RLUSD price is pegged at $1. People Are Already Paying Premiums—Here’s Why On-chain marketplaces like Xaman have become the center of activity. Collectors and traders are placing huge bids just to get early access to RLUSD. Some are offering up to 836 XRP—about $2,068—for a fraction of the stablecoin. Considering RLUSD price is meant to be $1, these prices are… surprising, to say the least. Source : X.com Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, chimed in on the unusual bidding frenzy. In a post on Sunday, he shared his thoughts on why people are paying so much. “There actually is someone willing to pay $1,200 for a tiny fraction of RLUSD,” he said. Schwartz believes these buyers might see value in being among the first to hold RLUSD, even if it doesn’t make financial sense. Temporary Shortages, Temporary Chaos Ripple expects early supply shortages to create some price volatility. This isn’t unusual for a new token launch. As Schwartz pointed out, RLUSD’s price will stabilize quickly once liquidity increases. He reminded everyone that the whole point of a stablecoin is… stability. So why the chaos? Part of it comes down to hype and speculation. Whenever a new token or NFT drops, some people are willing to pay a premium to own a piece of history. It’s a trend we’ve seen before in crypto markets. But Schwartz had a clear warning for buyers: “Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin! This is not an opportunity to get rich.” What to Expect Next Despite the temporary craziness, Ripple has systems in place to keep RLUSD on track. The stablecoin will always be redeemable for $1, thanks to a solid redemption mechanism. Any major price swings will likely be short-lived, as traders (known as arbitragers) will step in to bring things back to normal. For now, all eyes are on Tuesday’s launch. RLUSD price will likely face some initial bumps, but Ripple is confident the market will stabilize quickly.

A Wells Notice is a letter from the agency informing that they plan to sue a person or the company. According to Fortune , the Wells Notice states that the commission will charge Unicoin with fraud, misleading practices, and sales of unregistered securities, but it does not mention specific problems. Gary Gensler, the controversial head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will leave his post in a month but is still gunning around for crypto before he leaves. SEC’s crypto team sends subpoenas to Unicoin The SEC issued a Wells Notice against the crypto firm Unicoin, signaling that Gensler is not done with enforcement actions before he leaves office in January https://t.co/YdpHLNurmR — Leo Schwartz (@leomschwartz) December 17, 2024 In May, the commission’s crypto team sent subpoenas to the company. Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin described the subpoenas as related to Unicoin’s main product, a cryptocurrency backed by real assets, including billions of dollars in real estate. He added that Unicorn’s lawyers are working on a response due Dec 24. He also shared a common sentiment in crypto land that a lot of Gensler’s enforcement actions are politically fueled. “I can only say one word: bulls–t, complete and utter bulls–t,” says Konanykhin. It is to be noted that the Wells Notice containing fraud charges against Unicoin has not been seen in recent cases against major crypto companies like Coinbase. The Securities and Exchange Commission is blocking Unicoin because it doesn’t want it to have an ICO (initial coin offering), as per Konanykhin. A spokesperson said the commission “does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.” Unicoin’s CEO believes that the firm has been subject to several SEC investigations due to its novel approach, but the latest is the first to result in a Wells Notice. Konanykhin told Fortune that the company entered into a so-called standstill agreement with the SEC earlier this year not to conduct an ICO or go public. Yet, he argued that he had decided to breach the agreement after Trump had won the recent election. Gensler races to issue lawsuits before leaving office The crypto community was optimistic when President Biden nominated Gensler for the SEC, hoping he would adopt an open approach towards the industry with his experience teaching a blockchain course at MIT. However, things took a turn after the collapse of FTX in November 2022, and Gensler distinguished much of the industry as a “Wild West” of scams. He also tried to force companies to operate under existing securities laws, which they claimed was impractical. The SEC simultaneously filed a barrage of coercive actions against some of the latest companies in the space. It resulted in many of the industry’s top firms, entrepreneurs, and investors campaigning to elect crypto-friendly politicians with the intent of unseating Gensler. Trump embraced the technology and earned the support of much of the industry which led to Gensler’s announced resignation due in January. That hasn’t halted the SEC from issuing Wells Notices and lawsuits against crypto companies, including CyberKongz, which revealed on X it had received a letter on Monday. Unicoin’s Wells Notice is the latest in the crypto space, and Konanykhin said that the company would rather engage the SEC in a prolonged legal battle than settle. The company was founded in 2015 and is connected to the television series Unicorn Hunters . Its token was announced in 2022 and Konanykhin argued that it would overtake Bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency. The token is collateralized by real-world assets such as real estate holdings. The company initiated a deal early this year acquiring nearly 8,000 acres of land in the Bahamas valued at over half a billion dollars in exchange for the future promise of its token. Konanykhin disclosed that the firm has sold $3.5 billion worth of Unicoin tokens through similar deals to around 70,000 investors. The company maintains that its token is a security even though it never managed to register the security with the SEC. The firm had earlier filed paperwork with the agency revealing its intent to go public via a reverse merger. The firm’s CEO believes that the agency’s action is retribution for its plans to move forward with its untested token offering. “How did we get so important to become the final focus of the SEC?” he noted.

However, it later located support and regained strength. Currently, the price is back in an upward range. Exactly a week ago, Ethereum lost grip above the important $4,000 level after rejecting its all-time high (ATH) in the preceding week. That struck a major sell-off last week and the price dropped into the $3,500 range, causing a serious panic amongst short-term traders and investors. Surprisingly, that price range held well as support and the price bounced back, restoring hope for a long-term buyer. The asset has recovered nicely over the past week but is yet to reclaim the lost important level following a slight rejection earlier today. Looking at the market from a technical perspective, the price is likely to explode anytime soon. As we can see on the price chart, Ethereum is poised for a fresh surge in volatility, especially when we consider the daily higher high and higher low formation from around the $2,400 level in November. A successful break above the ATH should set the asset for another ballistic move. Currently, the bulls are gaining dominance. If by any chance they lost control of the market, the price may revisit last week’s low range to form base support (as a double-bottom) before initiating a mega rally. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As of now, the $3,780 and $3,500 levels are acting as support areas. If these levels fail, Ethereum may navigate $3,255 and $3,015 for support. Looking ahead, the $4,094 ATH is an important level to watch. A break above it could skyrocket the price to $4,500 and $5,000 in the near term. Key Resistance Levels: $4,094, $4,500, $5,000 Key Support Levels: $3,780, $3,500, $3,255 Spot Price: $3,948 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/chill-pepe-chilpepe-solana-memecoin-will-surge-14000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

It is footing another leg up while the fear and greed index stands at 80 due to overbought. Bitcoin’s daily structure remains highly bullish in the long term due to a consistent surge in the past month. The crypto pushed higher yesterday and comfortably entered the $106,000 range, closing last week bullish. Prior to the latest break up, the primary crypto flash crashed to a low of $90,500 earlier this month following a sudden rejection at $104,000. The price recovered and traded at around $100k throughout last week. Despite the low volatility movement in the past weeks, the trend is still considered bullish on the daily chart. Though it appears to be gathering momentum for another leg up. The breakout could set the market up for a huge price movement if the demand level increases significantly. In case of a drop, BTC must break below the current monthly low before considering a broader retracement. Currently, the trend is still in favour of the bulls, and as a result, more surges are expected in the future. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview If Bitcoin pushes above the newly marked all-time high of $106,648, the next key level for an increase would be $110,000, followed by $115,000. For now, the psychological $100,000 level is considered as support. A drop below it could roll the price back to the $94,150 support – last week’s low. Below this support lies the monthly $90,500 low. Lower supports for broader retracement are $85,072, $81,500 and $77,200.

CAT zoomed from $0.000039 to a record peak of $0.000067 in early Asian hours Tuesday, data shows, before paring gains. Trading volumes rose tenfold from $55 million to over $500 million.  Open interest in the token’s future products nearly doubled to over $60 million, showing a bump in expectations of further volatility with a bullish bias.  Binance said Monday it would offer airdrops of CAT to users of their Earn products who staked specific amounts of BNB tokens last week. It would then list 1000CAT (where a single token holds a thousand CAT) at 09:00 UTC later on Tuesday.  CAT is the official token of Simon’s Cat, an animated series about a hungry house cat and its adventures, with over 20 million followers across YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.  Comparisons with other cat-themed memecoins like Popcat, MOG, and MEW often place CAT at a perceived undervaluation due to its spot listings and IP backing, among other reasons. Data shows it is the fourth-largest by market cap in that category, one that’s led by MOG at $1.1 billion as of Tuesday.  Well-followed trader @theunipcs — who famously turned $16,000 to $18 million on a BONK trade — is among the most vocal supporters of CAT and expects it to become the largest cat-themed meme token in the coming months.  “A $CAT flippening of $POPCAT to become the top cat memecoin is highly likely,” the trader said in a Monday post. “(It has) the best mainstream recognition for a cat memecoin brand, the best unit bias among major cat memecoins, strong and official IP, 99% of CT is sidelined, so a hated rally is likely”  Are IP memecoins the future?  CAT’s spot listing comes as non-IP memecoins increasingly see legal heat.  IP, or intellectual property, can include characters from memes, video games, or any cultural phenomenon that have officially been trademarked or copyrighted before their tokens were offered to the public.  Tokens backed by IP have a clearer legal standing regarding usage rights. The creators or owners of the IP can legally license the use of their characters or concepts, reducing the risk of legal challenges like cease and desist orders or lawsuits for unauthorized use of copyrighted material, which can abruptly devalue non-IP-backed tokens.  Tokens are starting to face the risk of legal action from IP holders if they do not own or securing rights to the IP they emulate or represent. Non-IP tokens like chillguy (CHILLGUY) and pnut (PNUT) face challenges despite being popular and widely traded.  On Monday, Mark Longo, the owner of Peanut the Squirrel which inspired the PNUT token, issued a cease-and-desist letter to Binance, accusing it of trademark infringement for listing and offering the PNUT memecoin.  Longo claimed Binance used his “Peanut the Squirrel” trademark and mascot likeness without permission, noting he has been using the PNUT brand for educational and animal welfare initiatives since 2017.  The cease-and-desist warning of potential legal action and sought penalties of up to $150,000 per infringement. PNUT’s prices are down 5% in the past 24 hours, in line with a broader market lull.  As such, CAT is officially licensed to the mainstream Simon's Cat brand and is the first major cat memecoin on the BNB Chain, backed by the company's IP which earned $5.8 billion in revenue last year.  That drives the token’s investment thesis for traders such as @theunipcs.  ""The reality is that T1 CEXs (Binance/Coinbase/Upbit/etc) and major entitites will not touch memecoins with IP issues with a ten-foot pole,” he noted in a November post. “Because while the memecoin is likely decentralized and launched by an anon, these CEXs are real entities that could be held liable for IP violations and it's just not worth the drama for them.”  “Official Simon's Cat channels have promoted and will continue to promote the $CAT memecoin. This is an advantage no other cat memecoin in the space has right now,” he added at the time.  In the world of memecoins, CAT's IP could prove to be its nine lives.",POSITIVE,BNB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/17/ip-backed-meme-token-cat-bags-binance-spot-listing-spiking-bullish-sentiment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83693fb6c3f4c057f4eb5d7bd2a2b6be7be01021-1500x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an appearance on the Coin Stories podcast, Matthew Sigel said Bitcoin ( BTC ) could go as high as $180K in 2025, pointing to crucial indicators like funding rates, unrealized profits, and retail speculation as the basis for this prediction. Sigel, in conversation with the host Natalie Brunel , says VanEck has been “ bullish on Bitcoin since 2017 ”. However, he believes corporate adoption of Bitcoin still has a long road ahead. Traditional asset managers, many of which, like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, are owned by banks and brokers, have been slow to adopt BTC into their financial strategy, he said. Their tightly regulated structure and reliance on traditional asset allocation models, such as the 60-40 portfolio, have yet to adjust to accommodate BTC ETFs . You might also like: FTX to start bankruptcy payouts via Kraken, BitGo from Jan. 3 According to Sigel, this adds to the fact that approximately 80% of BTC ETF holders are retail or high-net-worth investors either diversifying away from self-custody or scaling up existing positions.

Sigel shared that macro trends such as inflation hedges and BTC being adopted as digital gold are fueling this bullish sentiment. According to Sigel, BTC safeguards against actions like government currency devaluation and asset confiscations, a must-have for individuals living in countries with double-digit inflation.

However, it has been facing hurdles for some days now due to low demand. Breaking up should drive more gains in the future. The last two weeks of trading have been a tough moment for the bulls as they find it difficult to sustain momentum above the monthly rejected $1.3 level. Although they are still gaining control in the mid-term but their commitment seems not strong enough to drive the price higher. This low commitment has brought a notable reduction in the last 24 hours, and as seen on the daily chart, ADA is now trading at around $1 after rejecting $1.2 on Thursday. Just like what we saw this week, the latest rejection could lead to another decrease in the upcoming week. Considering yesterday’s strong bearish close, which suggests a potential sell, the asset may drop into the $0.8 range. Locating support in the price range could trigger a bounce back. If not, we may see more drops until it finds a threshold. On the daily chart, the volume indicator has been on the fall since the price entered $0.7 in mid-November. A rise in this volume should bring buying pressure back into the market. Having said that, it is important to note that ADA is currently under correction. ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Losing grip above $1, it may navigate the $0.9 and $0.875 levels for support. A breakdown from there could plunge the price to $0.765 and $0.69. Lower supports for a broader correction are $0.6 and $0.522. If ADA climbs back above $1.154 along with the rejected monthly $1.32 high, the next buy target for the bulls would be $1.5, $1.7 and $2 in no time.

However, it located support and quickly recovered as the price broke to a new high. It appears bullish but the price is stalled. Like many altcoins, Link witnessed significant growth in the past month as it surged through several key resistances to mark a new multi-high at $30.94 on Friday. However, the bears have defended that high well and the crypto is now stalled with choppy price actions. The intraday trading remains bullish but the asset may lose momentum soon considering the latest rejection. As seen on the daily chart, there’s little-to-no movement in the market. A weekly close under the $28 level could facilitate another drop as witnessed earlier this week. Towards the upside, Link must break higher before considering more rallies, although maintaining a bullish on the daily chart. If that comes into play, the $40 range would be the next buying target level for the bulls. Nevertheless, the overall market appears strong on a daily scale. As of now, there are no signs of bears in the market. If they return, the price must fall below last month’s low before considering a reversal. But from the look of things, more positive actions are likely to occur. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview While deciding where next to head, a break above the weekly $31 high should propel buying to $33, followed by $35. Higher resistance levels to consider on the way up are $40 and $45. A pullback from the current trading level could bring a retest at $27. Below it lies the $23.8 support.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has faced skepticism throughout this cycle, with some analysts predicting it would underperform compared to its previous bull runs. However, Ethereum has surprised doubters, steadily climbing in recent weeks despite market uncertainty. Related Reading: ONDO Exchange Inflows Grow – Volatility Ahead? Key on-chain metrics from Glassnode reveal an important trend that could fuel further price gains: Ethereum whales have been accumulating aggressively since late November. This signals growing confidence among major holders, who are positioning themselves for potential upside. Historically, whale accumulation has often preceded significant price moves, hinting at the possibility of a breakout in the near term. While the market remains divided on Ethereum’s trajectory, its ability to sustain upward momentum near the $4,000 mark will likely define its performance in the weeks ahead. Breaking above this critical resistance could open the door to new highs and further solidify ETH’s role as a leader in the ongoing bull cycle. Ethereum Mega-Whale Balances Grow Ethereum has experienced a steady, albeit modest, rally since November 5, but it seems the real fireworks for ETH are yet to ignite. As Bitcoin soars into price discovery and several altcoins outperform expectations, Ethereum investors are searching for clear signals of an impending bull run for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Key on-chain data shared by top analyst Ali Martinez on X provides intriguing insights into Ethereum’s current state. Martinez highlights that Ethereum whales—entities holding significant amounts of ETH—have been accumulating aggressively since the price broke above the $3,330 level. This accumulation trend suggests that smart money is positioning itself for what could be a massive upward move in the months ahead. Historically, whale accumulation has often been a precursor to strong price rallies, as these large investors tend to anticipate major market shifts before retail traders. However, the narrative isn’t entirely bullish. While whale accumulation may signal confidence, it also raises concerns about a potential bull trap. These large holders could quickly pivot, offloading their ETH for other assets if market conditions shift or if Bitcoin’s dominance suppresses altcoin growth. Such a move could catch smaller investors off guard, leading to sharp corrections.

Until then, ETH remains a watchlist favorite, balancing potential and uncertainty. Price Testing Crucial Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,950, struggling to break above the crucial $4,000 resistance level for several days. Despite this, the price remains resilient, signaling strong market support. Clearing this level is essential to confirm the continuation of the uptrend, as $4,000 represents a psychological barrier and a key resistance zone for the asset. If Ethereum fails to breach the $4,000 mark, a retrace toward lower demand zones around $3,500 could be expected. This level has served as strong support in recent weeks, providing a cushion during periods of increased selling pressure. A pullback to this area could allow for renewed buying momentum, setting the stage for another attempt to break higher.

The factors include blockchain patents, jobs in blockchain and the number of crypto exchanges. “Singapore is first as a global hub for blockchain innovation, excelling in both adoption and infrastructure development,” the study noted. The island nation has 1,600 blockchain patents, nearly 2,500 jobs related to blockchain and 81 crypto exchanges, leading to the highest composite score of 85.4. Further, the results showed that the US stands out for its dominance in blockchain research, innovation, and job creation, globally. The results shared with Cryptonews noted that South Korea leads in blockchain patent activity, showing its commitment to technological advancement. Source: ApeX “What stands out is how diverse approaches—whether through regulatory clarity, investment in talent, or fostering innovation—are paving the way for global adoption,” said a spokesperson from ApeX. “This reflects a broader shift toward decentralization and transparency, which are becoming essential in today’s interconnected economy.” Hong Kong stands second in blockchain and crypto technology, supported by over 1,100 blockchain jobs and strong crypto exchange base.

This notice means the regulator believes there might be securities law violations and is preparing to take enforcement action against CyberKongz. “We are extremely disappointed at the approach the SEC has taken towards us, but we are going to stand up and fight for a brighter future that holds more clarity for NFT projects,” the project said in an X post. “We have been suffering in silence for the last two years, ever since we first received contact from the SEC,” it added. “Throughout the entire process they have showcased a complete lack of understanding of blockchain technologies that has resulted in unjust accusations and information inaccuracies.” CyberKongz has received a Wells Notice from the SEC.

We have been suffering in silence for the last… pic.twitter.com/lc6hyzUPb0 — CyberKongz (@CyberKongz) December 16, 2024 CyberKongz Genesis Collection Sparked the PFP NFT Boom In March 2021, artist Myoo launched the CyberKongz project with 1,000 unique, randomly generated NFTs known as the Genesis Collection. Myoo designed these 34×34 pixelated gorilla images specifically as profile pictures (PFPs). At the time, using NFTs as PFPs was still a novel concept. However, CyberKongz quickly gained traction for its innovative approach. Setting the initial mint price at just 0.01 ETH also made the collection affordable, boosting its early success. CyberKongz Slams SEC Over Misunderstanding of NFT Contract Migration The project claimed the SEC has presented a “perplexing interpretation of smart contracts.” It pointed out that one of the SEC’s key concerns—the ‘sale’ of Genesis Kongz in April 2021—was actually a contract migration. The team questioned how a clear regulatory path can exist if the SEC cannot distinguish between a primary sale and a contract migration. “It has become increasingly apparent that the current administration is trying to force their anti-crypto agenda at the last minute,” it said. “We hope that the new administration puts an end to this unjustness on our industry, but until then we will fight for NFT projects on all chains.” The crypto industry has repeatedly criticized the SEC for relying on “regulation by enforcement” instead of providing clear rules. The SEC’s use of the Howey Test to classify NFTs as securities remains especially controversial. Many in the industry argue this approach is unclear and overly punitive. Earlier this year, the SEC issued a Wells Notice to OpenSea , the largest NFT marketplace, claiming some NFTs on the platform might qualify as securities under US law. OpenSea’s leadership quickly pushed back, framing its resistance as a defense of creative freedom in digital art.

Full Insight,"As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, new players are breaking into the scene, claiming their slice of the blockchain revolution. One of these contenders is Lightchain AI , a cutting-edge platform combining blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) through its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) . 🚀 The Lightchain AI Presale is NOW LIVE , offering early adopters a chance to grab discounted tokens before its public launch! Claim your tokens here and step into the future of blockchain-innovated AI! But how does Lightchain AI stack up against one of the OGs of cryptocurrency— Dogecoin (DOGE) ? Is it just more fluff, or is it truly laying a foundation for the next phase of blockchain innovation? Let’s break it down. What is Lightchain AI? At its core, Lightchain AI is not your typical blockchain platform—it’s an AI-driven ecosystem designed to drive innovation, decentralization, and privacy across industries. The project is built on unique, future-facing technologies like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) that power decentralized, intelligent solutions.

Plus, early adopters gain exclusive perks like governance voting rights and early access to exciting ecosystem features. Join today! The Story of Dogecoin (DOGE): A Pioneer with a Meme-Legacy Dogecoin started as a playful joke in 2013, born out of the internet’s love for the “Doge” meme. But in the crypto world, where adoption drives survival, Dogecoin defied expectations and gained a loyal following, including high-profile endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. What Makes Dogecoin a Contender? While Lightchain AI represents groundbreaking utility, Dogecoin’s strength lies in community and its simplicity as a fast, low-fee cryptocurrency. Let’s explore why DOGE still holds its charm: Accessible and Beginner-Friendly Dogecoin’s straightforward functionality has made it a starting point for many crypto enthusiasts entering the space. You don’t need to understand complex use cases to engage with DOGE—it’s simple and fast. Strong Community Support The “Dogecoin Army” remains one of the most supportive and tight-knit communities in crypto. Their enthusiasm and grassroots efforts continue to keep Dogecoin relevant in discussions of payment app integration and merchant adoption. Endorsements and Visibility With billionaire cheerleaders and public appearances, Dogecoin has managed to stay visible globally—an invaluable asset in the digital currency sphere. Ecosystem Growth While Dogecoin lacks the advanced features of newer platforms like Lightchain AI, there’s some buzz about its development for broader use cases, including Layer 2 scaling projects. Lightchain AI vs. Dogecoin—A Feature Comparison Feature Lightchain AI Dogecoin (DOGE) Focus Blockchain + AI synergy Peer-to-peer transactions Consensus Mechanism Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Proof of Work (PoW) Development Potential High (AIVM, dynamic ecosystem) Moderate Community Growing (focused on innovation) Large and enthusiastic Ideal Use Cases AI-driven dApps, intelligent ops Digital payments, tips Investing Stage Early Presale opportunity Well-established While Dogecoin feels like a secure and steady name for small transactions, Lightchain AI shines as an emerging leader in revolutionizing how blockchain integrates futuristic AI technology .

Investors can secure tokens at a low presale price, potentially yielding high returns as adoption grows. DOGE remains a steady option for those focused on fast, fee-less transactions and an enjoyable, community-driven approach to exploring crypto.

ETH is consolidating gains and might aim for a move above the $4,150 resistance zone. Ethereum started a decent increase above $3,950 and $4,000. The price is trading below $3,980 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $3,940 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $4,080 and $4,120 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Regains Momentum Ethereum price remained stable and extended gains above $3,880 but it underperformed Bitcoin . ETH was able to climb above the $3,980 and $4,000 resistance levels. The bulls pushed the pair above the $4,050 and $4,080 resistance levels. A high was formed at $4,107 before there was a pullback. There was a minor decline below the $4,000 level.

If you’ve been keeping tabs, you’d know there’s no shortage of drama or opportunity in this space. Peanut the Squirrel’s owner is locked in a legal battle with Binance over alleged trademark infringement, sending ripples across the crypto world. Meanwhile, Popcat’s price might just have found its bottom, with analysts predicting a bullish reversal. On the flip side, BTFD Coin is riding a tidal wave of excitement, smashing through the $4 million mark in its presale. With these developments, this week might just be the perfect time to jump into the meme coin frenzy. Meme coins have always had their finger on the pulse of crypto hype, riding cultural waves like no other asset class. From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s unexpected success, these quirky coins have proven their staying power. Now, with BTFD Coin’s innovative play-to-earn game and staking rewards , it’s bringing something fresh to the table. It’s more than just a meme; it’s a movement powered by a strong community of holders. So, if you’re looking for the best meme coins to join this week , let’s break down what makes BTFD Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Popcat worthy of your attention and possibly your wallet. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is turning heads for all the right reasons. The presale has already raised over $4 million and sold more than 55 billion tokens to 5,600+ holders. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, BTFD is now in its 12th stage, with the price hitting $0.00013. At this pace, it’s set to close out its presale at $0.0006 per token. What sets BTFD apart isn’t just its meteoric presale performance but its long-term vision. The coin features a play-to-earn (P2E) game that’s set to make waves, offering players a chance to earn rewards while having fun. Add staking options into the mix, and you’ve got a token with tangible utility beyond just its meme appeal. Let’s do some quick math. If you invested $15,000 at the current price of $0.00013 per coin, you’d snag roughly 115,384,615 BTFD tokens. Once the presale ends and the price hits $0.0006, your investment would balloon to a jaw-dropping $69,230. That’s a tidy 361% profit before BTFD even hits its first exchange listing. With four stages left in the presale, and analysts predicting a surge in demand as the end draws closer, this is one train you don’t want to miss. BTFD isn’t just a meme; it’s a movement. Peanut the Squirrel: Fighting for a Cause On the other side of the meme coin spectrum, Peanut the Squirrel is grabbing headlines for a very different reason. Mark Longo, the owner of the late social media sensation, is taking Binance to court over alleged trademark infringement. Longo claims the exchange used the “PNUT” trademark and Peanut’s likeness without permission, issuing a cease-and-desist letter demanding Binance halt these activities. Despite the legal battle, PNUT’s price has remained relatively stable at $1.11. For a token that achieved a $1 billion market cap in just 11 days after its launch, stability is a testament to its strong community and cultural resonance. Peanut’s story is as much about justice as it is about value. The token has become a symbol of intellectual property rights in the fast-evolving crypto space, and this narrative is likely to keep it in the spotlight. If the lawsuit resolves in Longo’s favour—or even if it just garners more media attention—PNUT could see a surge in value. Meme coins thrive on attention, and PNUT has plenty of it right now. Popcat: The Rebound Everyone’s Waiting For Popcat is the OG of cat-themed meme coins, and it’s not about to let that title go. Inspired by Oatmeal, the viral cat meme from 2020, Popcat has already delivered over 10,000% gains since its launch at $0.01. After peaking at $2.07, the token has entered a mini-bear phase, dropping to $1.21. But according to renowned trader Cold Blooded Shiller, Popcat might just be gearing up for a comeback. Shiller points out that Popcat’s trading range has been tightening, with repeated dips into the high-demand zone around $1.20. This kind of pressure often precedes a breakout. With cat memes gaining traction and favourable market conditions, analysts predict Popcat could claw its way back to its all-time high and beyond, with $3 as the next big target. If you’re a fan of the meme coin market’s quirky charm, Popcat is one to watch. It’s got the pedigree, the community, and the potential for another moonshot. The Concluding Remark The meme coin market is hotter than ever, and this week’s lineup is nothing short of stellar. BTFD Coin is smashing presale records, giving investors a chance to ride the wave of its innovative game and staking features. Peanut the Squirrel offers a unique story of justice and cultural impact, while Popcat is primed for a breakout, backed by a loyal fan base and solid fundamentals. Whether you’re looking for the best meme coins to join this week or simply seeking the next big opportunity in crypto, this is your moment. Don’t let it pass you by. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your slice of the future at $0.00013 before it’s too late. With over $4 million already raised and a community that’s growing by the day, this might just be the best investment you make all year.

Monica Long, President of Ripple, took to her social media handle on Monday and said that this new stablecoin is an important step for both the XRP Ledger and Ripple, which handles over $70 billion in payments. RLUSD combines Ripple’s 10 plus years of experience with strong compliance standards and support from a trusted advisory board. The company had received final approval for RLUSD from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), under the regulator’s limited-purpose trust company charter, as of last week. RLUSD will launch on platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, CoinMENA, Archax, and Bitso, with more exchanges like Bullish, Mercado Bitcoin, Zero Hash, Independent Reserve, and Bitstamp joining soon.

RLUSD will be available on global exchanges starting today, December 17, 2024. While the launch date is confirmed, the exact time has not been disclosed. While social media posts on X suggest the launch will happen at 8:00 AM EST, allowing users to get in before the typical 9-5 workday begins, this information is purely speculative and has not been officially confirmed. As such, it should be treated with caution until Ripple provides official details. XRP Price Jumps: The market reacted positively to the news, with XRP seeing a boost in value.

XRP has been experiencing a strong price surge due to a major announcement from Ripple.

MicroStrategy, led by CEO Michael Saylor, disclosed its latest purchase of 15,350 BTC for $1.5 billion , marking its first buy above $100,000 per coin. The purchase brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC, worth over $45 billion, with unrealized profits nearing $18 billion. This aggressive acquisition reinforces institutional confidence and adds upward momentum to Bitcoin’s rally. JUST IN: MicroStrategy bought another 15,350 $BTC for $1.5 BILLION pic.twitter.com/GIYARe3CTb — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 16, 2024 Saylor’s bold strategy of using debt financing to expand holdings—targeting an additional $42 billion by 2028—positions MicroStrategy as the largest corporate BTC holder. Growing Institutional Confidence Bolsters Bitcoin Rally MicroStrategy’s consistent accumulation signals a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future as a digital store of value. This, coupled with bullish policies under President-elect Trump, including speculation about a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, has strengthened market confidence. Analysts suggest such institutional backing could propel Bitcoin toward the next resistance levels at $108,000 and $110,000. However, critics argue MicroStrategy’s reliance on Bitcoin exposes the company to significant downside risk during market corrections. While this strategy attracts scrutiny, supporters view Saylor’s vision as a transformative bet on Bitcoin’s long-term dominance. Daily Technical Outlook: Bitcoin (BTC/USD) – December 17 Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continues to hold its bullish momentum, currently trading at $106,520, up 1.74% in the last 24 hours. The price is supported by an ascending channel, with immediate support at $105,535 and next support at $104,430 near the 50 EMA. If the bullish trend persists, Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $107,217, followed by stronger hurdles at $108,466 and $109,531. The 50 EMA, sitting at $104,390, reinforces Bitcoin’s upward trendline, offering a critical area for buyers to defend. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending at 63, suggesting the market retains buying strength but remains below overbought conditions. A sustained move above $107,217 could pave the way for further gains, driving Bitcoin toward its next significant resistance zones. However, a break below $105,535 may trigger minor corrections. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 STARS Presale Raises Over $19.3M – Only 3 Days Left to Join!

37750938,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319910,1734404400,Russian Banks Still Unsure About Digital Ruble as Central Bank Sets Rollout Date,"Russian banks are worried they will be burdened with costs when the nation’s central bank rolls out its CBDC , the digital ruble, next year. The bank last week said that it would release the coin to the public on July 1, 2025. Digital Ruble Doubts? The radio broadcaster Avto Radio reported that the First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, Vladimir Chistyukhin, told parliamentarians that this would be the day when the CBDC “moves out of its pilot phase” and into “the mass implementation stage.” Moscow has fast-tracked its CBDC launch, and will likely release its coin nationwide even before its ally Beijing. With sanctions pressure rising, the Russian Central Bank appears to think that launching its CBDC will let it bypass the USD and global banking messaging networks like SWIFT. Here’s the latest news and analysis on the oil market https://t.co/zyTtlVfwPS — Bloomberg (@business) December 15, 2024 But Russian banks appear concerned about the move. Per RIA Mo , Anatoly Kozlachkov, the head of the Association of Russian Banks, told State Duma lawmakers that Russian banks “are expressing reluctance to switch to the digital ruble.” Kozlachkov said the “high costs” of adoption were off-putting for many large Russian commercial financial institutions. U.S. and U.K. authorities have taken action against a money-laundering network accused of helping Russians bypass sanctions using crypto. #Russia #Crypto https://t.co/TeZku8cgCu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 5, 2024 Adoption Costs Kozlachkov added that institutions “are concerned about the possible outflow of liquidity and the costs associated with the CBDC transition.” Preliminary association calculations show that digital ruble adoption could cost banks an average of 100 million rubles ($963,000) each. The association chief noted that “some banks with basic licenses” have capital holdings of “less than 300 million rubles ($2.9 million).” “The proportions of costs for the introduction of the digital ruble should be adjusted, or approaches should be differentiated by taking into account the specifics of [each bank].” Anatoly Kozlachkov, head of the Association of Russian Banks The offices of Sberbank in Khabarovsk, Russia. (Source: KonstantinEvstegneev1996 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Frosty Reception However, Kozlachkov’s comments appear to have received a frosty reception from senior MPs. The head of the State Duma’s Committee on Financial Markets, Anatoly Aksakov, said he “did not understand why the banking community” was “criticizing the digital ruble.” The Russian Central Bank developed its first proof-of-concept started for the digital ruble in 2020. However, the bank began to accelerate the project after the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022. Western sanctions have restricted the cross-border operations of most Russian banks. Moscow has since been forced to turn to crypto and other solutions to continue international trade. But many of its subsequent efforts to find a more sustainable workaround with fellow BRICS members involve the use of digital fiats. The Central Bank responded by launching its first real-world CBDC pilot to a group of 600 citizens in 11 cities in August 2023. COMMENTARY: Russia’s shadow fleet could aid Moscow in other ways too — not just oil revenue. https://t.co/zptacK6xVJ — POLITICOEurope (@POLITICOEurope) December 16, 2024 Pilot Expands In September this year, the bank expanded this number to 9,000, with 1,200 businesses also joining the pilot. In recent weeks, a select group of Russian companies has begun using the CBDC to make B2B transactions. But even back in mid-2023, the bank had already targeted a 2025 rollout. The Central Bank has also warned that businesses will be forced to accept CBDC payments, and will be fined for non-compliance. Moscow has witnessed no shortage of pushback from commercial banks, however. The same association has already expressed its displeasure at the fast-tracked rollout . Chechnya's Kremlin-backed leader Ramzan Kadyrov has said he is ready to step in if necessary and ensure that Syria gets the wheat it needs in what he said was the unlikely event that Russian wheat supplies to the country were disrupted https://t.co/vo1FRXQxZF — Reuters (@Reuters) December 16, 2024 When the August 2023 pilot launched, major players like Sberbank were conspicuous by their absence. Sberbank has since joined the pilot’s “second stage.” But, as has been the case with commercial banks elsewhere in the world, Russian banks appear skeptical about CBDCs. Not All Banks Unsure? Regardless, many appear to feel they have no choice but to comply with the Central Bank’s wishes, and are rushing to get to grips with the coin. Earlier this month, 59i , a media outlet based in Perm, reported that Rosselkhozbank has recently conducted its first “operations with the digital ruble.” A branch of Rosselkhozbank in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Edrko CC BY-SA 4.0) Rosselkhozbank said that a group of “individual and legal entity clients” used the coin to “buy food and train tickets,” as well as make peer-to-peer transfers. “The digital ruble opens up a new horizon of opportunities for both the entire financial sector and for each bank client. The mechanics of handling the digital ruble will not differ from [conventional] transactions.

37739589,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663123,1734402653,Bitcoin’s Next Big Move? Key Metric Reveals When to Cash In Profits,"Bitcoin recent price momentum which led to a renewal of its all-time high (ATH) appears to have reignited interest in key metrics used to time market entries and exits. Among these, the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) reversion metric has been highlighted by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost, who shared insights on its current implications for Bitcoin investors. The metric, a measure of Bitcoin’s price deviations from its expected value based on the S2F model, has become an important tool for many traders assessing market sentiment and identifying potential profit-taking windows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Confidence Grows As Binance Data Highlights Surprising Market Trends When Should Cash In Your Bitcoin Profits? Darkfost’s analysis points to September 11 as a significant date, when the S2F reversion metric dropped below 1, signaling a potential buy opportunity as Bitcoin traded at $57,000. Now, the analyst emphasizes a different critical threshold—a value above 2.5—historically indicating a favorable time to secure moderate profits. Should the metric reach a value above 3, it often signals market overheating, marking an opportune moment for larger profit-taking strategies. The S2F reversion metric offers a structured approach to assessing Bitcoin’s price cycles. Darkfost suggests a two-step profit strategy: investors should consider securing smaller gains when the metric hits 2.5 and proceed to larger profit-taking if it surpasses 3. Darfost particularly wrote: A prudent strategy when using this indicator is to take moderate profits once the S2F reversion ratio hits 2.5 and to secure larger profits when the ratio exceeds 3, thereby balancing risk and reward effectively. BTC Market Performance Regardless of the suggested indicator by Darkfost on when to take profit, Bitcoin appears not to be slowing down in its upward momentum. So far, BTC has created a new ATH after trading as high as $106,352 in the early hours of Monday. Although at the time of writing, the asset has seen a slight rebound currently trading at a a price of $105,942, however, BTC is still up by over 3% in the past day more than 10% in the past two weeks. Unsurprisingly, along with the rising price, BTC’s market capitalization has also seen a significant surge in its valuation now sitting at roughly over $2 trillion as of today. Meanwhile, despite this positive momentum, BTC’s daily trading volume has seen quite an opposite trend.

37739380,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393880,1734402189,XRP Price Prediction For December 17,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 17 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s RLUSD is all set to launch today (December 17) and XRP price is all set to possibly explode. Analysts are saying that XRP is currently in the later stages of a cycle wave three on the daily chart and this wave may still extend a bit higher, potentially reaching new all-time highs. While we haven’t yet seen a clear end to wave three, there’s a possibility it could continue moving upward before we see a correction in wave four. A possible target for the final move of this cycle could be between $5 and $9.81. At the time of writing, XRP is trading below $2.50 level and is up by more than two percent in the last 24 hours. Key Price Levels and Support Zones At present, XRP is trading between the 2021 high and the all-time high. This zone is critical for understanding potential price action. If XRP continues to hold above this range, there’s a good chance XRP could break through the all-time high, though it’s not guaranteed. Micro Patterns and Short-Term Movement Looking at the microstructure , there was a three-wave move down from the swing high formed on December 3rd, followed by a three-wave move up (wave B). Subsequently, a corrective wave C formed to the downside, bringing XRP to retest the 2021 high, which held as support. This suggests that short-term price action remains bullish. The breakout from the corrective price channel is a positive sign, though XRP has yet to move away from it in an impulsive fashion. The first target following this breakout is typically the starting point of the channel, which is around the $2.90 level. This target aligns with the typical length of wave C, which often matches that of wave A. Watch Out for Potential Pullbacks If the price breaks below the $2.33 level, followed by a drop below $2.28, the price could see a test of lower support regions between $2 and $2.23. From there, XRP might attempt another rally.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-17/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

These bids range from 500 XRP ($1237) to as much as 836 XRP ($2068) as of Asian morning hours on Tuesday, CoinDesk viewed on the Xaman application. Each XRP exchanges hands for just under $2.5, data shows.  “There actually is someone willing to pay $1,200/RLUSD for a tiny fraction of one RLUSD.,” Ripple Labs CTO David Schwartz said in a Monday post. “Tools will show you the highest price anyone is willing to pay, even if it's just for a tiny bit. Maybe someone wants the ""honor"" of buying the first bit of RLUSD on the DEX.”  “But rest assured, the price will come back to very close to $1 as soon as supply stabilizes. If it doesn't, something is very seriously wrong,” Schwartz added.  Speculators often engage in high-priced transactions for small quantities of a new token or NFT to gain early access or to capitalize on the novelty of holding the first batch.  As such, RLUSD might not have enough liquidity to maintain its peg effectively in the first few hours after it goes live, meaning there may be some price discrepancies from the intended $1 peg. However, each token will be redeemed for only a dollar, and it is unlikely to remain depegged for an extended period.

Cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin, which benefited from the significant change in macro conditions —are reaching record-breaking valuations and are increasingly influencing the social and political landscape. It has also been a fruitful year for HTX Ventures. Benefiting from the continuous innovation in the industry, this year we have supported 28 leading projects and funds that are exploring new frontiers of crypto utility. These projects span a range of sectors, including DeFi, BTCFi, ZK-rollups, modular infrastructure, Layer 1 & 2 solutions, AI, SocialFi, GameFi, and more. Looking ahead, HTX Ventures has identified five key sectors that showed encouraging progress in 2024 and will be closely monitored in 2025: the Bitcoin ecosystem, infrastructure, Meme, artificial intelligence (“AI”), and the TON ecosystem. This report provides an in-depth examination of the current landscape, challenges, and future opportunities within each sector, complemented by a macroeconomic overview and market projections. Bitcoin Ecosystem Market Dominance LTM Bitcoin dominance has increased from 45.27% to 56.81% . This implies most of the liquidity of the crypto market is currently lying mainly on the Bitcoin ecosystem and increasing. Source: CoinStats Bitcoin spot ETFs now account for 5.3% of the total Bitcoin supply, with holdings rising from 629,900 BTC at the beginning of the year to 1.24 million BTC, an increase of 613,708 BTC. This growth has elevated ETF holdings from 3.15% to 6.25% of the total Bitcoin supply in just twelve months. (data dated as of 4 Dec 2024) A new market trend has emerged – with Bitcoin as the core asset, spot ETFs as liquidity channels, and U.S. listed companies represented by MicroStrategy (MSTR) as the vehicles to absorb unlimited dollar liquidity. As a result, it is increasingly essential to further develop Bitcoin’s ecosystem and enhance capital utilization efficiency, which can also boost BTC’s demand and drive up its price. Layer 2 77 BTC L2s have been launched/ fundraised over the past 3 years. Existing bitcoin L2s from the previous cycles including Lightning, Stacks and Liquid Network had experienced a significant surge in trading volume and token prices in 1H 2024 with the BTC ETF narrative. Further technical development has also been witnessed from these previous cycle L2s. Various L2 solutions on Bitcoin have emerged, including Spiderchain (Botanix), ZKRollup (Nexio and Critea), EVM compatible chains (BOB and B Squared), Sidechains (Merlin), etc. Current TVL on BTC L2 has reached US$3 billion, contributed by 19 BTC L2 projects. Assuming all Bitcoin L2s are launched in the coming years, approximated TVL on all BTC L2s could reach at least 2 to 4 times further, indicating a TVL of US$6 billion to US$12 billion. Layer 1/ Execution Layer BRC-20, Ordinals and Runes were the new major execution standards that emerged in late 2023. BTC L1s activities were on a steady increase despite an overall market downturn in Q2. However, the growth momentum was not able to keep pace in Q3 despite the resurgence of the Bitcoin markets. BTC L1s Landscape in # of Transactions, Source: Cryptokoryo_research Other Bitcoin Infrastructure Other infrastructures including interoperability solutions and security layers emerge with the rise of Bitcoin adoption. Interoperability Bridges and WBTC remain the mainstream of interoperability solutions on Bitcoin. Given that the Bitcoin network does not directly provide composability to build applications directly, people have to rely on these bridges/ WBTC to unlock DeFi yields on other blockchains. HTX Ventures remain bullish on Bitcoin interoperability solutions given the surge in institutions’ growing investment in Bitcoin as an asset class, and anticipate more solutions coming including liquidity bridges Xlink, Atomiq and Auran will launch in the coming year. Security Layers However, these interoperability solutions may pose threats on security over the underlying assets as hacking issues often happen. In light of this, security solutions with Bitcoin arise. Babylon is an example. It developed a set of security-sharing protocols for Bitcoin. This includes (1) Bitcoin timestamp, which allows data to be recorded with a timestamp on the Bitcoin network, thereby enhancing the credibility and immutability of the data, and (2) Bitcoin staking, which allows Bitcoin to provide security for other networks with financial incentives. On top of that, further usage potential with Bitcoin has been unleashed with other new technology, such as Data Availability (“DA”) layers. Nubit is a key player in Bitcoin DA. It enables scaling of Bitcoin’s data capacities, to empower applications, L2s and oracles, secured by Bitcoin. OP_CAT Is the Key to the 2025 Upgrade The Taproot upgrade enables the Bitcoin mainnet to issue assets. From the rise of BRC-20 inscriptions and Ordinals NFTs in 2023 to the introduction of ARC-20, SRC-20, and other asset issuance protocols, as well as the emergence of infrastructure such as Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, restaking, Liquid Staking Tokens (“LSTs”), and cross-chain bridges, the ecosystem has developed in leaps and bounds. Following the Bitcoin Conference in July 2024, the market shifted its attention to decentralized and unwrapped native BTCFi such as stablecoins. Currently, the Discreet Log Contract (“DLC”) with a cryptographic technique known as adaptor signatures can be utilized to allow Bitcoin scripts to program financial contracts dependent on external events while fully ensuring permissionless clearing for stablecoin and lending projects. Meanwhile, it facilitates permissionless multi-party transactions via Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (“PSBT”). However, this approach is dependent on game theory. In other words, it discourages projects’ malicious actions by significantly increasing their costs for such behavior rather than achieving decentralization at the smart contract level. For example, Shell Finance, a stablecoin project set to launch its mainnet, adopts this strategy. The real game-changer is OP_CAT. Once OP_CAT is enabled, developers will be able to use high-level Bitcoin native programming languages like sCrypt to develop fully decentralized, transparent smart contracts directly on the Bitcoin mainnet. sCrypt is a TypeScript framework for writing smart contracts on Bitcoin. It allows developers to write smart contracts directly in TypeScript, which is one of the most popular high-level programming languages. Bitcoin’s current Layer 2 solutions could also transition to ZK-Rollups, and BTCFi’s total market cap will be limitless. With the support of both macro markets and infrastructure support, we believe Bitcoin will experience a further surge in market demand over the coming 2 years. Infrastructure In 2024, infrastructure remains one of the most compelling sectors in the crypto industry. The synergy between capital and technology has driven the rapid development of Layer 1, Layer 2, and middleware projects, among others. Various factors have contributed to the thriving infrastructure, such as the Ethereum ecosystem’s ongoing upgrades and construction, as well as Layer 2’s improvements in costs and performance; rapid growth of high-performance Layer 1 blockchains led by Solana; the deepening of multi-chain landscape; the enhancement of network security and capital efficiency through restaking mechanisms by projects like EigenLayer; and the attempt by multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 projects to combine Bitcoin’s security with high-performance scaling solutions. Layer 1 Layer 1 projects continue to optimize consensus mechanisms and performance, thus consolidating the foundation for on-chain applications. ● Ethereum : It introduced EIP-4844 and reduced L2 network fees. ● Solana and Tron: On-chain transactions have been active, attributable to the development of meme coins, infrastructure like Pump.fun and Sunpump, and so on. ● Aptos and Sui : GameFi and DeFi applications have spurred growth in active user numbers. Layer 2 Layer 2 remains a critical pathway for scaling, with advancements in both ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups. ● zkSync and StarkNet : Continuous upgrades have significantly improved the user experience for ZK Rollups. ● Base and Arbitrum : DeFi and NFT projects are thriving on these platforms, with substantial growth in TVL. Layer 0 and Cross-Chain Middleware Layer 0 and cross-chain middleware have made breakthroughs in interoperability. ● LayerZero : It connects over 40 chains , with a significant increase in cross-chain transaction volumes. ● Cosmos : The IBC upgrade has boosted cross-chain performance by 50%. Modular Public Blockchains Modular public blockchains offer exceptional performance and flexibility, thus attracting diverse applications. ● Celestia : By supporting multiple modular execution layers, it has established itself as a benchmark for modular public blockchains. ● Monad : Its ultra-high TPS performance has attracted a huge number of developers and DApp deployments. BTC Layer 2 Bitcoin L2 has emerged as a new focus in the primary market in 2024. Several related projects like Babylon, Taro, BounceBit, and Corn completed their funding rounds this year, primarily introducing smart contracts and scaling to the BTC network. ● Taro : It expands BTC’s payment and contract capabilities via the Lightning Network. ● Stacks and RSK : They drive growth in Bitcoin smart contract applications. Restaking Restaking has seen speedy development and gained market attention for its ability to improve capital utilization efficiency. Projects like EigenLayer and Satori secured tens of millions of dollars in investments from leading venture capital firms this year. 2024 Key Funding Rounds in Infrastructure Project Funding Amount Lead Investors Valuation Funding Round EigenLayer US$50m Blockchain Capital, Polychain US$200m Round A LayerZero US$100m a16z, Sequoia Capital US$3bn Round B Celestia US$55m Polychain, Binance Labs – Round A Shardeum US$60m Multicoin Capital – Round A Monad US$30m Dragonfly Capital – Seed Round Fuel Labs US$40m Paradigm – Round A Lightning Labs (Taro) US$30m a16z – Round A Infrastructure is still imperative in this year’s crypto investments and funding. Layer 1 solutions, modular public blockchains, and infrastructure related to the Bitcoin ecosystem have all been favored by investors. Layer 1 now represents the most concentrated areas of technical development and exploration in the crypto space, and it is expected to remain a key sector for development resources and capital investment in the future. Meme An Important Gateway for Retail Investors Under Relaxed Crypto Policies In 2024, the Meme coin sector has once again become a hotspot in the crypto market. As an ecosystem bridgehead , it has not only built community consensus but also integrated with verticals like DeFi and GameFi to create new use cases. For example, Solana has actively championed the innovation and growth of Meme projects, successfully energizing its ecosystem. From Bome and Slerf earlier this year to the emergence of pump.fi mid-year, these projects are much like lottery due to their bonding curve pricing models and low market-cap launch strategies, thus attracting widespread attention. In addition, pump.fi is characterized by a decentralized feature that allows everyone to launch Meme coins, which fosters greater prosperity in the ecosystem. Over half of Solana’s Meme projects now originate from pump.fi, with dozens of these achieving market caps exceeding US$1bn. Public blockchains like SUI and TRON have also quickly adopted meme strategies, further invigorating their ecosystems. Pump.fun Characterized by their accessibility and low entry barriers, Meme projects have become a key tool for attracting new crypto users. The launch of Mootshot allows users to purchase Meme assets with fiat, while the craze of politically-themed Meme coins after the election has created a strong sense of engagement for new players. Looking forward, the potential influence brought about by the crypto policies and related governance trends under the Trump administration may spawn new hotspots related to Meme coins. For instance, if the “Department of Government Efficiency” (abbreviated asDOGE) led by Elon Musk garners attention, it could trigger another surge in Dogecoin. As the crypto market environment becomes increasingly relaxed, more retail investors are expected to enter the market, making Meme projects a key channel for capital inflows. Robinhood’s record of significant price surges following every Meme coin listing clearly highlights this trend, which is likely to drive future development in this sector. Meme Infrastructure With market participants’ growing demand for fair launches, the Meme coin fair launch sector has gained significant market attention and attracted substantial participants this year. Infrastructure projects such as Pump.fun and SunPump have emerged as top-performing cash flow generators, injecting fresh momentum into Meme coin development. Pump.fun Pump.fun is a Solana-based platform for launching Meme projects. By offering simple and intuitive creation tools, robust community support, a fair-launch allocation model, and mechanisms for automated liquidity injection into DEXs, coupled with Solana’s proven market operations, community management, and low transaction costs, Pump.fun gained market recognition upon its debut. It has successfully incubated several high-profile Meme projects. As of November 2024, over 40,000 projects have been launched on Raydium, generating cumulative revenue exceeding 1.17 million SOL, equivalent to approximately US$200m. Meanwhile, Pump.fun’s success has led to imitations by many other projects, inspiring numerous imitators across various chains, with SunPump being the most notable one. Overall, this market-driven meme coin craze owes much to innovation and progress in infrastructure tools. Tools like Pump pioneered automated liquidity injection on launch platforms while pursuing fair, low-cost, and efficient launch methods. These innovations effectively lower launch costs and barriers, boost the market and community confidence, and drive increased participation. As a result, Meme projects have sustained their popularity throughout the year. Pump.fun’s success has not been perfectly replicated on other chains, and the main reasons are as follows: ● Solana’s low transaction costs and high throughput make it one of the ideal platforms for launching meme projects. ● The Solana community has shown exceptional enthusiasm for new projects, which drives rapid growth for emerging Meme projects. ● Other ecosystems such as Ethereum struggle with high gas fees and other issues. Moreover, Meme projects on high-performance chains like BSC and Avalanche demonstrate lackluster performance because they are constrained by smaller community sizes and lower user stickiness. Launch platforms like Pump.fun and SunPump have become essential infrastructure for the development of Meme projects. Meme projects may become more diversified and practical in the future, with infrastructure potentially offering greater product functionalities, incorporating features tailored to specific use cases, such as gaming, NFTs, and social networking. As multi-chain ecosystems mature and real-world use cases expand, meme coin infrastructure will continue injecting more vitality into this sector. AI In 2024, the Crypto x AI sector has been exploring viable directions, giving rise to several segmented fields such as ZK/OPML for enabling AI on-chain, AI data crowdsourcing, decentralized computing power rental, AI data trading, AI games, and AI agents. Crypto Projects Expand Their Focus to Capture AI Narrative A significant number of blockchain infrastructure and applications have expanded their focus to AI this year. Centralization of resources and ownership is one of the key challenges in scaling AI infrastructure in the long term, while traits of decentralization enabled with blockchain networks present a viable solution to solve the centralization issues with AI. One of the major examples of traditional crypto projects moving with AI include Near – it encourages AI to run on open source protocols on the chain since this year. Data Labeling/ Management Data resource constraints have been a major challenge for scaling AI development currently. Majority of useful data for AI model development is monopolized by big tech. Language and cultural coverage inefficiencies have thus become a problem due to the exclusiveness of jurisdiction coverage of these firms. Existing centralized AI data labeling firms are not able to scale the dataset in a comprehensive manner due to the poor financial incentives offered and operational jurisdiction limitation. Blockchain can be a good solution for solving these problems. Multiple projects are going to launch to improve data provenance and incentivize more efficient data labeling tasks across jurisdictions, e.g. Kiva, Sapien, Bagel, etc. Decentralized Inferencing and Machine Learning People mainly use centralized service providers like Hugging Face to run inference of open source models currently, which may pose concerns over privacy or censorship issues. Decentralized inferencing allows people to run machine learning models without relying on centralized service providers while ensuring the model output is trustable. Three major verifiable inferencing verticals have emerged, with different cost and security trade off conditions embedded: Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (“ZKML”) ZKML allows inferencing of AI models with privacy provided by zk-snarks technology. Giza, Modulus Labs and EZKL were the key players in this vertical. These unlocks enhance security and accuracy over the inferencing process on open source models. However, the cost of inferencing will significantly surge due to the cost to generate ZK proof, leading to at least 100x time cost and latency compared to centralized inferencing. As such, current products still need further enhancement on ZK technology to be usable in the future. Optimistic Machine Learning (“OPML”) OPML assumes inference is accurate unless proven wrong by the challenger on the network. Network challengers act as watchers of the on-chain inferences and run on their own models to ensure output accuracy. A primary example of OPML platforms is ORA. Although the cost performance of OPML is lower than ZKML, it is still much more expensive than centralized inferencing due to the watcher cost. On-chain Decentralized Inferencing Network With a decentralized inferencing network, queries are run on-chain with a few nodes. If differences arise, the outstanding one will be slashed. This is the cheapest and fastest solution among the rest but security is not guaranteed as there are possibilities for the nodes to cheat. To ensure further security, more nodes may be considered to be deployed but this will further increase the cost. Ritual is one of the examples of running a decentralized inferencing network. Due to the weak cost efficiency compared to local inferencing, it is not a priority to decentralize AI inferencing for users at the moment. Output verification is rarely a huge concern of AI developers and users under the current AI status quo. Aside from that, edge computing can also be another solution for privacy and security for running AI models. As such, decentralized inferencing may face bottlenecks on growth in the long run. Decentralized GPU GPUs are heavily demanded in AI development while current GPU providers are largely monopolized by a few main players in the market, which may pose a risk of price sensitivity if any extreme market conditions happen. Old decentralized GPU protocol Render has experienced 10x growth in price since 2023. An influx of decentralized GPU networks is launching in the market this year, e.g. IO.net, Grass, Akash, etc. These networks incentivize GPU contribution with tokens, with target audiences of both consumers and smaller GPU companies. However, due to the lack of uniformity of GPU resources on these networks and the fact that most performant GPUs are not owned by the consumers, it is anticipated that centralized GPU providers will still be the mainstream of adoption by AI developers. AI Agent On Chain AI agents were put on chains to take advantage of the token mechanism to incentivise and bootstrap certain behaviors with the agents, including interacting with smart contracts, trading and querying on behalf of users. Myshell is one of the examples. In the future, AI Agents will gradually become personal butlers and assistants for users, serving them with comprehensive capabilities, such as independent asset issuance, initiation of viral marketing campaigns, formation of decentralized autonomous organizations (“DAO”), and even fund management and investment decision-making. Over time, they may develop unique cultures and religions. This deep integration of AI and encryption technology is a groundbreaking evolution that is unattainable within Web2 and cannot be achieved by Web3 relying solely on encryption technology. These innovations have not yet been transformed into products. Recently, in order to address AI agents’ needs for independent financial identities, specifically, the ability to autonomously control wallets, Coinbase has launched AI wallets based on its Coinbase MPC Wallet, allowing AI agents to conduct transactions with these wallets effortlessly. To make AI Wallet more accessible, Coinbase has also released a Based Agent template, which helps users deploy AI wallets with zero coding. More related products are expected to emerge in 2025. Based Agent Breakdown, Source: https://x.com/starzqeth/status/1853597036421259728 On top of that, AI agent networks have also arisen. Theoriq is a key example. It enables efficient multi-agent operation on blockchains with its community-governed AI agent marketplace. This creates an efficient distribution channel for AI agent creators and streamlined processes for AI agent users to perform multiple tasks. TON Ecosystem Attributable to Telegram’s hundreds of millions of users and robust technical support, the The Open Network (“TON”) ecosystem has gradually built a multi-layered blockchain ecosystem. In 2024, it experienced a full-scale boom in both its ecosystem and market. From DeFi and meme coins to NFTs and gaming, TON has made significant accomplishments with its massive user base in various fields, pioneering the monetization of Web2 social applications through crypto. TON data overview, Defillama, https://defillama.com/chain/TON Since traditional business models cannot bring Telegram substantial profits, TON began exploring alternatives like zero-threshold or low-spending “tap-to-earn” games, along with token airdrop incentives. This strategy has successfully drawn in a large number of Web2 users. Notcoin’s Success In May 2024, the first project Notcoin was launched. Notcoin is a social clicker game accessible via Telegram. Players engage with the Notcoin bot, invite friends, and start playing. The game mechanics are straightforward: a golden coin appears on your screen, and each tap earns you Notcoin, the game’s virtual currency. However, users’ ability to tap is limited by an energy bar that depletes with each tap but gradually refills over time. Notcoin quickly gained popularity in the market after it was released. Relying on its simple gameplay and Telegram’s vast user base, it achieved over one million monthly active users in a short time and was listed on major exchanges. Notcoin’s success marks the successful implementation of TON’s ecosystem gaming model and signifies that the gaming sector has entered a new phase of user attraction. Catizen’s Optimization Following Notcoin’s success, Catizen optimized its gameplay by introducing features such as speed boosts, encouraging users to start with small amounts, such as $0.99 or $4.99. Users can also deposit fiat via OTC channels or directly purchase crypto assets with credit cards, significantly lowering entry barriers. This zero-threshold or low-spending model has further expanded the user base. Other Business Models DOGS is one of the most popular meme projects in the TON ecosystem. Thanks to its unique community governance and ecosystem development, DOGS quickly gained a hold in the market. The project enables simple mining operations by verifying users’ Telegram accounts and adopting a referral mechanism. Upon its launch, DOGS attracted significant community attention and traffic and rapidly secured listings on multiple exchanges. Apart from gaming and social projects, DeFi also thrives in the TON ecosystem. Projects like TonStaker and Ston.fi have made strong progress. With star projects such as Notcoin, DOGS, and Catizen, TON has not only solidified its position in social payment but also achieved breakthroughs in multiple sectors like DeFi. However, tap-to-earn games fundamentally operate on a model where Web2 users are initially attracted through token airdrop incentives and sold to exchanges afterward. After the initial hype subsides, traffic declines significantly. Currently, the TON ecosystem urgently needs to find a new business model in 2025 that can improve user retention and identify the next growth curve. It could be DeFi or meme coins but certainly not the models already implemented on Ethereum or Solana. TON’s success has also inspired other Web2 social applications. For instance, Line, targeting markets in Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, has introduced the Kaia chain, experimenting with the Mini DApp model to monetize its existing Web2 traffic. This shows that TON’s model is influencing the entire industry profoundly. Line Web3 Platform Breakdown, Source: https://govforum.kaia.io/t/gp-4-budget-request-for-kaia-wave/963 Capital Markets Attention In the capital markets, the TON ecosystem has garnered more attention from investors than other high-performance public blockchains. Multiple projects have received investments from the primary market this year. The TON ecosystem will continue advancing user experience, ecosystem diversity, and technological innovation, injecting fresh momentum into the sustained development of the crypto market. While the TON ecosystem has made substantial breakthroughs in 2024, TON must innovate its business model, increase user retention, and identify a new growth curve for the future. This is the only way for TON to maintain its leadership in fierce blockchain competition and deliver constant value to both its users and investors. Macro Summary The theme of the crypto market in 2024 was first dominated by the approval of the Bitcoin ETF in January and more recently by Trump’s presidential election win in November. From a macroeconomic perspective, the market is currently transitioning from quantitative tightening (“QT”) to quantitative easing (“QE”), with QE expected to begin in the second quarter of next year. Historically, the peak of crypto bull markets rarely occurs during rate-cut cycles. Instead, it usually happens at the end of rate-cut cycles, or just as a rate-hike cycle nears its end or even just begins. For example, the extreme easing policies triggered by the 2020 pandemic started a crypto bull run, which reached its peak at the end of 2021 as the Federal Reserve signaled a gradual shift toward tightening policies. Later, rate hikes officially began in 2022. Therefore, in our opinion, the crypto market has yet to reach its bull market peak. On the whole, this cycle may unfold in various ways. In particular, against the backdrop of Trump’s fiscal expansion policies and unprecedented crypto-friendly signals, a robust bull market is expected. Moreover, with regulatory easing and the entry of traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin will gain stronger support and gradually become a core dollar-denominated asset, aside from those tied to the dollar industry cycles (such as AI). The trend of decoupling between Bitcoin and the traditional altcoin market is expected to intensify. On the one hand, the benchmark interest rate is expected to decline to neutral levels by mid-2025. Whether there would be further rate cuts or tightening will largely depend on inflation levels at the time, as well as Trump’s ability to influence the Federal Reserve. If the Fed signals tightening measures to address inflation, the market may enter an adjustment phase that may last until May 2026, when Trump could have the chance to assert control over Fed policies. The Influx of Traditional Financial Giants and Retail Crypto Investors in 2025 Will Spawn New Sectors The Repeal of SAB 121 Will Clear Hurdles for the Entry of Traditional Financial Institutions Trump is expected to repeal SAB 121 after his inauguration on 20 January 2025. This move will allow traditional financial institutions to hold cryptos on their balance sheets, further accelerating the institutionalization of crypto assets. The repeal will not only provide more financing options for crypto assets but also make spot cryptos more accessible through existing institutional exchanges and partnerships. At the same time, it will significantly enhance the maturity of the overall institutional crypto market. Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (“SAB 121”) is a guideline issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in 2022. This regulation requires banks, exchanges, and other financial institutions holding or providing custodial services for crypto assets to treat these assets as liabilities and disclose them accordingly on their balance sheets. Even if these institutions are merely holding clients’ crypto assets in custody, they must assume potential responsibilities. This rule requires financial institutions to make two adjustments: On the one hand, they must disclose detailed information regarding potential risks associated with crypto assets, including market volatility, hacking, and technical failures. On the other hand, they must account for crypto assets as liabilities rather than client assets in their custody. This may increase the total liabilities on the balance sheets of banks and financial institutions, which in turn impacts their capital adequacy ratios. Due to these restrictions, SAB 121 has directly hindered traditional financial institutions in the U.S., especially national banks like Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, from offering crypto custody services. It has also limited crypto firms’ access to banking services. However, as regulatory agencies clarify their stance and policies ease, traditional financial service companies and investors will be able to operate on blockchain platforms for the first time, which will bring them new earnings and strategic possibilities. Coingecko , (data dated as of 8 Dec 2024) PayFi: Fiat’s Direct Involvement in Crypto Operations Will Unlock Infinite Potential ● With traditional financial institutions now allowed to legally invest in, hold, and provide custodial services for crypto assets, sectors such as PayFi, compliant stablecoins, and compliant fiat on-ramps are set to rise. Recently, Tether announced the launch of a new real-world asset (“RWA”) platform that focuses on tokenizing real-world financial assets (such as government bonds, real estate, and other fixed-income assets) to provide digitized investment options. ● Moonshot has created brand-new use cases by integrating fiat on-ramps with meme coin trading. In the future, more projects are likely to emerge by connecting fiat channels and by integrating real-world assets and high-frequency crypto gameplay (such as GameFi and DeFi).

In addition to the price action, whales and industry experts seem to be losing interest in the altcoin, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firms IntoTheBlock and CryptoQuant. Will ETH Price Decline? Recently, ETH experienced a price surge of over 15% and hit the $4,100 mark for the first time since March 2024, where it faced selling pressure and a notable price decline. Historically, ETH has reached this level five times, and each time, it has encountered a price decline and significant selling pressure. Ethereum (ETH) Rising Exchange Reserve This time, looking at past trends whales and long-term holders appear to continue depositing their ETH to exchanges, as revealed by CryptoQuant’s ETH exchange reserve metrics. Data shows that exchange reserves have increased by nearly 100k ETH worth $400 million which could signal increased selling pressure as the price nears a six-month high. Source: CryptoQuant Rising Unstaking Activity In addition to the rising exchange reserves, whales have begun withdrawing tokens from staking, suggesting they are gradually taking profits due to the recent price surge or indicating a loss of interest in holding ETH long-term. This is evidenced by the recent activity of Justin Sun, the founder of Tron. On December 16, 2024, the whale transaction tracker Spotonchain shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating that Sun’s linked wallet address requested to withdraw 52,905 ETH, worth $209 million, from the staking protocol Lido Finance. Source: Previously Twitter Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, ETH appears to be forming a bearish double-top price action pattern at the strong resistance level of $4,100. In addition to the double-top pattern, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is falling, indicating a bearish divergence, which further suggests a price decline and increased selling pressure. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, there is a strong possibility that ETH could decline by 12% to reach the $3,500 level in the future. Current Price Decline At press time, ETH is trading near the $3,970 level and has experienced a modest price decline of 0.80% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has soared by 60%, indicating heightened participation from crypto enthusiasts amid the recent price surge.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ethereum-eth-bearish-signal-3500-the-next-target/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-loves-usa-muskusa-to-rally-16000-before-exchange-listing-while-bonk-and-shib-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 448,500 followers on the social media platform X that XRP appears to be gearing up for wave three of its five-wave surge on the four-hour chart. Credible practices the Elliott Wave theory which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rally where wave three represents the longest and steepest part of the surge. Credible shares a chart that outlines XRP’s path to $20 before its five-wave rally comes to a conclusion. “And for non-traders, you just need to zoom out a little so you don’t forget the big picture. Structure on XRP here looks so freaking clean and bullish, it’s actually insane. Forget what happens on these lower timeframes. It’s noise (for a non-trader), the big picture is incredibly and unequivocally bullish.” Source: Credible/X At time of writing, XRP is trading for $2.44, indicating a potential rise of 719% if the altcoin hits the massive price target. Zooming in, Credible believes it is within the realm of possibility for XRP to revisit a support level below $2 before taking off to new all-time highs. “XRP looking solid here, fresh local demand formed in the ORANGE zone. Any retests of that zone should be good long opportunities for those looking for an entry. Ideally, we get something like what is pictured.” Source: Credible/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to predict that XRP will first rally above $3 before witnessing a deep corrective move.

This latest purchase comes as BTC has surged to new all-time highs, with the leading cryptocurrency recently surpassing the $106,00 mark on Monday. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Stash Grows To 439,000 BTC On Monday, Michael Saylor announced that MicroStrategy acquired an additional 15,350 BTC for approximately $1.5 billion, averaging around $100,386 per Bitcoin. This acquisition contributes to the firm’s substantial Bitcoin portfolio, which now totals 439,000 BTC, purchased for about $27.1 billion at an average price of $61,725 per Bitcoin. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Faces Headwinds: Can Bulls Revive Momentum? Interestingly, Saylor also disclosed in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) that the firm’s Bitcoin holdings have yielded notable returns, boasting a 46.4% gain quarter-to-date (QTD) and 72.4% gain year-to-date (YTD). This bullish momentum in the market follows increased optimism since November 5, when President-elect Donald Trump secured a new term in the White House with key promises made throughout the year to the industry. Investors are now confident that Trump’s new administration would make regulatory changes that could create a more favorable climate for digital assets. The US crypto market has encountered considerable difficulties in recent years, particularly from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Microstrategy’s MSTR Rises 3% On Nasdaq 100 News The recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price is further evidenced by a significant trading volume increase, with CoinGecko reporting a $92 million surge in the past 24 hours—a 54% increase compared to the previous day. However, MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy has not only influenced the cryptocurrency market but has also positively affected its stock (MSTR) price. Following the announcement that MicroStrategy would be listed on the Nasdaq 100 index last week, shares of the company rose over 3% in premarket trading. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ The inclusion in the Nasdaq 100—a benchmark for technology stocks—takes effect on December 23 and is expected to attract significant investment flows, potentially leading to $2.1 billion in stock purchases from over 200 exchange-traded products that track the index. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani remarked on Monday that MicroStrategy’s strategy to Bitcoin purchase is “unprecedented,” establishing the company as the largest corporate Bitcoin owner, with around 2% of the total supply. Chhugani commented: MSTR’s Bitcoin buying program is unprecedented on the street, and inclusion in Nasdaq 100 further improves MSTR’s market liquidity, expanding its capital flywheel and Bitcoin buying program. At the time of writing, BTC has managed to consolidate at $103,900 for the past few hours after surging to new all-time highs.

37737194,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52307,1734397228,Discover the Forefront 5 Innovators of Decentralized Platforms: A Detailed Examination of Blockchain Advances,"Blockchain technology’s spread across various sectors has sparked extensive innovation, transforming traditional business structures and pioneering new user engagement strategies. This article examines five significant blockchain projects—Origin Protocol, Syscoin, Particl, District0x, and Web3Bay. Each initiative introduces unique enhancements to the blockchain environment, from decentralized markets to advanced privacy measures, illustrating the adaptability and transformative capability of blockchain solutions. 1. District0x: Building Decentralized Community Networks District0x presents a novel approach to decentralized applications by offering tools for creating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that manage marketplaces, social networks, and other community-driven platforms. Each ‘district’ within the network operates independently, governed by its participants under District0x’s governance frameworks. 2. Syscoin: Combining Bitcoin’s Security with Ethereum’s Versatility Syscoin integrates Bitcoin’s security features with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. It introduces the Z-DAG protocol, enhancing transaction speeds essential for scalable business uses. Syscoin’s framework accommodates various applications, from affordable global transactions to business services, aiming to establish a decentralized marketplace for diverse assets. 3. Particl: Promoting Enhanced Privacy in E-commerce Particl is dedicated to privacy, offering a decentralized marketplace where transactions remain confidential. By using its proprietary cryptocurrency, Particl ensures that user identities and activities are kept private. The platform’s focus on privacy is crucial for users who prefer anonymous transactions, especially in today’s frequent data breach climate. 4. Origin Protocol: Facilitating Decentralized Marketplaces Utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, Origin Protocol develops a comprehensive structure for creating decentralized marketplaces. It enables users to generate and handle listings for goods, services, and even rentals without traditional intermediaries. This approach minimizes transaction costs and hands control and profits back to the users, supporting a true peer-to-peer marketplace. 5. Web3Bay: Enhancing E-Commerce with Blockchain Innovation Web3Bay operates on its proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, promoting a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace independent of central authorities. Its initial offering strategy aims to cultivate a solid community foundation, promoting stability and liquidity at its launch. Web3Bay combines blockchain’s core benefits—security, transparency, and decentralization—with an intuitive interface, appealing to a wide audience. Web3Bay’s initial offering provides a favorable opportunity for early backers, allocating 40% of its 5 billion 3BAY tokens to a 28-stage initial offering. Each stage incrementally raises the token price by 15%, benefiting early participants while securing vital capital. Beginning at $0.003 per token in Stage 1 and climbing to $0.1959 in Stage 28, each phase specifies funding goals and token distributions. This structured approach, combined with Web3Bay’s ambitious plans, aims to establish a steady introductory price and cultivate community loyalty, positioning it to revolutionize decentralized e-commerce with its secure, community-focused platform and cross-chain functionality. Key Insights While each platform offers targeted solutions to particular challenges, Web3Bay’s dedicated strategy in decentralizing e-commerce marks it as a potentially influential player in a broad market. Its strategic initial offering, designed to encourage early investment and community engagement, lays a strong foundation for success. Although Origin Protocol, Syscoin, Particl, and District0x each offer specialized services within their areas, Web3Bay’s wide market appeal and strategic use of blockchain technology could lead to extensive adoption and substantial impact. As these decentralized platforms evolve, Web3Bay emerges as a notable contender, potentially reshaping the e-commerce sector, making it an important project in the current blockchain innovation landscape.

Regarding the roadmap, the team behind DawgzAI has made plans to achieve the following phases in the coming months: Phase 1: The launch of presale and community building, which is already underway.

37736720,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=628680,1734396058,"Meta makes three major updates to its Ray-Ban glasses, including live AI","Meta Platforms has added new features to its Ray-Ban glasses, including real-time live AI and Shazam on top of the already onboarded features. This comes as the social media giant has been constantly upgrading the AI-enabled glasses to enhance performance including to handle more complex tasks and respond more naturally in major updates that are expected to transform the smart glasses. Meta made significant upgrades to Ray-Ban Earlier this year Meta revealed it was integrating its next-generation AI model Llama 3 into virtual assistant – MetaAI in its Ray-Ban smart glasses to enhance performance. The multi-modal features were in early access last December and can perform translations in addition to identifying objects, animals, and monuments. Now, Meta has brought other major upgrades to the smart glasses to boost their performance further. According to Cnet, the always-on continuous AI assistance started working on the Ray-Ban glasses on Monday for owners that have access to Meta’s features . This is in addition to the onboard translation, and Shazam which is currently available in the US and Canada only. The latest features added to the AI-enabled glasses include continuous audio and camera recording as opposed to specific individual prompts. This, according to Cnet , allows the glasses to be used for an extended period of time with the AI features turned on. Whenever the always-on live AI is activated, the glasses’ LED also stays on. Meta keeps a recording of the conversation that can be referred to throughout the AI session. In terms of translation, it is expected to work automatically while talking. However, although the translation comes through the glasses, it comes with a slight delay. The live AI assistance is reportedly similar to what Google demonstrated on its own prototype glasses this month via Gemini and Android XR, arriving next year. According to Meta, as cited by Cnet, the aways-on AI takes a hit on battery life, and users can expect up to 30 minutes of use before recharging the device. However, the company further explains that this type of always-on camera-assisted AI is exactly what more tech companies will be exploring in the next year. AI glasses hit their stride in 2024 The upgrades come as Big Tech is pushing AI assistants as the raison d’etre for smart glasses. Last week, Google revealed Android XR for new smart glasses, and specifically positioned its Gemini AI assistant as the killer app. In the meantime Andrew Bosworth, Meta CTO said in blog post that “2024 was the year AI glasses hit their stride.” In the same blogpost, Bosworth further opines that smart glasses may be the best possible form factor for a “truly AI-native device.” He added the AI-powered glasses could be the first hardware category to be “completely defined by AI from the beginning.” With Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, users can activate the virtual assistant on the glasses by saying “ Hey Meta ” then ask a question or prompt, before the assistant can respond via speakers built on the frames. According to Meta , users can livestream from the glasses to social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, using “Hey Meta” to engage with the firm’s “advanced conversational assistant” MetaAI. The Ray Ban glasses feature enhanced audio and cameras, in addition to more than 150 different custom frame and lens combinations, “and they are lighter and comfortable.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",NEUTRAL,없음,OTHER,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-makes-major-updates-to-ray-ban-glasses/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37736720.jpeg

On December 17, 2024, data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment revealed a massive rise in whale activity on the Cardano network, signaling potential upside momentum. Whale Transactions Surge on Cardano Network According to the data, the Cardano network witnessed a substantial 687 transactions, each worth more than $1 million, recorded in the past 24 hours. This highlights whales’ rising interest and confidence in the altcoin, suggesting a major price rally could be on the horizon. Additionally, these notable transaction details were highlighted by crypto experts on X (formerly Twitter). However, ADA experienced this surge in transactions during a period of consolidation, as it traded within a tight range over the past week.

However, this pattern isn’t yet complete, as the price remains trapped in a consolidation range between $1.07 and $1.14. This range could determine whether ADA moves upward or downward in the coming days. Source: Trading View ADA Key Levels and Current Price Momentum Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks out of the narrow range and closes a daily candle above the $1.14 level, the bearish pattern would be invalidated, and ADA’s price could soar by 43% to reach the $1.63 mark in the future. Conversely, if ADA breaks down from the range and closes a daily candle below $1, the bearish pattern would be confirmed, and ADA could witness a price decline of 24%, falling to the $0.78 level. However, this bearish outlook currently appears manageable, as ADA continues to receive support from an ascending trendline. On the positive side, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 52, below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset has enough room to rise in the coming days. Currently, ADA is trading near $1.07 and has recorded a price decline of 2.7% in the past 24 hours.

37737189,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52346,1734394722,Running an XRP Ledger Node: How to Start from Scratch,"Running an XRP Ledger (XRPL) node has been a frequently discussed topic within the blockchain community, particularly for individuals seeking greater control and independence in interacting with the ledger. XRPL Validator, VET, recently shared valuable tips for beginners interested in setting up their nodes. This article outlines the key points from VET’s post to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process and its benefits. What is an XRP Ledger (XRPL) Node? An XRP Ledger (XRPL) node is essentially a computer running the XRPL software, known as “rippled.” These nodes connect to the XRP Ledger network by establishing peer connections with other nodes. This interaction forms a decentralized network that processes transactions and maintains the ledger’s integrity. There are several types of XRPL nodes, each serving distinct purposes based on their configuration: Validators: Nodes that validate transactions and add them to the ledger. Stock Nodes: Designed for standard use, such as querying balances, submitting transactions, and sharing ledger data. Full History Nodes : Nodes that store the complete history of the XRPL. Pathfinding Nodes: Nodes optimized for finding payment paths. Why Run a Node? Running an XRPL node comes with several significant benefits. First, it provides independence, allowing users to eliminate reliance on third-party wallet providers or exchanges that typically run nodes to submit transactions. By operating your own node, you ensure uninterrupted access to the ledger at all times. Additionally, running a node contributes directly to the XRPL network by supporting the dissemination and validation of ledger data, strengthening the overall system. Finally, maintaining a personal node enhances security and control by reducing dependence on potentially vulnerable third-party infrastructure. Setting Up an XRP Ledger Node: Basic Requirements To get started, you’ll need a few essential components. A standard laptop or PC will suffice as the primary hardware, paired with a stable internet connection. While VET recommends speeds above 200 Mbps for optimal performance, lower speeds may still work in certain situations. Additionally, you’ll need the XRPL software, known as “rippled,” which can be downloaded directly from the official XRPL documentation. Hardware Specifications: The hardware requirements for running a node are relatively modest. While the official XRPL documentation suggests higher specifications, VET notes that 32GB DDR3 RAM and a basic CPU should suffice for non-intensive use. Operating System: Linux is the recommended operating system for running “rippled.” For users unfamiliar with Linux, VET suggests using Docker , a platform that simplifies the setup process. A video guide on this approach is forthcoming. Overcoming Challenges: Setting up and maintaining a node may seem daunting, particularly for those unfamiliar with command-line interfaces. However, with available resources and support from the XRP community , many beginners have successfully navigated the process. Resources and Support: The XRPL documentation provides a detailed installation guide for Linux users, accessible here . Additionally, experienced members of the XRP community, including VET, are available to answer questions and provide guidance. Running an XRPL node is an excellent way for individuals to contribute to the network, enhance their control over their transactions, and gain deeper insights into blockchain technology. While the setup process may require effort and learning, the long-term benefits of independence, security, and community engagement make it a worthwhile endeavor. Those interested in getting started should leverage the resources and support available within the XRPL ecosystem.

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to Shiba Inu’s multi-billion-dollar ecosystem, meme coins have proven they’re more than just jokes. Enter BTFD Coin, the latest buzz in the meme coin universe, poised to redefine what these digital assets can do. With its play-to-earn (P2E) game , lucrative staking rewards, and vibrant community, BTFD Coin is already making waves—and it’s just getting started. The presale for BTFD Coin (BTFD) , which went live on November 26, 2024, has quickly captured the attention of crypto investors. With over $4 million raised in just a few weeks, BTFD’s presale performance is nothing short of legendary. Analysts predict BTFD’s price will skyrocket once listed at $0.0006 per coin. But what makes this meme coin so special? And how does it stack up against heavyweights like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? Let’s dive deep into why BTFD Coin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are the best meme coins to invest in right now and what sets them apart in the ever-growing crypto market. BTFD Coin: The Future of Meme Coins Is Here BTFD Coin’s presale is one of the hottest crypto events of 2024. In just a few weeks, it’s surged through 12 presale stages, raising over $4 million and selling more than 55 billion coins. What’s driving this success? A combination of innovative features and community-driven hype. BTFD’s presale kicked off at an eye-popping price of $0.000004 per coin. By Stage 5, the price had risen to $0.00005. Fast forward to Stage 12, and it’s now sitting at $0.00013 per coin. Once the presale concludes, BTFD will launch at $0.0006 per coin, offering early investors potentially massive returns. To illustrate: if you had invested $5,000 during Stage 5, you would have snagged 100 million BTFD coins. By the time the coin hits $0.0006, your investment would be worth a whopping $60,000. That’s a 12x return—not bad for a coin that’s just getting started! BTFD Coin isn’t just about numbers, though. Its ecosystem is packed with features to keep users engaged. The P2E game, which integrates $BTFD rewards, is already being hailed as a game-changer. Players can earn tokens while having fun, creating a win-win scenario. On top of that, staking rewards incentivise long-term holding, ensuring a steady price trajectory. Combine this with a strong community of over 5,600 holders, and you’ve got a recipe for success. BTFD also benefits from its tongue-in-cheek branding. “Buy the F***ing Dip” isn’t just a slogan; it’s a mindset. This meme coin embraces market volatility, turning it into an opportunity for its investors. With analysts projecting significant gains post-launch, the FOMO around BTFD is real. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on this trailblazing meme coin. Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin That Started It All When it comes to meme coins, Dogecoin is the undisputed king. Launched in 2013 as a joke, it’s now a household name, thanks in part to its playful Shiba Inu mascot and high-profile endorsements from the likes of Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s rise to fame wasn’t just luck; it’s backed by a passionate community that believes in its potential as a decentralised currency for everyday use. In 2021, Dogecoin hit its all-time high of $0.74, catapulting it into the crypto elite. While its price has since cooled off, Dogecoin remains a favourite among meme coin investors. Its transaction speed and low fees make it a practical choice for microtransactions and tipping. Plus, with Musk recently hinting at integrating Dogecoin into X (formerly Twitter), there’s renewed optimism about its future. But Dogecoin isn’t without its challenges. Critics argue that its lack of utility and unlimited supply could hinder long-term growth. Still, its resilience and ability to weather market downturns make it a strong contender. For those looking for a relatively stable meme coin with a proven track record, Dogecoin remains a solid bet. While newer meme coins like BTFD offer innovative features, Dogecoin’s simplicity and charm continue to win hearts. It’s not just a coin; it’s a cultural phenomenon. And in the world of meme coins, that’s priceless. Shiba Inu: The “Doge Killer” with Big Ambitions Shiba Inu burst onto the scene in 2020, branding itself as the “Doge Killer.” What started as a joke quickly evolved into a multi-faceted ecosystem. Shiba Inu isn’t just a meme coin; it’s an entire universe, complete with its own decentralised exchange (ShibaSwap), NFTs, and a metaverse project in the works. In 2021, Shiba Inu made headlines when its price skyrocketed by over 70,000,000%, turning early investors into millionaires. Today, Shiba Inu continues to innovate, expanding its ecosystem to include real-world applications. For instance, the upcoming Shibarium layer-2 solution promises faster and cheaper transactions, making $SHIB more appealing for everyday use. One of Shiba Inu’s standout features is its deflationary model. A significant portion of $SHIB tokens is regularly burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing demand. This sets it apart from Dogecoin’s inflationary model and positions it as a long-term investment option. While Shiba Inu’s price is nowhere near its 2021 peak, its robust ecosystem and active community make it a strong contender in the meme coin space. For investors seeking a meme coin with serious utility and growth potential, Shiba Inu is worth a closer look. Conclusion: Join the BTFD Revolution Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu are the best meme coins to invest in right now. Each offers unique features and growth potential, but BTFD Coin stands out as the most exciting opportunity. With its explosive presale performance, innovative P2E game, and strong community backing, BTFD is poised to take the meme coin world by storm. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this revolution. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in one of the hottest crypto investments of 2024. This is your chance to buy the dip—and ride the wave to the moon.

37735405,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52325,1734393653,3 Best Altcoins to Buy in the US That Will Rise Like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu by January 1,"The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to explosive growth stories like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. As 2025 approaches, investors are searching for the best altcoins to buy in the US. Analysts have highlighted three promising altcoins— RCO Finance (RCOF) , TRON (TRX), and Cardano (ADA)—as potential high-risers by January 1. Can these tokens deliver the best altcoins to buy in the US? 1. RCO Finance RCO Finance stands out with its advanced robo-advisor, which provides a more efficient approach than traditional human market analysis. This tool scans the markets, reviews projects, and identifies trends that need to be included manually. Investors can now access insights and predictions that make decision-making easier. Experts who have used the AI tool say the robo-advisor predicts outcomes and creates customized portfolios based on each investor’s goals and risk tolerance. This personalized service helps investors make more informed decisions and aligns trades with their strategies. RCO Finance’s robo-advisor acts like a financial consultant thanks to its machine-learning algorithms. It offers real-time recommendations, telling users when to buy, sell, or diversify their assets based on specific patterns. This feature gives users a clear advantage in decision-making and ensures they are always one step ahead. Beyond the robo-advisor, RCO Finance offers access to the best altcoins to buy in the US. The platform has 120,000 digital assets across 12,500 categories, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, ETFs, and real-world assets (RWAs). This wide selection lets users diversify their portfolios and manage risk. Very importantly, in an age of increasing emphasis on security, RCO Finance takes security seriously. It has completed a smart contract audit with SolidProof, a leading blockchain security firm. The audit confirms the platform’s commitment to transparency and the safety of user assets. 2. TRX Justin Sun declared TRX the “Next XRP” on X (previously Twitter). This has sparked much curiosity in the crypto world, especially given XRP’s recent surge, spurred by legal updates, ETF registrations, and favorable news about Ripple. Sun’s posts, including “TRX = XRP” have captured the attention of the Tron and XRP community and the larger market, speculating that TRX will follow XRP’s trend. TRX boasts one of the blockchains’ highest active user bases, thanks to its seamless integration with popular platforms, and currently trades at about $0.2893. Analysts believe TRON is on the cusp of a major price breakout, making it one of the best altcoins to consider before January 1. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu experts believe that TRX could rise to about $0.7788 to become the best altcoins to buy in the US. With its solid foundation and growing adoption, TRX is a reliable option for long-term investors seeking steady growth. 3. Cardano The Cardano Foundation’s social media platform X account appears to have been compromised in the early hours of December 8, causing fake news to spread throughout the cryptocurrency community. A series of messages from the account indicated that ADA tokens would undergo significant changes, such as stopping trade and token burns. One message claimed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had filed a lawsuit against the Cardano Foundation. At a current price of $1.10, ADA has a strong developer ecosystem and an active community that continues to drive its adoption. With its ongoing upgrades and partnerships, Cardano is poised for significant growth in 2025. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu analysts predict that the price of Cardano could rise by 22.49% and reach $ 1.34 by January 1. Cardano stands out as a top contender for investors looking for a secure yet high-potential crypto. RCOF Becomes The Best Altcoins to Buy in the US Ahead of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin and Shiba Inu analysts are predicting a staggering 1000x return for early investors that would capitalize on the $0.077 selling price of RCOF during the ongoing stage 4 of the presale. Imagine turning a $5 investment into $5,000—a life-changing opportunity that is well within reach if you act now. Experts say RCOF is one of the best altcoins to buy in the US due to its post-launch potential. After the launch at the $0.4 to $0.6 price range, experts expect a further 5,000% surge. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are strong contenders with their robust ecosystems and promising growth trajectories, RCOF’s presale offers unparalleled potential for explosive gains.

37735404,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52331,1734393608,"Chainlink And Solana Memecoin Fartcoin Running Hot, But PropiChain Is Poised For Higher Gains By 2025","With most major crypto prices peaking from the $100k Bitcoin (BTC) rally, investors are now rushing to find other undervalued gems before the bull run expires. Market analysts studying each crypto sector closely say Chainlink (LINK) is the altcoin to watch and believe Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) is poised to become a top Solana memecoin in 2025. However, regarding the best cryptos to buy now, experts say anyone looking for substantial profits by January has more to gain from the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale. PropiChain is ushering in the Web3 real estate revolution, and PCHAIN, its native token, is projected for an outstanding 23,902% run . Should Your Portfolio Include Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN)? While altcoins like XRP, ETH, and ADA stole the spotlight over the past month, many failed to notice the silent Chainlink (LINK) rally that was taking place. Some now even consider LINK one of the best-performing altcoins of Q4, considering that the Chainlink price at $28.62 today is up across the past week (13.28%), month (116.22%), and year (91.54%). This is even more true for Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) over in the Solana memecoin sector. Barely two months since its CMC listing, the Fartcoin price has surged 238.54%, 187.35%, and 948.26% to $0.5921 over the past week, month, and all-time, respectively. However, the problem with Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) remains the same for investors. Despite being good portfolio options, their surging prices offer diminished gains and potential losses for investors who purchase today, leaving the search for the best altcoins to buy now still wide open. PropiChain: The RWA Altcoin Outpacing Chainlink (LINK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) If you’re a crypto community member or pay any attention to Web3 news, you’ve likely heard about the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale , which recently concluded round one after raising over $1.4 million. While it’s not uncommon in a hype-fueled industry, PropiChain’s early success with investors can be attributed to its breakthrough blockchain solutions for the $600T real estate industry. Unlike competing solutions focusing on a single industry problem, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is introducing the first-ever full-service platform for checkmating global property fraud, eliminating the financial investing barrier, providing unlimited market access, and allowing for super-convenient digital asset management. These are all problems the industry has been trying to fix for many years. Still, PropiChain is finally making it possible with blockchain, RWA tokenization, metaverse, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence technologies. Among these technologies, blockchain is most important as it enables PropiChain to tokenize real estate, provides an impervious vault for storing tokens, and allows for smart-contract-based property management. PropiChain is finally bringing RWA tokenization to real estate, but what might seem like a simple technological advancement can reshape the entire industry. First, tokenization will allow for fractional ownership in real estate , thereby making it possible to trade digitized properties in unlimited fractions and prices. But this digitization will also bring liquidity to real estate by allowing for instant property transactions instead of the 44-day average it currently takes. We’ll witness unprecedented access to the market with fractional ownership and digitization, but PropiChain is taking it a step further with its interactive metaverse marketplace. Experts believe that by letting users take virtual tours, hosting virtual meetings, and staging assets virtually, PropiChain will become a major property trading platform. Yet, things only get more interesting with PropiChain’s smart contracts for property management and artificial intelligent tools for investors. On PropiChain, smart contracts can handle property rights transfers and manage rental agreements with features such as auto asset leasing, auto-renewals, and auto rent payment collections. Furthermore, PCHAIN holders can make data-driven investment decisions and even automate the investing process with AI tools that can personalize property search, derive assets’ true value using real-time metrics, and automatically trade properties when their value drops or rises above a pre-specified amount. Chainlink (LINK) vs. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) vs. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Which to Buy? Chainlink (LINK), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and PropiChain (PCHAIN) are three undervalued altcoins on investors’ watchlists today. However, its PCHAIN investors pick for the highest profits in this generation’s bull cycle. Unlike Chainlink and Fartcoin, offering modest gains and potential for significant losses from sharp price corrections, analysts project PropiChain (PCHAIN) for an astonishing 23,902% run by Q1 2025, outperforming LINK, FARTCOIN and most crypto markets. PropiChain Presale: Round Two Begins after Raising Over $1.4 Million Many already consider PropiChain (PCHAIN) the hottest new crypto after round one of its presale raised $1.4 million weeks after launch. Understandably, investors rushed to acquire a stake in the real estate Web3 revolution at its lowest-ever price. While round one is already gone, interested investors can still participate in round two of the presale , now selling PCHAIN at $0.011, the cheapest it’ll ever be again. However, round two is already moving quicker than the first as its early success signals investors of the best crypto presale project to invest in. The project’s BlockAudit security audit and PropiChain CoinMarketCap listing also have a hand to play after massively driving traffic following their announcements. Although a generous 291% profits await round-two investors by the final stage in the coming weeks, most are looking ahead as today’s investment of $1,500 can yield a staggering $360,030 by Q1 2025 when PCHAIN completes its 23,902% run. But remember, PropiChain is breezing through round two, and investors might miss this chance just as they missed round one.
