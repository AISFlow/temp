42400169,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrVB,1500325359,$7 Million Lost in CoinDash ICO Hack,"An initial coin offering (ICO) for a little-known startup project called CoinDash was abruptly halted today when it was revealed the sale had been compromised shortly after it began.  In total, the ICO was able to raise $7.53m before the ethereum address it was using to solicit funds was altered to a fake one by an unidentified hacker, resulting in the ether going to another source.  At the time of publication, the CoinDash website has been shut down, and the project is asking investors who have been affected to submit information to the provided link to collect the CoinDash token (CDT) they should be rewarded through the sale.  The company's statement reads:  ""Contributors that sent ETH to the fraudulent Ethereum address, which was maliciously placed on our website, and sent ETH to the CoinDash.io official address will receive their CDT tokens accordingly.""  Notably, as the project is still under attack, and the sale has been terminated.  In a statement, CoinDash urged investors not to send any ether to any address, since ""transactions sent to any fraudulent address after the website was shut down will not be compensated.""  The hacking of this ICO is reminiscent of last year when $50m was stolen in a similar fashion from a project called The DAO. As such, the event will likely again draw attention to possible security issues in ICO funding, amid their escalating popularity.

42400157,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrLL,1500321324,Scaling Bitcoin Unveils 2017 Conference Dates,"The fourth edition of the Scaling Bitcoin conference series is set to be held at Stanford University in California this November.  To be held over two days on the 4th and 5th of the month, the conference follows previous events that have aimed to unite bitcoin's international developer community to address how its technology could be improved to accommodate more users.  Notable scaling technologies including Segregated Witness and Bitcoin-NG, were both presented at the conference, and past venues have included Politecnico di Milano, in Italy, Centre Mont Royal Salon in Montreal, and Hong Kong's Cyberport district.  Still, despite the fact that the ongoing scaling debate is again flaring, conference organizers gave little indication that the format for the conference would change.  Ferdinando Ametrano, chair of the host committee for the 2016 conference in Milan, said in a statement:  ""Scaling Bitcoin has strived to consider the complex tradeoffs between decentralization, utility, security and operational realities. Our intent is to aid the technical consensus-building process, in a domain where performance and security are crucial trade-offs.""  Topics to be addressed include improving bitcoin's throughput, network resilience, block size proposals and more.  The addition of the latter topic is notable, as the Scaling Bitcoin conference has received criticism in the past over its perceived failure to discuss block size, with a minor protest event even taking up the subject to coincide with the 2016 Milan event.

42400160,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrMK,1500318013,SatoshiPay to Stop Using Bitcoin Blockchain for Micropayments,"Micropayments startup SatoshiPay has announced it intends to phase out its use of the bitcoin blockchain as the underlying technology that enables its transactions.  Announced today  , SatoshiPay has partnered with the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit that oversees network development, to explore replacing bitcoin with IOTA as its settlement network. SatoshiPay has been relying on the bitcoin network to settle payments since its product launch in 2015.  Still, in that time, the economics of the bitcoin network have undoubtedly changed.  According to CoinDesk's forthcoming State of Blockchain report, the average transaction fee was around $2.41 per transaction during Q2, up from below $0.02 in 2015.  SatoshiPay CEO Meinhard Benn wrote:  ""We love bitcoin for its pioneering role in the creation of our industry, but some blockchain networks it inspired have evolved faster than bitcoin itself, so we decided to move on to superior technology.""  The IOTA network, the 8th largest cryptocurrency by the total value of its supply, by contrast, claims zero-fee transactions and does not limit the number of transactions per second of its processing, features the IOTA Foundation said make it unique among available cryptocurrencies.  According to a blog post, the IOTA Foundation and SatoshiPay agreed to work on a proof-of-concept project, to be supported by the IOTA Ecosystem Fund, which would combine SatoshiPay’s content payment interface with IOTA's technology.  The results of the joint proof-of-concept are expected to be presented in August 2017, according to the IOTA foundation.  Notably, SatoshiPay is not the only startup to switch from bitcoin to another blockchain because of issues with the escalating costs of micropayments.  In May, blockchain content startup Yours announced that it would switch to the litecoin citing similar concerns.

42400159,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcIrNJ,1500310809,GPU Miners Hit Secondhand Market as Ether Price Gains Taper Off,"As the price of ether has declined over the past month, e-commerce websites like eBay have seen an increase in users seeking to sell graphics processing units (GPU) used in ethereum mining.  The native cryptocurrency on the ethereum blockchain, ether had recorded strong gains in 2017, rising from just under $10 on January 1, to a high of more than $400 on June 12. However, as excitement for the emerging technology cools, and the economics of the network evolve, prices have dropped, declining to a low of $133 over the last weekend.  While the price has dipped alongside cryptocurrencies, an unexpected side effect unique to ether is that the market now seems flooded with used GPUs for ethereum mining.  The search term ""ethereum mining rig,"" for example, shows 260 entries on eBay – all of which went online after June 11 this year except three. Half were published during last week when ether price dropped below $200.  A similar case is also seen on the classified ad website Craigslist, where all 126 posts of ethereum mining GPU sales can only be found after July 11.  As a result, the development could have an impact, including stemming a rejuvenated interest from GPU manufacturers like NVIDIA and AMD, both of which saw sales and stock prices increase amidst the rally.  Still, that's not to say that manufacturers are deterred.  The Taiwan-based manufacturer Asus plans to launch two new GPUs later last month specifically for the cryptocurrency mining market, and sales results could do much to demonstrate market interest.

Since May, the inter-bank payments startup has grown its validator network by 140% to include 55 participants, all of whom are now maintaining the integrity of the XRP Ledger (formerly the Ripple Consensus Ledger), running software that helps it agree on the order in which transactions are settled.  Newly revealed validators include WorldLink, Telindus-Proximus Group, Swedish ISP, Bahnhof and AT TOKYO Corporation, a data center and systems integration service provider.  Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas told CoinDesk:  ""Our new and existing validators represent some of the top enterprise hosting providers in the world. By expanding and diversifying this group, we ensure that the security and performance of XRP Ledger continues to outperform other digital assets.""  With the news, the companies join previously announced validators such as Microsoft, MIT and CGI.  Further, the announcement helps paint a picture of how the XRP Ledger is evolving in line with the desire of users to leverage its native cryptocurrency.  The token has so far experienced a tumultuous year, reaching an all-time high of $0.33 in May before declining to its current price of $0.18.  In the coming months, Ripple plans to add two new third-party validators to its unique node lists (UNLs) of trusted node operators.

42379612,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHUX,1500303645,Bitcoin's Miners Signal for Segwit2x Scaling Proposal Early,"Bitcoin's miners weren't expected to start signaling for the controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x until July 21, but some are already moving to show support in advance of another round of software testing.  As of today, about 43% of bitcoin's mining power is signaling for the change, including AntPool, BitClub, Bixin, BTC.com and BitFury – and other mining pools may be on the way. Slush Pool, which oversees about 5% of the hashrate, said that it will soon signal as well. As of now, there is no way to tell which are running the code.  Still, all miners need to do to lock-in the update is signal support for the change via a code proposal called BIP91. If a total of 80% of miners do so within the next 336 blocks, a period of about two days, the long-proposed code change Segregated Witness will lock-in.  While surprising, the move is likely due to a perceived need to upgrade the protocol to support SegWit before August 1.  That's when BIP148's user-activated soft fork kicks in, a change that could lead bitcoin to split into two competing assets if not enough of the ecosystem supports SegWit.  Mining pools are setting a piece of code in each block that they mine to signal for Segwit2x, though it remains unclear what the state of the code is after a test release was delayed Friday. (Users can check to see how many mining pools are signaling for BIP91 here.)  For more news, guides and updates on the issue, visit our dedicated blog page.

42379621,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHeb,1500298211,Crypto Assets Bounce Back Above $70 Billion Amid Day of Gains,"After a daunting weekend in which the value of cryptocurrencies cratered to levels not seen in months, 48 of the top 50 tokens are posting press-time gains.  In total, the value of all publicly traded crypto assets edged over $70bn today, up nearly $10bn from a low of $61bn observed yesterday. At publication, all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies were in the green, with IOTA, ether and stratis posting the biggest gains.  Overall, the price movements are the latest that add context to the still-unanswered question of whether the cryptocurrency asset class is in the midst of a ""correction"" after setting a new all-time high of $115bn in June. Even with the reversal, the market is still down just 40% from figures observed at that time, according to data from Coinmarketcap.  Yet, after winning mainstream press coverage and magazine covers, it appears that mainstream interest in new cryptographic assets may be waning.  Data from Google Trends shows search terms for ""ethereum,"" ""bitcoin"" and ""ICO"" were also down from highs observed in mid-June, indicating a possible fatigue in the market among more casual buyers.  As such, it remains unclear whether today's upwards movements will be enough to jumpstart a significant rally, or how stable prices will remain given potential challenges ahead for bitcoin and ether, historically the industry's two most visible assets.

42379615,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHQl,1500296403,Nuco Builds Tokenized Blockchain 'Bridge' for Enterprise Applications,"Nuco, a startup founded by a group of former Deloitte employees, has released a new white paper detailing its latest blockchain initiative.  Dubbed Aion, the proposed technology aims to connect different blockchains, including private networks operated by enterprises. The idea is that, as more companies turn to the technology for a variety of applications, there will need to be a public layer through which these future networks can communicate – and that's where Aion comes in.  As the white paper outlines, Aion would act as a kind of ""bridge"" between those networks, serving as ""a mechanism to transfer data and value securely between them."" Aion, as a public blockchain, will utilize a token aimed at incentivizing the various parties involved in both validating transactions and putting up the resources to transact between the different networks.  The paper explains:  ""The AION 1 itself can be used to deploy decentralized applications on, as well as will maintain a public record of transaction between bridges. Essentially, facilitating a network that is to blockchains what the internet is to computers.""  Aion's public nature is notable among enterprise-facing solutions on the market today, which have tended toward private, permissioned networks in which only approved parties can participate. Aion's ""Connecting Network"", according to the paper, would link both private and public networks alike.  Nuco also details a built-in governance structure that functions by way of a voting system, with the aim of creating ""a truly democratic government"" through which proposals can be made and weighed by nodes connected to the network.  The release of the white paper comes just over a year after the team founded Nuco, which grew out of Deloitte's internal blockchain efforts. Since then, the startup has inked several partnerships, including one with the TMX Group focused on creating a blockchain-powered natural gas exchange.

42379619,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHZZ,1500289272,GAW Miners CEO 'Will Plead Guilty' to Wire Fraud Charge,"The former CEO of defunct cryptocurrency mining company GAW Miners will plead guilty to a federal wire fraud charge later this week, according to individuals with knowledge of the case.  Josh Garza will appear in court on July 20 to face the charge, which is connected to an investigation conducted by the US Department of Justice through the US Attorney's Office in the District of Connecticut.  The case, which has been previously reported but not yet been subject to any public court filings, is distinct from that pursued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which sued Garza and GAW Miners for alleged securities fraud in late 2015. Its existence was confirmed in a defense filing from February.  Word that Garza would plead guilty to the charge emerged through statements by former customers who had spoken with federal investigators and later shared letters from the Department of Justice detailing the pending plea deal.  GAW Miners  , prior to its collapse, sold mining equipment and later began offering hosted services for hardware. The company subsequently moved to a cloud mining model, in which customers purchase hashing power and, effectively, a share of the mining operation's projects.  Yet allegations that the firm was operating a Ponzi scheme – selling more hashing power than it possessed – dogged the company, even as it moved to launch its own cryptocurrency, paycoin, which was controversially said to be backed by a $20 peg. GAW fell apart in the spring of 2015, ultimately leading to the filing of the SEC's lawsuit in December of that year.  A source with knowledge of the US Attorney's Office investigation confirmed the Wednesday court appearance and the forthcoming guilty plea. The office held an information session on Friday for former customers, though details of that call are not currently known.  It remains unclear how the guilty plea will affect the outcome of the SEC's case, which is still active according to court records. In June, US District Judge Jeffrey Meyer approved the agency's request for default judgment against GAW Miners and a second company, ZenMiners, for $11m.  Garza himself was not included in that default judgment, with the SEC saying at the time that its ""litigation continues.""

According to domestic media reports, Qiang spoke to local court representatives on projects related to big data and blockchain, a notable development given that he is leading a drive to digitize China's court system and reduce difficulties inherent in the enforcement of court decisions.  Among the topics reportedly discussed was a national credit system and asset registry, and how the lack of such a system can create issues when a plaintiff asks a court to enforce its decision in civil lawsuits.  Zhou, who is also president of the Supreme People's Court, reportedly commented:  ""Under the leadership of the party, we should beef up the use of information technology, and constantly improve the workflow of the national court system to overcome the difficulties in the enforcement of court decisions.""  Because the court doesn't know how much of which assets the defendant owns and where the assets are, the investigation process places a huge burden on China’s court system, the article explains.  To combat the issue, Guiyang's court system is partnering with other municipal agencies in applying big data and blockchain tech to build a social credit system. Launched and supported by Chen Gang, the former secretary of municipal party committee, the campaign puts Guiyang in a leading position among municipal governments in adopting blockchain in governance in China.

42379616,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHYJ,1500282033,Blockchain and Aid: It's About More Than Efficiency,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and the author of CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to CoinDesk subscribers.      One of the more disheartening aspects of aid – and there are many – is the knowledge that a large portion of the donations don’t get to where they should.  Apart from the layers of bureaucracy and transfer costs, there's the price of corruption, leading to leakage all along the chain. According to former UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon, as much as 30% of all development aid does not reach its destination.  In response, charitable organizations around the world are turning to blockchain technology. This shift will affect not only the delivery of the aid, it is also likely to have a significant impact on the beginning of the chain – the donations themselves.  First aid  This past week, a UK-based network of national and international aid agencies announced a trial with Disberse, a blockchain startup that aims to improve the transfer and traceability of donated funds.  Similar projects around the world are also under way. For instance, the World Food Programme recently trialled a blockchain-based method of distributing aid to refugees in Jordan, and earlier this year, the United Nations put out a call for blockchain startups to help it improve systems and develop new processes.  Several startups are working on ways to, among other things, expedite aid transfers and improve efficiency.  While the cost savings afforded by more efficient payment rails is a valuable advantage when it comes to donations, increasing attention is being paid to the transparency aspect of the technology. With the opacity of many distribution networks obfuscating the destination and quantities of contributed funds, a clearer vision of flows and impact would enable errors to be corrected and would hold participants more accountable.  With greater transparency comes greater trust that funds reach their intended recipients intact, which could encourage donors to give more.  Duty bound  This may not affect national budgets as much as individual pockets, but the impact at the government level could also be significant.  Mandated aid is increasingly coming under criticism as budgets are squeezed and as political sentiment turns inward. Greater accountability would enhance confidence that the funds are, for instance, alleviating world poverty, supporting stability and encouraging economic growth, which makes the concept easier to sell to constituents.  What's more, a shift to blockchain-based aid management would help the relevant organizations comply with the growing demands from politicians for greater transparency.  Given that such a move would be unlikely to require significant structural changes (unlike blockchain applications in finance, for example), it is possible that we will start to see the benefits in the short term.  Not only are trials likely to pick up as the aid use case becomes even more pressing, but legislators are likely to support the shift, as the risk scenario is relatively low compared to the regulatory benefits that increased transparency can bring.  So, the application of blockchain technology to charitable donations at both the individual and government level will not only make the flows more efficient, it will make them more reliable. It could also encourage more giving, or at least sidestep criticisms aimed at reducing budgets. And it can do so in the short term, without waiting for changes in legislation or financial structures.  Now that’s making a difference.

42379605,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8JHKT,1500264001,Bitcoin Meets DLT: Bitfury Releases 'Anchorable' Enterprise Blockchain,"Can Bitfury Group replicate its success in enterprise blockchain?  Long a leader in the lucrative bitcoin transaction processing sector, this has been an open question since the startup expanded its mission in a bid to win the trust – and business – of the world's biggest financial firms, governments and institutions. But it's also a question that now has new context, as Bitfury is today making public an enterprise blockchain initiative that has long been in development in the lab.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Bitfury Group is open-sourcing its first private blockchain framework, though it's one that offers a twist on the established idea. Called Exonum, the software aims to distinguish itself from DLT solutions by enabling users to secure data using the bitcoin blockchain.  As explained by Valery Vavilov, the CEO of Bitfury Group, despite uncertainty surrounding the protocol's technical roadmap, potential clients are actually becoming more aware of bitcoin's strength as the longest-running and most secure blockchain in the world.  Vavilov told CoinDesk:  ""What we observe is a lot of companies and institutions becoming more and more comfortable using the bitcoin blockchain. Those monitoring the system know bitcoin has been around for 8–9 years, that it hasn't been hacked and that it is offering security that doesn't exist anywhere else.""  Alexander Shevchenko, head of Exonum, further stressed how the notion of adding cryptographic data from private, permissioned blockchains into the public bitcoin blockchain would strengthen the assurances of even trusted parties and networks.  ""Anchoring brings security to the solution. Even if all the validators collude and want to go back in time and rewrite an Exonum blockchain, they can't do this,"" he said.  As evidence of interest, the software is also already in use in Bitfury Group's ongoing projects – including its land title trial in Georgia, as well as an undisclosed insurance effort.  For those who want to take a closer look, the source code for Exonum, written in Rust, is now available on GitHub. It will further be on display during an 11-city tour that begins today in the Netherlands, and that includes stops in Beijing, Boston and San Francisco.  Finding a niche  Still, anchoring the data isn't the only feature of Exonum.  Also touted is the auditability the software provides by enabling developers to create both ""full clients"", which validate the full history of the system's data, and ""light clients"" that use this record to verify data.  While that might sound like a slight feature, Shevchenko cited the infamous ""Heartbleed"" vulnerability, where a code issue in OpenSSL left as many as half a million websites exposed to exploits, as evidence of how Exonum's design could be a practical step in improving internet systems.  As profiled in The New York Times, one of the major issues cited in the aftermath was the length of time it would take for OpenSSL's code to be audited, as well as its lack of regular reviews.  By enabling light clients, Shevchenko contends more nodes can participate in Exonum networks, verifying and auditing data to avoid such issues.  ""Each client guarantees correct data storage, and thus overall, it's self-auditable. Everything controls its tiny part, and you get this full audit of the system,"" he said.  Vavilov continued:  ""This is really important. You can build a very strong blockchain system, you can anchor it on the bitcoin system, and if your client is compromised, auditing can help. It closes the full loop of the security of the system.""  Cost of use  Still, that's not to say public blockchains are without difficulties.  To this point, Bitfury Group went so far as to address concerns about the rising costs of bitcoin network use, and how they might impact Exonum networks that seek to tether transaction data to bitcoin.  While Bitfury didn't provide specific figures, representatives indicated that it believes this would represent a ""low cost"", owing to how copies of data are stored on the bitcoin network.  Should a consortium of users want to hash data, for example, they would simply set up a multi-signature wallet and then batch transaction timestamps onto the bitcoin blockchain, using the OP_RETURN feature in bitcoin's code.  As even very small fractions of bitcoin can store additional information, the company argues the costs could be affordable even if the Exonum system was running processing as many as 3,000 transactions per second.  ""The only thing we need to have is the bitcoin you need for the transaction fees,"" Shevchenko said.  DLT design  But what about users that don't want bitcoin's added security?  Another major feature of Exonum is a new, unnamed consensus algorithm it claims improves on the Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols most often used today in distributed ledger proofs-of-concept. While the company did not disclose many details about the system, it described it as more robust and capable of achieving greater uptime.  Elsewhere, Bitfury Group said Exonum's implementations can support features including multi-signature contracts, time locks and oracles.  However, in interview, Vavilov mostly kept his sights on the biggest picture for how these features will enable what he believes will be an important leap in the use of blockchain technology.  Evoking the classic comparison of private blockchains to intranets, Vavilov framed Exonum as a natural next step in bridging the gap between these systems, and public, open blockchains.  Vavilov said:  ""Years ago when the internet started, a lot of conservative organizations didn't start using internet, they created so-called intranets to become comfortable.
