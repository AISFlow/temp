However, where many have seen an altcoin that does not have many prospects, crypto analyst FieryTrading believes that the digital asset is giving investors an opportunity to get in for cheap. Cardano Can Break Out Of Parallel Channel In an analysis on the TradingView website, crypto analyst FieryTrading alludes to Cardano’s ability to break out and go on a massive bull run. The analysis draws from a previous analysis where the analyst had pointed out that the Cardano price had entered a parallel channel. Related Reading: Here’s How This Ethereum Whale Made $16 Million From A Single Trade This parallel channel emerged with the last cycle’s top going into the current cycle top with a line drawn from the last cycle’s bottom when the lockdown had sent crypto prices crashing. Despite the crypto analyst first pointing out this parallel channel back in 2023, they believe that it continues to remain valid, especially as the price continues to rtend low. Back then, the crypto analyst had predicted that the ADA price, if it were to break out of this parallel channel, could rise as high as as $35. This bullish expectation continues with the most recent analysis, albeit with a price adjustment. In the Wednesday analysis, FieryTrading notes that There is still the possibility for the altcoin’s price to reach the top of the channel. In this case, the price would fully complete the move toward $30. However, the crypto analyst’s chart carries a $25 target, which would be a 5,600% rally from its current level. Source: TradingView.com ADA Bears Maintain Control Despite the bullish outlook maintained by the crypto analyst, Cardano has succumbed to the bears. The price has dropped as low as $0.44 in the last day, indicating a 1.38% decline. On a wider timeframe, the ADA price looks even worse, with an almost 28% drop in one month. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Reclaim $4,000? Fragile Fundamentals Threaten To Send ETH Crashing However, despite this trend, the analyst still believes that investing in Cardano right now is a risk worth taking. FieryTrading refers to it as “the entry of a lifetime” that could guarantee good returns. Moreover, the analyst gives it a R/R (risk/reward) ratio of 116, which is a good number. For now, the ADA price is still struggling to hold up in the market. This is not helped by the decline in market sentiment, leading to a nasty 22% drop in its daily trading volume, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

This prediction is underpinned by a technical pattern on Solana’s chart—a bullish signal suggesting a potential reversal from bearish to bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Issuer Franklin Templeton Bullish On Solana (SOL), Foresees It As 3rd Largest Crypto Technical Insights Into SOL Potential $360 Rise According to the trader, CryptoJack on X, SOL has developed a “rounding bottom pattern” over an extended period, indicating it is on the brink of a significant breakout. Notably, the ’rounding bottom’ pattern, characterized by a gradual decline followed by a stabilizing trend and an upward breakout, is a classic bullish indicator in technical analysis. CryptoJack’s analysis points out that Solana is setting up for a significant uptick, aiming for a price target double its current value of approximately $146. Solana formed a rounding bottom pattern over many weeks and is primed for an explosion any moment now. I entered a Long position on $SOL and expect it to break ATHs this year! #Solana pic.twitter.com/ApUazaXXz5 — CryptoJack (@cryptojack) May 8, 2024 Not only does CryptoJack see a bright future for Solana, but other analysts, such as Altcoin Sherpa, also maintain a bullish stance, with projections of the token potentially surpassing $500 this year. This would represent a 300% increase from its current level, adding to the 589% growth it has already achieved year-to-date. Solana Challenges Ethereum While Solana has shown notable growth, some of its key metrics are also beginning to keep up the pace. Dan Smith, a senior research analyst at Blockworks, suggests that Solana could soon surpass Ethereum regarding transaction fees and capture Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Smith’s analysis of X highlights that Solana’s total economic value is nearing Ethereum’s, indicating its increasing relevance in the blockchain space. Solana will flip Ethereum in transaction fees + captured MEV this month, maybe even this week — Dan Smith (@smyyguy) May 7, 2024 Despite this competition, Ethereum maintains a significant lead in daily transaction fees and total value locked (TVL). In the last 24 hours, Ethereum generated over $2.75 million in fees, compared to Solana’s $1.49 million. Moreover, according to data from DeFillama, Ethereum’s TVL of over $53 billion dwarfs Solana’s $3.96 billion, representing just about 7.2% of Ethereum’s scale.

42390825,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdOgDB,1715203559,Kgothatso Ngako: How I Brought the Machankura Bitcoin App to Africa,"Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto dropped the white paper, one of the selling points of bitcoin has been, “You don’t need a bank. All you need is a smartphone.”  But what if you don’t have a smartphone?  This is the case for millions of people in Africa, which is why Kgothatso Ngako, a former software developer for Amazon, created the no-frills app called Machankura.  Kgothatso Ngako is speaker at this year's Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  Or maybe “app” is misleading, as it’s designed to work on simple phones that lack touchscreens or cameras or the bells and whistles of an iPhone. All you need is the ability to text. Using the Lightning Network, Machankura (slang for “money”) lets users send and receive bitcoin, with or without the internet.  This is something most of us take for granted. Consider a bitcoin wallet address: Usually it’s something that looks like “37LaxH5ihB5hZMXs72fofA8qzanipuWTF!” Typing it in manually would ruin your week. If you make a typo – and you’ll make a typo – your bitcoin is lost forever.  Thankfully we can copy and paste this monster using our laptop or smartphone. But without a smartphone? “The user may not have copy-and-paste-functionality,” says Ngako. “But bitcoin has these wonderful things called lightning addresses, which are like an email.” Now, users of Machankura can use bitcoin by just typing in normal-looking numbers and email addresses.  Before heading to Austin for Consensus, Ngako shares how Facebook did something smart that inspired Machankura, how its 15,000 users are spending bitcoin, and why the usage patterns in Africa are, in a sense, surprisingly similar to the patterns in the United States.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Before creating Machankura, you helped spread the word about bitcoin in Africa. How so exactly?  Kgothatso Ngako: I grew up in a township called Mamelodi. So the main barrier at the time was that a lot of the literature that explains Bitcoin is in English, right? But we have all these different African languages. So if somebody is intrigued by Bitcoin and they don't speak English, how would they get content to learn about it? So we started an organization called Exonumia. Its aim is to translate Bitcoin literature into African languages.  What Bitcoin literature did you use? I’m guessing the white paper?  Yeah, the white paper. A few simple ones. The email Satoshi sent out when Bitcoin version 0.1 released, and Hal Finney's reply to that. And, of course, the ""I Am Hodling"" post.  Classic.  And a few others, like Understanding Lightning Network and The History of Bitcoin and the Kenya Government. We're also translating a few books, like “The Blocksize War"" and ""21 lessons.""  And then eventually you launched Machankura. What was the goal?  So I’m trying to tell as many people as I can about Bitcoin with my translated articles, but I’m met with all these problems. A person may not have a smartphone. If they have a smartphone, they don’t have data bundles on it. If they do have interest or you give them a Wi-Fi hotspot, they don’t have enough space on their phone.  All of these problems are solved by having a service that a person does not have to install on their phone, and does not have to pay to use. So USSD [Unstructured Supplementary Service Data] is pretty much that. It’s like a website that is reverse-billed. Look at what Facebook does in developing countries, and I think Twitter did as well. Facebook is available for free, right? People on a mobile cellular connection can access Facebook without paying to access Facebook, because Facebook will settle the bill with the telecom at a later time. So most USSD interfaces work on a similar principle.  So what does that look like from the user’s experience, exactly? Especially if they’re not using a smartphone?  The user may not have copy-and-paste-functionality. But bitcoin has these wonderful things called lightning addresses, which are like an email, but for human-readable addresses. So mine is kgothatso@8333.mobi. I can share this with pretty much everyone. And alternatively, if someone has my number, 0739 383 807, they could also use that as my lighting address.  This is your phone number?  Yeah. So whether or not you have copy-and-paste functionality, if you have Bitcoin, you can type out either of the two. And then you can send me Bitcoin.  Amazing. How many users do you have, and where are they?  So we’re at almost 15,000 users now. We’re in a few countries — South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Malawi, and so on and so forth.  What are some of the things people are doing with it?  In South Africa, we have a concept called Stockpile. In other places it has other names. In Kenya they call it a “chama.” Effectively, it’s a tabletop accounting.  You come together as a group of people in somebody’s home, and you put money on the table. And if we all contributed an equal amount each month, we’re going to distribute it at the end of the year, or maybe buy groceries or whatever in bulk.  Interesting. So this is a way to nudge people to save money, through positive peer pressure and accountability?  Yes. And also it can be an economic “starter pack” for people in the group, to help them buy in bulk. This would satisfy a minimum purchase order that one person couldn’t do on their own, but the group can.  Am I right that instead of trying to get merchants to accept Bitcoin — which can be tricky — they’re mostly using bitcoin to purchase gift cards? And where are they spending it?  Yes. The top culprits are [internet] airtime, electricity, and groceries. And if you have a gift card for a grocery store in South Africa, you effectively have so much you can do with your bitcoin. You can pay your bills because some grocery stores let you pay your bills at the till, you could book a bus trip, you can even pay for a flight at the grocery store.  How many users, from what you can tell, are using Bitcoin as the primary way to pay their bills and get through life?  That's not a lot of users. That's a very small number of users from the total. And a lot of people are still working normal jobs that do not pay Bitcoin, right? So maybe it’s like 10% or 20% of the total users.  So what’s the main thing that people are using it for?  Exploration, I think. That's the major thing. A lot of people are saying, “Okay. I've heard about this Bitcoin thing. So how do I use it?"" So a lot of people create an account and then look around, and then you're like, ""Oh, okay. This person hasn't came back."" And then an all-time high comes around, and then that person is back again.  Honestly, that sounds very similar to how people use bitcoin in the U.S.  That’s exactly how it is.

""A rapid succession of nearly $2 billion of token unlocks during the next ten weeks could lower the market for altcoins,"" crypto analytics firm 10x Research noted in a Wednesday report.  Large token unlocks in crypto are usually bearish events, increasing supply by distributing assets that were previously locked up in vesting contracts to team members, organizations and early investors including venture capital firms.  Over the next two months, some $97 million of aptos {{APT}}, $79 million of starkware {{STRK}}, $94 million of arbitrum {{ARB}}, $53 million of Immutable X's {{IMX}}, $330 million of Avalanche's {{AVAX}}, $64 million of optimism {{OP}}, $28 million of PRIME, nearly $1 billion of sui {{SUI}}, $48 million of ethena (ENA), $171 million of Altlayer's ALT and $135 million of XAI tokens will be added to circulation, according to data compiled in the report.  ""Venture capital investors might be pressured to lock in recent gains, which could cap any upside performance of tokens with positive momentum, especially those where unlocks become available,"" the report said.  Not just altcoins facing selling pressure  Over $11 billion worth of bitcoin {{BTC}} will be distributed to creditors of crypto exchange Gemini's Earn program and long-defunct crypto marketplace Mt.

Amid upcoming supply events, one market observer suggested that the FTX repayments might offer some relief.  Pending bankruptcy court approval, some $14-$16 billion of funds in U.S. dollars could be paid out to creditors, and a good chunk of that may flow back to the crypto market, said Arthur Cheong, founder and chief investment officer of DeFiance Capital.

They discussed why memecoins had become the most profitable crypto trade this cycle and what the future might hold for the sector. Related Reading: Is The PEPE Dream Over? Dissecting The Factors Behind The Meme Coin’s Price Tumble Is There Value In A Memecoin? To begin with, Shin asked the traders whether there was substance in tokens based on memes, as it has been a big argument against them. To Ansem, people “think too hard” about the value of memecoins as projects. Moreover, he considers there’s no real gain in comparing whether other altcoins deserve or have more value than meme-based tokens. Why Memecoins Have Been 2024’s Most Profitable Crypto Trade: Ansem and Kelxyz Dive into the wild world of memecoins with @blknoiz06 and @kelxyz_! Discover how Ansem and Kel trade memecoins, 🎢 the risks and rewards, and their predictions for the future of memecoins 🚀 Plus,… pic.twitter.com/QovysNwAGP — Laura Shin (@laurashin) May 7, 2024 Ansem further explains that the crypto community is “very internet-centered,” with its members being “internet people” since crypto’s origin. As a result, the community is knowledgeable about the financial aspect but is also knees-deep in online culture. The trader believes “there’s value in memes and culture on the internet.” People in the community are “financializing” meme virality and realizing that it’s a possibility with crypto. Shin jokingly added that if this trend had been popular in 2016, the Drake meme creator would be a “bazillionaire” by now. The host seemingly referenced the still-popular meme that originated from Drake’s Hotline Bling music video. Agreeing with this argument, Kel asserted that, over the last 20 years, many trillion-dollar businesses have capitalized attention as their “winning trade businesses idea.” All these trillion-dollar businesses (…) facilitate directing attention and the way they’ve done that successfully has been, oftentimes, via memes. One could even make the argument that memes are the core engine of the entire Internet. The Risks And Criticisms Of Memecoin Mania To understand why memecoins have become the narrative of Q1 2024, the traders discussed the risks and arguments against the tokens. One of the biggest criticisms of memecoins is their high-risk nature. Because they are much smaller and not backed by institutional money, they can “be riskier” and “more easily go to 0.” Despite this, traders consider that many investors, especially new ones, find memecoins attractive because they have the potential to give 100x to 1000x returns. Moreover, losing money is not exclusive to memecoins. To illustrate his point, Ansem compared the people who bought Doge’s top to those who bought Bitcoin at $69,000 last cycle before it fell to $15,000. To the trader, how much a token can drop and investors buying the top is part of the general market dynamics instead of a characteristic of memecoins. However, he clarifies that there is better criticism of the sector. Ansem considers the shady behavior behind the projects’ teams a crucial issue to address. To him, a framework could prevent creators from controlling a large supply of the tokens and dumping them immediately after launch or rug-pulling investors. In the replies to the podcast, a user argued that the reason behind the recent frenzy is driven by “the Financial nihilism and the lack of liquidity that the youth has.” Adding that investors are “Buying a mere coin is like a lottery ticket.” It is worth mentioning that trading memecoins like lottery tickets is not an unseen phenomenon. On-chain research platform Lookonchain recently reported a trader seeing 4,906x gains in one day by precisely doing that. This guy won a 4,906x lottery ticket today, so lucky! He trades MEMEcoins like buying a lottery ticket, investing 0.1/0.2/0.3 $SOL for each #MEMEcoins. He invested 0.2 $SOL($30) in $AGORA today, then sold 2M $AGORA for $100K, with 959K $MILK(worth $47K) left. So he turned $30… pic.twitter.com/fnJDQnavfI — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 7, 2024 Per the report, the trader invests 0.1/0.2/0.3 SOL for each memecoin. Yesterday, the investor turned $30 into $147,000 by turning 0.2 SOL into 2 million AGORA. What’s In Memecoins’ Future? When asked what is in store for the sector, both traders concurred that memecoins are not going away. To Ansem, the community behavior towards memecoins is like that of NFTs last cycle. With NFTs, investors felt like they were part of a community and were working towards developing it. The shared experience of relating is another crucial factor in the craze of meme-based tokens, as seen in communities of tokens like Dogwifhat (WIF). Adding to that idea, Kel asserted that “all memes will become coins” in the next ten years. Moreover, the trader wouldn’t be surprised if “the creation of a meme was natively financialized” by then, as the trend of financialization of things continues to increase. Ultimately, he believes the sector is in the early stages of this trend as the community tries to “capture the moment of a meme” and capitalize on it now that crypto has made financialization “trivial from a tech perspective.” Related Reading: Dogecoin on the Rise: Over 5 Million Wallets Now Profitable As Potential Surge Looms Total crpto market is at $2.22 trillion on the weekly chart.

42418283,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd85l,1715201163,The FCC’s Net Neutrality Ruling Is Good News for Web3 Startups,"Last month’s FCC vote to restore net neutrality rules is a welcome example of forward-looking, innovation-friendly regulation. Rules aimed at ensuring an open internet are a model for the kind of regulation that champions innovation in the digital era and exemplifies core American values. Other regulators would do well to take note.  Opponents of net neutrality like to argue that rules guaranteeing equal access aren’t necessary (go back and watch John Oliver’s reports for an excellent refresher). They claim the old rules were perfectly suited for oversight of the modern internet, even though those rules were written for old-school telephone service.  Sarah Aberg is the General Counsel at Nova Labs, a pioneer in decentralized wireless networks and the creators of Helium Mobile.  While some regulators seem stuck in the 1930s and 40s (sound familiar?), the FCC is showing that it understands that 21st century technologies require 21st century regulations. The FCC’s net neutrality rule encourages innovation opportunities here in the U.S. because it means new technologies, applications, and services – some running on blockchain, some not – can join the marketplace and participate in fair competition for consumer attention.  It wasn’t always the case that you could choose your own phone, or design and run new applications on the nation’s telecom network. Before 1968, only a Western Electric phone could be plugged into a phone line because the incumbents argued that other devices could damage the network. It would be almost another 20 years before the government forced incumbents to open the network to competitive providers.  The development of packet-switching protocols – like TCP/IP, which makes the modern Internet possible – took this evolution a giant step further. Today, a voice call is just a set of data packets that the network is tasked with delivering from the device where it originates to the device where it terminates. Same for a web page, a YouTube video or a ChatGPT session. These are all just packets of data that travel over the network. And net neutrality says that the network providers can’t discriminate by prioritizing sending data packets from some commercial providers over others.  This principle has made possible a long list of home-grown internet applications that live at the endpoints and run on the network. Many, like YouTube and Netflix, or Zoom and Facetime, are core components of American (and global) social and work life. Without net neutrality regulations, network providers could have stopped Zoom or Facetime from ever coming into being, favor their own services over any potential new entrants, and pick and choose who they compete with, if you can even call that competition.  Fair regulations create a sandbox for creative ideas to flourish and test themselves in the market. Blockchain-based solutions are ripe for creative innovation designed on the modern internet and with the potential to change much more than modern finance. But we need fair, clear, and smart regulations to do so in the US.  That’s what net neutrality does for innovators seeking to operate on the network. Think about generative AI or the blockchain-enabled affordable phone service offered by my company, Helium Mobile. Capabilities like these are the champions – and consequence – of the original intent of the Internet and net neutrality principles. Open access to the network is critical for their development and healthy competition.  Net neutrality guardrails protect new competitors like Helium Mobile from unfair network practices. Helium’s decentralized system of internet-connected hotspots creates a new dynamic network for wireless connectivity that challenges conventional wisdom about how phone networks are built and owned. Net neutrality makes it possible for us to innovate and compete in the wireless space with some of the most powerful companies in the world, including some of the network providers themselves.  Decentralized ownership of public infrastructure networks (DePIN) through token rewards for building and maintaining the network are among the myriad innovations made possible by blockchain. In our case, that’s wireless communications.  DePIN is uniquely situated to solve sticky problems like providing sustainable connectivity to rural and underserved communities, by empowering the members of those communities to create their own wireless infrastructure, tailored to their own use. However, the mere fact that DePIN involves blockchain and tokens has swamped it in a morass of regulatory uncertainty created by the enforcement-first approach taken by some other federal agencies. That uncertainty stifles competition, stifles innovation in America, and stifles opportunity for consumers.  The FCC has provided a model for what a smart regulatory approach looks like. By accounting for the evolution and development of the industry and markets it regulates, the regulator’s approach enhances the scale and scope of future innovation as much as possible consistent with essential protections for consumers and critical infrastructure.  Mirroring the FCC’s approach, rather than raising the drawbridge, regulators should engage with innovating DePIN projects to learn about the technology, innovation potential, and emerging capabilities that can usher infrastructure into the digital era and change the way consumers interact with and own that infrastructure. We can simultaneously protect consumers from undue harm and make possible the kinds of innovations that will give consumers choice in the market. That philosophy is one that will benefit U.S. consumers, society, and the economy in the next phase of the digital era.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sarah Aberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/08/the-fccs-net-neutrality-ruling-is-good-news-for-web3-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d40e02a47675f7a55ddbd38963206454ade83359-2304x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418289,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd87p,1715199457,House Votes to Erase SEC Crypto Policy While President Biden Vows Veto,"The House resolution starts a formal process to kill the Securities and Exchange Commission's controversial accounting policy on crypto custody.  President Joe Biden said he'll veto the resolution if it reaches his desk for approval.  The U.S. House of Representatives voted Wednesday to approve a resolution rejecting Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cryptocurrency accounting guidance that the industry said has deterred banks from handling crypto customers, but President Joe Biden is already promising he'll veto the effort if it hits his desk.  The SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 – also known as SAB 121 – has been a focus of criticism from digital assets businesses and Republican lawmakers since its arrival. The bulletin was meant to clarify accounting treatment for crypto assets, directing a bank holding customer's digital tokens should do so on its own balance sheet, potentially incurring massive capital expenses. But the policy guidance has since been found in one government review to have been handled badly, though the agency and Chair Gary Gensler have defended it.  ""Gary Gensler, in his jihad against digital assets, used what is supposed to be mundane staff accounting guidance to essentially freeze out large publicly traded banks from taking custody of digital assets,"" said Rep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.), the effort's sponsor, in a Wednesday interview with CoinDesk. And the SEC didn't consult with the banking regulators about it, Flood pointed out, arguing that Gensler ""doesn't have any business in the banking world.""  The White House considers the policy worth defending with a veto, according to a statement from Biden.  ""SAB 121 was issued in response to demonstrated technological, legal, and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers,"" Biden said in a Wednesday statement, saying he ""strongly opposes"" disrupting the SEC's work on this.  Despite that, the House vote went strongly in favor of the resolution – including support from 21 Democrats who weren't moved by Biden's threat.  The SEC's accounting policy ""made a joke of the rulemaking process and ignored other regulatory agencies,"" Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a speech on the House floor earlier on Wednesday, calling SAB 121 ""a massive deviation for how highly regulated banks are traditionally required to treat assets on behalf of their customers.""  But a key House Democrat thought the resolution went too far.  ""This bill takes a sledgehammer to fix an issue that may merely need a scalpel, and it does so because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not only interested in doing the bidding of special interest groups, they are also interested in attacking and undermining the SEC in every possible way,"" said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on McHenry's committee.  SAB 121 was originally introduced as staff guidance, but a subsequent Government Accountability Office (GAO) review determined that the agency should have handled it as a rule, with full public comments and submission to Congress.  Read More: U.S. Lawmakers Seek to Overturn SEC's Crypto Accounting Policy  Rep. Flood introduced the resolution to formally disapprove of the regulator's guidance alongside two Democrats, and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) has been pushing for a matching resolution in the Senate, which would be needed before the joint resolution could make it to Biden's desk.  When an agency rule is reversed under the Congressional Review Act, it's not only erased, but anything similar is forever blocked from future implementation. Waters argued that SAB 121 – apart from the controversial custody component – also provided guidance on crypto disclosures that are necessary and would be threatened if Congress overturns the policy, and Biden echoed the concern about policies that would be blocked.  ""By virtue of invoking the Congressional Review Act, it could also inappropriately constrain the SEC’s ability to ensure appropriate guardrails and address future issues related to crypto-assets including financial stability,"" Biden said. ""Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty.""  Flood called it ""disappointing"" that the president would approve the improper use of a bulletin to do the work of a full-fledged federal rulemaking. He said he and his allies will ""look for every single vehicle between now and the end of the year that will go to the president's desk and add this language in there.""

Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, is also confident about the meme coin’s potential in this market cycle. He suggested that the meme coin is in a good position to lead this season.

The First Step Is Hitting A New All-Time High (ATH) While Shiba Inu undoubtedly looks primed to make big moves in this bull run, the first step will be for the meme coin to rise above its current all-time high of $0.00008845, as it is currently 70% down from that price level. Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lucie has earlier predicted that the meme coin could hit a new ATH before or shortly after the Bitcoin Halving. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Reclaim $4,000? Fragile Fundamentals Threaten To Send ETH Crashing Crypto analyst and trader Xanrox also hinted that SHIB may hit a new ATH of $0.00008854 by July. Shiba Inu rising to a new ATH by then could set the pace for it to hit other bullish price predictions that crypto analysts have made for the meme coin. Meanwhile, it is also worth mentioning that Shiba could soon come close to its current ATH with Ali Martinez highlighting a bull flag on Shiba Inu’s chart which he belives could send the meme coin to $0.000072323. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.0000227, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418276,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd82f,1715195865,Crypto Is an Election Issue This Year. Is That a Good Thing?,"An online survey conducted by blockchain conglomerate Digital Currency Group found that more than 20% of voters in several swing states consider crypto to be a key issue in the upcoming U.S. elections. The poll is the latest sign that crypto is increasingly becoming an electoral issue, with more and more politicians on both sides of the issue willing to condone or condemn crypto.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This is in marked contrast to the last presidential election cycle, before the days of so-called single-issue voters like Ryan Selkis (who is speaking at Consensus this May) took up the charge of trying to find and support pro-crypto pols.  Crypto is also on the minds of candidates themselves. Former President Donald Trump has done an about-face on his earlier criticisms of crypto, seemingly because he sees the industry as a potentially powerful (and lucrative) ally. Outsider candidate Robert F. Kennedy has also become a vocal supporter of Bitcoin (RFK will also be speaking at Consensus this May).  Interestingly, crypto seems to be of particular importance in key battleground states including Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to an online Harris Poll survey of over 1,000 voters in each state commissioned by DCG in early April. One-third of voters with ""crypto-positive"" views think politicians should make regulating crypto a priority.  “This data shows crypto is top of mind for voters in swing Senate states and that a pro-crypto position is a net positive for policymakers and candidates,” said Julie Stitzel, senior vice president of policy at DCG in a statement. “The poll also underscores a strong desire for policymakers to establish reasonable regulations that protect consumers without stifling innovation.”  The data comes at a time when crypto companies and influential advocates have become increasingly vocal about the political x-risks of crypto. In October, for instance, potential voters helped raise over $2 million for the Coinbase-led nonprofit Stand With Crypto that aims to influence state and federal crypto policy.  See also: Crypto Seeks to Make Mark on U.S. Elections  The super PAC reportedly is focusing attention on ousting or influencing crypto skeptics like Senator Sherrod Brown, who is facing a tight reelection in Ohio. Fairshake, perhaps the largest crypto super PAC, said it is dedicating resources in four Senate races this year: primaries in Maryland, Michigan, Montana and the aforementioned Ohio.  Potential blowback?  While fighting for what you believe in is certainly a noble cause, the general public is often grossed out and disconcerted by overt flows of money into politics. This may be especially true for crypto following the FTX scandal, which saw Sam Bankman-Fried funding at least one-in-three members of Congress and funneled money into races across the country (with mixed results).  There is also never a guarantee that once in office, politicians will do or support what they said on the campaign trail. Take Gary Gensler, who although wasn’t elected was expected to be a more lenient head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) because of his experience teaching about the industry at MIT.

The announcement has sparked a substantial surge in the exchange’s native token, FTT, which recorded an uptrend of 52% over the past seven days, reaching a monthly high of $2.29 during Wednesday’s early trading session. FTX Unveils Debt Repayment Strategy FTX estimates its outstanding debts to creditors to be approximately $11.2 billion, as revealed in the reorganization plan published late Tuesday. The company has disclosed that it possesses between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion, which it intends to distribute among the creditors. Under the proposed plan, customers with $50,000 or less claims will receive approximately 118% of the allowed claim amount. This compensation is slated to be disbursed to around 98% of the creditors, relieving FTX customers who have experienced locked funds since the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Suffers Massive Outflows Amid Crypto Market Uncertainty, Tops $284 Million FTX stated in a press release on Wednesday that the company could not utilize the appreciation of the missing tokens during the Chapter 11 cases. Instead, FTX had to identify other recoverable sources of value to repay creditors. Following the departure of founder Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX appointed John Ray III as CEO. Ray, speaking on the matter in November 2022, expressed his astonishment at the “complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information” witnessed at FTX. Ray further stated in the press release on Wednesday: We are pleased to be in a position to propose a Chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors. FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, faced legal consequences, being convicted on seven criminal counts, including charges related to embezzling billions of dollars from FTX’s customers. Bankman-Fried was subsequently sentenced to 25 years in prison. FTT Bulls Eyeing $2.55 For Potential Breakout Continuation As of the latest update, the price of FTT has corrected to $2.050 after reaching its monthly high. This breakout occurred after consolidation between the $1.17 and $1.48 levels. At the current price level, FTT faces a significant resistance at $2.169, which has led to the ongoing correction. If FTT sustains its bullish momentum, the next resistance level to watch is $2.55 in the token’s daily chart. A successful breakthrough of this level could potentially lead to a retest of the $3 mark, which has not been revisited since January. Related Reading: Forget The Price Dip: Ethereum Network Activity Hints At Imminent Takeoff On the other hand, if the price experiences a further correction, FTT bulls should closely monitor the $1.95 and $1.765 levels, as they serve as crucial support levels.

Cardano May Be Showing A Good Buying Opportunity According To RSI In a new post on X, Santiment discussed how the top assets in the cryptocurrency sector have been performing regarding the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI here refers to a technical analysis (TA) indicator that tracks the velocity and magnitude of recent changes in any given commodity’s price. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Move $21 Million Worth Of Coins – Here Are The Destinations This momentum oscillator is generally used to judge whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued right now. The indicator displays its value on a scale that runs from zero to one hundred. When the RSI is above 70, the corresponding asset may be considered overbought and due for correction. On the other hand, the metric being below 30 implies potential oversold status, with a probable price rebound. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the 1-day RSI for some of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap: The data for the 1-day RSI across some of the top coins in the sector | Source: Santiment on X As the above graph shows, Cardano currently has the lowest 1-day RSI value out of these top cryptocurrencies at around 32.4. Although the asset isn’t yet inside the actual underpriced zone, this value that’s close enough could still suggest that ADA is providing a good entry point right now. As Santiment points out, most of the top assets appear to provide a slight buying opportunity. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently the lowest one next to ADA, with an RSI value of 38.4. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have prices slightly undervalued to a similar degree, as their RSI values are around the 41 mark. Dogecoin (DOGE) is more or less neutral at the moment, as the metric is just under 50 for the memecoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Reach Escape Velocity? Analyst Makes The Case Toncoin (TON) appears to be the riskiest buyout of these top assets if RSI is anything to go by, as the metric stands at 55.1 currently (note that the chart has wrongly marked TON as ETH, as Santiment has admitted in a reply to a user under the post). Nonetheless, this value is still quite close to the neutral level of 50. It now remains to be seen how the Cardano price develops from here, given that the RSI has flagged it as perhaps the most undervalued of the top coins. ADA Price Cardano hasn’t been able to recover from last month’s crash so far. All attempts at a surge have failed, with the coin slumping back to consolidation around the current $0.44 level.

In this week's issue of The Protocol, we explain the blockchain industry's newest fundraising method, which explicitly leans on its decentralizing impact.  ALSO:  Devious technique known as ""address poisoning"" leads to $68M exploit  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Polyhedra, MetaMask, MicroStrategy, Aave, JPMorgan, Swift  Nearly $50 million of blockchain project fundraisings: Lava, Lagrange, Galaxis, Botanix, ZKM  Explainer on Ethereum's 'EIP-3074' proposal to make crypto wallets simpler to use (and Vitalik Buterin's just-proposed ""alternative"")  Network news  Tiered node sales, like this one from Sophon, mean that the price goes up, the longer buyers wait (Sophon/modified by CoinDesk using PhotoMosh)  NODES FOR SALE: It's the blockchain industry's latest innovation – not in technology, but in how to round up cash from investors. ""Node sales"" involve selling blockchain nodes directly to investors – a process that brings in quick cash while ostensibly giving projects an easy path to decentralization. Still a relatively new phenomenon in fast-moving crypto, they are becoming more common: Aethir, a decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure provider, disclosed last week that it had distributed more than 73,000 node licenses valued at over 41,000 ETH ($126 million). Other blockchain projects raising funds via node sales include CARV, XAI Games and Powerloom. The latest to come to market is Sophon, an entertainment-focused blockchain ecosystem based on zkSync technology, relying on Celestia for data. The project attracted more than $60 million in a node sale over the past week, even though its founders are semi-anonymous. Certain mechanics of the sales appear designed to drive the fear of missing out, or FOMO – such as a system of tiering, where the price goes higher as more nodes are sold, and the use of exclusive whitelists that reserve early spots for certain users. ""Buyers hope to get high quality projects,"" says Calvin Chu, a former Binance researcher who helped start Impossible Finance, which has facilitated some of the sales. As with many crypto-related investments, buyers also hope for juicy yields in the forms of token rewards, and possibly to qualify for eventual token airdrops.  'ADDRESS POISONING?' A cryptocurrency user has lost $68 million worth of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) after falling victim to a type of exploit known as ""address poisoning,"" according to blockchain security firm CertiK. As reported by CoinDesk's Oliver Knight, ""Address poisoning is a technique that involves tricking the victim into sending a legitimate transaction to the wrong wallet address by mimicking the first and last six characters of the true wallet address and depending on the sender to miss the discrepancy in the intervening characters. Wallet addresses can be as long as 42 characters."" In this case, the exploiter mimicked a 0.05 ether (ETH) transaction before receiving 1,155 wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) from the victim.  STILL WHIRLING. A hacker that stole $125 million from Poloniex's hot wallets in November has sent 1,100 ether (ETH) to sanctioned coin mixer Tornado Cash, according to blockchain data. The developers of Tornado Cash, a blockchain protocol that can be used to obscure the origin and destination of cryptocurrency transfers, are facing charges by U.S. authorities that they conspired to commit money laundering, even though they claim all they really did was write code.  Former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski agreed to pay $1.9 million to settle claims brought against him by former customers of Voyager Digital, a cryptocurrency lender.. This was despite a viral joke at his retired teammate Tom Brady's expense where ""Gronk,"" as the National Football League star is known, was portrayed as having dodged crypto troubles.  A back-and-forth broke out on X over the blockchain project Sui's token supply.

Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.  Polyhedra co-founder and CTO Tiancheng Xie (Polyhedra)  1. Polyhedra Network launched an open-source ZK proof system, Expander, ""that can generate proofs nearly 2x faster than alternatives while enhancing security and efficiency of ZK proof process,"" according to the team. According to a blog post, ""Expander can prove 4,500 Keccak-f permutations per second on an Apple M3 Max Machine."" Keccak-256 is a ""cryptographic hash function standardized by NIST in the secure hash algorithm 3 (SHA-3) and is the hash function used by the Ethereum blockchain,"" according to the post. The new proof system builds on Polyhedra's Libra paper, lead-authored by Polyhedra co-founder and CTO Tiancheng Xie.  2. MetaMask, the most popular crypto wallet for Ethereum, is rolling out a new feature this week designed to help users avoid the consequences of maximal extractable value, or MEV. The optional new feature, called Smart Transactions, will allow users to submit transactions to a ""virtual mempool"" before they are officially cemented on-chain. According to Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, the virtual mempool will protect against certain kinds ofMEV strategies, and it will run behind-the-scenes simulations of transactions to help users get lower fees.  3. MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, unveiled plans to develop a decentralized identity service using Ordinals inscriptions. The goal of ""MicroStrategy Orange"" is to provide ""trustless, tamper-proof and long-lived"" decentralized identities using the Bitcoin blockchain, founder Michael Saylor said at the company's Bitcoin For Corporations conference on Wednesday.  4. Aave Labs, the main developer behind Aave, a DeFi protocol, proposed to develop its ""V4"" as part of a wider grant proposal, involving community feedback and testing, with a timeline starting this quarter and leading to a full release by mid-2024. ""Aave V4 would be built with a completely new architecture with an efficient and modular design, while minimizing the impact on third-party integrators,"" the proposal reads. A key change would be the introduction of a ""unified liquidity layer"" and a new oracle design with Chainlink.  5. Citi, JPMorgan, Mastercard, Swift and Deloitte are among major companies with an interest in financial services teaming up to explore sharing ledger technology by simulating multiasset transactions in U.S. dollars. The research project, titled Regulated Settlement Network (RSN) proof-of-concept (PoC), will explore the potential of bringing commercial-bank money, wholesale central-bank money and securities such as U.S. Treasuries and investment-grade debt to a common regulated venue, according to a statement shared with CoinDesk. The New York Innovation Center of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will act as a technical observer.  Ethereum Developers Target Ease of Crypto Wallets With 'EIP-3074'  Screengrab from the EIP-3074 proposal (Ethereum.org, modified by CoinDesk using PhotoMosh)  As blockchain teams strive for the holy grail of mainstream adoption, making crypto wallets easier to use is suddenly at the top of the agenda.  Ethereum developers have been moving along with their discussions and inclusions of certain Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for the blockchain’s next big hard fork, Pectra.  One of the proposals that has drawn both support and concern from the Ethereum community is EIP-3074, a code change that is supposed to improve the user experience with wallets on the blockchain.  Paradigm Chief Technology Officer Georgios Konstatonopolous said on X that EIP-3074 “is a big deal. Wallet UX will 10x.”  Click here for the full story by Margaux Nijkerk  P.S. THIS JUST IN: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed an ""EIP-3074 alternative"" called EIP-7702.

Peter Thiel's Founders Fund led a $13.2 million seed funding round into Lagrange Labs, a cryptography startup based on Ethereum's EigenLayerrestaking platform.  Galaxis, a Singapore-based Web3 platform, has raised $10 million from funders including Chainlink, Ethereum Name Services (ENS), Rarestone Capital, Taisu Ventures and ENS co-founder Nick Johnson.  Bitcoin development startup Botanix Labs said it raised $8.5 million toward building of layer-2 network Spiderchain, taking its total backing to $11.5 million after a $3 million pre-seed round last year.  ZKM, described as a ""general-purpose zkVM seeking to unite the fragmented Web3 universe"" announced it has completed a $5 million pre-A funding round led by OKX ventures, and is preparing to launch a Bitcoin layer 2 with native asset security and yield.

The financial analyst has predicted that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could surge massively, doubling its current price to reach $150,000 during the 2024 crypto market cycle. Bitcoin Could Go Parabolic In 2024 During a recent interview on Squawk Box, CNBC on May 7, Lee doubled down on his previous Bitcoin forecast, expressing strong confidence that the pioneering cryptocurrency would experience a dramatic surge before the end of 2024. He predicts that Bitcoin, currently priced at $62,371, according to CoinMarketCap, will exceed previous all-time highs and reach $150,000. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Reclaim $4,000? Fragile Fundamentals Threaten To Send ETH Crashing The Fundstrat CEO disclosed earlier in April in an interview with CNBC Television, that “Bitcoin would definitely make new all-time highs this year,” predicting that the cryptocurrency could surge to $150,000 in 2024, and $500,000 long term. He highlighted that the strong demand for BTC has been fueling its price increase. Furthermore, the integration of the Rune Protocol, a new token standard for issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network, has also bolstered the blockchain’s network. Lee’s ambitious forecast of Bitcoin comes at a time when the market has been experiencing significant volatility and periods of fluctuations. Bitcoin previously surged to an all-time high above $73,000 in March, propelled by the hype and demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, after Bitcoin halving on April 20, which many analysts and investors believed would trigger another price rally, BTC witnessed a dramatic drop, falling as low as $57,000 at some point in May. Despite the upheaval in the broader crypto market, Lee remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term value. His unwavering confidence in the cryptocurrency’s robust price fundamentals is reflected in his expectations of a potential price surge to or even exceeding half a million in the coming years. Factors Point To Upward Momentum After FED Rate Cut While Lee made his bullish projections about Bitcoin, he also discussed the present inflationary situation and economic conditions of the United States. According to the Fundstrat CEO, inflation in the US is set to cool off dramatically, potentially triggering an upward momentum for Bitcoin if this happens. Related Reading: Here’s How This Ethereum Whale Made $16 Million From A Single Trade The CEO disclosed that the Federal Reserve (FED) currently has more leeway to cut rates, citing their impacts on the country’s banking balance sheet. Although he refrained from specifying a precise timeline for the drop in the US inflation rate, Lee indicated that it could potentially occur by the second half of 2024. Overall, the Fundstrat CEO has maintained an optimistic outlook for inflationary pressures in the US, with Bitcoin typically serving as a hedge against inflation and a store of value during these periods of economic uncertainty.

42418281,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd83h,1715184673,Restaking Is Hot in Ethereum and Entering Solana. Should We Worry?,"If you're reading this ensconced in a traditional finance career, you know the deal: If money is idle, make it do more work.  Are you, for instance, a broker with collateral quietly sitting in a vault? That's boring! Do that rehypothecation thing! Use it to finance your own trades! (The Lehman Brothers–fomented global financial crisis of 2008 helps illustrate what can go wrong.)  The cryptocurrency biz has invented its own version of rehypothecation, called something else, of course: restaking. It caught fire on Ethereum (ETH) with the help of EigenLayer (which is inching toward an airdrop of its EIGEN token).  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  As a proof-of-stake blockchain, Ethereum's plumbing relies on folks called validators ""staking"" their ETH to the network. Validators are rewarded for pledging their assets, given something akin to interest payments. But that ETH is locked up. Sitting idle. Financial engineers hate that, right?  With restaking, that locked-up ETH is kinda sorta freed up via the creation of a derivative, and the owner of that ETH can earn a bit more money. (So, too, can the restaking platform like EigenLayer that enables this.)  Many billions of dollars of ETH are now restaked. CoinDesk's Danny Nelson just reported that several firms are trying to bring restaking to Solana (SOL), including a titan of that blockchain: Jito (JTO).  Read more: What Is Restaking?  Not everyone is keen on the idea. To proponents, restaking can help make Solana startups' blockchain-powered apps more secure. See Nelson's story for some discussion of that. Critics fret over the systemic risks (if something goes wrong, the entanglements can get ugly real quick, as shown in 2008).  Meanwhile, ETH restakers are presumably happily earning more than the current Ethereum staking yield (3.13%, according to CESR).  It's all fun until it isn't.  MetaMask vs. MEV  Confession time: I'm both really curious about MEV (aka maximal extractable value) and really befuddled by it.  In the broadest terms, MEV involves validators tinkering with the order they add transactions to a blockchain to maximize their profit. To my (possibly naive?) eye, some of it resembles arbitrage. Some looks like front-running clients' trades in TradFi.  As you can imagine, some people love it (they're making money, either by engaging in MEV or by building tools that enable it or fight it or whatever it) and some hate it (they're getting sandwiched).  Anyway, MetaMask, the widely popular Ethereum wallet, is introducing a new feature designed to protect MetaMask users from MEV. It reminds me of dark pools in TradFi: those stock trading platforms that obscure details of orders until they're executed, to protect from those who want to move prices against the placers of larger orders.  Crypto has MEV, TradFi has high-frequency traders. There is (almost?) nothing new in the world of money.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Nick Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/08/restaking-is-hot-in-ethereum-and-entering-solana-should-we-worry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3dd1bd98fc413af092fc3a1659f1f1600a56487-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27241657,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607041,1715184021,Crypto Expert Weighs In On ETH/BTC Pair’s Recent Decline,"Amid turbulence surrounding the crypto market, popular founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Into The Cryptoverse Benjamin Cowen has taken the spotlight to shed his insights on the recent downtrend observed in the Ethereum/Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) pair. Cowen’s views examine the complex relationship between Ethereum and Bitcoin pricing and the potential for further downside risk. According to Benjamin Cowen, the ETH/BTC pair is currently on the downside, and the last 2 times that the pair declined, ETHUSD witnessed a steep decline of around 70%. Given that the crypto community has been eagerly anticipating an Altcoin season for the past 2.5 years, Cowen thinks it is crucial to warn the community that there is still a possibility of a downward movement. ETH/BTC Pair Rejected By The Bull Market Band Cowen has also confirmed that ETH/BTC is presently being rejected by the bull market support band, which he previously predicted days back due to a price pump. “I would expect it (ETH/BTC) to be rejected by the bull market support band, at least when looking at weekly closes ($0.053-$0.054),” he stated. He further noted that the pump appears to be mirroring the last cycle of rate cuts right before summer capitulation. Related Reading: Cracking the Crypto Code: ETH/BTC Signals The Next Altcoin Explosion – Here’s How Following the launch of Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Cowen mentioned that ETH/BTC saw a sharp rally. The analyst affirms that the rally was probably similar to the trend of the previous bull cycle, ushering in new lows. Furthermore, Cowen stated that there has been an unquestionable macro downtrend since November 2021, particularly following the merger of the ETH/BTC pair. However, it is also evident that the market did not decrease abruptly. As a result, investors held ETH instead of BTC all the way down from 0.085 to 0.048 because of the multiple lower highs, giving the impression that it was holding up quite well. Prior to the Bitcoin Halving, Cowen predicted that the bull market support band would reject ETH/BTC, at least when considering weekly closes ($0.053-$0.054), should there be a rebound after the Halving, similar to that witnessed with BTC spot ETF launch. Regardless of what occurs, the expert is confident that ETH/BTC will reach between $0.03 and $0.04 by this summer. Heightened Divergence Between Ethereum And Bitcoin Being the two leading cryptocurrency assets, there is great interest surrounding Ethereum and Bitcoin. However, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted a shift in performance between both digital assets. Related Reading: Ethereum Trouncing Bitcoin, ETH/BTC Ratio Bouncing Higher: Will This Trend Continue? According to the firm, the performance of Ethereum and Bitcoin has been increasingly diverging so far in the 2023–2024 cycle. This is due to poorer performance in ETH price, which is explained by a generally weaker trend in capital rotation. In addition, this is evident when particularly compared to preceding cycles and all-time highs.

42418291,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd8Cz,1715184000,What Technical Analysis Tells Us About the Bitcoin Market,"Technical analysis has long been relied upon for investing in cryptocurrencies. The discipline lends itself well to the highly-volatile asset class, not only because cryptocurrencies are momentum-driven, but also because they are generally subject to less headline risk than equities, which can muddy supply/demand dynamics.  Investors can better understand the risk-reward dynamics of the cryptocurrency market by combining momentum indicators and overbought/oversold measures with the identification of key support and resistance levels. Investors can source relative strength inputs to help spot opportunities.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Real-time analysis of the chart of bitcoin shows that, as of early-May 2024, there was a loss of intermediate-term momentum per momentum indicators like the MACD (Moving-Average-Convergence-Divergence), which has a bearish crossover. The loss of momentum suggests that bitcoin is in a corrective phase that should persist for at least another few weeks. Downside risk can be framed by the next support on the chart, near $51,500, which is defined by a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the uptrend off the 2022 low and bolstered by a rising 200-day moving average.  The loss of momentum should be viewed within a long-term bullish framework. Bitcoin broke out to new all-time highs in March 2024. The breakout extended bitcoin’s secular uptrend with implications for the coming months, if not years. This suggests that, once there are signs that a corrective low is in place, the risk/reward ratio will be more favorable for investors.  The weekly stochastic oscillator, which is a gauge of overbought and oversold conditions, is a useful tool to help identify when a corrective low has been established. For now, the stochastics have room to oversold territory (20%), increasing the likelihood that a deeper pullback in price will happen before the long-term uptrend resumes. An upturn in the weekly stochastics from oversold territory would be a positive short-term technical catalyst for bitcoin, irrespective of the level at which it occurs.  A relative strength input that is useful for identifying potential winners and losers in the cryptocurrency market is a Relative Rotation Graph®, or RRG. The RRG shows altcoin rotation normalized relative to bitcoin, which is at the crosshairs of the graph. There is an inherent clockwise rotation by the altcoins in the RRG, helping us determine when certain altcoins are rotating into or out of favor versus bitcoin.  Most altcoins in the graph point lower and to the left, which reflects bitcoin’s strong position in the market, particularly during a corrective phase which sometimes sees a flight to safety (in relative terms). We would expect most altcoins in the lower left portion of the graph to eventually rotate into favor as more risk-on positioning resurfaces in a sign that the corrective phase has matured.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Katie Stockton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/08/what-technical-analysis-tells-us-about-the-bitcoin-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79b66debdb1ef9d21d0af79dfe789940086e5b86-6240x4160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42418290,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd8Av,1715184000,Stablecoin Surge: Tether's Headroom for Growth,"The market cap for stablecoins has grown considerably in the past six months, increasing from $122 billion in October 2023 to $157 billion in April 2024. Among stablecoin providers, Tether (USDT) has captured a significant market share, exceeding $100 billion and accounting for over 70% dominance in the stablecoin market.  Building on this momentum, Tether's Q1 2024 attestation report disclosed a record $4.52 billion profit from U.S. Treasury holdings, generating $1 billion in net operating profits. The number of active Tether addresses (non-zero balances) as of April 28 rose to 5.6 million.  This poses the question: What is the growth headroom for this stablecoin giant?  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  We delve further into the decentralization of these wallets through the Herfindahl Index. This index, repurposed to measure the market concentration of Tether wallets, calculates the shares of the total supply held by different addresses by summing the squares of each address's balance in the network. A high score indicates that the supply is concentrated in a few hands, while a low score suggests a more evenly distributed supply among many addresses.  Source: Glassnode as of April 30, 2024.  Above, we see the Herfindahl index scores for different stablecoins: 0.00708164 for USDT, 0.00981202 for USDC, and 0.00331652 for DAI. Among the top three stablecoin providers, DAI has the most evenly distributed supply across addresses, followed by USDT, and then USDC.  The recent introduction of USDT on the TON network may decrease its Herfindahl score and achieve a more evenly distributed supply. Telegram, which claims 900 million monthly active users, announced in April that USDT will be natively supported on TON. This move could influence the distribution of Tether wallets significantly.  Source: DefiLlama as of May 6, 2024.  When examining the top three blockchain platforms and their stablecoin usage, TRON transactions are heavily dominated by USDT, with a dominance of 98.2%. On TRON, USDT transfers typically range from 95 cents to approximately $2, though gas fees can vary. Meanwhile, the TON wallet is natively integrated into the Telegram app, allowing users to conduct peer-to-peer USDT transactions within the TON wallet for free. Transactions between two USDT users outside the wallet reportedly incur a network fee of 0.0145 TON, which equates to about $0.09 as of May 6 2024.  Source: Statista as of 2023.  The integration of USDT on TON, with its lower fees and faster transactions, could prompt users to switch from TRON to TON for frequent, small transactions. This is particularly relevant in Telegram’s top user countries as of 2023: India, Russia, the US, Indonesia and Brazil.  Most of these countries are key players in the global remittance market. India ranks as one of the top global receivers, while Russia sees significant inflows from its diaspora in Europe and former Soviet states. Indonesia benefits from remittances sent by its migrant workers in Malaysia and the Middle East. Brazil, on the other hand, is known more for sending remittances through its emigrants in the US, Japan, and Europe.  Tether's integration on the TON network, combined with its significant market share and the potential for a more distributed wallet system, could support USDT's expansion among Telegram's user base, boosting its usage in major remittance markets.",POSITIVE,USDT | DAI | TON,BUSINESS | MARKET | USDT | DAI | TON,Sylvia To,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/08/stablecoin-surge-tethers-headroom-for-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ba1c8f6a064d74913eab67cd709a8f5bc1f4538-4000x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the price struggles for direction, its underlying network is experiencing a surge in activity. Related Reading: Whispers In The Deep: Why Are Ethereum Whales Disappearing? Ethereum Network Sees Increase In New Users According to crypto data firm Santiment, May 4th saw a whopping 200,000 new Ethereum addresses created, marking the highest single-day growth in nearly two years. This surge suggests a renewed interest in the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially driven by factors like the burgeoning Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space and the ever-evolving world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). 📈 #Ethereum rebounded back above $3,200 this weekend, and saw massive network growth. 196.71K new addresses were created on the $ETH network on May 4, 2024, the largest single day of growth since October 8, 2022. This should be viewed as a #bullish sign. https://t.co/l9iFVWCJpE pic.twitter.com/MlHQTvKKN0 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 6, 2024 This network growth is a bullish signal, and indicates strong and increasing interest in Ethereum, which could translate to significant capital inflows when macroeconomic conditions become more favorable. Is The Price Dip A Buying Opportunity? While the network thrives, Ethereum’s price currently sits at $2,995, a 1.8% decline in the past 24 hours. This puts it precariously close to falling below its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a technical indicator often interpreted as a sign of bearish momentum. However, a closer look reveals a potentially bullish twist. The price decline is accompanied by a drop in trading volume, which could indicate that selling pressure is waning. Historically, such a scenario has sometimes preceded a price reversal, where buyers re-enter the market, pushing prices upwards. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. chart: TradingView Investor Optimism Buoyed By Potential Fed Pivot The recent weakness in the US economy, highlighted by a disappointing jobs report, has sparked speculation that the Federal Reserve might consider easing interest rates. This could inject fresh liquidity into the market, potentially benefiting riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. According to analysts, a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve could be a game-changer for Ethereum. Lower interest rates generally make holding cryptocurrencies more attractive compared to traditional fixed-income investments. Ether seven-day price action. Source: CoinMarketCap The future path of Ethereum remains uncertain. While the network’s fundamentals appear robust, the price faces immediate challenges. Navigating this complex scenario will require investors to carefully consider both the on-chain activity and the broader economic landscape.

This has led to a wave of massive outflows from Bitcoin investment products, which could negatively impact the flagship crypto. Bitcoin Investment Products Record $284 Million Of Outflows CoinShares revealed in a blog post that Bitcoin investment funds recorded an outflow of $284 million last week. Most of these outflows are said to have come from the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw outflows of $156 million last week. CoinShares noted that last week was the first time these funds recorded such a measurable amount of outflows. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Reclaim $4,000? Fragile Fundamentals Threaten To Send ETH Crashing These US Spot Bitcoin ETFs indeed had a week to forget last week, as even BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded its first day of outflows since launch, with almost $37 million exiting the fund. CoinShares suggested that the magnitude of outflows was likely due to Bitcoin dropping below $62,000, which they estimate is the average purchase price of these ETFs since launch. Therefore, they claim that Bitcoin’s decline may have triggered automatic sell orders. Before now, institutional investors had already shown mixed feelings towards these funds thanks to Bitcoin’s recent price action. As such, it makes sense that Bitcoin dropping below $60,000 made them panic sell instead of holding their positions. Despite this development, CoinShares noted that the Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong which launched last week, were a bright spot, recording $307 million in inflows in the first week of trading. The launch of these funds could prove timely, with Bitcoin needing a catalyst to continue its upward trend. Interestingly, CoinShares revealed that Bitcoin was the only crypto asset to record outflows. On its part, Ethereum broke its seven-week streak of recording outflows, with $30 million flowing into Ethereum investment products. Other altcoins like Avalanche, Cardano, and Polkadot also saw inflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Still Not In The Clear With Grayscale’s GBTC recording its first day of net inflows last week, there was the feeling that such development could spark a turnaround in the outflows that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been recording. However, that hasn’t been the case. On May 7, these funds recorded a net outflow of $15.7 million. Related Reading: Here’s How This Ethereum Whale Made $16 Million From A Single Trade GBTC was again the primary culprit, with the fund seeing a net outflow of $28.6 million.

Those premium/discount percentages were typically low since both the ETF and the stocks within the ETF closed at the exact same time. The spot bitcoin ETFs have traded as I would have expected and any elevated premiums/discounts are due to how NAVs are calculated, not any inherent issues with the structure of these funds. By David Mann, Head of ETF Product & Capital Markets, Franklin Templeton The Bitcoin ETFs (""Bitcoin ETFs"" hereafter) registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which have been discussed, are not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and therefore are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds or ETFs registered under the 1940 Act. The Bitcoin ETFs are not a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and accordingly are not subject to the regulatory protections afforded by the CEA. Last week, I was very excited to receive a request for this blog to be published for our international readers. Although my focus has typically been on the US ETF market, I have no doubt that many of my ETF comments and observations would resonate with a global audience. In fact, I had some fantastic meetings in London and Frankfurt recently. The giant caveat is that our international marketing teams thought my analogies were maybe a little too US-centric, that somehow there may be a world where readers would not appreciate or care about the Detroit Lions. Rest assured that my love of sports knows no bounds! I am also a huge fan of the Chelsea Football Club (please save comments about this season for another day) and I follow the English Premier League very closely. Sadly, one of the main stories of this season beyond the fantastic title race is VAR (video assistant referee). Even before I began my side career as a high school soccer (""football"") referee, I was both fascinated and frustrated with VAR. Like instant replay in the NFL, sometimes as a fan, I need to temper my celebration as the video official reviews a scored goal or a potential handball in the penalty box. Staying with handballs, I feel I had to relearn what that term even means! When I was young, the definition seemed quite simple - if the soccer ball hit a player's hand, then that was a foul. Now? Did the ball hit the upper or lower arm? Was the defender purposely making themselves bigger? Was the player in an unnatural or justifiable position? The result is frustrated fans every Monday morning. I feel there has been a similar evolution when it comes to defining ETF premium/discount, especially as I read some of the recent commentary on the problems with spot bitcoin ETF discounts during the recent bitcoin selloff. As a reminder, an ETF's premium or discount is calculated by measuring the percent change between the fund's net asset value (NAV) and the ETF's closing price on exchange. This metric is often a good gauge to show that ETF arbitrage is functioning properly. When I began my career over 20 years ago, the premium/discount conversations were focused on ETFs that hold US equities. Those premium/discount percentages were typically low since both the ETF and the stocks within the ETF closed at the exact same time (4 p.m. EST). The premium/discount conversation with investors then shifted to US ETFs that hold international equities. Those ETFs tended to have higher premium/discount, as there was a timing mismatch between the close of the underlying market (used for NAV calculations) and the close of the ETF. This concept was called ""price discovery"" in which the US ETF would offer a clue as to the expectation of what might happen in those international markets the next business day. That conversation evolved further as some ETF issuers applied fair value accounting to the NAVs of their US ETFs that hold international stocks. The price discovery process still applied, but the premium/discount percentages for those ETFs tended to be lower since there was now an adjustment to the fund's NAV based on US market conditions. All this brings us to the newest iteration of the premium/discount ETF conversation - bitcoin. The NAVs of spot bitcoin ETFs have added a whole new wrinkle. As discussed earlier, phase one of premium/discount was when the ETF and the underlying security have the same closing time. Phase two (and 2b) was when the ETF and what it holds have different closing times. Phase three is when there is no closing time of the underlying asset. Bitcoin trades 24/7, which means there is no official closing price. Given that, there are several reference rate options available for calculating the NAVs of the various spot bitcoin ETFs. Some ETF issuers chose a snapshot of the bitcoin as close as possible to 4 p.m. EST. Others (including ours) will take the average price of bitcoin over multiple crypto exchanges between 3 p.m. - 4 p.m. EST. I will save the debate as to which is better for another day. For those ETPs that use a 4 p.m. EST bitcoin snapshot for calculating NAV, I would expect a minimal premium/discount since that bitcoin price matches the closing time of the ETF. For the ETFs that use an average price between 3-4 p.m. EST, there could be an elevated premium or discount, depending on how the price of bitcoin moves over the last hour of the ETF trading day. Using a simple example, imagine the price of bitcoin smoothly drops 2% over the last hour of the day. In that case, I would expect the ETF to close at around a 1% discount to NAV. This is perfectly normal and explainable. The big takeaway? The spot bitcoin ETFs have traded as I would have expected and any elevated premiums/discounts are due to how NAVs are calculated, not any inherent issues with the structure of these funds. There is no need to check VAR on this one. What are the risks? All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. The value of investments can go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full amount invested. Generally, those offering potential for higher returns are accompanied by a higher degree of risk. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. For actively managed ETFs, there is no guarantee that the manager's investment decisions will produce the desired results. ETFs trade like stocks, fluctuate in market value and may trade above or below the ETF's net asset value. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns. ETF shares may be bought or sold throughout the day at their market price on the exchange on which they are listed. However, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will be developed or maintained or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. While the shares of ETFs are tradable on secondary markets, they may not readily trade in all market conditions and may trade at significant discounts in periods of market stress.

Injective’s ""inEVM,"" which is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) operating system and connects the Ethereum, Cosmos and Solana networks, will rely for its infrastructure on Arbitrum's Orbit toolkit, which allows developers to build customizable chains with Arbitrum’s technology while accessing interoperability between multiple ecosystems.  The move could theoretically inject fresh energy into the INJ token, which outperformed nearly all of its peers in digital-asset markets last year, jumping at one point to a market capitalization of more than $4 billion.  This year, crypto markets have moved broadly higher, with the benchmark CoinDesk 20 index gaining 25% year-to-date. But at least in the eyes of traders, INJ has suffered a reversal, falling nearly 30% so far in 2024.  According to a press release seen by CoinDesk, the integration for developers means that it “unlocks new opportunities to build within the Ethereum L2 ecosystem while retaining Injective’s lightning-fast speeds and low fees.”  The teams also shared that transacting on the inEVM network will contribute to the tokenomics of the Injective ecosystem, including the burning mechanisms of its $INJ token, “which aggregates and systematically burns a percentage of all protocol fees on a weekly basis.”  “The significance of Injective’s integration with Arbitrum extends beyond just building blockchain networks or infrastructure,” said Eric Chen, the co-founder of Injective Labs (and a speaker at this year's Consensus festival), in the press release. “It enforces the fundamental principle of interoperability – closing the gap between Ethereum, Cosmos and other widely adopted L1s – for an ecosystem where cross-chain assets and liquidity can be truly composable across ecosystems.""

42418277,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd81d,1715173200,"It's Not a Token Offering, It's a 'Node Sale': Sophon Blockchain Raises $60M","Sophon, an entertainment-focused blockchain ecosystem, raised more than $60 million in a node sale, an increasingly popular type of fundraising method.  Node sales, described as a way of helping to decentralize projects, are structured in pricing tiers, where the longer buyers wait, the more they have to pay.  The project is built on zkSync's technology, using a data solution provided by Celestia.  It's the blockchain industry's latest innovation – not in technology, but in rounding up cash from investors.  Sophon, an entertainment-focused blockchain ecosystem, has attracted more than $60 million in a node sale – a novel form of project fundraising that is catching on in crypto circles as token sales come under greater scrutiny from securities regulators.  The Sophon project, built as a rollup network atop the Ethereum blockchain using technology from the zkSync project, sold about 121,000 network nodes, netting some 20,391 ETH ($62.7 million), according to a data dashboard on the blockchain-analytics website Dune. A total of 200,000 nodes were offered in the sale.  Many of the nodes were likely purchased by venture capital firms, a person with knowledge of the matter told CoinDesk.  Technically, buyers purchased Ethereum-based ERC-721 tokens, or NFTs, allowing them to operate nodes. That in turn qualifies them to collectively earn 20% of the project's eventually-to-be-released SOPH tokens over the first 36 months after the network's main launch, expected in the third quarter of this year.  Underscoring the explicitly financial aspects of running a node on Sophon, project officials acknowledged in the press release that the network doesn't even need the full 200,000 nodes. Users don't have to actively operate the nodes themselves.  ""They can simply delegate and reap the rewards for it,"" according to the press release. ""Furthermore, the node licenses that are unsold and unused when the sale ends won't come into circulation and will be burned.""  Using Celestia for data availability  Sophon previously had raised $10 million in a traditional funding round led by the investors Paper Ventures and Maven 11, with participation from Spartan, SevenX and OKX Ventures.  The fundraising track record looks especially impressive given that the project's principals aren't publicly named. According to a press release, the project is co-founded by ""several well-known semi-anonymous builders, including Sebastien ('Seb'), previously head of DeFi at zkSync; as well as Pentoshi, the legendary Crypto Twitter persona and trader and team member at Merit Circle.""  In a May 3 post on X, Seb wrote that it had come to his attention that ""a lot of folks were weary of the node sale and questioning the technical legitimacy of what we were doing, and thus of the overall project.""  ""We will use this money to build cool shit, innovate, fund projects and make strategic partnerships – always with the goal of delivering value to our core community,"" Seb wrote. ""As a crypto-native user myself, I know exactly what it means to risk funds on a new project and the value of transparency from the founder.""  Data services will come from plugging into another blockchain project, Celestia, according to an investor slide deck for the project.  What is a node sale?  Node sales, still a relatively new phenomenon in fast-moving crypto, are becoming more common, many of them with help from the DeFi protocol Impossible Finance, which itself raised $7 million from institutional and angel investors in a 2021 seed funding round.  Amounts raised from these node sales aren't tiny: Aethir, a decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure provider, disclosed last week that it had distributed more than 73,000 node licenses valued at over 41,000 ETH ($126 million). Other blockchain projects raising funds via node sales include CARV, XAI Games and Powerloom.  The marketing pitch is that the node sales help to decentralize the fledgling networks right off the bat, while still giving investors the ability to earn token rewards on top of their nodes – a form of yield.  The goal is to ""decentralize network participation, educate more users in their community about their tech, involve more participants than equity and involve retail users at larger skin-in-the-games than public,"" said Calvin Chu, a former Binance researcher who helped start Impossible Finance. Chu goes by the title of ""Core BUIDLer,"" he said.  FOMO  Certain mechanics of node sales appear designed to drive the fear of missing out, such as a system of tiering, where the price goes higher as more nodes are sold, and the use of exclusive whitelists that reserve early spots for certain users.  In Sophon's deal, for example, a Tier 1 node license cost 0.0813 ETH, roughly tripling to 0.2524 by Tier 11. And according to the Dune Dashboard, about three-fourths of nodes were sold to whitelisted buyers.  There's also the teaser that node operators may qualify for future token airdrops from related projects. Crypto traders have speculated that zkSync, one of the biggest Ethereum layer-2 networks, might at some point announce plans for a new token.  ""I cannot comment on 'wen zks token,'"" Sophon's Seb wrote in the May 3 tweet.  Buyers of the Sophon nodes are subject to a 12-month restriction on transferring them, a stipulation designed to keep participants from simply cashing out and moving on, as sometimes happens after big token distributions.  Often, however, venture capital firms that receive token allocations are locked up from selling them anyway. So the opportunity cost of owning a node may not look like too much of an additional burden – especially if the investments are accruing awards in the meantime.  ""Buyers hope to get high quality projects,"" Impossible Finance's Chu said in an interview with CoinDesk over Telegram. ""This doesn't work well with low quality projects, because there is a lockup effectively. Because the nodes don't give instant tokens.""",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/08/its-not-a-token-offering-its-a-node-sale-sophon-blockchain-raises-60m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c2e75cc2035951b6996339be631ebb0c91a05b9-1920x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lagrange specializes in zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs – a way for computers to mathematically verify certain kinds of data. Zero-knowledge proofs, a type of cryptography, have wide applications to blockchains and have become a popular component of layer-2 ""rollup"" chains, which are used to make networks like Ethereum faster and cheaper for end-users.  Lagrange explained its main product in a statement shared with CoinDesk, describing its zero-knowledge ""coprover,"" targeted for release later this month, as ""an off-chain network of specialized nodes that execute intensive computations and generate ZK proofs of the result.""  Decentralized applications on blockchain can use the platform to ""verifiably access computations that would otherwise be too heavy to compute on-chain, without ever having to trust the off-chain prover to give them the correct result,"" according to the statement.  In other words, the whole system acts as a way for blockchains – which are expensive and sluggish for certain kinds of activities – to run some kinds of computations cheaply and quickly off-chain.  ""Our proving systems and our proof constructions are able to scale to these very big-data scales of verifiable computation that otherwise would have, historically, been infeasible,"" Lagrange founder Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh said in an interview.  Lagrange will base its security on EigenLayer, an increasingly popular platform on Ethereum that allows users to ""restake"" ether (ETH) tokens to help secure upstart blockchain apps in exchange for extra rewards. Some $6 billion worth of restaked assets has already been allocated to the security of Lagrange, according to Hishon-Rezaizadeh.  Over time, once EigenLayer matures, those assets will be used to help hold Lagrange's operators accountable – meaning the organizations that operate the platform's infrastructure can have some of their stake revoked if they act dishonestly.  As EigenLayer continues to build out its core technology, Lagrange will have ""a set of operators from very, very reputable groups that run our infrastructure,"" said Hishon-Rezaizadeh. Those operators will include Kraken, the crypto exchange, and Galaxy, a crypto-financial firm, among others.  In addition to Founders Fund, Lagrange's seed round included participation from Archetype Ventures, 1kx, Maven11, Fenbushi Capital, Volt Capital, CMT Digital, Mantle and Ecosystem  CORRECTION (May. 10, 19:42 UTC): Corrects spelling of Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh .",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/08/thiel-backed-cryptography-startup-lagrange-raises-13m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83485d505d6084da72df922ad13c086221899801-3600x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27241651,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607019,1715171415,Cardano Update: ADA Faces Make-Or-Break Price Level For Bullish Revival,"The Cardano (ADA) price is down 46% since its yearly high and is currently facing a make-or-break price level for a bullish reversal. Here’s what you need to know: Cardano Price Analysis: Daily Chart The daily ADA/USD chart is currently charting a path within a descending channel, which has defined the bearish trend since the beginning of March. On Monday, the ADA price peaked near $0.475, encountering substantial resistance at the channel’s upper boundary and from the critical 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which stands currently at $0.47. In the short-term, this resistance level is crucial as it coincides with historical price rejection points, confirming its significance. As of press time, ADA is trading at approximately $0.44. The convergence of the 20-day EMA ($0.47), 50-day EMA ($0.54), and 100-day EMA ($0.51) above the current price level illustrates a dense zone of resistance. The 200-day EMA at $0.52 reinforces this barrier, emphasizing a strong bearish momentum. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Trading Activity Goes Quiet: Will This Drag Down The Price? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is currently at 38, which does not venture into the oversold territory (below 30) but indicates a bearish momentum with potential for further decline unless a reversal occurs. For a bullish reversal, ADA needs a sustained break above the $0.47 mark (20-day EMA) with accompanying high volume to confirm the breakout from the descending channel and shift the market sentiment. Then, the cluster of EMAs becomes the central resistance zone. Crossing this band is of utmost importance in order to build up bullish momentum for a break above the yearly high of $0.81 from March. If not, the ADA price could trend towards the midline of the channel and drop below $0.40. In-Depth Weekly Chart Overview Transitioning to the weekly chart, the broader picture also underscores the bearish sentiment that has dominated ADA since it reached its peak at $3.17 in late 2021. The series of lower highs and lower lows is a textbook representation of a downtrend. The price action currently remains suppressed below the long-term moving averages: the 20-week EMA at $0.52, 50-week EMA at $0.48, 100-week EMA at $0.51, and 200-week EMA at $0.52, all of which slope downwards, underscoring the persistent selling pressure in recent weeks. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Cardano Bloodbath Far From Over, Sets Bottom Price For ADA The Fibonacci retracement levels, drawn from the high of $3.17 to the low of $0.22, provide further insights. Currently, ADA trades near $0.44, which is above the major psychological and technical support at $0.40. The closest significant Fibonacci retracement level is the 0.236 level at $0.918, which ADA has struggled to surpass. A breach above this level could open the path toward higher Fibonacci levels at $1.348 (0.382) and $1.697 (0.5), which would require a significant shift in momentum and buying interest. Overall, for ADA to shift from its bearish constraints, attention should be focused on the daily resistance at roughly $0.47 (descending channel breakout). Overcoming this barrier would be pivotal for confirming a bullish reversal. Until this level is decisively broken with substantial volume, the outlook remains tilted towards bearish continuation.

The fundraising consisted of seed equity and debt financing led by crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital. A wide range of investors also participated in the round: investment firms Room40 Ventures, Selini Capital and Breed VC, corporate partners FalconX, Circle Ventures, Paxos, P2 Ventures (previously Polygon Ventures), Deribit, Chorus One, StarkWare and Immutable, and angel investors at Aevo, Cega, Talos, Amberdata, and Framework, the press release listed.  The investment happened as the digital asset industry continues its recovery from the crypto credit meltdown of 2022 that took down multiple companies such as BlockFi, Celsius and Three Arrows Capital. Alongside, more sophisticated and traditional players are entering the space as the asset class matures, making it more similar to traditional financial markets leaving behind its retail-driven beginnings.  Read more: BlackRock Sees Sovereign Wealth Funds, Pensions Coming to Bitcoin ETFs  Arbelos, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, aims to fill the gap left after the carnage, serving the liquidity and hedging needs of sophisticated investors using crypto derivatives and options, Joshua Lim said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Before starting Arbelos in late 2023, Tang served as chief investment officer at quantitative digital asset investment firm LedgerPrime while Lim was head of trading strategy at Galaxy and head of derivatives at now-defunct crypto lender Genesis, which also went under during the credit meltdown.  Lim said that lack of transparency was a key reason for the crypto's credit crisis, with some firms presenting financial reports that were ""outdated or manufactured,"" hiding the true risks from their creditors.  The company aims to solve this problem with a so-called ""transparency engine"" that lets clients independently verify in real time Arbelos' risk profile, balance sheet and counterparty exposure.  ""Our key tenet [at Arbelos] was how we could prevent what happened in the last cycle,"" Lim said.  The company is active on both centralized and on-chain derivatives and options marketplaces, has become one of the largest options block liquidity providers and its derivatives trading volume surpassed $25 billion in notional during the first six months since its inception.

42418288,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd89t,1715169660,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hovers Above $62K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin slid toward $62,000 during the Asian and European mornings on Wednesday as part of a broader dip across the crypto market in which tokens lost more of their gains from the rally at the end of last week. BTC is priced at around $62,200 at the time of writing, down nearly 2.9% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which measures the performance of the whole digital asset market, has sunk around 3.65%. Solana is one of the worst affected of the leading altcoins, falling 6.5% to $146, while ether has declined by around 3.63% to trade around $3,000.  Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX proposed a new reorganization plan that would see 98% of its creditors get back 118% of their claims in cash within 60 days of court approval. The proposed payouts are higher than earlier estimates from the FTX estate, which said in October it expected to pay back only 90% of customer funds. The estate said it expects to have between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion in cash available from scraping together the company's assets and liquidating them. It also denied that the recovery in crypto prices since FTX's collapse in November 2022 is the driving force behind its pile of cash.  Holders of liquid staking tokens on decentralized options platform Lyra Finance can now generate additional yield using automated versions of strategies like basis trade and covered calls. Lyra says holders of rswETH and eETH, the native liquid staking tokens of Swell Network and Ether.Fi respectively, could earn an annual percentage yield of 10%-50%. Liquid staking protocols like Swell and Ether.Fi allow users to deposit their tokens, which are then restaked in EigenLayer, thereby receiving liquid staking tokens that can be exchanged for ether. “We believe that tokenized derivatives yield is a game-changing primitive that will underpin the bootstrapping of networks and the expansion of sustainable crypto economic markets,” Nick Forster, co-founder of Lyra, said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin call-put skews, which measure demand for calls relative to puts.  The seven-day (red) and 30-day (light blue) skews remain below zero, indicating persistent demand for put options, offering protection against price drops.  It likely reflects concerns about the U.S. SEC not approving the spot ether ETF this month.

A general election is expected to occur in the second half of the year.  The current U.K. government will only have enough time to implement stablecoin and staking secondary legislation in the coming weeks, Economic Secretary Bim Afolami said on Wednesday.  “What I’m very confident we’ll be able to achieve is the secondary legislation around staking and stablecoins. Those two things are absolute priorities in the coming weeks and months,” Afolami said at the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Asset Summit. Stablecoins are digital tokens that are tied to other assets like fiat currencies.  He also plans to outline what the next steps could be later on in the year.  An election is expected to occur in the second half of this year, leaving little time for the current ruling party, the Conservatives, to implement all of the crypto measures they promised. Afolami said last month that the Government planned to issue new legislation for stablecoins, staking as well as crypto custody and exchanges by July.  The Conservatives have said they want the U.K. to be a crypto hub and the government ushered in new legislation for crypto to be treated like a regulated activity last year. They have consulted on a phased approach to regulating crypto, starting with stablecoins.  Recently, the Conservative party faced a blow as local election results indicated a large swing towards Labour.

42418285,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd88r,1715166503,Key Bitcoin Indicator Points to Period of Calm in Crypto Market,"BTC's volatility risk premium (VRP) has collapsed since halving, a sign traders foresee relatively stable market conditions ahead.  ETH's VRP remains elevated compared to bitcoin.  A week ago, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of the BitMEX crypto exchange, said bitcoin {{BTC}} had bottomed out, but the expected move higher is likely to be slow.  Now, an indicator called the volatility risk premium (VRP) is suggesting the same, signaling a relatively low volatility market environment ahead, which could be seen as a positive development by long-term investors.  VRP reflects the tendency of an underlying asset's option-induced implied volatility, a measure of expectations for price turbulence, to exceed realized volatility over time. The spread represents the premium options sellers demand for additional risks associated with future uncertainty and price volatility.  The one-month VRP has collapsed to 2.5% from 15% since the Bitcoin blockchain implemented mining reward halving on April 20, according to data tracked by Bitfinex's analysts. The VRP calculation is based on the gap between Volmex's bitcoin 30-day implied volatility index (BVIV) and one-month realized volatility (VBRV).  ""The significant narrowing of the VRP indicates a realignment of market expectations to a more stable and predictable environment post-halving,"" analysts at Bitfinex said in a note shared with CoinDesk. ""The market consensus seems to be that future volatility may be less than previously anticipated following the halving.""  In other words, uncertainty has ebbed and market participants foresee more predictable market conditions.  On April 20, the Bitcoin blockchain cut per block supply emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.125 BTC in a quadrennial event that halved the pace of supply expansion.  The consensus is that global debt concerns and massive fiscal spending by the U.S. will help bitcoin repeat its record of posting solid gains in the months after the halving.  As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at $62,400, largely unchanged since halving. Prices, however, have recently recovered from lows near $56,500.  ETH outlook relatively uncertain  While ether's {{ETH}} one-month VRP has declined to 8.5% from 18%, it remains elevated compared with bitcoin, a sign traders see ether's future as relatively uncertain.  ""A possible reason for Ethereum VRP to drop less, is that the SEC’s ETF decision on May 23, 2024 acts as an additional uncertainty for the ETH price. This also confirms that VRP captures the premium related to future uncertainty,"" Bitfinex's analysts said.

Dissecting The Factors Behind The Meme Coin’s Price Tumble,"The once-booming meme coin Pepe (PEPE) has hit a rough patch, experiencing a price drop of nearly 10% in the past 24 hours. This sudden downturn comes amidst a flurry of questions surrounding massive token withdrawals from a major exchange and the overall future of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Trading Activity Goes Quiet: Will This Drag Down The Price? PEPE Price Takes A Tumble Just a few months ago, PEPE was riding high, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts with its rapid price surges. However, the tides seem to have turned. The recent price drop has cast a shadow of uncertainty over the meme coin’s future trajectory. While some might attribute the dip to a typical correction in the volatile cryptocurrency market, recent on-chain data paints a more intriguing picture. Whale Movements Spark FUD According to Etherscan, a blockchain analytics platform, a massive withdrawal of nearly 1 trillion PEPE tokens, valued at almost $8 million, occurred two days ago. The origin of the transfer remains shrouded in mystery, with a high-security Gnosis Safe Proxy wallet facilitating the movement. Source: Etherscan This wasn’t an isolated event either. Data reveals another withdrawal of 322.48 billion PEPE tokens, worth around $2.7 million, from the same shadowy address just a day prior. The timing of these hefty transactions couldn’t be more perplexing. They coincided with an unexpected 17% surge in PEPE’s price, leading to speculation and fear, or FUD, within the cryptocurrency community. Theories range from market manipulation tactics to the possibility of unforeseen regulatory crackdowns, causing jitters among investors. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.2 trillion. Chart: TradingView Community Sentiment: Bullish Despite The Wobble Interestingly, despite the price drop and surrounding uncertainty, CoinGecko data indicates that the PEPE community remains largely bullish. This unwavering optimism is further bolstered by the influx of 703 new PEPE holders in the past day. PEPE price action in the last 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Prominent cryptocurrency figures like renowned analyst David Gokhshtein, who thinks PEPE will continue to be Dogecoin’s major rival in the imminent bull market anticipated later this year, are fanning the bullish flames.

The New York Innovation Center of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will act as a technical observer.  Citi, JPMorgan, Mastercard, Swift and Deloitte are among major companies with an interest in financial services teaming up to explore sharing ledger technology by simulating multiasset transactions in U.S. dollars.  The research project, titled Regulated Settlement Network (RSN) proof-of-concept (PoC), will explore the potential of bringing commercial-bank money, wholesale central-bank money and securities such as U.S. Treasuries and investment-grade debt to a common regulated venue, according to a statement shared with CoinDesk.  The New York Innovation Center of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will act as a technical observer.  ""In today’s digital economy, financial market infrastructures may need to settle a host of digital assets within well-defined legal frameworks. Citi looks forward to exploring the opportunities of this project,"" Debopama Sen, global head of payments at Citi Services, said in the statement.  In the U.S., ideas such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have become contentious. While the U.S. Federal Reserve's Chair Jerome Powell has told lawmakers that the Fed has zero interest in a system in which it would have a view into user data, CBDCs have become a presidential election Issue.  The program's participants are not committed to any future phases of research once the first is complete. The collaboration was focused on gaining ""further consensus on the use of shared ledger technology in the U.S. financial system,"" and the findings will be published once concluded, the statement said.  ""The application of shared ledger technology to dollar settlements could unlock the next generation of market infrastructures – where programmable settlements are 24/7 and frictionless,"" said Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president for blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard.

42418292,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd8Bx,1715157000,The Crypto Lawsuit State of Play,"Last month, Ethereum incubator ConsenSys sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an injunction asking a federal court to block the regulator from investigating its MetaMask offering or from declaring Ether (ETH) a security. It's the latest company to follow a growing trend of preemptive litigation against the SEC.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Suing the SEC  The narrative  I think it's fair to say that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies has now escalated into an all-out legal war, with crypto companies filing lawsuits and rolling out entire press approaches to tackle the SEC.  Why it matters  It seems increasingly unlikely that Congress will actually pass a legislation, which addresses the woes of the crypto industry in the near term. As a result, the industry’s growing strategy of looking for court victories may well be the right one, so to speak – if federal judges, appeals courts, and (I'm guessing) the U.S. Supreme Court start to create case law for companies and regulators to use, that will be one way of securing what the crypto industry calls regulatory clarity.  Breaking it down  Last month, Ethereum developer ConsenSys pre-emptively sued the SEC for injunctive relief. The firm asked a federal court in Texas to block the regulator from investigating it, bringing charges against the MetaMask wallet or MetaMask services and to declare ether (ETH) a not-security. In an unredacted version of the suit filed later, ConsenSys alleged that the SEC launched a formal investigation into whether ETH was a security (though the SEC does not appear to have actually come to a conclusion yet, based on the filing).  They join the DeFi Education Fund and a company called Beba, who sued the SEC at the beginning of the month, the Blockchain Association and Crypto Freedom Alliance of Texas, who sued earlier in the week over how the SEC is defining a ""dealer"" and a company called Lejilex, which wants to launch a crypto exchange literally called ""Legit.Exchange."" Each of these lobby groups or companies is concerned that a group, or companies the groups represent, may be sued on various charges. Still, they share the same fundamental view: that the SEC is overstepping its boundaries in how it regulates crypto or that the fundamental question of how crypto fits into securities laws needs a more definitive answer.  It’s a growing tactic among crypto companies, which pointedly filed in federal districts known for being less than wholly supportive of the administrative state.  Last month, the Blockchain Association and attorney (and Massachusetts GOP Senate candidate) John Deaton also filed amicus briefs in support of Coinbase’s motion for interlocutory appeal in one of its SEC cases.  Coinbase wants an appeals court to rule on how the Howey Test might apply to digital assets. The amicus briefs both largely argue that courts don’t currently agree on this question, and a higher power needs to step in to at least try and get the various federal judges on the same page.  The next question is how successful these suits and arguments might be. And the real answer is who knows. The federal courts have so far had a variety of rulings in crypto matters. The SEC has had some notable victories, like those against Terraform Labs and Coinbase in early motions (and one trial), not to mention their past victories over Telegram and Kik. The industry has some wins, like the split ruling in the SEC's Ripple case or the putative class action against Uniswap (issued by the same judge overseeing SEC v. Coinbase and USA v. Roman Storm).  The fact that these various suits are all asking for slightly different things certainly won’t immediately clarify some of these matters.  In the meantime, the SEC itself is continuing with its various investigations. In recent weeks, Robinhood and Uniswap have both announced they received Wells Notices from the agency tied to their crypto offerings. These notices are documents where the SEC said it believes it has enough evidence to bring enforcement actions, and usually, recipients have a chance to argue against an enforcement action.  The 30,000-foot view would suggest that the SEC – despite all the enforcement actions it’s brought over the past year – is starting to finalize some more of its investigations and is ready to turn these over to the courts.  It’s worth pointing out that SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been pretty clear about how he views crypto: most tokens are securities, he’s said over and over again. He repeated this point on CNBC on Tuesday, contrasting token issuers with publicly traded companies.  “Without prejudging any one of them, many of those tokens are securities under the law of the land, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. So we follow that law,"" he said. ""And you, the investors, are not getting the required or needed disclosures about those assets … Where’s the disclosures from these crypto tokens similar to these season earnings releases?”  Gensler did not answer a question about ETH specifically during the interview.  There are a few backdrops to all this legal wrangling. For one thing, as mentioned above, Congress doesn’t look particularly close to passing even a stablecoin bill, let alone market structure legislation.  We’re also now about six months out from the U.S. general election and seven months from the inauguration. I’m not suggesting that the SEC may be running out of time ahead of what looks like a tight election, but it certainly has the hint of a tight election.

Former NFL Star Rob Gronkowski to Pay $1.9M to Settle Crypto Investor Suit: Three athletes – including former New England Patriots star Rob Gronkowski – will pay $2.4 million to settle a Voyager investor lawsuit.  CZ gets sentenced  Last week, I flew to Seattle alongside Danny Nelson and several other reporters to cover former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s sentencing hearing.  As a reminder: Last November, Zhao pled guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and stepped down from the exchange he founded. Binance itself agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines and penalties and submit to a court-appointed monitor (which has yet to be appointed). On Tuesday, Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison.  I live-tweeted the hearing, and The Verge's Liz Lopatto live-blogged it. You can read those play-by-plays if you want an in-depth version of what happened. The short version: Judge Richard Jones asked representatives for Zhao and the Department of Justice to weigh in on the DOJ’s request to apply enhancements to Zhao’s base-level sentencing guidelines. The DOJ argued that the guidelines recommendation of less than 18 months was too lenient for Zhao’s conduct.  The DOJ attorneys seemed almost ill-prepared for the judge's questions. I don’t know how else to put it – the judge opened by asking about the enhancements, and the DOJ table needed to confer briefly before taking the lectern.  When the attorney did, his argument was a bit strained, to say the least. At one point, he argued that the judge should be able to infer that Zhao was aware of wrongdoing on his platform after the judge said there was no evidence supporting that assertion. If this description seems harsh, I should note that at this point, my main point of comparison is against the team that prosecuted FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried, which was a much bloodier affair (metaphorically) and saw a team of DOJ attorneys in New York clinically dismantle the very image of Bankman-Fried.  The defense argument was somewhat more straightforward: Zhao voluntarily showed up to the U.S. instead of fighting extradition, he voluntarily pleaded guilty, he apologized, and he already began taking steps to atone for his misdeeds (stepping down from Binance, agreeing to a $50 million fine).  There was much left unsaid. The defense filing from last month had a significant redacted portion, and a defense attorney alluded to a mitigating factor for Zhao’s sentencing. The judge didn’t want to discuss it, and so we’re all left to speculate as to what, exactly, that mitigating factor was. It’s clear Zhao cooperated with at least one, and likely other federal investigation(s), so there's probably a good guess there.  As many have pointed out, one reason for the light sentence is the fact that Zhao only pleaded guilty to one charge of violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which one attorney I spoke to described as “a huge give.”  The DOJ never alleged fraud, and while its sentencing memo hinted at sanctions violation concerns, the DOJ didn’t bring any charges on this front either. The time for the DOJ to allege more serious crimes would have been last year when it unveiled its charge against Zhao and Binance, rather than last month in a sentencing memorandum.  “The fact he hasn’t pleaded guilty to sanctions violations is an enormous give to him … it would not have happened if he hadn’t been willing to show contrition,"" said the attorney, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.  On the other hand, the DOJ did appear to plan for losing its argument for a stricter-than-guidelines sentence. The law enforcement entity has already begun lobbying Congress for stricter sentencing guidelines for Bank Secrecy Act violations, and last week’s sentence will undoubtedly become a piece of evidence in support of stronger guidelines.  A DOJ spokesperson said in a statement that ""this is the first time a CEO has ever gone to jail for a BSA violation.”  It was genuinely interesting to see the extent to which the judge praised Zhao, even when reading through the crimes he pleaded guilty to. While Zhao’s famous ""better to ask forgiveness” line was an issue for the judge, ultimately, Judge Jones said he believed Zhao had worked hard to build Binance and demonstrated enough remorse and good character to sentence him to below what the Probation and Pretrial Services Office recommended (five months).  At some future date – it's not been set yet – Zhao will report to a federal prison for four months.  And then he’s done with this whole episode.  This week  Monday  14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. ET) The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission held a Small Business Advisory Committee meeting discussing, among other things, crypto issues (briefly).  20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET) The House Rules Committee met to discuss a number of bills and resolutions, including a House resolution to disapprove of the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121. The full House should vote on this resolution on Wednesday. House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) praised the bulletin during the session, saying lawmakers could address a narrow, controversial aspect of the overall guidance instead of the entire document but have chosen not to do so. ""This kind of transparency helps prevent the kind of fraud and mishandling of crypto assets that led to the collapse of major crypto companies like FTX. In fact, this disclosure guidance has been broadly supported by industry and advocate stakeholders alike,"" she said. Congressman Mike Flood (R-Neb.) spoke against the bulletin, saying the SEC did an end-run around other regulators in issuing SAB 121 and it was ""not the appropriate vehicle to promulgate accounting guidance for digital asset custodians.""  Tuesday  14:00 UTC( 10:00 a.m. ET) A House Financial Services subcommittee met to discuss the SEC's oversight of things like crypto. A group of House Democrats intend to introduce a bill to ""clamp down"" on crypto mixers, Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) said during the hearing.  Friday  14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. ET) The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will hold an open meeting on event contracts, just days after Bloomberg reported the regulator might move to ban political prediction markets.  Elsewhere:  (Protos) Tron creator Justin Sun tried to claim diplomatic immunity in a civil suit filed by former BitTorrent employees who alleged they were wrongfully fired, Protos reports. Sun, who we previously knew to be Grenada's ambassador to the World Trade Organization, also appears to have been an ambassador to the United Nations for some period of time, said the news organization.  (Bloomberg) Molly White, who most in this industry probably know as the creator of Web3IsGoingGreat, wrote an oped in Bloomberg arguing that the crypto industry needs better oversight and self-regulation before the next crash.  (White House) The White House published a ""National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan"" (version 2) on Tuesday, saying among other things that the U.S. would ""support other countries' efforts to adopt and implement the global anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards for virtual asset service providers."" This effort will be led by the Treasury Department through the Financial Action Task Force, and this support may include ""technical assistance to low-capacity countries,"" the document said.

After reaching a peak of nearly $2 in April 2021, it has been in a downward motion, leaving investors wondering if a comeback is on the horizon. However, a recent analysis by market analyst Jonathan Carter suggests that XRP might be on the verge of a significant breakout. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Trading Activity Goes Quiet: Will This Drag Down The Price? XRP Stuck In Symmetrical Triangle Carter’s prediction hinges on a technical chart pattern known as a symmetrical triangle. This pattern typically forms during periods of consolidation, with prices bouncing between converging upper and lower trendlines. XRP has been trading within this triangle for several years, indicating a potential struggle between buyers and sellers. Support Retest Fuels Breakout Hopes The recent price drop in April, which mirrored a broader market correction, saw XRP retest the lower trendline of the symmetrical triangle. In technical analysis, such a retest is often seen as a precursor to a breakout, where the price decisively breaks through one of the trendlines. Carter believes this retest signifies an imminent upswing for XRP. #XRP Ripple is bouncing from the lower trendline of a symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart🧐 A successful breakout above this triangle would be a bullish signal with mid-term targets at $0.93 and $1.68🎯 pic.twitter.com/sbZXfEYMCM — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) May 6, 2024 Undervalued XRP? MVRV Ratio Hints At Opportunity Adding fuel to the fire is the MVRV Ratio, a metric used to gauge whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued. XRP’s current MVRV sits at a low -0.5733, suggesting that the token is trading significantly below its historical average price. This could be interpreted as a sign of undervaluation, potentially attracting investors seeking undervalued opportunities. Analyst Projects Mid-Term Target Of $1.68 Carter forecasts an initial spike towards $0.93, a level that XRP briefly touched in July 2023 after a favorable verdict in the current SEC dispute, should a breakout from the symmetrical triangle occur. XRP market cap currently at $28.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Carter, however, thinks that XRP will overcome this resistance level this time around in order to reach its more ambitious mid-term goal of $1.68. It would take an incredible 213% increase from the current price of $0.53 to reach this goal. XRP seven-day price action.

The crypto exchange is opening a Dubai office, making UAE the choice of its first expansion outside of Europe.  European crypto exchange Bitpanda expanded its partnership with the Vienna-based unit of Austrian lender Raiffeisen to offer crypto to customers at 55 bank branches across the country, the firms said on Wednesday.  Earlier this week, Bitpanda said it was opening a Dubai office, making UAE the choice of its first expansion outside of Europe.  A clear regulatory framework is essential for crypto businesses, and any jurisdictions that can offer this peace of mind will naturally take the lead in digital assets. In the case of Europe, this is the Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regime being implemented this year. UAE has already stolen a march on other jurisdictions with its Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).  Bitpanda’s deputy CEO Lukas Konrad says the European Union’s promise of regulatory clarity is translating into adoption: the Raiffeisen partnership, which kicked off several months ago for customers in the capital city Vienna, has seen an adoption rate of 10%, with new investors buying mainly large-cap cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum tokens, he said.  “Europe has a big benefit when it comes to crypto and that’s a clear regulatory framework, which comes into force from January 2025 onwards,” Konrad said in an interview. “The same regulatory clarity exists in the Dubai and Abu Dhabi regions. But in the U.S., this is not happening, making entities like banks hesitant. That’s not the case in the UAE.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/05/08/crypto-exchange-bitpanda-expands-austrian-presence-with-raiffeisen-bank-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c94777191c5f55c7f97250525742fc442e600e8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42390858,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPFwv,1715155193,Lyra Finance Now Lets Liquid Restaking Token Holders Earn Extra Yields From Automated Trade Strategies,"Lyra’s new offering allows liquid restaking token holders to automate and package any yield-bearing strategy into an ERC-20 token, which can be used elsewhere.  Initially, users will be allowed to tokenize basis trade, followed by a covered call strategy later.  Decentralized options platform Lyra Finance now allows holders of liquid restaking tokens (LRT) to generate an additional yield. The platform will let holders of LTR earn extra income using automated versions of popular strategies like basis trade and covered calls.  The so-called tokenized derivatives yield product has been launched in partnership with liquid restaking protocols Swell NEtwork and Ether.Fi.  It will help holders of rswETH and eETH tokens earn an annualized percentage yield of 10% to 50%, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. That’s significantly higher than the 10-year yield of 4.47% on U.S. treasuries, traditional finance’s proxy for the risk-free rate.  rswETH and eETH are native liquid staking tokens of Swell Network and Ether.Fi, respectively. Staking refers to the act of locking cryptocurrencies in a blockchain network in return for rewards.  Liquid restaking protocols, such as Ether.Fi and Swell Network allow users to deposit their ether {{ETH}} or liquid staking tokens like stETH, which are then restaked in EigenLayer. In return, users receive liquid restaking tokens or LRTs, which can be exchanged with ETH at any time.  Users only need to deposit rswETH and eETH in Lyra and mint a yield-bearing derivative token, which then automatically executes a predefined yield-bearing strategy on-chain. In other words, any yield-bearing strategy can be automated and packaged into a composable ERC-20 token, which can be used elsewhere.  “We believe that tokenized derivatives yield is a game-changing primitive that will underpin the bootstrapping of networks and the expansion of sustainable crypto economic markets,” Forster said.  Forster added the total value locked in the restaking protocols could double to $30 billion in the next 12 months, and Lyra stands out as the only protocol providing a new layer of derivatives yield for stakers and restakers.  Initially, users can tokenize basis trade, a popular market-neutral strategy that seeks to profit from discrepancies in two markets. Lyra told CoinDesk that tokenized covered calls will be made available later.  “The basis trade is a delta-neutral strategy that users can execute to earn an extra yield on the tokens that are already generating restaking yield as well as ETH yield,” Nick Forster, co-founder of Lyra Finance, said in an email.  “The covered call strategy involves more risks but uses liquid restaking tokens as collateral to sell ETH calls. So if ETH finishes above the strike price [at which calls are sold], they will potentially have to give up some of their upside but get the USDC yield in return,” Forster added.  The covered call involves selling call options or upside protection at strikes higher than the underlying asset’s going market rate while holding the asset in the spot market. The premium received for selling insurance against bullish moves represents extra yield on top of the spot market holding. Lyra’s self-custodial vaults automate the strategy.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/08/lyra-finance-now-lets-liquid-restaking-token-holders-earn-extra-yields-from-automated-trade-strategies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57d79bab306f98a1fef5670cb80efed368ec9567-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27167257,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606983,1715151045,Bitcoin Gets A ‘Monster’ Whale Boost With $1.2 Billion ETF Purchase,"Susquehanna International Group, a behemoth in asset management with a trading volume handling numerous financial products globally, has made a substantial investment in Bitcoin through various exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 7 revealed that Susquehanna held approximately $1.2 billion in spot ETFs during the first quarter of 2024. The Bitcoin ‘Monster Whales’ Are Here The details of the investment are particularly notable for their scale and diversity. Susquehanna now holds 17,271,326 shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which alone is worth approximately $1.09 billion as of March 31, 2024. This single investment represents a significant portion of the entire BTC investment, indicating Susquehanna’s preference for Grayscale due to its high liquidity. Further diversification in Susquehanna’s holdings includes 1,349,414 shares of Fidelity‘s spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC), valued at roughly $83.74 million. In addition, the firm has significantly increased its stake in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which offers exposure to BTC futures contracts. Susquehanna owned 7,907,827 shares of BITO as of the same date, valued at approximately $255.42 million — this represents a 57.59% increase from a February filing that listed 5,021,149 shares. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bold Bet: Options Traders Eye $100K Surge By September Additionally, Susquehanna’s Bitcoin ETF portfolio includes stakes in other high-profile funds such as the BlackRock ETF, ARK21 ETF, Bitwise ETF, Valkyrie ETF, Invesco Galaxy ETF, VanEck ETF Trust, and WisdomTree ETF. The firm’s strategic selection of funds illustrates its comprehensive approach to capitalizing on different aspects of Bitcoin’s investment potential. Susquehanna International Group, LLP holds over $1 Billion in Bitcoin ETFs in Recent Portfolio Update pic.twitter.com/0UPzLUVRsK — Phoenix » PhoenixNews.io (@PhoenixTrades_) May 7, 2024 Julian Fahrer, CEO and co-founder of Apollo, commented on the magnitude of this development, stating, “HUGE: Susquehanna International Group is the biggest Bitcoin ETF whale yet! $1.2 Billion held across 10 ETFs! The monsters are here.” This enthusiastic endorsement reflects the growing optimism and institutional interest in cryptocurrency investments. Despite these considerable stakes, Susquehanna’s allocation to BTC remains a relatively minor fraction of its total portfolio. With total investments surpassing $575.8 billion, the $1.2 billion in Bitcoin ETFs constitutes approximately 0.22% of the firm’s holdings, signaling a cautious yet significant entry into the digital asset space. Related Reading: The Next Big Catalyst For Bitcoin? What Michael Saylor Predicts This move by Susquehanna has far-reaching implications for the market. Bitcoin ETFs got off to a roaring trading start and have seen interest wane in recent weeks. The rise in institutional investment, as evidenced by Susquehanna’s activities, is expected to enhance Bitcoin’s credibility and stability as a financial asset. Moreover, Susquehanna’s diverse investment is not just limited to direct Bitcoin exposure. The company also reported indirect exposure through its holdings in MicroStrategy stock, which possesses a substantial Bitcoin reserve on its balance sheet. However, in a recent rebalancing, Susquehanna reduced its stake in MicroStrategy by nearly 15%, adjusting its exposure in line with its strategic portfolio adjustments. At press time, BTC traded at $62,352.

42390852,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdPFN1,1715136586,"Nearly All FTX Creditors Will Get 118% of Their Funds Back in Cash, Estate Says in New Plan","Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has proposed a new reorganization plan that would see a whopping 98% of its creditors get back 118% of their claims – in cash – within 60 days of court approval, according to new documents filed Tuesday evening.  Under the plan, other non-governmental creditors would get back 100% of their claims plus up to 9% interest to compensate them “for the time value of their investments.” The arrangement is still subject to approval by the Delaware bankruptcy court overseeing the bankruptcy case.  The proposed payouts are higher than earlier estimates from the FTX estate, which said in October it expected to pay back only 90% of customer funds. In January, current FTX CEO John Jay Ray III revised that estimate, telling the court he expected to be able to pay customers back in full.  Though the crypto market has rebounded since FTX’s collapse and subsequent bankruptcy – irking many of FTX’s customers, who have missed out on the opportunity to profit from the run-up in crypto prices while their funds are stuck in bankruptcy limbo – the estate denies that the market recovery is the driving force behind its massive pile of cash.  In a Tuesday press release, the FTX estate said it expects to have between $14.5 and $16.3 billion in cash available for distribution by the time a plan is approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court – the result of a year-and-a-half of scraping together the company’s scattered assets around the world and liquidating them.  “As previously disclosed, FTX.com had a massive shortfall at the time of the Chapter 11 filing in November 2022 – holding only 0.1% of the Bitcon and only 1.2% of the Ethereum customers believed it held,” the press release stated. “Accordingly, Debtors have not been able to benefit from the appreciation of these missing tokens during these Chapter 11 cases.”  Other sources of value, including investments made by FTX and Alameda Research – such as its 8% stake in AI startup Anthropic, which was sold piecemeal to institutional investors for $884 million in March – have been liquidated to generate cash to pay back the claims.  See also: Bankers Are Lining Up Buyers for FTX's 8% Stake in Anthropic  FTX's new reorganization plan would also settle a host of claims from regulators and government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The IRS agreed to resolve its $24 billion in claims in return for a $200 million cash payment and a $685 million subordinated claim that will only be paid out after all creditors and other governmental entities.  The CFTC and other unnamed governmental claimants agreed to subordinate their claims as long as FTX users and investors were paid in full with interest. There are also plans for a special fund created to make “supplemental restitution” to certain customers and creditors, though the details of this agreement have not been finalized, according to the press release.  A hearing to discuss the proposed plan is scheduled for June.  The specter of Sam Bankman-Fried  Former FTX CEO and convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried previously attempted to use the estate’s ability to pay back customers in full as evidence that the collapse of his exchange had “zero” harm to its customers.  Before his sentencing in March, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argued that their client should receive a light sentence, in part because customers would get all their money back.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Agrees to Help FTX Investors Go After Celeb Promoters  Ray, along with dozens of FTX creditors, wrote to the court arguing that the estate’s ability to claw together enough to money pay back his victims – the result of “tens of thousands of hours … spent digging through the rubble of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s sprawling criminal enterprise to unearth every possible dollar, token or other asset” – doesn’t mean his conduct wasn’t criminal.  Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison. He plans to appeal his sentence and conviction.

27130785,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=606971,1715135414,"Bitcoin ETF Issuer Franklin Templeton Bullish On Solana (SOL), Foresees It As 3rd Largest Crypto","In the wake of the November 2022 crypto market crash, which saw the bankruptcy and collapse of FTX and other firms, Solana (SOL) has emerged as a standout performer, experiencing a year-to-date price increase of over 560%. With a market capitalization of $67 billion, Solana has secured its place as the fifth largest cryptocurrency, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Tether’s USDT stablecoin. Despite its substantial growth, asset management giant and Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Franklin Templeton anticipates further expansion for Solana as the emerging bull market takes shape. Solana Poised For Continued Growth A recent report released by the firm highlights Solana’s strong position to capture the next wave of crypto adoption, solidifying itself as a major crypto asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Related Reading: Here’s How This Ethereum Whale Made $16 Million From A Single Trade The report emphasizes that Solana’s growth will continue due to several key factors. Notably, the crypto industry witnessed accelerated activity during Q4 2023, with Solana as a focal point for major airdrops within its ecosystem, such as Jito and Pyth. According to the report, these airdrops generated a wealth effect of over a billion dollars, driving up the value of SOL and other Solana ecosystem tokens, particularly meme coins. This surge occurred concurrently with Bitcoin’s upward trend, providing additional momentum to the Solana ecosystem. Since then, meme coins have gained significant attention, with a substantial portion of activity occurring on Solana. The network has witnessed the creation and trading of numerous meme coins, with some attaining multi-billion-dollar market caps, including Bonk (BONK) and Dogwifhat (WIF). The Crypto Industry’s Next Big Breakthrough? According to the asset manager, Solana has demonstrated significant growth over the past year, which is evident in the network’s increased total fees and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes. The network’s low fees, transaction latency, and high data throughput relative to other networks have contributed to its success. Solana’s network effects are expected to strengthen further as its performance improves, positioning it to capture upcoming trends in the crypto space. Related Reading: Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone Reveals Why A $150,000 Bitcoin Price Target Is Far Off The future remains uncertain as crypto enthusiasts ponder the next big thing in the industry. However, Franklin Templeton suggests that there is a strong possibility that Solana could play a pivotal role. According to the report, the Solana ecosystem anticipates additional airdrops in the coming months, which will continue to enhance the ecosystem’s wealth effect. Moreover, meme coin activity shows no signs of slowing down on the Solana network, further adding to the bullish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency and its ecosystem. SOL is now attempting to consolidate above the $150 level and has seen a significant 21% increase in the last seven days alone.

Particularly, the derivatives market is expressing confidence, with a significant number of traders betting on Bitcoin surpassing the $100,000 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Make-Or-Break Moment: Trading Guru Predicts Rally Amid Market Uncertainty Bitcoin Market Optimism Amidst Whale Movements Recent analysis from industry experts highlights a significant trend in Bitcoin options that points to growing optimism among traders. According to insights from QCP Capital, a noticeable shift has occurred in the risk reversals landscape, with calls (options to buy) now priced higher than puts (options to sell). QCP Capital noted that this change underscores a “stronger demand” for potential price increases rather than hedges against declines. The preference for call options, particularly those pegged at ambitious strike prices of $75,000 and $100,000 for September, underscores the bullish sentiment permeating through the market. Data from the Deribit derivatives exchange corroborates this trend, revealing that call options with a strike price of $110,000 for the end of September are currently seeing the highest volume. This enthusiasm in the options market is a strong indicator of the traders’ bullish outlook for Bitcoin, suggesting that many are betting on a significant price uptick by the end of the third quarter. However, the skies are not clear. Bitfinex analysts have pointed out actions by Bitcoin whales that might signal potential short-term volatility. The whale ratio on exchanges—a metric indicating the amount of Bitcoin large holders are moving to exchanges—has seen an uptick. This could typically suggest that these major players are considering selling, which could introduce increased sell pressure in the market. Bitfinex’s recent Alpha report revealed that while the short-term holders of Bitcoin seem to be at a pivot point with a realized price of $58,700 acting as an “important support level,” the increased activity by whales on exchanges might lead to heightened price fluctuations. Long-Term Perspectives And Market Recoveries Despite these potential short-term pressures, the broader Bitcoin market has shown signs of recovery. After a drop from its peak above $73,000 in March, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience with a 5.8% increase over the past week and a 2.8% rise in the last 24 hours alone. This recovery has brought its trading price to around $63,791 at the time of writing. Adding to the long-term confidence in Bitcoin, Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy shared his views on the future catalysts for Bitcoin’s price. In his perspective, regulatory decisions, particularly those rejecting spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) applications for other cryptocurrencies, will further solidify Bitcoin’s standing as an unmatched digital asset. Saylor disclosed that this regulatory moat could potentially steer more institutional investments towards Bitcoin, as it remains the ‘steel’ of the cryptocurrency world—unparalleled and indispensable.

According to a comprehensive performance analysis conducted by Messari, amid the emerging crypto bull market, Fantom has emerged as one of the major beneficiaries, showing significant growth in key metrics and market capitalization. FTM Market Cap Soars 101% QoQ By the numbers, FTM’s circulating market capitalization saw a substantial 101% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase, jumping from $1.3 billion to $2.6 billion, vaulting it up ten spots to 48th among all tokens (currently 58th). The token’s rally extended for two consecutive quarters, resulting in a fourfold increase since the end of Q3 2023. Related Reading: Here’s How This Ethereum Whale Made $16 Million From A Single Trade Although Fantom experienced a decrease of 53% QoQ in revenue measured in FTM, amounting to 1.8 million FTM, revenue denominated in USD exhibited a 4% QoQ increase, reaching $1.2 million. According to Messari, the revenue decline was primarily due to reduced inscription activity across all smart contract platforms in Q1. Despite this, Fantom maintained an upward trend in average daily transactions, excluding inscription-related activity, surpassing the Q3 average and reaching 247,000 daily transactions. Daily active addresses also rebounded, rising by 24% QoQ to 40,500. In Q1, the staking requirement for Fantom validators was significantly reduced from 500,000 FTM to 50,000 FTM, aiming to increase accessibility. However, the number of active validators remained unchanged at 55. Notably, the total amount of FTM staked increased by 17% QoQ, from 1.1 billion to 1.3 billion FTM, resulting in a 135% QoQ surge in the total dollar value of staked FTM, reaching $1.2 billion. Among proof-of-stake (PoS) networks, Fantom ranked 22nd in the dollar value of funds staked by the end of Q1. Memecoin Mania Boosts Fantom On-Chain Activity During the year’s first quarter, Total Value Locked (TVL) denominated in USD experienced a substantial 59% QoQ increase, rising from $810.8 million in Q4 to $1.28 billion. Conversely, TVL-denominated in FTM decreased by 21% QoQ, indicating that the surge in USD-denominated TVL was partly attributed to FTM’s price appreciation. Fantom’s average daily decentralized exchange (DEX) volume surged by 64% QoQ, from $10.2 million to nearly $176.8 million. In Q1, the “Memecoin Mania” trend contributed to elevated on-chain activity across various networks, including Fantom. Fantom’s monthly DEX volume surpassed $1 billion in March, marking the first time since March 2023. The number of DEXs on Fantom increased to 31 by the end of Q1, with no single DEX dominating more than 30% of the market share. Related Reading: Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone Reveals Why A $150,000 Bitcoin Price Target Is Far Off Lastly, following an exploit in the Multichain: Fantom Bridge, which affected stablecoins on Fantom in Q3 2023, the Fantom Foundation took steps to increase the liquidity of stablecoins. As of Q1 2024, two independent third-party bridging solutions, Axelar (axlUSDC and axlUSDT) and LayerZero (lzUSDC and lzUSDT), have emerged. USDC remains the predominant stablecoin on Fantom, accounting for 98% of the stablecoin market cap. USDT also experienced considerable growth, with an 86% QoQ increase. The FTM token is currently trading at $0.7037, reflecting an 8.7% increase in price over the past seven days. However, it has experienced a decline of nearly 20% in the monthly time frame.
