The figures, while potentially unrelated to the final results to be confirmed Monday, provide evidence that Silbert's strategy to use a syndicate model was successful at opening the auction to a wider range of foreign and domestic investors.    Results of our US Marshals bitcoin syndicate: Bidders - 42 Bids received - 186 BTC quantity bid - 48,013 Winners notifed by USMS on Mon      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) June 28, 2014    The SecondMarket syndicate was one of a handful of confirmed bidders to be participating in the auction, with others including Pantera Capital, Binary Financial and Bitcoin Shop. Those confirmations were preceded by a lengthier list of names accidentally leaked by the US Marshals Service (USMS) that gave insight into other potential participants.  Silbert  first announced his syndicate's auction plan on 20th June, issuing a statement to interested investors that said the syndicate would lower the minimum bid needed to participate from $200,000 –the amount required by the USMS to join the auction – to smaller bids between $25,000 and $50,000.  In total, Silbert reported that 42 bidders took advantage of SecondMarket and BIT's syndicate, and that the initiative garnered 186 individual bids on the assets.  Silbert also noted that the total value of the bids was 48,013 BTC or roughly $28.4m. At press time, the market value of the 30,000 BTC was roughly $17.7m.

42425831,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRBh,1404048048,California Governor Grants Bitcoin 'Legal Money' Status,"The 39th Governor of California Jerry Brown has officially signed Assembly Bill 129, the measure that sought to grant bitcoin and other digital currencies 'legal money' status, into law, Reuters reports.  The news comes just weeks after the approval of the final amended version of the bill earlier this month through key votes in both the California Assembly and Senate.  AB-129, which first received approval in the California Assembly earlier this February, sought to update a California law under which alternative forms of value such as rewards points, coupons and digital currencies were technically being used in violation of the law.  Though digital currencies were not targeted for violating the law, such rules could have been used to stem the technology's growth in the area that is home to 40% of all bitcoin jobs in the US.  However, as noted by Roger Dickinson, the California assembly member who introduced the bill, AB-129 does not regulate bitcoin in California, a matter that will be left up to other authorities.  In an interview with CoinDesk in March, Dickinson summed up the intent of the bill, saying:  ""We’re trying to say that to the extent that alternative currencies are developed and in use, we will consider that to be a legally acceptable activity in California.""  With AB-129 now law, California bitcoin enthusiasts will need to wait for a forthcoming decision from the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO), which issued a warning on digital currencies in April.  For more on how that agency will play a role in deciding the future of bitcoin in California, read our full interview with Dickinson.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/29/california-governor-grants-bitcoin-legal-money-status,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79e317ec37fd5e5ef275613d9fa9b020e91230b1-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425840,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRNh,1404046519,New York Bitcoin Job Fair Shows Demand for Bitcoin Wage Payments,"More than 200 job seekers convened yesterday at the Bitcoin Job Fair in New York, a networking function organized to connect potential employees with companies in the bitcoin arena.  The event was hosted by the Bitcoin Center NYC on Broad Street in New York’s Financial District. BitPay, Coinbase, Coinsetter and eGifter were among the higher-profile of the 11 companies with representation at the job fair.  Alex Palantzas, head of business development at the Bitcoin Center said the job fair is one of the most crowded and successful events they have ever had, telling CoinDesk:  ""The turnout is pretty overwhelming.""  The latest Bitcoin Job Fair follows a successful launch in San Francisco, which saw the 34 startups come together with more than 400 job seekers.  The results may not be indicative of a poor turnout in New York, however. Previous research from CoinDesk indicates that New York is the number two state in the US for bitcoin professionals, but that it trails California by a substantial margin.  The Bitcoin Job Fair is the product of Coinality, the online job and resume board for prospective employers and employees to connect about jobs paying in digital currencies, and the Plug and Play Tech Center, the Sunnyvale, CA-based accelerator that specializes in tech startups; in partnership with Bitcoin Center NYC.  Bitcoin jobs diversify  The employers at the event were looking for candidates of all skill sets, to hire for positions across various departments – sales, marketing, business development and programming – based in and out of New York.  Palantzas said that many of the attendees had backgrounds that extend beyond programming, and that he was pleased to see the variety of people who came out and showed their interest in bitcoin:  ""I noticed we have both people in technology and software development, as well as people in finance and sales, which is very encouraging. My background is in finance and I’m happy to see more people from that industry coming to this new concept.""  “I was very happy to hear that people are concerned with the current financial system,” he added. “People are very knowledgeable, and they saw a solution – in bitcoin.”  Bitcoin entering the mainstream  The other distinction between job seekers was not in their skill sets but their objectives.  Some were interested in finding work in the industry to build their resume and career in the bitcoin space. Others, though, were purely interested in getting paid in bitcoin instead of the dollar, so that they could own bitcoin without having to purchase it themselves – both to make watching bitcoin’s progress more interesting and to allow them to do more things, such as trade bitcoin for other digital currencies.  In either case, almost everyone agreed that the success of the job fair was indicative of bitcoin’s ascent into the mainstream.  Olivier Annoual is a cryptocurrency enthusiast interested in jobs on the tech side. Although he said he is still learning about digital currencies, he sees education on the subject becoming more accessible with bitcoin’s increasing popularity.  On the turnout at the job fair he said:  “It shows [bitcoin] has a good future and it shows it’s getting more popular. If more and more companies hire and start paying in bitcoin, who knows how far it can go? When I first heard of it I didn’t think much of it, three years ago.”  Daniel Mestre, a student at Stevens Institute of Technology, is interested in jobs in web and software development mainly for the sake of being paid in bitcoin.  He said:  “I think these kind of job fairs are going to become bigger and we’re going to start seeing more of them at some point or another, maybe people will start demanding they get paid in bitcoin once mainstream interest spreads.”  Photos courtesy of Jonathan Kirsh",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/29/new-york-bitcoin-job-fair-shows-demand-for-bitcoin-wage-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e19a47431ffb2036766caf92e11b73466bf3ecd-841x561.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425834,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgRFh,1404041714,Stripe CTO: Bitcoin Could Unify the World's Financial Systems,"Greg Brockman, CTO of payments solutions provider Stripe, has said that rather than replacing the existing financial infrastructure per se, bitcoin holds promise as a unifying technology capable of bringing these two worlds together.  Stripe  offers businesses a suite of APIs that allow them to accept payments for products or services by a variety of means, and across many devices.  As part of the company's vision to provide the greatest possible number of payment options, Stripe started testing bitcoin payments in March of this year.  Speaking in an interview with CoinDesk, Brockman said:  ""It really comes down to the the way that we, Stripe, want to be the universal payment infrastructure of the web. As part of that, bitcoin is really interesting as something that helps spread that, that helps connect this archipelago of different financial systems.""  He added, ""Aside from something that allows consumers to pay, and merchants to accept, it’s also something that can help connect the world’s financial systems in a way that we cannot today.""  Unifying factor  Brockman is to speak at the Bitcoin Finance conference in Dublin, which is being held on 3rd-4th July. He plans to outline this vision of bitcoin's potential as part of his speech, he said.  The CTO indicated that his talk will set out what bitcoin's role in the mainstream could look like.  For example, if you look at an average consumer, whether they're aware of bitcoin technology or not, it’s not necessarily optimised for them. That's something that will need to change.  ""The main thing I'm going to focus on,"" he said, ""is, what would that ecosystem look like, if you wanted something that was well suited for them, well optimised for them? What are the necessary consequences, or at least what’s one set of evolutions of that world, and what are the things that we as a community are going to have to build?""  He indicated that there are a lot of pieces of the existing financial system that are accepted just because they exist.  Bitcoin, however, offers exciting potential as the backend for a new financial world because, as an open system without significant barriers to entry, it will surely just keep getting better and better, as opposed to being a closed network that’s hard for people to integrate with.  Bitcoin to dominate?  Brockman sees cryptocurrencies as a key component of the financial world in the long term, although whether it is bitcoin that wins, or some other currency, remains to be seen.  ""It’s obvious that bitcoin has a lot of mindshare and momentum,"" he said, ""but it was designed before we really knew what we needed. I think we’re still figuring out what we need. There’s a chance that a cryptocurrency will be a winner and it won’t be bitcoin.""  Don’t think the world’s existing financial systems are going away anytime soon, however. Brockman envisages a future in which cryptocurrencies are just one connecting part of the financial ecosystem, rather like how the web is to the world's businesses today:  ""If you look at the Internet, there are all these various backbones that connect all these disparate providers. These providers have their own technology and their own systems – it’s not like anyone supplanted their own office or local area network just because you had a wider Internet. It’s just like this additional connectivity boosted the value of the existing ecosystems.""  Exciting period  CoinDesk recently reported on comments made by Jason Oxman, CEO of the Electronic Transactions Association (ETA), who suggested that, while bitcoin offers some advantages for the payments industry, the technology is both too insecure and immature for its members to yet adopt.  When this was put to the Stripe CTO, he argued that such an opinion is reasonable, despite bitcoin integration currently being beta tested at his own company.  ""Bitcoin’s just emerging,"" he said. ""We haven’t figured out what it’s going to look like yet, and I think, going back to my talk, the kind of vision I’m going to lay out is something that hasn’t happened yet. I think it’s going to feel completely different for a consumer involved in the system, but at the backend there’ll be the same technology – we can build it on top of exactly what we have today.""  ""[Bitcoin] is very much in a state of rapid discovery and we’re learning what works and what doesn’t. [...] I think it’s a very exciting time, to see how things go and how these systems will work in practice.""  Interest in bitcoin  Regarding a launch date for sending bitcoin payments live on Stripe's platform, Brockman couldn't provide a timeline, saying, ""We don’t have a particular date set for the public launch. We are currently in beta and people are using it successfully.""  However, he indicated that the company had seen a lot of demand for bitcoin payments, and this is something that ""a lot of people are really interested in and excited about"".  ""At the end of the day, Stripe is really about enabling people anywhere to pay using their payment instrument of choice. And bitcoin is a really powerful step along that way,"" he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/29/stripe-cto-bitcoin-could-unify-the-worlds-financial-systems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e2692e792cdd0f01bbc4e8dbc49a9968940e518c-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425829,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgR5h,1404038707,Coins.ph CEO Talks Opportunity for Bitcoin in the Philippines,"Bitcoin startups are emerging across Asia as entrepreneurs begin to see bitcoin's potential to improve the region's inefficient payments infrastructure and bolster its relative absence of advanced financial tools.  One Asian nation that is increasingly active in the bitcoin space is the Philippines, which is being led by perhaps its most well-known startup, Coins.ph, a bitcoin exchange service and merchant processor that has so far inked two deals with major local merchants.  The company is led by co-founder and CEO Ron Hose, a graduate of Cornell, a founding partner at Innovation Endeavors and an established entrepreneur who previously co-founded Tokbox, a video communications services which was acquired by Telefónica Digital in 2012.  While Coins.ph began trading late last year, the actual exchange launched publicly in February. To date, Hose told CoinDesk that he's pleased with the results, stating:  ""In terms of volume, we have been doing pretty well in growth so far – high double digit, triple digit growth which is a very encouraging sign. We focus on building trust with customers through fast customer service.""  Hose is also adamant in his belief that bitcoin can truly help consumers in the Philippines, explaining:  ""In contrast to developed countries, where bitcoins as a payment method are more of a novelty – here it is serving a real problem. For instance, credit card penetration in the Philippines is 3%. Only three out of 100 customers that land on an e-commerce site have an immediate way to pay for it.""  Because emerging markets are different than developed countries, Hose explains, Coins.ph had to provide a positive customer service process, one customers could trust to buy and sell bitcoin.  Building trust door-to-door  This emphasis on putting a trusting face to bitcoin's advanced technology has lead Coins.ph to provide services that would perhaps be uncommon in other markets.  Hose said:  ""As a consequence, we built out a physical network and actually deliver cash through retail locations. We even conduct door-to-door deliveries, too.”  The CEO is also looking to build on this trust by listening to the needs of the local market.  Because the team has an active exchange, they can now see what customers use it for and have begun building a second layer of applications on top, creating banking services for those outside the traditional financial system.  Here again, Hose is taking aim at what he views as an underdeveloped e-commerce infrastructure, comparing his service to other market alternatives:  ""[With] other [services, you] have to travel to a bank for 45 minutes on bus, wait in line and then return back on the bus. Before you know it, it takes three hours to pay for something online.”  Remittance within reach  According to Hose, there is even a larger pain point: transfer of money from other countries.  The Philippines one of the largest recipient for remittances in Asia and it was estimated that, in 2010, migrants sent around $21.3bn back to the country.  A large portion of these funds are going to people who do not have bank accounts and thus have to collect money in person at retail locations like Western Union, consequently paying an average of 9% in fees.  “The reason they pay this 9%,” explained Hose, “is because they don't have a bank account and likely will never have a bank account because they do not have enough savings. Banks have a cost structure (location, tellers, rent) and if you do not have sufficient savings on the first day when you open an account, the bank is already losing money.""  Hose believes that bitcoin's ability to harness the power of mobile devices, however, will set it apart.  ""This pain point is an area where mobile banking and bitcoin can help out. For instance, if a relative abroad sends money to you and you have to pay a transaction fee to a retail location, then that is equivalent in three-to-four days of income that you paid just to pick up your money.”  The way the company deals with regulatory issues, he said, is part of what differentiates his team from other local competition: ""We have a well-seasoned Silicon Valley team. And even though bitcoin is not yet regulated in the Philippines [...] we treat it as if it was regulated. We work to comply with industry standard KYC/AML regulations; we are self-regulated and assume that we are being regulated.""  Unregulated market  Although the Philippines formally issued a warning against bitcoin in March, the country's lawmakers have not been quick to provide clarity as to how the local bitcoin ecosystem should operate.  Hose said this has brought new challenges his team is working to solve:  “There are definitely a lot of very particular challenges related to working in an emerging markets (for example, there is no automated way for us to do bank-to-bank money transfers here, we actually have someone going to the bank, withdrawing cash, and depositing it [in another bank].”  The team launched in the Philippines, however they see themselves as a regional player, aiming towards providing similar services to other markets, and expanding into places like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.  In addition to a foot network, the team is still quite lean, comprising of around 10 people – one half in engineering and the other half in operations.  To accomplish its goal domestically, the team has built a large physical network and the next step is opening up this network up with an API (using a 'sneakernet' model) providing bitcoin ATM makers the ability to use this infrastructure to send money anywhere else in the Philippines.  Hose noted, ""users can put in who they want to receive the funds and when they want to receive it. Next day delivery. We have providers that can do same-date, however we only guarantee next day as it is important to not overcommit to our customers. Part of providing good service is giving people the proper understanding what will happen and standing up for it 100% of the time"".  Long-term view  Concluding, Hose mentioned he was recently on a panel in Singapore, and was asked what is going to drive bitcoin adoption.  In his view, the key will be finding use cases for the technology:  ""It must solve a real problem; there has to be something that is painful enough to convert, somewhere there is enough friction. The thing about emerging markets is that pain exists – you don't have a bank account or you have to pay 9% to transfer money to your family – so it is much easier to make that leap.""  From there, he said, adoption should follow, adding:  ""And if we can make it so [a customer] had a positive experience, then through word-of-mouth [their friends] have a reason to try and use it as well.""

42425822,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgQxh,1404036054,7 Must-See Bitcoin Documentaries,"Update (30th June 15:05 BST): This article has been updated with an additional entry.      The story of bitcoin’s journey into mainstream society seems practically made for Hollywood.  From its introduction to the public in 2008 with Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, up to today, bitcoin has endured dramatic highs and even more spellbinding lows as the community has matured alongside the technology.  With all of the scandal, tales of overnight millionaires and the captivating nature of such a disruptive invention, it should come as no surprise that many filmmakers are jumping at the opportunity to tell stories about bitcoin’s impact on people's lives and society as a whole.  Because bitcoin is so technically complex and the concept of purely digital money is such a novelty to most people, it is sometimes difficult to communicate its value and its potential to truly change society on a global scale.  Documentaries are an approachable and entertaining medium for educating audiences all over the world on their subject matter, so it's certainly fitting that there are a number of bitcoin documentaries in production.  These six documentaries highlight bitcoin’s different use cases, its short but dramatic journey over the past five years, and its position in a long history of financial systems.  1. ‘Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It'  With the invention of the block chain and the bitcoin protocol, Satoshi Nakamoto created a currency unlike any other we have seen in history. Its trustless, decentralized nature makes bitcoin a formidable challenger to traditional banking systems and fiat money.  The team behind 'Bitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It' hopes to show just how disruptive the digital currency is to the monetary systems to which we have all become so accustomed.  Behind The Scenes: Australian media entrepreneur Torsten Hoffman is leading his team of writers and producers to make this a jargon-free documentary that viewers will ""watch with [their] parents"". Hoffman and crew have already filmed interviews with the likes of Andreas Antonopoulos, Blockchain.info CEO Nic Cary and bitcoin pioneer and investor Roger Ver.  The film has raised about $7,000 of its $10,000 goal on Kickstarter and has an estimated release date of December 2014.  2. 'Life on Bitcoin'  A common argument made by bitcoin skeptics is that the digital currency can't be used to buy practical, everyday items in the same way as cash or credit cards. In July 2013, one ambitious couple embarked on a 100-day ""social experiment"", where they relied exclusively on the digital currency to prove to naysayers that it's possible to have a life on bitcoin.  Considering the strides that have been made in recent months with more merchants and retailers accepting bitcoin, the most remarkable thing about 'Life on Bitcoin' isn't that Austin and Beccy Craig started their journey just after exchanging wedding vows, it's that they took the plunge to live on bitcoin almost a year ago, when the ecosystem was far less developed.  Behind The Scenes: Austin and Beccy didn't have the luxury of living in a major metropolitan region for their 100-day bitcoin journey. The Utah-based couple had to convince many local retailers to accept the digital currency, and in some cases resorted to traveling quite the distance to find bitcoin-friendly locations to purchase everyday luxuries like petrol.  'Life on Bitcoin' garnered a significant amount of buzz in the bitcoin community, and after reaching their fundraising goal of $70,000 on Kickstarter, the newlyweds continued their journey with a world tour last fall to promote the film.  Austin and Beccy recently announced that their filmmakers, The Good Line, are in the ""final stretch"" of completing 'Life on Bitcoin' and that they have already submitted the documentary to a well-known film festival as a work in progress.  3. 'Bitcoin in Uganda'  One of the most profound benefits of using bitcoin instead of traditional methods to send and receive money can be seen when processing an international money transfer.  Unlike services like Western Union or MoneyGram, which charge a hefty fee for their work, sending money anywhere in the world with bitcoin takes minutes – not days – and the transaction fees pale in comparison to any alternative.  'Bitcoin in Uganda' serves as a storybook example of how these benefits can make a real difference in people's lives. The short film puts a spotlight on a Ugandan student, Ronald, who relies on his family in the US to send him money for tuition.  Frustrated with the slow and expensive system that Ronald has relied on for so long, his brother-in-law suggested that his wife switch to bitcoin to send Ronald money for tuition payments.  Behind The Scenes: Directed by Argentinian filmmaker Sergio Ruestes, 'Bitcoin in Uganda' premiered at the Bitcoin2014 Conference in Amsterdam back in May. The short is one of three films that have been produced by BitcoinFilm.org, a group hoping to make ""several small documentaries"" to tell life-changing stories involving bitcoin.  Ronald's story highlights another noteworthy feature of bitcoin: by sharing the public address to his bitcoin wallet, Ronald can accept donations from anyone in the world to help pay for his tuition.  4. 'The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin'  Those who have been part of the bitcoin community for some time will be the first to say that bitcoin's journey can be likened to a roller coaster ride: unpredictable highs and lows, with a number of surprise twists and turns along the way.  'The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin' documents the events that have made headlines for the digital currency, and takes a deeper look at what the filmmakers call the ""largest social-economic experiment ever conducted"".  Behind The Scenes: Produced by Daronimax Media, 'The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin' features appearances from the Bitcoin Foundation's chief scientist Gavin Andresen, fallen Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and the Winklevoss twins, among many others.  The film is perhaps the most publicized bitcoin documentary, having been chosen in the official selection at this year's Tribeca Film Festival, where it premiered in April. The filmmakers advise fans to sign up for their mailing list for updates on its release to the public.  5. 'The Bitcoin Doco'  Bitcoin's potential to make a difference in people's lives isn't limited to those in developing countries or speculators hoping to get rich quick. The team behind 'The Bitcoin Doco' hopes to tell personal stories of the digital currency's impact on people's lives, focusing on the diversity of the bitcoin community.  'The Bitcoin Doco' will strive to provide context for bitcoin's place in mainstream society in an approachable and comprehensive manner, while putting a spotlight on some of the many community members that contribute to the ecosystem's growth.  Behind The Scenes: Filmmaker Chris Mylrae teamed up with bitcoin enthusiast Dale Dickens to produce the three-part mini-series. Generously hoping to educate the public about what they call ""part of history in the making"", the Australian duo will release 'The Bitcoin Doco' under Creative Commons licensing on Vimeo and YouTube.  The mini-series is still in its early stages of production, with the team actively seeking donations to support the project. Just over $2,000 of their $25,000 fundraising goal has been pledged, and supporters have until mid-August to contribute.  6. 'I am Satoshi'  Open-source platforms have already disrupted the fields of software, education and retail, yet the banking system remains untouched. 'I am Satoshi' asks whether bitcoin, an open-source technology, can usher in game-changing innovation within outdated currency, trade and payments systems.  Winner of 'Most Creative Video' at 2014's Blockchain awards, 'I am Satoshi' is a 52-minute montage that uses an investigative approach to explore bitcoin's relationship with the wider financial system.    Behind The Scenes: So far, 'I am Satoshi' creator Tomer Kantor has recorded over fifty interviews across five continents for the project, including notable figureheads from the bitcoin community. Currently in post-production, the final cut is scheduled for release in December 2014.    7. 'Bitcoins in Argentina'    One of the most appealing qualities of bitcoin is its independence from any government-issued fiat currency. Advocates argue that, in theory, if a country's national currency were to collapse or become extremely unstable, a decentralized currency like bitcoin is the ideal alternative for citizens to store value and fight inflation.      Indeed, Argentina has seen considerable inflation and monetary restrictions on its fiat currency, the Argentinian peso. 'Bitcoins in Argentina' is a short film that tells the story of Argentinians turning to bitcoin as an alternative way to protect their wealth.      Behind The Scenes: 'Bitcoins in Argentina' is produced by BitcoinFilm.org, the same team behind 'Bitcoin in Uganda'. The filmmakers hope to continue showcasing profound examples of bitcoin's value to society, and fans can support their efforts by donating to their public bitcoin wallet.      Since the documentary was released last year, Argentina's relationship with the digital currency has wavered. The South American country's central bank recently issued a warning to citizens, arguing that there's ""still no consensus"" about bitcoin on an international level.      While it may take time for governments around the world to embrace the digital currency together, these documentaries all play an important role in educating the public about the true potential bitcoin has to make a difference everywhere.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Tom Sharkey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/29/7-must-see-bitcoin-documentaries,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7b3f744d243508983b7cb4f91609b378606080f-1020x735.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
