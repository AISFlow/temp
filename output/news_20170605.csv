The decision brings to a close part of the SEC's legal effort against GAW, Zen Miner and their CEO Homero Josh Garza, who it sued in December 2015 for securities law violations, as well as the operation of a Ponzi scheme. The SEC's case centered around the sale of Hashlets, which were ""virtual miners"" sold through a bid/ask marketplace on a platform called ZenCloud. The sale of those Hashlets, the SEC argued in court, amount to an unlicensed securities offering.  According to court documents, both GAW and Zen Miner are required to disgorge $10,078,331 in profits, along with $305,768 worth of prejudgment interest.  Both firms are further required to pay $1m apiece in civil penalties, according to the decision signed by US District Judge Jeffrey Meyer. The court order was signed on 31st May, though the SEC announced its court win this afternoon.  Notably, the decision did not include Garza. ""The SEC's litigation continues against Garza,"" the agency said in its release.  GAW Miners  fell apart in mid-2015 amid growing controversy over its mining operations and the failure of its alternative digital currency, paycoin, which it launched at the start of that year.

The meeting between Buterin and president Vladimir Putin occurred at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, which took place between 1st and 3rd June, following an address to a global group of chief executives.  According to the brief statement released on Friday by the Kremlin:  ""Mr. Buterin described the opportunities for using the technologies he developed in Russia. The President supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners.""  Buterin, who described the meeting as a ""brief conversation"" on Reddit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Putin’s meeting with global heads of business is notable to the blockchain community for reasons that go beyond the conversation with ethereum’s inventor. In a brief address, the president gave insight into multiple blockchain efforts happening within Russia.  From the Kremlin’s official translation of the address:  ""We are doing a great deal to create a favorable business climate and above all to provide macroeconomic conditions for sustainable economic growth and a stable social system – so that working in Russia is beneficial and pleasant.""  Blockchain efforts accelerate  The news comes less than a week after CoinDesk reported on several bitcoin and blockchain-related announcements out of Russia. First, Russia’s central bank is writing a new law focused on bitcoin and other digital currencies, and also, the Bank of Russia is interested in developing a national cryptocurrency.  In May, CoinDesk reported that the Moscow Exchange Group was in the final stages of tests on a blockchain-based stockholder voting platform using the Hyperledger Fabric which the group hoped would lead to an increased sense of comfort from international investors.  CoinDesk reported today that the Moscow Exchange Group was among early participants in a possible Central Securities Depository consortium aimed at leveraging blockchain efficiencies at the highest levels of the financial sector.  Indeed, Russia's government, too, has been exploring applications, with Russian Prime Minister (and close Putin ally) Dmitry Medvedev pushing for research into the tech earlier this year.

42399937,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCCT,1496679993,Nevada Lawmakers Send Blockchain Tax Bill to Governor's Desk,"Legislators in Nevada completed work on a bill to block the taxation of blockchain use.  Public records show the bill, first reported by CoinDesk in March, has unanimously passed both the state Senate and the House of Representatives. The measure was introduced by Senator Ben Kieckhefer, and has since been sent to Governor Brian Sandoval's office for signature.  As previously reported, the Nevada bill – the first of its kind – if signed into law, would keep local jurisdictions from taxing blockchain use.  The text explains:  ""A local governmental entity shall not: (a) Impose any tax or fee on the use of a blockchain or smart contract by any person or entity; (b) Require any person or entity to obtain from the local governmental entity any certificate, license or permit to use a blockchain or smart contract; or (c) Impose any other requirement relating to the use of a blockchain or smart contract by any person or entity.""  The bill also ensures blockchain-based records can be introduced and utilized during ""proceedings"", stipulating that ""if a law requires a record to be in writing, submission of a blockchain which electronically contains the record satisfies the law"".  While the tax aspects of the bill are unique, the legal language mirrors efforts in states like Vermont and Arizona to make blockchain data admissible in court.

42399957,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCSD,1496674951,Walmart: Blockchain Food Tracking Test Results Are 'Very Encouraging',"Global retail giant Walmart hosted a presentation on its work with blockchain during an annual investor event last week.  The company began working with IBM and Tsinghua University of Beijing last year to test blockchain-based supply chain applications, with a particular focus on China's massive pork market. In follow-up statements, Walmart indicated it wanted to apply the tech to various areas – and more recently, CoinDesk reported the company is looking at blockchain as a tracking solution for unmanned delivery vehicles.  The results of the initial trial, though, will arguably set the tenor for Walmart's use of blockchain, and according to the firm, its food-focused testing has produced ""very encouraging"" results.  And this is only the beginning, according to Walmart, which said of the presentation:  ""This is just the start of our blockchain exploration. We plan to continue to test the technology, by including more data attributes, for example. And we will continue to test how we can use it to improve food traceability and transparency by collaborating with others throughout the supply chain. This means farmers and suppliers and other retailers.""  Walmart explained that the technology has helped it reduced the time it takes to track food from days to minutes, enabling more effective response in the event that tainted products are discovered.  ""This will help enable precise and rapid recalls to preserve consumer trust in the food industry, while increasing traceability and transparency of the food system,"" the firm said.

42399946,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCJM,1496671234,IT Firm Fujitsu Debuts Blockchain System for Secure Data Sharing,"Japanese IT firm Fujitsu has developed a new blockchain-based system for securely exchanging data.  Announced on its corporate blog, the release is aimed at companies and organizations that want to exchange data safely but may not have a central hub for doing so. The system’s unveiling comes months after Fujitsu debuted a blockchain product centered around secure document exchange.  Fujitsu is a member of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain consortium, and according to the firm, the system is based on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric.  Fujitsu said it will be holding a demonstration later this week at an event in Tokyo. The plan, the firm said, is to launch a commercial-scale version of the system later this year.  The blog post explained:  ""Fujitsu will expand this software with the goal of commercializing it as part of the Fujitsu Network Virtuora series during fiscal [year] 2017. This will create data exchange networks where people can safely interchange their data across boundaries.""  In addition to its development of blockchain products, Fujitsu has helped other firms in Japan experiment with the tech.

42399947,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCKL,1496668510,Are Sidechains a Better Solution for Bitcoin's Scaling Debate?,"The thinking on sidechains might be shifting.  While historically seen as an avenue for experimentation and increased operability on bitcoin's network, the conversation is now framing the technology as a possible solution to the digital currency's long-standing scaling debate.  The idea behind sidechains is to allow many coins with different sets of rules to be tied to bitcoin. For instance, one sidechain might feature the advanced privacy of MimbleWimble, while another might allow for much larger (or even smaller) block sizes.  The latter is what’s piquing interest in sidechains as a way to circumvent bitcoin’s highly contentious block size debate. It's an idea which could theoretically make everyone happy, according to some.  But it's not that sidechains achieve higher throughput, stressed Paul Sztorc, an economist at Bloq Inc, who invented a sidechain called Drivechain. With this model, though, participants would have the choice to move their bitcoin over to a sidechain with a larger block size (say, 2MB) while still remaining a part of the bitcoin network.  Sidechains or extensions?  However, there have been a flood of other ideas recently proposed for solving the block size issue that sidechains must now contend with.  Extension blocks  , for example, were recently reintroduced by bitcoin startup Purse with the same goal of giving users choice over block sizes.  Yet, some developers, including one of the originators of extension blocks, Blockstream CEO Adam Back, believe extension blocks would downgrade security for users.  This is one reason why Sztorc's Drivechain proposal – where what happens on one chain hypothetically can't negatively impact what happens on others – appears to have the blessing of some developers who have opposed other recent scaling proposals.  Sztorc proposed the solution to the bitcoin developer mailing list, requesting feedback during CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference.  Still, some developers argue it's not one versus the other, but a matter of which technology works better for which applications.  “I can see a few potential use cases for extension blocks, such as adding MimbleWimble support to bitcoin,” said bitcoin developer James Hilliard. “But, I generally see sidechains as better due to the security isolation.""  Yet, some argue that Drivechain (and other variation of sidechains which rely on miners) might not work optimally in the current environment where mining hashrate is concentrated in the hands of a few.  For other developers, it depends on the details.  “In general, [Drivechain] sounds like a fine idea; but specifics are important,” said Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr.  What about 'Segwit2x'?  Back to the issue of scaling, though.  In particular, Sztorc framed Drivechain as a better solution than the Digital Currency Group's (DCG) recently unveiled 'Segwit2x' proposal.  The latter, which aims to steer the industry toward a transaction capacity boost, has found significant backing from bitcoin businesses and miners. For the boost, SegWit2x combines two tech upgrades: an optimization called SegWit, which previously stalled mainly due to lack of miner support, and a boost to bitcoin's block size parameter.  Sztorc, like several others, is skeptical, though.  He told CoinDesk:  ”I’m a little bit concerned about the New York agreement. To summarize, I think it’s a big cost. It’s unlikely to work. And even if it does work, it only gets us 2MB, which is not very much. I’m baffled that people think it’s progress. It’s a very small amount of progress at tremendous effort.”  Instead, he argued, Drivechain is superior for a number of reasons – primarily, perhaps, that sidechains “avoids coercion"".  SegWit2x requires a hard fork to scale the block size to 2MB. That's a boost not everyone in the ecosystem agrees with, partly because it would mean an increase in the amount of data each user needs to store. And the change might lead to a network split if not everyone upgrades their software.  Meanwhile, sidechains don't require a hard fork. And, Sztorc argued, users can spin up a sidechain featuring whatever block size they want, whether 8MB or 50MB, as 2MB is a one-time increase that some argue is too small.  Choices, choices  Further, some in the bitcoin community believe the volunteer developer team around the Bitcoin Core implementation has effectively become a monopoly, suggesting that the group has quashed outside ideas.  Drivechain, according to Sztorc, would eliminate both of these undesired issues, since users would get to choose exactly what they want, and different developer groups could form around different sidechains, boosting developer diversity.  Sztorc suggested Drivechain could be deployed within the same six-month timeframe as DCG's recent proposal, even with the proposal's requirement for a bitcoin soft fork (a backwards-compatible way of making changes to bitcoin’s consensus rules).  This upgrading process has recently become more politicized with SegWit's proposal. But, Sztorc doesn’t think a soft fork will be a problem for Drivechain, since it gives ""everyone what they want"".  Still, as with most other major proposals for improvements to bitcoin's code, the community will have to just wait and see.

42399935,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCBU,1496665805,Why a Swedish MP Is Joining Bitcoin Exchange BTCX,"Mathias Sundin has come a long way since campaigning as the first Swedish politician to exclusively accept bitcoin donations.  After being elected in 2014, Sundin has helped turn the nation’s banks into some of the most progressive in the world when it comes to working with bitcoin startups. And now he’s joined Sweden’s largest bitcoin exchange, BTCX, as chairman of the board.  But Sundin’s involvement with the firm is about more than bringing attention to one of the oldest bitcoin exchanges in Europe.  An entrepreneur in his own right, having co-founded Sweden’s Warp Institute, which aimed to help accelerate technological innovation, Sundin intends to take a hands-on role at the bitcoin exchange.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Even if you don’t care about bitcoin at all, it’s a very exciting startup. So, we’re going to raise money now and probably also expand into other markets in a few countries, in Europe first.""  BTCX is growing at a rate of about 1,200 customers per month, with transaction volume over the same time at around 2 million euros. At the core of the firm's expansion plans lies what Sundin characterized as a willingness by the company to work with established banks, not just disrupt them.  Appeasing the banks  Sundin first met the BTCX team during his 2014 election campaign, when he raised about two bitcoins in donations from 50 donors around the world.  Already a member of the Swedish Parliament with the Liberal party, Sundin had set about transforming himself into a representative of the bitcoin community after reading a New York Times article by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. Reading the article changed his impression of bitcoin as a way to buy ""drugs and mushrooms"" to a way of giving more power to normal people.  Sundin said:  ""I realized this has some real potential to move power from institutions to regular people. That’s the main reason I’m into politics.""  A bitcoin-only exchange when it launched in 2012, BTCX has expanded on that business, introducing, with Sundin’s help in 2015, what it termed a Swedish Bitcoin Embassy aimed at educating the public.  Now registered with the Swedish Tax Authority and the Swedish Financial Supervision Authority, the company’s educational efforts have evolved into what more closely resembles blockchain consulting services, offering lectures for 24,990 Swedish krona or about $3,000.  These lectures originated from an invitation from Sundin shortly after he was elected to address members of Swedish banks, which had been hesitant to offer bitcoin companies bank accounts on the basis of what they were concerned might be underdeveloped regulatory compliance.  BTCX ""could show the banks and everyone else that they're following every regulation,"" Sundin said. ""And they showed the Swedish IRS and everyone that we’re doing everything by the book here and there’s nothing fishy going on.""  The result? BTCX obtained a bank account at Sweden’s largest bank, SEB, and is now helping teach other regional startups how to do the same.  Mainstream dreams  Since then, Sundin said his perception among fellow Parliament members has evolved from being the ""weird and funny"" bitcoin proponent to someone representing a more mainstream interest.  Reacting to news earlier this year that Sweden’s land registry was exploring putting titles on a blockchain, many other government departments have started looking for potential benefits to their own work, Sundin said.  In addition to helping bitcoin startups obtain recognition by Sweden’s banks, Sundin has turned his attention to working with startups outside bitcoin and blockchain and the venture capitalists who support them. Though, Sundin had no comment on Swedish startup Brave New World Investments using cryptocurrencies to facilitate investment in Iran.  BTCX plans to publicly launch a new payment platform this summer, providing businesses a service license. And, later this year, the company plans on releasing a new exchange into stealth mode.  As recently as last Thursday, Sundin met with BTCX, to begin parlaying his experience with startups and investors into an effort to help the company define its future — not only as an entity to itself, but as a leader in the space, helping other Swedish bitcoin companies gain traction.  Sundin explained his attraction to the exchange, saying:  ""I liked what they’re doing in their business. But also the community aspect of it.""

42399942,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCGP,1496662204,The World's Largest CSDs Are Forming a New Blockchain Consortium,"Some of the world's biggest central securities depositories (CSDs) are uniting to build their own blockchain consortium.  Informally called the CSD Working Group on DLT, and comprised of institutions tasked with holding vast amounts of the world's financial instruments, the fledgling consortium is emerging from talks that have been ongoing since last year.  While the formal membership of the group has yet to be revealed, CoinDesk has learned that early participants of the exploratory effort met last month in London and that the work is ongoing.  Hosted by 'Big Four' consulting firm EY, the meeting was designed to give the companies, including the DTCC, Canada’s CDS, the Moscow Exchange Group and South Africa's Strate, a better understanding of how blockchain technology might change their roles in the future.  In interview, the director of Moscow Exchange Group’s National Settlement Depository, Artem Duvanov, explained to CoinDesk the origins of the idea for the consortium and its mission going forward.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We realized there are lots of consortia, but mostly they are for banks. If we talk about CSDs, we don't have our own consortium aimed to our needs. The idea was to create one.""  What started as informal conversations last October have since evolved into the more formal working group, with members including Russia’s National Securities Depository, Switzerland’s SIX Securities Services, the Nordic subsidiary of Nasdaq and Chile's DCV.  Last week, members of the group published the first results of its partnership: a document describing the product requirements for a proxy voting solution for general meetings, built using distributed ledger technology and 'synchronized' with Swift's messaging standard.  Using an unspecified technology, the proposal requires that the platform should accommodate up to 100,000 voting parties and conduct at least 50 transactions per second.  While the official stated objective of the working group is to demonstrate the business value of the technology, Duvanov and Strate CEO Monica Singer revealed to CoinDesk that that is only part of the minimum viable product being tested.  And, though not every member of the working group appears to have been involved in the London meeting, a second objective of the group is to show the value of collaboration in its own right.  ""Basically, we proved that both hypothesis are true,"" said Duvanov.  Network effects  As intermediators, CSDs might at first glance seem ripe to be cut out of the transaction flow by a shared, distributed ledger.  But according to Singer, who 20 years ago helped digitize South Africa's paper-based settlement process, the distributed nature of CSDs actually makes them perfect adopters of the technology.  Global central securities depositories are broken up into six regions, including the Americas' Central Securities Depositories Association (ACSDA), the European Central Securities Depositories Association (ECSDA) and the Africa & Middle East Depositories Association (AMEDA).  To fully capitalize on that distribution the goal of the consortium, according to Singer, who is also the vice president of AMEDAhttp://www.ameda.org.eg/What_About, is to gather leading CSDs from each of the regions, and then grow from there.  Singer echoed a sentiment also expressed by Duvanov that each depository on its own is already largely optimized to provide the best possible service to banks, brokers and other financial institutions, but that efficiencies can be achieved in the overarching network.  By working together to ensure that CSDs from each region are represented, Singer said the consortium could potentially unleash network effects previously unimagined by any single member.  Singer said:  ""I have a mandate from my region that whatever we discover in the blockchain space I will bring it to the region, and I will bring it with me. So you want to uplift everybody.""  Focus on standards  Still, even as the members are expected to share knowledge about how to optimize their services for blockchain, Duvanov emphasized they are not currently building a single solution. Rather, each group is building its own platform designed to interoperate with the others.  For example, in May, CoinDesk reported on the Moscow Exchange Group's e-proxy voting solution built using Hyperledger Fabric, and in February we reported on Strate’s early experiments using Chain, Hyperledger, Corda and ethereum.  To help ensure each consortium member’s technology interoperates, Duvanov said he met early on with Swift's head of standards, Stephen Lindsay, in an effort to align the various efforts with the ISO20022 messaging standard.  ""We don’t have the ambition yet to create a new standard,"" said Duvanov. ""We are just trying to ensure that we are all moving in the same direction.""  Swift's head of research and development, Damien Vanderveken, confirmed with CoinDesk in a statement that his company was providing support to the working group to help them leverage existing business standards for the distributed ledger technology application.  ""ISO 20022 will provide a great foundation, in terms of both existing business content and approach,"" said Vanderveken. ""That can accelerate the implementation and acceptance of DLT technology for industrial solutions.""  As for Singer, she expects the founding membership to consist of the DTCC, Canada’s CDS, The Moscow Exchange Group and Strate, while Duvanov predicted the group could include as many as six depositories.  Not all CSDs belonging to the working group are actively participating in the development of proxy voting case. However, Duvanov expects more members will eventually take part.    ""When we start moving this working group closer to standardization, I think the everyone will participate more closely,"" he said.  Expanded applications  Currently, the potential founding members of the CSD consortium are in discussions to help define the parameters of the collaborative effort, according to Duvanov – a process he expects to end in the coming months.  In addition to seeking more efficient ways of voting using blockchain tech, Singer says a proof-of-concept is currently being tested for an undisclosed application that, if successful, could eventually help connect the US and Canada.  Further, Duvanov reported early work conducted by Russia's NSD to move commercial papers to a blockchain is also being considered for possible integration.  Duvanov concluded:  ""The next step will be to create the consortium, which will be an official legal entity and it will not be limited to one use case, it will have many use cases.""

42399982,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzCNI,1496656839,Back to Basics for Blockchain Tokens?,"Finally, there’s something that virtually the whole cryptocurrency sector can agree on: digital tokens are hot.  Several recent token issuances have sold out in minutes or even less – and many more are in the pipeline. And while the potential is intriguing, especially for some use cases, the current enthusiasm is disconcerting, leading many observers to dust off the word 'bubble'.  How long this can go on for is unclear. But recent deals reveal what could be the beginning of an encouraging trend away from a focus on easy financing and toward one that prioritizes utility.  When the initial coin offering (ICO) craze started, it was hailed as a more democratic way to raise funds for startups. It allowed blockchain-based businesses to bypass the traditional venture capital (VC) and bank lending routes by realizing a type of crowdfunding that gave participants the right to use the service and/or participate in future profits.  The more that people wanted to use the service or believed in its profitability, the higher the price of the token would rise.  At least, that's the theory.  The runaway success of some issuances encouraged speculators to bet that others would have a similar success, and when institutional investors started to get involved, the relative scarcity of tokens compared to the amount of funds looking for high-return opportunities pushed the prices up even further. The fundamentals of the underlying projects seemed to dwindle in significance, and firms with no revenue model or even working product found it relatively easy to raise funds.  Ecosystem shift  However, the recent news around three unusual digital token issuers reveals a shift in priorities, as all of them already have working products and VC funding. So, rather than seeing token sales as an alternative to more rigorous financing methods, all seem to focus on a more fundamental characteristic – the incentivisation of an ecosystem.  Last week, messenger app Kik announced that it was planning a blockchain-based token sale for June. Its main purpose is to encourage its 15 million monthly users to transact more within the app. The company has already raised $120m in venture capital funding, and has been operating for seven years. Replacing VCs as a source of funds does not sound like the main objective.  Also last week, blockchain startup Blockstack released a decentralized browser aimed at making apps more easily accessible, and revealed plans for a type of coin issue to power the network. Again, it doesn’t seem to be about bypassing the VCs – Blockstack has already raised over $5m in capital from high-profile institutional investors.  The ICO of internet browser Brave, completed earlier this week, distributed a chunk of utility tokens (created to incentivize use of its new ad-serving platform) to investors. It raised $35m, which dwarfs the initial VC financing of $4.5m and makes it the highest-grossing ICO to date. More unusual is the speed (it was sold out in under 30 seconds) and the concentration – all tokens went to a group of about 130 investors.  Bigger picture  While that may seem in contradiction with the principle of 'democratizing investment', it does serve to highlight the problematic consequences of too much hype.  This increased awareness could encourage a redesign of upcoming issuances, triggering a period of self-regulation by the sector to ensure fair distribution and practical application. For instance, limits could be placed on the amount of coins that can be issued to investors rather than users, as well as the amount any one investor can purchase. This would provide the sector with a much-needed return to basics, and should be of interest to startups, enterprises and regulators alike.  Blockchain-based tokens provide an ingenious way to fuse practicality and buy-in. And once the speculative fervor dies down, they can revert to the original purpose of incentivizing development and testing adoption, with limited risk and without violating any securities laws.  Effectively, they can go back to kickstarting the initial bootstrap phase of a product. This should sound familiar – it’s the same premise that bitcoin was founded on.
