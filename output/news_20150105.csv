42426233,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGLrh,1420496975,Bitstamp Claims $5 Million Lost in Hot Wallet Hack,"Update (6th January 15:20 GMT): Slovenian state-owned news agency STA is reporting that Bitstamp expects to resume services within 24 hours.      Bitstamp has released a new statement regarding the security of its website, admitting that it has lost ""less than 19,000 BTC"", about $5.1m at press time.  The revelation follows the disclosure that Bitstamp's wallet system was compromised, prompting it to halt deposits and later shut down its platform entirely.  According to the statement, an undisclosed number of wallets were compromised and upon learning of the breach, the Bitstamp team issued warnings about deposits and moved to suspend operations. Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič said that all other funds held by the bitcoin exchange are secure in cold storage, stating:  “This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp’s total bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are are held in secure offline cold storage systems. We would like to reassure all Bitstamp customers that their balances held prior to our temporary suspension of services will not be affected and will be honored in full.”  Kodrič added that Bitstamp is working with law enforcement officials during what he said was an ongoing investigation into the incident.  Site still offline  The statement suggests that Bitstamp may remain offline during infrastructure changes.  Calling the shutdown a “disruption”, Kodrič said a process to shift data to more secure server space is underway. No indication was given as to when the exchange will actually open its doors to withdrawals or trades.  “We are working to transfer a secure backup of the Bitstamp site onto a new safe environment and will be bringing this online in the coming days,” he said.  The full statement from Kodrič reads:    ""Bitstamp customers can rest assured that their bitcoins held with us prior to temporary suspension of services on January 5th (at 9am UTC) are completely safe and will be honored in full.      On January 4th, some of Bitstamp’s operational wallets were compromised, resulting in a loss of less than 19,000 BTC. Upon learning of the breach, we immediately notified all customers that they should no longer make deposits to previously issued bitcoin deposit addresses. As an additional security measure, we suspended our systems while we fully investigate the incident and actively engage with law enforcement officials.    This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp’s total bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are are held in secure offline cold storage systems. We would like to reassure all Bitstamp customers that their balances held prior to our temporary suspension of services will not be affected and will be honored in full.    We appreciate customers’ patience during this disruption of services. We are working to transfer a secure backup of the Bitstamp site onto a new safe environment and will be bringing this online in the coming days. Customers can stay informed via updates on our website, on Twitter (@Bitstamp) and through Bitstamp customer support at support@bitstamp.net.""

42426214,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGE3h,1420492697,Vault of Satoshi Founders Close Bitcoin Exchange to Focus on Netflix Startup,"The owners of Vault of Satoshi have announced that they will be closing the notable Canada-based bitcoin exchange on 5th February due to the ""insane"" growth of a new business venture.  Though short on details in the official announcement, Vault of Satoshi co-founder Mike Curry told CoinDesk that the success of new venture TurboFlix has encouraged the exchange's owners to switch focus. Launched six months ago, the service has gained popularity by allowing global Netflix users to bypass restrictions that limit their movie libraries.  Throughout the conversation, however, Curry stressed that the decision is a personal one for himself and his co-founder Ryan van Barneveld, and that it shouldn't be perceived as a bearish sentiment toward the wider bitcoin market.  Curry said:  ""If I wasn’t involved in [TurboFlix], I would still be running Vault of Satoshi because it’s very attractive. We set up the infrastructure for basically a financial services company. We’ve done everything the best way possible.""  The co-founder's statements reflect the difficulty of running a financial services businesses; Curry cited the 9-to-5 nature of TurboFlix's business model as a benefit. When faced with a choice between the businesses, the founders suggested that they felt that splitting time between the initiatives would have been a disservice to Vault of Satoshi customers.  ""TurboFlix is doing everything we need it to do and it’s going well, and its not very needy,"" he said.  Curry went on to explain that while Vault of Satoshi is not actively pursuing a buyer, it is open to conversations that could lead to a transfer of ownership. The news comes amid the ongoing issues at leading US dollar bitcoin exchange Bitstamp, which earlier today suspended operations.  Withdrawal process detailed  In a notice posted to both its homepage and on Reddit, Vault of Satoshi said that it will no longer process deposits but that access to funds and withdrawal requests will be available until 5th February.  Vault acknowledged the potential for customers to draw comparison between it and Bitstamp’s issues, stating:  “We expect there will be some speculation as to why the Vault is going to be sealed forever, and we’d like to reassure the community that it has absolutely nothing to do with insolvency, stolen funds or any other unfortunate scenario.”  The company explained that it wants to focus more directly on its content streaming service, due to its impressive growth. Though Curry did not provide user figures, Facebook data shows that TurboFlix has already amassed more fans in just six months, 18,000 compared to the 3,700 for the year-old Vault of Satoshi.  Curry affirmed both in the post and the interview that he is still passionate about bitcoin, and that TurboFlix uses the digital currency as a payment option. Further, he is still bullish on the long-term potential of the technology.  ""We made a decision that we could wait for this to become a lot bigger. It’s just so much effort compared to something that takes little effort and is doing so well,"" he said.  Sale still possible  Curry indicated that Vault of Satoshi has been in talks with unnamed exchanges about a potential acquisition, but that the company opted to close owing to the likelihood of a long sale process.  ""We got a bit of interest from some other exchanges and that’s about it,"" Curry explained. ""It’s just quicker for us to just close the site rather than go into some six-month agreement. We just want to move on with our winning horse.""  Curry went on to speculate that Vault of Satoshi will likely receive purchase offers, and encouraged those who are interested to reach out to the exchange's general mailbox.  ""At this point, if we were to get an offer from a legitimate trustworthy partner, we would consider [selling] it. Everything is fine, the exchange is great,"" he said.  The entrepreneur added that he suspects Vault of Satoshi could still grow to dominate Canada's still-small bitcoin market under a different ownership. The exchange currently has five employees.  Vault of Satoshi's impact  Vault of Satoshi was long one of the more popular bitcoin exchanges in Canada and one of the more well-known exchanges from the country internationally.  The company was well-connected in the bitcoin ecosystem, and at times ambitious with the products it offered the market. However, it did face issues in some jurisdictions, notably pulling out of the US market in March of last year.  Though also not available in the US due to the fact that a full movie library is made available to residents, Curry said that he expects the future for TurboFlix to be just as bright.  The service opened up a private beta this summer to 10,000 users, igniting online interest in Canada where Netflix's full libraries are not available.  Curry decline to speculate on whether he thought TurboFlix was a better long-term business model, adding:  ""I’m not too sure, it’s definitely fun.""  Stan Higgins contributed to this report.

42426221,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGEFh,1420487138,California Delays Formal Decision on Bitcoin Regulation,"California’s financial services and money transmitters regulator did not rule on whether it would regulate bitcoin at a scheduled December meeting.  The meeting of California’s Department of Business Oversight (DBO) was first revealed in early December by Bloomberg. Though details were scarce, spokesperson Tom Dresslar said at the time that the state was seeking to determine whether regulating bitcoin and digital currencies was in the best interest of consumers.  Dresslar told CoinDesk that though no action was taken at the meeting, the DBO still expects to come to a decision regarding when and how it might regulate digital currencies, stating:  “We’re still deliberating, we’ll be making a decision in the near future. But, there’s nothing more to add [at this time].”  Dresslar declined to comment on when another meeting to discuss the subject might take place, why no decision was made at the original meeting or what might have been discussed during that hearing.  While forthcoming, such an action could prove influential, as California was home to roughly 40% of all bitcoin professionals as of mid-2014. A number of leading bitcoin companies also call the area home, including Coinbase, ChangeTip and Ripple Labs.  The actions would follow the approval of Assembly Bill 129, a measure that granted bitcoin and a host of other alternative forms of value the status of “legal money” under California law.

42426212,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGE1h,1420470291,ChangeTip Brings Bitcoin Tipping to Social Media Cynics,"Bitcoin micropayments startup ChangeTip has introduced a new feature that lets users receive tips without a social media account.  Currently, ChangeTip users can tip one another via accounts linked to their social networks, including Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr and GooglePlus. However, One Time Tip Link now allows registered users to send bitcoin tips directly to a person’s email address, using a one-time link.  Email or text tips  In fact, the recipient does not even have to have an email, as users can send tips via Skype or any kind of messaging service. This obviously expands the potential of using small tips to bring bitcoin to a broader audience that may or may not be tech savvy.  Although the sender needs a social media-linked Changetip account, the recipient doesn't need an internet presence to receive the tip – the service also works via SMS.  Victoria van Eykhttps://www.changetip.com/tipme/victoria  , VP of community development at ChangeTip, explained:  ""I’ve used this feature to tip cab drivers who are interested in bitcoin, friends and to show others how easy it is to send bitcoin over different mediums. I plan on tipping some journalists tonight who may not have a Twitter handle.""  As for the tipper, using the One Time Tip Link is straightforward – users simply need to log into their ChangeTip account, click ‘One Time Tip’, set the amount and send their tip.  Alternative use cases  ChangeTip said the use of one-time tips could create entirely new use cases for its service. The company pointed out that the community often uses its products in ways it hadn't anticipated.  Van Eyk said:  ""Adam Guerbuez had a little giveaway – the first people to click his link won some money through the One Time Tip link. Martin Holland over at OurEverydayEarth.com set up an online scavenger hunt, by hiding money in posts online.""  ChangeTip added that the new feature could be used to devise and hold unique online contests, due to the privacy offered to both parties involved in the process.  The company maintains that it takes privacy seriously. Last month CEO Nick Sullivan told CoinDesk that the company enforces a strict privacy policy, dismissing recent criticism of its business model and off-blockchain tips in general.  Roughly a month ago, the company announced the successful completion of a seed funding round, amounting to $3.5m. The round was led by Pantera Capital and included 500 Startups, CryptoCurrency Partners, Idealab and Boldstart Ventures.

42426223,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGENh,1420462192,Markets Weekly: Bitcoin's New Year Starts With a Crash,"Bitcoin's price crashed over the New Year weekend, losing $51 over two days. According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, the currency opened on Saturday at $314.59 and closed the following day at $263.63.  The plunging price got market watchers chattering as Sunday drew to a close. Unsurprisingly, a contingent of bitcoin watchers put a positive spin on the price crash, viewing it as a buying opportunity, albeit with a note of alarm.  Even among bitcoin bulls, Tim Draper's call for Russian ruble-holders to switch from their rapidly devaluing sovereign currency was particularly ill-timed:  Another flash crash?  So, what triggered the crash? One theory is that savvy short-sellers timed their move for the thinly traded holiday season, betting on setting off a cascading margin-call as they nudged the price down.  As the price moved against traders with leveraged long positions – perhaps banking on a rise in the bitcoin price, which was trading at 2014 lows in December – a rising number of leveraged positions were closed, with coins liquidated at the prevailing price.  In other words, it's another 'flash crash' triggered by margin calls of the sort the market saw in August. Back then, a series of big intra-day declines drove the price from the $600 level to under $500.  That's the theory offered by Alistair Milne, the portfolio manager at the Monaco-based Altana Digital Currency Fund. Milne says he saw sell orders for hundreds of coins with no limit price appear on the order book of Bitfinex over the weekend, which he took as a sign that leveraged positions were being automatically closed by the exchange.  A sharp drop in leveraged long positions lends support to Milne's theory. US dollar swaps on Bitfinex fell by $2.48m or 12% over the weekend, as the price plummeted. Traders on the platform use dollar swaps if they want to bet on margin that bitcoin's price will rise.  Still, the closed leveraged long positions of $2.48m on Bitfinex is small when compared with a total of $82.7m-worth of trades in the BTC/USD markets across all exchanges tracked by Bitcoinity.  Open short swaps have also risen steeply against long swaps. Over the last 24 hours, the portion of short swaps has risen 25 points, from 63% to 88%. In other words Bitfinex traders are continuing to bet that the price of bitcoin will fall.  Money never sleeps, except at Christmas  The Christmas and New Year holidays could have played a critical role in this short-sellers haven. Exchanges are thinly traded over the holiday period, with a fall of 24% in the final week of December compared to a week earlier, for example.  Then there are the practicalities of modern banking. With banks closed over the holidays, traders could be caught without dry powder in their cryptocurrency trading accounts, unable to top up fiat funds when they need to. It all adds up to optimum conditions for short-sellers wishing to trigger margin calls.  Milne said:  ""If you boil it all down, the price of bitcoin is firmly in the hands of the speculators. It looks to me like experienced traders with resources are exploiting inexperienced enthusiasts who should not be using leverage.""  Some traders think the price has further to fall. Arthur Hayes of BitMEX says more pronouncements of bitcoin's failure as an asset class – of the sort found on Bitcoin Obituaries, for example – need to hit the market before a bottom is found.  ""Not enough capitulation yet. Need a couple more media outlets saying, 'I told you so' about bitcoin being a bad investment,"" he said.  Gavin Smith at derivatives provider First Global Credit advises a similar wait and see approach, noting that the price could fall further before hitting a bottom.  The silver lining for bitcoin bulls now might be an opportunity to enter the market at lows that haven't been seen since November 2013, before the cryptocurrency's historic bull-run.  Milne, for one, says he's hearing from investors who are looking to load up on coins at these prices for the long term.

42426227,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGEPh,1420445811,"Bitstamp Reports Hot Wallet Issue, Tells Customers to Not Deposit Bitcoin","UPDATE (5th January 09:43 GMT): Bitstamp has been temporarily suspended from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index as its API has been unavailable since 09:13 GMT.  UPDATE (5th January 09:40 GMT): Statements from Bitstamp have been added to this article.      Bitstamp announced today it was suspending services after it ""detected problems"" with its hot wallet, initially stopping withdrawals and warning customers not to attempt bitcoin deposits.  Once again, confusion reigned on bitcoin discussion forums as interested parties speculated on what and how large the problems might be at the world's second-busiest USD exchange.  The company has now replaced its regular main page with a statement saying ""we have reason to believe that one of Bitstamp’s operational wallets was compromised on January 4th, 2015"".  It warns customers not to make deposits to previously-issued bitcoin addresses, stating in bold text that deposits to these addresses ""cannot be honored"", but reassured them that it holds a large majority of its bitcoins in cold wallets, and had ample supplies to cover any deposits made before 5th January, 2015, 9:00 UTC.  Bitstamp takes our security and soundness very seriously. In an excess of caution, we are suspending service as we continue to investigate. We will return to service and amend our security measures as appropriate.  Worries at silence  Concerns had mounted for hours over Bitstamp's apparent silence. At 9:27 GMT, however, CEO Nejc Kodrič calmed some nerves by tweeting the following apology:  Stop sending bitcoins  The issue first came to attention when reddit user 'Tsuyoku Narital' posted that he had attempted to deposit bitcoins twice to a Bitstamp account, but the amounts had vanished before reaching his balance.  After the user contacted Bitstamp's customer support, he received the following emailed reply:    Dear customer,      Today our transaction processing server detected problems with our hot wallet and stopped processing withdrawals.    You should STOP SENDING bitcoin deposits to your Bitstamp account IMMEDIATELY as private keys of your deposit address may be lost.    Your bitcoins already deposited with us are stored in a cold wallet and can not be affected.    We will send you more info as soon as possible.    Best regards,    Bitstamp team    It also posted the following message on users' main Account Balances page:  The phrase ""previously provided addresses"" led some to wonder if Bitstamp was suffering the kinds of problems with re-used random number values that plagued Blockchain wallets a couple of weeks ago.  Bitstamp's reputation  Slovenia-based Bitstamp became the world's busiest USD bitcoin exchange in July 2013 when it overtook the troubled Mt Gox. It has since lost that crown to Hong Kong's Bitfinex. The three busiest bitcoin exchanges in the world by total BTC traded per day are BTC China, OKCoin and Huobi.  The company has generally been respected within the bitcoin community. In May 2014 it passed a proof-of-bitcoin-reserves audit overseen by BitcoinJ developer Mike Hearn, and in June it beat other bitcoin companies to win the Europas' Best Virtual Currency Startup Award.

42426222,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGEJh,1420433291,Bitcoin Messenger App GetGems Raises $400k From Waze Investor,"Magma VC has invested $400,000 in decentralised social messaging startup GetGems (formerly Gems).  The funding marks the first VC investment for the widely anticipated crypto 2.0 project, which seeks to incentivise social messaging users through the use of GEMZ, a native token issued on Counterparty that allows users to profit from the platform’s growth.  The news comes amid GetGems’ ongoing crowdsale, the first hosted by IDG-backed decentralised application development platform Koinify. Since its 1st December launch, GetGems has raised $600,000 through the sale, bringing its total funding to roughly $1m.  Magma VC  general partner Ran Achituv framed the investment as just another example of how his firm is able to identify disruptive trends early. In addition to GetGems, Magma VC was an early investor in community-based traffic and navigation app Waze, which was purchased for $1.1bn by Google in 2013.  Achituv told CoinDesk:  ”We are looking for disruption, differentiation, distribution and a great winning team. We felt Gems has very good characteristics in all four parameters. Chat and value transfer is a growing trend.”  GetGems CEO Daniel Peled further expressed his belief that Magma VC would in turn increase its chances of success in the long term.  “The additional funding will help us scale our company faster which is necessary since the mainstream instant messaging market is very competitive,” Peled said.  Announced in October, the GetGems encrypted messaging service is now available on Android. Gems plans to introduce its basic iOS app, wallet and token system and advertising platform in 2015 using funds from its ongoing crowdsale.  Community support proves essential  Unlike a recent investment made by 10x Venture Partners as part of a crowdsale for e-commerce software developer Ziftr, Magma’s investment has not been made in the GEMZ tokens directly.  However, Achituv indicated that the crowdsale did inform his team's decision to back GetGems, stating that the support of the community provided assurance of the project's viability.  “We hope our investment as a well-known venture capital firm would also increase the bitcoin community as well as general public's trust in GetGems as a platform and therefore its cryptocurrency will have an increasing value,” Achituv added.  Following its $100m fund in 2013, the Israeli seed-stage investment group raised a $150m fund in September. Achituv suggested Magma may seek to support additional startups in the digital currency field with this capital.  “We believe in the blockchain and cryptocurrency as a macro trend and if the right opportunity is found we're open to investing,” he said.  The appeal of crypto 2.0  While GetGems marks Magma’s first investment in the bitcoin ecosystem, Achituv said that the service, operated by Decentrlized Mobile Applications Ltd, was not the first from the industry his firm considered, having vetted a number of bitcoin mining companies in 2013.  Perhaps most notably, however, Achituv voiced his belief that Gems was attractive as it is not wholly dependant on the price of bitcoin, but rather leverages its technological benefits to provide value for consumers.  “We're looking for investments that control their destiny on their own and create new solutions and value. What we are seeing now is not directly on bitcoin, it's more trying to leverage the benefits of the technology for new use cases and capabilities,” he added.  Achituv indicated that he believes GetGems could prove influential in inspiring other businesses to consider leveraging the capabilities of bitcoin in similar ways.
