42378020,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpNn,1424128855,Commonwealth Secretariat to Explore Bitcoin in the Developing World,"The Commonwealth Secretariat is set to hold a hearing on digital currencies from 17th to 18th February to identify how the nascent technology might benefit consumers in the developing world.  Called the Virtual Currency Round Table, the two-day event will feature representatives from Europol, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Interpol and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  Deputy secretary general of the Commonwealth Secretariat Josephine Ojiambo indicated in statements that the intent of the meeting is to highlight the benefits of bitcoin and other digital currencies, while also noting the risks involved.  Ojiambo said:  “This meeting will help member countries guard against risks and identify ways virtual currencies can contribute to future social and economic development.”  At the end of the two-day event, the Commonwealth Secretariat indicated it will issue recommendations that would inform a “next phase” of research in the area.  The main intergovernmental organisation behind the Commonwealth of Nations, the association includes 53 states in Africa, Asia the Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific, including such notable markets as New Zealand, India and South Africa.  Risks and rewards  Ojiambo went on to note, that while bitcoin does post risks, the meeting is meant to focus on both the positive and negative attributes of the technology.  In particular, she noted that digital currencies can provide certainty of payment, improved transaction times and reduced transaction fees.  Further, Ojiambo indicated that such benefits “will need to be considered” when the body reviews existing national regulatory and criminal law framework. The full release went on to suggest that participants could discuss using mutual legal assistance, agreements between countries that would enforce laws related to the technology.  Virtual currencies are being considered under the Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, a collaborative effort created in 2011 by member nations to address cybercrime.

42377993,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpBD,1424124054,Policy Experts Talk Transparency in Bitcoin at Foreign Affairs Event,"Emerging digital currency protocols have enormous potential to transform payments as we know them today. And with more time and more clarity, industry insiders believe that promise can manifest in digital banking and digital identities.  This was the subject of a day-long meeting hosted by US-based journal Foreign Affairsat the Council on Foreign Relations townhouse in New York on Thursday, during which three expert panels spoke in front of an assembly of bank and tech experts and enthusiasts.  Anne Shere Wallwork, a senior counselor for strategic policy at the US Department of the Treasury, said her organisation supports financial innovation and more efficient transfers to bring more people into the financial system – but that it needs companies in the ecosystem to comply with a certain set of standards.  There’s no requirement to impose regulation on the bitcoin or Ripple protocols, she confirmed, but when anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) controls apply or if there’s a node engaging with the fiat system, there need to be protections in place.  The difficulty is in establishing standards.  ""The Bank for International Settlements is concerned with all of these issues that, in this country, are dealt with more on a state-by-state basis,” Wallwork said. “But, I think that probably there will be some push if this industry is to obtain trust and obtain greater traction and legitimacy. How are they going to meet those requirements?”  Access to the global banking system  To date, making cross-border payments has been slow, expensive and perhaps difficult relative to the alternative that digital currencies provide. Digital banking is becoming more common in the developed world, but it remains true elsewhere that sending money abroad requires that the recipient have access to a bank branch.  Karen Gifford is the chief compliance officer at Ripple Labs and has eight years’ experience counseling and representing the New York Fed. She said smaller banks don’t really have direct access to the exclusionary global financial system.  “Accessing that network [of banks] is expensive,” she said. “It can cost $1m just to set up a correspondent account to have access to the global financial system with one of these correspondent banks.”  Emerging technologies like the Ripple protocol, she said, offer a solution whereby banks can offer their clients correspondent banking services and be competitive with the bigger banks – faster and more affordably.  Advantageous as this is for US banks, she implied that a fragmented regulatory system could put off the impact of new technologies for a while, stating:  “Payments are the backbone of the financial system. We have a national economy. The idea that we are going to create a fragmented payments system by state just makes me sad.”  “I think America should be one economy,” she added.  Wallwork said that from an AML/CTF perspective, she agrees there’s a need to have consistent standards nationally, and feels states recognize it as well.  There is a de-facto national standard, she said. Each state assumes the attitude that if a company complies with FinCEN’s Banking Secrecy Act, it is compliant with the needs of the state.  However, she added: “On the one hand we did get rid of regional and state banking requirements, but we still have a system where banks are still regulated in part by the banking authorities and in part by states.”  Rules-based, risk-based regulation  Gaining access to the banking system is also a major concern for emerging digital currency companies and startups.  These regulatory variations – at the state level and the level of the traditional financial system – present the next level of friction in the ecosystem, according to Brian Stoeckert, managing director of digital currency consulting firm CoinComply.  “Whether people want to believe this or not,” he said, “if you’re in the regulated financial services world of digital currency, you need – if you want to operate – a US bank account because you want to have ACH or wire transfers.”  But companies are grappling with how to give confidence to regulators, bank authorities and customers; how to dispel fears around money laundering, security and fraud; how to reassure all parties that they won’t become victims of events like the ones that brought bitcoin into the limelight.  “You need to address those risks, you need to have consumer confidence,” said John Beccia, general counsel and chief compliance officer at digital money platform Circle Internet Financial. “People need to feel that this is another legitimate payments vehicle and so you need to have that [regulation] in place.”  He added that Circle does full KYC procedures, venturing that it might even do more than traditional banks. It looks at IP addresses, geo-location, document validation, visual recognition – a technology company can build its KYC system from the ground up, without having to work with legacy systems.  This is an industry where new companies seem to sprout up daily. Stoeckert said the market demand for engagement is significant, and that although there is a lack of faith in trustful companies, there is an increasing number of them putting consumers at ease.  “Is that going to push the traditional financial institutions to try and keep up? I absolutely think so. I think they’re going to be in a hard position to do that,” he said.  He added:  “The more we hear about these privacy data leaks and cybersecurity aspects, I wonder if that’s going to be the backend to more digital currency-based methods […] Maybe there’s going to come a time where people don’t want to be able to turn over that much information for day-to-day purchases, and that may end up being a use case for it.”  Digital identity and financial autonomy  Millennials are a highly digital demographic moving the payments industry of the developed world. They are 20 to 35 years old, 52% of them have used mobile payments and 18% expect to use digital currencies on a weekly basis by 2020.  “[They’re] looking at the technology, growing up in technology, [there’s] very minimal use of the traditional financial system right now,” Stoeckert said. “They get paid in ACH, they utilize and transfer money through mobile devices, they share rides, they share apartments – the sharing mechanism is a key component that we’re looking at.”  But in the developing world that doesn’t have access to the global banking system and where individuals might not have access to banking services, digital identity is the heart of the matter.  Lack of identity is precisely the issue with the so-called “unbanked”, said Michael Casey, a Wall Street Journal global finance senior columnist and co-author of The Age of Cryptocurrency. He argues that there is enormous economic power in giving people their identity and creditworthiness.  He said:  “Whether or not they have the documents themselves there’s just no way to prove who you are. You can own your land but you can’t mortgage it and turn it into an asset as we can, and that just retards growth.”  “If we build identities around these alternative measures,” he added, “the concern is always that the centralized figure – whether it’s Google or PayPal – owns your information.""  It was perhaps Casey that spoke most directly to the abilities of bitcoin to influence the global financial system, adding:  ""This is where the blockchain comes in: Give people the power to recognize that they can withhold certain information because they can control it.”  Images via Tanaya Macheel for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/16/policy-experts-talk-transparency-in-bitcoin-at-foreign-affairs-event,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3d28386c458c4eca7f431eafdb81c341132b667-1262x523.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377996,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpHV,1424118938,eToro CEO Joins Board at Bitcoin Startup Colu,"Fresh off $2.5m in funding, colored coins startup Colu has announced eToro CEO Yoni Assia has joined its board of directors.  The founder and CEO of what’s billed as “the world’s largest social investment network”, Assia has long been an active member of the bitcoin community. For example, eToro first enabled bitcoin trading for the estimated 2.75m users of its platform in January 2014.  Perhaps most notably, however, Assia is credited as one of the originators of the concept of colored coins – that metadata in the bitcoin protocol could be used to augment bitcoins so that they could represent other assets.  Key to his participation, Assia indicated, is that he believes Colu will release applications that will help position it as the “standard for bitcoin 2.0”.  Assia told CoinDesk:  ”I believe that bitcoin 2.0, specifically the usage of the blockchain itself for different transactions is the killer application of bitcoin. Colu is a great team that will build a platform to enable these transactions, Colu will make it possible for non-bitcoin companies to easily integrate this technology and for users to use 2.0 for different everyday applications.”  Colu CEO Amos Meiri likewise indicated that he is happy to have Assia on the board given that the two have often worked closely together, both on colored coins and while working as head of dealing at eToro.  “We share the same vision and passion when it comes to 2.0 and I am very excited to keep working closely with him,” he said.  The decision marks the first time that Assia has been formally associated with a bitcoin company, though he helped establish the Israeli Bitcoin Association.  Colored coins advocate  The move may not be surprising given Assia’s long interest in the crypto 2.0 space. For example, the official Colored Coins foundation blog, which is also helmed by Meiri, recalls Assia's early interest in using colored bitcoins to trade gold.  Assia still sees bitcoin as analogous to gold, and believes Colu is a company that can help bitcoin develop into a platform for asset trading.  “Once bitcoin becomes the standard blockchain for digital assets, then its value will become like gold,” Assia said. “Think about owning a part of the TCP/IP protocol in the late 1980s, knowing it will gain value with every packet sent.”  Assia indicated that such use cases, in his opinion, are key to bitcoin gaining long-term value, arguing that any alternative use of the bitcoin blockchain, in turn, makes it more valuable.  He went on to describe himself as long interested in the convergence of finance and tech, adding that his discovery of bitcoin in 2010 has only propelled this interest.  Open to the industry  Though he will work closely with the Colu team, Assia indicated that he is open to working with other startups in the colored coins space to bring new ideas to life.  He said he is most excited about the use of colored coins for asset trading.  “As I am personally involved in Internet finance, I am interested in how financial assets could be created on the blockchain and how a public ledger technology could simplify a lot of the process in the financial industry,” he added.  Colu has indicated it will first focus on using bitcoin tokens for authentication, but that such use cases are in its development pipeline.  More recently, members of the wider colored coins community have come together with the aim of developing a technical standard for interoperability through Colored Coins, the foundation, one that Meiri has indicated is expected to be released soon.

42378003,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpLH,1424104536,New York Councilman: Bitcoin Could Save City Millions,"Last Thursday New York City councilman Mark Levine introduced a bill petitioning for the city to accept bitcoin as payment for fines and fees.  Levine opened up about the bill, which he says could be passed as early as June, in a new interview with CoinDesk, indicating that he believes New York City has a pressing incentive to begin accepting the payment method due to its cost advantages when compared to credit cards.  The democrat from the 7th District in northern Manhattan recalls that it was this benefit that led him to introduce the bill, one that will now go through a process of gathering co-sponsors, before heading to a vote with the city’s technology committee and finally a full vote in the city council.  Levine told CoinDesk:  ”It started with realizing how much money the city of New York is losing on transaction fees on credit cards, ultimately it’s several million a year because of all sorts of fees and fines.”  Levine added that if the city were to partner with an intermediary in accepting bitcoin, it would bear some costs, but that these would still be less than those charged by payment card providers.  While Levine is optimistic about an expedited timeline for the bill, he indicated that the end-of-June estimate is far from concrete.  “There’s a lot of uncertainty in the process,” he said.  Message to entrepreneurs  Yet another benefit to accepting bitcoin, Levin said, is the message that New York City is an innovator that deserves the attention of entrepreneurs considering Silicon Valley as the hub for their endeavors.  Levine framed New York City as “in competition” with areas like Silicon Valley and Boston when seeking to attract top tech talent, and framed bitcoin as a key differentiator that could provide value to city.  “I think that being the first major city in the US to make this move sends a clear signal that we’re innovators here,” Levine said.  New York has already positioned itself as at the forefront of developments in the bitcoin space, with its introduction of the proposed 'BitLicense', the first state-specific bitcoin regulation in the US.  Further, the city was home to the first physical bitcoin center, Bitcoin Center NYC, opened at the start of 2014.  Negative reactions  Though excited and optimistic about his proposal, Levine indicated that some of his peers in the New York City council have taken issue with the bill and the idea of accepting bitcoin.  “Some of the reactions I’ve gotten in the last few days are concerns that bitcoin is the ‘Wild West’ of currencies,” he said.  The councilman indicated that he countered such claims as ill-informed, arguing to his colleagues that the city accepts cash, the “ultimate untraceable financial instrument”.  Levine, however, framed the ongoing discussion by the New York State Financial Services Department (NYDFS) over its BitLicense proposal as one that would likely help “calm the nerves” of those in the state government, though he indicated it would not directly affect the outcome of the bill.  For bitcoin community members, he also clarified a provision of the bill that would enable the city to accept fees for bitcoin transactions, arguing that, while the city would be looking to pass on the cost of the transaction to payees, the fee would likely be less than 1%.  Issue of legal tender  Given the uncertain status of bitcoin in the eyes of US courts, there are also questions about whether the city could accept the payment method, given that bitcoin the currency is not considered legal tender in New York state.  Levine indicated, however, that the bill was fully vetted by the city council’s legal team, and that he believes having a financial intermediary accept bitcoin, thereby providing the city with US dollars, would help the city circumvent potential legal issues.  The issue is one that remains murky for the number of proposals introduced in US governments over the last few weeks.  Levine’s bill in New York City notably follows others recently introduced to state legislatures in Utah and New Hampshire.

42378000,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpMX,1424093024,Markets Weekly: Price Jumps $50 in Four Days of Trading,"The bitcoin price had an action-packed end to the week, rising in three consecutive sessions to a high of $267.35 yesterday.  The price began its run-up four days earlier at a low of $217.62. Gains were modest for the day's trading, closing just over $2 from the opening price.  But the next two days would see significant gains. The price rose to a high of $240 on Friday before rising a further $20 to hit the following day's peak.  A further $7 would be gained before momentum slowed on Sunday, with trading ending in negative category. The price closed at $234.33, representing a 5% gain over Monday's open.  From peak to trough, the bitcoin price gained nearly $50 in four days of trading. This represented a 23% gain from Thursday's open, as the run-up began.  The price action was largely positive despite a week dominated by news of dodgy dealings at a bitcoin-linked investment platform.  The platform was a Hong Kong firm called MyCoin that claimed to operate an exchange and investment scheme. Headlines blared that some $387m was taken in a Ponzi run by the firm, although that initial estimate, supplied by the South China Morning Post article that broke the story, was slashed to $8.1m according to police estimates.  Exchange volumes decline  Even with a healthy price spike, however, trading volumes have fallen. The amount of bitcoin that changed hands in the last seven days was 20% less than the previous period, standing at 3.07m coins, according to data from Bitcoinity.  Volumes fell across nearly all exchanges tracked by Bitcoinity. The big Chinese exchanges showed drops of 19% and 24% at BTC China and OKCoin respectively.  Exchanges outside China showed smaller losses in trading volume. Bitstamp's volume fell just 1% week-on-week while Bitfinex showed a 14% decline in coins traded.  Bucking the trend was Coinbase, which makes an appearance on the volume leaderboard for the first time. The Coinbase exchange was launched on 26th January as the bitcoin services firm added a significant piece to its vertically-integrated business model.  Coinbase adds exchange piece to puzzle  With the exchange, Coinbase now handles a customer's coins from the time they enter its wallet service through to their being spent using its payment processing platform at a merchant's till. The exchange allows the firm to take care of the conversions between bitcoin and fiat that both merchants and their customers require.  The Coinbase exchange also means that it no longer has to pass on orders for others to fill, while taking a slice of the day-trading pie. It's moving to a maker-taker model starting in April, where liquidity 'takers' will be charged 0.25% of orders filled at the prevailing price.  This means large US dollar and euro exchanges – platforms like Bitfinex and Bitstamp – should theoretically face a slowdown in orders from Coinbase resulting in thinner order-books for themselves.  While Coinbase's volume is still some way off Bitstamp's – by about 50,000 BTC weekly – the former's position as a universal bitcoin services supplier means it should have more room to grow.  Market-watchers like Barry Silbert have already taken notice of Coinbase's rapid ascent up the trading volume charts.

42395297,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaH72,1424081067,Bitcoin Powers New Worldwide Cellphone Top-Up Service,"Mobile payments pioneer mHITs has entered the bitcoin space with a platform it claims is the ""easiest way"" to send phone credit across borders.  The new service, BitMoby, lets users transfer between $10 and $100 to mobiles in over 117 different countries, without the need to register.  MHITs, founded in 2004, offers a range of mobile money services to customers in Australia and beyond.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Harold Dimpel said the project is a chance for his company to experiment with digital currency, while giving users a simple and fast experience that ""simply cannot be achieved via existing card-based technology"".  How it works  Like competitors Piiko and Bitrefill, mHITs' new service is the online equivalent of a cash top-up made over the counter at a local newsagent.  Users do not need to register with BitMoby or any kind of mobile money operator (Kenya's mPesa, for example) to send funds, nor do they need to disclose any personal information.  In fact, all that is needed to complete a bitcoin transaction is the recipient's phone number, their country and an email address. The latter is used to contact or refund the sender should something go awry.  After this information has been entered and the user has selected how much credit they wish to buy, BitMoby presents a wallet address and the corresponding amount of bitcoin to be paid. There is a 10-minute window for the user to complete their payment at BitMoby's 'frozen' exchange rate.  Once BitMoby has confirmed the transaction, it pays the relevant operator (eg: AT&T, O2) and credit is added to the recipient's phone.  ""We are trying to exploit the fact that, with bitcoin (unlike card-based transactions), we can directly embed transaction information in the bitcoin QR code and wallet address which means no 'shopping cart' or 'check out' process is required,"" Dimpel said.  The service currently supports around half of the world's carriers, but the CEO said the company will be working to add more over time.  Research and development  As the project is still in its early stages, Dimpel conceded there are still kinks to iron out – including complex daily and monthly top-up limits that vary across the world's service providers.  Rather than a polished product, the CEO sees BitMoby as a ""bit of R&D for us to get into the [bitcoin] space"".  Choosing 'digital cash', he said, was part of the company's desire to sidestep the red tape and KYC (know your customer) requirements involved with many overseas transfers, including remittances.  He said:  ""Mobile top-up is purchased in cash around the world with no customer registration information, so why should we require it? We don’t care who is paying us. So long as we have the funds, we will do the transaction.""  Storing digital currency is another experiment for the company. While various self-hosted solutions are currently on the table, Dimpel said he remains open to new ways to store BitMoby's funds.  However, like many merchants accepting bitcoin, the company doesn't keep its currency digital for long, cashing out regularly to buy credit and settle with mobile operators.  “Our AU$ just dropped 1%, so we’re used to volatility. Bitcoin’s no different really, you just have to move quickly and know how to manage it,” he said.  Australia and beyond  The Canberra-based company already serves Australians remitting money via SMS to six countries: Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Nepal, the Philippines and Somaliland.  However, the new service has a broader reach, hoping to capture users outside these established, highly regulated 'corridors'.  ""Remittance is a different business. Money flows from one country to another, for example there is a lot of money from UK to Ghana, whereas top-up is all over the place,"" Dimpel said.  Bitcoin too, is international. BitMoby is one of a growing number of businesses, including BitPesa and SMS wallet 37Coins, that are using its borderless technology to undercut entrenched legacy systems.  There is much to gain. According to World Bank data, remittances to developing countries will hit $516bn in 2016, while money-transfer agents like Western Union – which often operate in a duopoly – charge fees as high as 29%https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/en/corridor/South-Africa/Botswana, despite world targets of 5%.

42377998,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpK1,1424047124,Bitcoin Foundation Candidates Voice Concerns Over Low Voter Registration,"Candidates in the ongoing Bitcoin Foundation election to fill two vacant board of director positions have expressed concern at a low voter turnout.  Candidate Jim Harper of the Cato Institute, and former global policy counsel for the foundation, has pointed out that only 364 of the organisation's roughly 2,728 members have registered to vote – about 13% (this figure has been revised–please see below). This is in part due to the Bitcoin Foundation's requirement that members must confirm their intention to vote before becoming eligible, he contends.  The 364 figure means the minimum threshold for voters will be met if 183 of those ballots are actually cast, according to the Bitcoin Foundation's election committee chair Brian Goss. The previous election in 2013 saw 359 out of 713 registered voters cast ballots.  All who became members before 7th February are eligible to vote. The confirmation requirement, according to the foundation, is to ensure this minimum, or quorum, can be met from members who are actively engaged.  Previous elections required volunteer staff to spend hours communicating with individual members to encourage voting. Notably, this is not the first time bitcoin's chief organisation has struggled to meet this minimum number of voters.  Communication channels  Candidates such as Harper, who was let go by the foundation in a recent organisational pivot, has argued the foundation could have done more to inform voters of the election.  Harper said:  ""If you look at the foundation's blog, there's been hardly a peep about the elections. Nothing since mid-December. I don't have every copy of the 'Bits & Bytes' membership email, but what I recall seeing is election information relegated to below the fold.""  Fellow candidate Bruce Fenton also voiced his concerns at low turnout with a post on Reddit, voicing similar concerns by writing:  ""The requirement to activate accounts was not announced on the Bitcoin Foundation home page (nor was the election itself!) or on Reddit or on Bitcoin Talk, two of the most popular industry news sources.""  Fenton went on to note that announcements were only made on the Bitcoin Foundation message board and in an email campaign, both of which he suggested did little to increase visibility.  These conditions meant that even some standing candidates were not eligible to vote, he added. Both Fenton and Harper said they have received multiple complaints from other Bitcoin Foundation members about the elections and eligibility process.  The problem was not so much the election procedure itself, Fenton said, but the way it was communicated to members.  Efforts made  Speaking to CoinDesk, Bitcoin Foundation director of communications and business development Jinyoung Lee Englund spoke out against the organisation's critics, asserting that every effort has been made to keep members informed.  The foundation has issued an official statement on the debate, stating:  ""We make every effort to communicate directly to our membership while trying not to spam our members. We believe a weekly email leading up to the election in addition to one specific email about confirming membership, in addition to the forum and blog post was sufficient notice.""  At the end of the day, the statement concluded, the foundation can provide information and instructions, but it is up to individual members to decide if they wish to engage in the process.  Several comments in Fenton's Reddit thread supported this view, saying that while communications may not have been perfect, it was up to members to stay engaged.  Much of the election's technical process has been managed by Goss, a radiologist who works for the foundation in a voluntary capacity. His task was to design a system that accommodates members' varying degrees of engagement while ensuring the result is legitimate.  Some members have also claimed they were aware of the new process, but were unable to confirm or vote due to problems with either confirming or voting. The foundation has expressed concern at this, and posted a thread on its own forum for voters to register their issues.  Emails sent to members  There are 13 candidates running in the elections, which will conclude on 19th February. It has also maintained an 'Elections Update' blog, with the most recent message posted on 19th December.  CoinDesk can confirm that four separate emails titled 'Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections' were sent to current Bitcoin Foundation members in the first week of February explaining the activation process, as well as forum and blog posts on the foundation site.  In addition, the edition of the organization's Bits & Bytes newsletter carried the same voting instructions – though as Harper indicated, the notice was the fourth item in that message.  Confirming 'active' membership meant visiting the foundation's members' page and following instructions for the election.  Increasing participation  The foundation was created on a democratic model where elections would guide its direction, Harper said. His platform includes a plan for greater member engagement and participation.  Harper said:  ""I like the model, though I recognize its challenges. If I am elected, I think that the foundation absolutely must find its membership roots again. My plan to repeat my risks-to-bitcoin study, polling the membership on threats to bitcoin's success, is just one part of that.""  While he disagrees with fellow candidate Cody Wilson's plan to disband the foundation altogether, Harper said he felt ""more than before"" that radical change is necessary to build engagement and confidence. He endorses a ""reboot"" and return to the Bitcoin Foundation's greater role in policy and outreach, which was put aside in favor of Bitcoin Core development after the departure of former executive director Jon Matonis.  Goss also expressed a desire for more effective systems going forward. While no amount of internet posts and emails is guaranteed to reach 100% of the audience, he said, the foundation was working to communicate with individuals both inside and outside 'internet culture' and their various channels.  He also urged people to remember the open-source culture that has driven bitcoin since 2009, and volunteer their efforts if necessary. That culture encourages people to raise issues through appropriate channels, and also work together to fix them.  UPDATE (16th Feb, 20:20 GMT): The Bitcoin Foundation has confirmed that its total membership count is 1,523 – which includes 886 annually-renewing members and 637 Lifetime members, meaning 23.9% have confirmed membership to vote. Jim Harper's figure of 2,728 was based on an estimate, and included members who have not kept up annual dues and are thus ineligible to vote.
