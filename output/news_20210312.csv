42406032,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerhxH,1615585686,Market Wrap: Bitcoin's Winning Streak Ends as Prices Struggle to Break Record,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $56,700 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping 1.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $55,116 to $58,150.  Continuing a strong start to the month, bitcoin bulls pushed all the way to $58,000 on Friday, but they’re still struggling to pass the record high set in mid February.    Bitcoin was down 2.2% on Friday, poised to end its longest winning streak this year, after prices failed to break though the all-time-high above $58,300 set last month.      As of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), bitcoin was changing hands just above $56,000 on Coinbase. The seven straight days of gains allowed the largest cryptocurrency to recover nearly all of its losses from late February, but bulls were unable to push the market to new highs.      Read more: Watch Out for These Risks Before Investing in Bitcoin or Ether      The largest cryptocurrency is now up 25% so far in March, and a gain this month would mark the sixth straight monthly increase, the first time that’s happened in seven years. Bitcoin has doubled this year.      For bullish technical traders, the possibility of a “double top” forming on the price chart could be concerning, according to CoinDesk’s Damanick Dantes. “Traders are on watch for a breakout to fresh all-time highs, but there is concern about a double top forming, which could lead to profit taking,” Dantes wrote Friday.      In other words, the market has retraced last month’s comedown only to now sit on the precipice of either a bearish “double top” technical chart or a bullish blastoff to fresh all-time highs, signalling a continuation of the rally over the last two weeks.      ""It's over to the weekend trading crowd to decide if bitcoin should remain at the top end of its range, or take a little pop higher and register a new all-time high,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset exchange firm EQUOS, wrote Friday in his newsletter.    Ether lags    Although mostly tracking with bitcoin’s gains this week, ether (ETH) lagged behind it. The second-largest cryptocurrency traded around $1,743, dropping almost 4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The Ethereum developer and miner community has spent most of March digesting major upcoming protocol upgrades. One of the largest changes addressing the network’s fee market via Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 was confirmed to be included in a July hard fork upgrade, per CoinDesk's prior reporting.      For some analysts, the longer-term price impact from these changes remains an open question. “Due to the highly experimental and frequently evolving nature of the Eth 2.0 upgrade, it is unlikely that these tentative proposals will have a significant impact on the price of ether today,” according to Christine Kim, research analyst at CoinDesk.      Read more: Crypto Investor MetaKovan Announced as Buyer of $69.3M Beeple NFT      But if the planned upgrades “become a reality and Ethereum is able to boast a significantly more scalable and efficient blockchain protocol,” the future is almost certain to be brigh and “more value is likely to accrue on the network in the form of new users and decentralized applications and thereby positively impact ether price in the long run,” Kim said.      Besides ether, other alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) gained on the week but lagged behind bitcoin. Altcoin index futures on FTX have gained less than 2% this week.

42406056,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeriE0,1615584679,Why Bitcoin Is More Like a $100 Bill Than Gold,"This week, two developments point toward continued interest in bitcoin as a medium of exchange, the reason the ""commerce on the internet"" meme may be more accurate than the ""digital gold"" narrative.      One of the developments is the debut of a service allowing use of Lightning – a protocol built to scale transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain – for payments with online merchants that use the Visa network. The company behind the service is called Moon, and it uses a similar mechanism to that used by other bitcoin commerce startups, such as Fold.      The other is PayPal's announcement that it acquired Curv, an Israeli startup developing crypto asset custody technology. The PayPal announcement, which confirmed a CoinDesk scoop, may be more about PayPal's support of bitcoin as an investment, but it's impossible to separate what PayPal does from commerce, which is the backbone of that company.      In this article, I'll take a look at two data points: one is a metric worth watching as a bellwether for bitcoin's use in commerce. The other is a macroeconomic indicator that can be instructive for those who are confused about whether bitcoin is money or not, and highlights one of the ways in which bitcoin is nothing like gold, despite the strength of bitcoin's ""digital gold"" meme.      LISTEN: Digital Gold: How Should Financial Advisors Be Thinking About Bitcoin?      Lightning Network is a Layer 2 protocol that sits atop Bitcoin, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. The overall capacity of Lightning – the bitcoin available for use on the protocol – is a good proxy for interest in using bitcoin for everyday commerce.      Unfortunately for bitcoin's use in commerce on the internet, this metric remains stuck at a ceiling set in 2019.      The chart shows that as bitcoin has appreciated, more dollars are available for Lightning transactions. But in bitcoin terms, capacity is at a ceiling. It remains stuck at about 0.008% of bitcoin's free-float supply (a Coin Metrics measure that counts bitcoin held by addresses active within the past five years), a high first reached in March 2019.      This is fodder for cryptocurrency critics like U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, whose remarks on bitcoin last month gained attention for their focus on crime, but were really a slap at bitcoin's negligible use in commerce. ""I don’t think that bitcoin … is widely used as a transaction mechanism,"" she said. ""To the extent it is used I fear it’s often for illicit finance.""      Read more: Money Reimagined: Bitcoin’s Road to Gold      The $100 bill is not used widely in commerce, either. The estimated lifespan of the average C-note is 22.9 years, nearly three times the life of a $20. ""Larger denominations such as $100 notes are often used as a store of value, which means they pass between users less frequently than lower denominations,"" the Federal Reserve notes.    The $100 bill also gets little use in commerce  DenominationEstimated lifespan$16.6 years$54.7 years$105.3 years$207.8 years$5012.2 years$10022.9 years  Source: U.S. Federal Reserve    Nonetheless, the $100 bill in the past 20 years has become the U.S. Federal Reserve's most popular paper product. As the chart below shows, its popularity has grown. In 1999, the circulating value of the $100 bill was $390 billion, about 3.4 times that of the $20 bill. Twenty years later, the Fed estimates $1.42 trillion worth of $100 bills in circulation, more than seven times that of the commerce-friendly $20 bill.    The Fed's most popular product    Bitcoin skeptics who point to its lack of use in commerce are making a mistake comparing bitcoin to the dollar. Bitcoin is not like the $5 bill or the $20. It's like the $100. Essentially, investors are speculating that, in the future, bitcoin will become like the $100, an asset held as a bearer instrument and a store of value.      In this way, bitcoin's usefulness for ""commerce on the internet"" remains crucial to its value. Like the $100 note, bitcoin isn't valuable necessarily because it is spent, but because it could be spent. In this way, it is unlike gold. And, in this way, Lightning's capacity, though limited, remains an important data point for bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Galen Moore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/12/why-bitcoin-is-more-like-a-100-bill-than-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/365ad7f62299cbbbb6f9d5891618f9bd616e970d-2560x1201.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

So writes Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a cryptocurrency investment management firm, in his newsletter this week.      ""Many investors are so concerned about inflation that they will invest in just about anything to eliminate holding cash on their balance sheets,"" Dorman wrote. ""When investors become too scared to hold cash even for a short period of time, you know the world isn’t quite as it used to be.""      And the reach for yield could attract investor interest beyond just art and collectibles.    “NFTs will expand beyond current use cases such as collectibles, art and gaming into more traditional use cases like know your client (KYC), asset-backed loans (i.e., putting the value of your house/car on-chain to collateralize a loan), a fractional ownership of specific properties.""Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer, Arca  From an investment standpoint, companies and projects that facilitate the growth and trading of NFTs could be big winners, according to Dorman.  Tokens affiliated with NFT businesses have gained an average of 46% last week, and have now increased an average of 787% year to date, according to data from Messari.  In-game assets (swords, skins or characters) can turn into NFTs, allowing players to have ownership whether they continue to play the game or not.  “Essentially, NFTs begin to quantify the time spent on playing games into equity,” says Dorman.  ""Whether a digitized tweet, a digitized moment of an basketball dunk or digital art is really worth tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars is entirely up to the buyer willing to pay this price. But conceptually, there’s nothing weird about non-fungible tokens.""

But can the craze have much of an effect on bitcoin? Probably not, at least for now.      The oldest and largest cryptocurrency, which, at around $57,000, ended a weeklong winning streak Friday, sits at the center of digital-asset markets, accounting for some 62% of the overall industry's $1.7 trillion market capitalization.      So it would stand to reason there might be some spillover into the bitcoin universe from NFTs, which work atop mainly Ethereum-based blockchain networks, even if the connection might be indirect.      “Although NFTs have a different use case than bitcoin, both are part of the same vision for a decentralized digital future,” said Miha Grčar, head of business development at crypto exchange Kraken. “The success of one complements the other.""      Read more: Associated Press NFT Artwork Sells for $180K in Ether      According to the website nonfungible.com, the NFT industry had a market capitalization of $338 million at the end of 2020.      The NFT figure, however, doesn't include this year's eye-popping growth, most recently evidenced in Thursday's $69 million purchase of a digital work by the artist Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple. Or the $6.6 million digital token representing an animated clip of a graffiti-covered Donald Trump lying face down in the grass. Or the $1 million batch of 34 “digital collectibles” known as CryptoPunks.      Contrast those figures with bitcoin's market value of roughly $1 trillion. So at least for now, the NFT ""industry"" might not be enough to make a big difference in the crypto universe, especially with the MicroStrategys and Teslas on Wall Street buying billions of dollars of bitcoin as an inflation hedge or a bet on future payment technologies.      “The relative sizes of the markets means it's effectively impossible for NFT spillover to have a material price impact” on bitcoin, Piers Kicks, venture partner at the cryptocurrency analysis firm Delphi Digital, said in a Twitter message to CoinDesk.      Read more: Kraken Clients Stake $725M of FLOW Tokens, Buying Into NFT Frenzy      Even so, the NFT market is seen as having vast growth potential for a broad range of things: artwork; video game items including skins, weapons and avatars; music; digital trading cards; tokenized real estate, racehorses and designer sneakers; virtual land; and video footage of iconic sporting moments.      Such widespread use could introduce new people into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. That might lead to investing in bitcoin.      “If you want to buy NFTs, you need to be buying crypto,” Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk. “And if you're going to start learning about crypto, you are going to be turned onto the value proposition that bitcoin offers.”      NFTs “introduce a whole new world of people to the possibility of new technology, which happens to be around blockchain and cryptocurrency,” Kruger said. “This is the way adoption should happen. There is an opportunity and solution that is better than what exists right now, and people are drawn to that.”      It's important to note the majority of NFTs transactions are made with ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and second-biggest overall.      Read more: How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT      Beeple’s $69 million NFT, for example, was paid for with ether by Metakovan, the pseudonymous founder of non-fungible token (NFT) fund Metapurse.      There are strong linkages between bitcoin and ether because bitcoin's price usually has a strong impact on ether and other cryptocurrency prices.      As of March 11, the correlation between bitcoin and ether remains strong at 0.70, despite a drop from earlier last year, according to data compiled by CoinDesk.      It's also possible to convert bitcoin into a tokenized form such as wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) so that it can be transferred over the Ethereum blockchain.      “If you want to buy NFTs, you need to be buying crypto,” Kruger said. “And if you're going to start learning about crypto, you are going to be turned onto the value proposition that bitcoin offers.”      Watch: What's Next for Beeple After Dizzying $69M NFT Sale?

SushiSwap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain. Its price has skyrocketed to about $19, representing a 30-fold gain from a November 2020 low. The protocol has proven one of the biggest success stories of decentralized finance, or DeFi, generating over $100 million in cumulative revenue since launch, Todaro wrote Thursday in the newsletter Bankless.      And similar to the way stockholders might receive a dividend, holders of the SUSHI get a share of the SushiSwap platform's fees. “Recently, SushiSwap initiated a process whereby a portion of trading fees across the platform are paid out to token holders,” Todaro wrote.      This ownership stake is essentially a dividend, which can be used to value SUSHI, similar to the way a bond's price is a function of the yield.    “In traditional equity markets, dividend paying stocks are often valued by discounting future cash flows to the present by and expected discount rate,” Todaro wrote.  Todaro used historical trading volumes and fees to calculate cash flows.  Based on his assumptions, Todaro estimates SushiSwap's intrinsice market value at around $12.6 billion, which equates to a token value of about $100.    Despite the lofty valuation, Todaro cautioned investors about considerable risks in the market, including a slump in DeFi cryptocurrency trading.

42406042,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeri3B,1615578884,Valkyrie Files for an ETF That Would Invest in Firms With Bitcoin on Their Balance Sheets,"A proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) would invest the majority of its capital into companies that have bitcoin on their balance sheets or are otherwise connected to the cryptocurrency.      Valkyrie Digital Assets, which has also filed a bitcoin ETF application, filed a Form N1-A for Valkyrie Innovative Balance Sheet ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday in partnership with KKM Financial, which is acting as the investment advisor to the fund, and institutional asset manager SEI, which is acting as the distributor of the fund.      “The Fund … will invest principally in the securities of operating companies that have innovative balance sheets … [O]perating companies that directly or indirectly invest in, transact in or otherwise have exposure to bitcoin or operate in the bitcoin ecosystem,” Valkyrie wrote in the filing.      Valkyrie defined the Bitcoin ecosystem as the Bitcoin network and “bitcoin trading platforms, bitcoin miners, bitcoin custodians, digital wallet providers, companies that facilitate payments in bitcoin and companies that provide other technology, equipment or services to companies operating in the Bitcoin ecosystem.”      Similarly, last week JPMorgan Chase published a filing that detailed an incoming debt instrument that is linked to cryptocurrency-associated companies such as MicroStrategy, Square, Riot Blockchain and chipmaker Nvidia.      If the ETF proposal becomes an investment vehicle before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves a bitcoin ETF, it could capture the same kind of inflows that Canadian bitcoin ETFs have seen days after approval from the Ontario Securities Commission.      Earlier this year, analysts noted that MicroStrategy’s stock was being treated as a bitcoin ETF proxy because the stock rallied in tandem with bitcoin.      Investment vehicles that give exposure to companies buying bitcoin may help companies that aren’t allowed to add bitcoin to their own balance sheets, said Jeff Kilburg, CEO of KKM Financial.      “This is a very complicated, sophisticated approach for some of these multinational corporations that have policies and procedures that currently don’t include the ability to own cryptocurrency,” Kilburg said. “That’s where it gets really challenging to identify not just the existing companies [invested in bitcoin] but to find the companies who are looking to include this on their balance sheet.”      CORRECTED (March 12, 22:03 UTC): The CEO of KKM Financial is Jeff Kilburg, not Jeff Kilgore.",POSITIVE,SEI,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SEI,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/12/valkyrie-files-for-an-etf-that-would-invest-in-firms-with-bitcoin-on-their-balance-sheets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5c441b830cb7e8f2e57b7455e3a3c104e0d8e13-2560x1721.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406054,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeriC2,1615575786,Money Reimagined: Why Quantitative Easing Is Here to Stay,"Welcome to Money Reimagined.      Another week, another NFT blowout. This one was capped by the biggest deal of all: a $69.3 million sale in Christies’ auction of digital artist Beeple’s “EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS.” Aside from the fact we seem to be at the peak of the Gartner hype cycle for non-fungible tokens, this and other wild deals underscore a wider issue in the global economy: How many excess dollars are sloshing around in search of finite things to buy? As we discuss in this week’s essay, global economic forces are likely to ensure that fund flow continues for some time.      NFTs are, again, the focus of this week’s “Money Reimagined” podcast. In the third in our series on the topic, Sheila Warren and I talk to Roham Gharegozlou, CEO and founder of Dapper Labs. A pioneer in NFTs, Dapper Labs created the ERC-721 token standard on which most Ethereum NFTs are built, used it to bring the groundbreaking CryptoKitties concept to the world, and then decided to build its own tailor-made blockchain, known as Flow, to better serve the industry. Now, with the popular NBA Top Shot game running through Dapper’s app, Roham is uniquely placed to peer into the future that NFTs portend, not just for art but for the entertainment business at large.      Have a listen after reading the newsletter.    The new normal    A paradox: The U.S. dollar’s reserve currency status, usually seen as a source of American might, is now hindering the Federal Reserve’s monetary sovereignty.      The European Central Bank’s aggressive move this week to expand its “quantitative easing” stimulus program leaves the Fed little choice but to continue its own hyper-expansive policy, even if it wants to end it.      That’s positive for bitcoin and underscores how a failing global financial system needs the kind of alternatives crypto innovators are dreaming up. But it also speaks to the emerging impotence of central banks, including of the most powerful one in the world.      Late last month, U.S. bond yields rose amid speculation the Fed will start to unwind its massive monetary stimulus once the U.S. economy emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, stocks, bonds and cryptocurrencies fell while the dollar rose. Fed Chair Jerome Powell amplified that speculation during last week’s Wall Street Journal Job Summit, when he gave no word of deliberate actions to curb the tightening market conditions. Bitcoin fell further on that news.      But while Powell and the Fed wouldn’t put their money where their mouth is, the European Central Bank did. On Thursday, the ECB announced it would accelerate a $1.85 trillion bond-buying program to contain what President Christine Lagarde described as an “undesirable” rise in bond yields.      The news not only boosted European stocks and bonds, it sent the S&P 500 into record territory in the U.S. In part that’s because markets saw it as a sign the Fed’s own capacity to tighten policy was now weakened.    Dollarization    This inter-relationship between U.S. and European policymaking results from an unprecedented degree of global capital integration.      Global finance is more dollarized than ever. About half of all cross-border loans and international debt securities were denominated in dollars at the start of the COVID-19 crisis. By the third quarter last year, non-U.S. banks’ dollar liabilities expanded even further, reaching a record $12.4 trillion, according to the Bank of International Settlements. Even as international trade shrank – which should reduce demand for dollars – foreign banks’ jittery customers converted local-currency deposits into the U.S.’ “safe haven” currency.      Dollarization increases the relative influence of U.S. policymaking on European financial conditions and decreases the domestic economy as a factor. So as yields rose in the U.S., eurozone borrowing costs also rose, even though a sluggish vaccine rollout and high debt levels have left the European Union economically worse off than the U.S.      That out-of-sync outcome meant the ECB had to counter. It couldn’t control dollar-denominated rates, but it could at least drive down euro rates.      In turn, this latest move has the potential to send an opposite ripple effect across the Atlantic, via the euro-dollar exchange rate. And this raises a dilemma for Powell and his colleagues.      Here’s the problem: The Fed might at some point feel a need to signal tighter monetary policy. That would raise U.S. bond yields and widen the premium over newly lowered eurozone yields, which would then drive even more European money into dollars and increase the greenback’s value versus the euro. The result: U.S. products would become more expensive for Europeans and European exports to the U.S. would be cheaper in dollar terms.      Under normal circumstances, a principled, free trade-respecting U.S. government would resist temptation to act in support of U.S. exporters or locally based companies that compete with imports. And, officially, the Fed never targets the dollar and doesn’t listen to politicians’ concerns about corporate interests.      These are not normal circumstances.      For one, the scenario I described entails the dollar rising as a result of European actions that are themselves a reaction to conditions in the U.S. These second-round, reinforcing effects separate exchange rates from economic factors.      Second, a currency appreciation would come at an especially difficult time for U.S. companies. The U.S. economic outlook might be better than Europe’s, but that’s hardly saying much. This is the worst economy since the Great Depression, one that warranted a new $1.9 trillion stimulus package last weekend. Small businesses across the country are hurting, badly.      So, while you’ll never hear it from the Fed, it will be concerned about the economic fallout from a strong dollar. This will damp its capacity to tighten policy.      Foreign exchange markets, where the dollar counterintuitively weakened on Thursday, seem to know that. The standard response is for a currency to fall on weaker monetary policy. But the ECB move resulted in the dollar, not the euro, heading south. That’s partly because the restored buoyancy in stock markets pushed investors into “riskier” bets, but it’s also because the Fed now has less room to change its current, easy-money course.    Default: Do nothing    So, who’s in charge here? The Fed or the ECB? In reality, it’s neither. Both have seen their power to manage their economies diminished.      On the surface, central banks appear omnipotent these days. Their bond-buying has sharply and uniformly driven down short-term rates around the world (see the chart below). In filling financial institutions’ balance sheets with monetary reserves, they have pushed all risk assets ever higher with unprecedented cross-market correlation. Now more than ever, investors hang on every utterance from the Fed.      Yet, because of investors’ hyper-sensitivity to even the most subtle changes in policy, central banks’ hands are tied. The slightest signal that the Fed is considering tapering quantitative easing can send markets into paroxysms.      Central banks put their monetary machines into top speed. Now they can’t slow them down.      The default, then, is for more of the same.      As this continues, it will slowly erode trust in fiat money. A relentless increase in money supply, coupled with persistent increases in the prices of assets controlled by hedge funds and few other privileged investors but not by the general public, all without real improvements in most people’s lives, is a recipe for mistrust.      As gloomy as that sounds, it’s constructive to bitcoin. The leading cryptocurrency’s digital scarcity stands as a counterpoint to “QE infinity.” And it gives those of who want to reimagine money a reason to explore alternatives to this broken, inequitable system.    Converging on zero    Until the financial crisis of 2008, charts like the one below were used to praise the “Great Moderation,” an almost two-decade period of resounding success for central banks. Inflation was tamed by the tough love of high interest rates, famously imposed by Fed Chair Paul Volcker in the early 1980s, which allowed benchmark short-term rates to consistently decline. The falling cost of credit unlocked capital for the world.      But since the crisis, which was stoked by that cheap credit, rates have leveled off. And that’s for one simple reason: they’re at zero, with nowhere else to go. (Though, as you’ll see, in Switzerland, Japan and most recently the eurozone, they’ve gone slightly negative, a wacky situation in which lenders pay borrowers for the right to lend them money.) This is a far less heartwarming story.      As central banks sought to boost lending during the crisis, they slashed rates to the “zero bound” and adopted Japan’s approach to quantitative easing. Under QE, which Japan began in the 1990s, central banks buy bonds and other assets from commercial banks, seeking to drive down long-term bond yields to encourage loans to comparatively riskier investments. As shown by a chart of central bank balance sheets in a prior edition of Money Reimagined, those asset acquisitions have continued ever since and have significantly accelerated during the COVID-19 crisis.      Over time, congregation around zero has created a ”sameness,” not only across countries and currencies but across assets and asset classes. When the base rates are all at zero and central banks are actively driving down long-term rates as well, there’s less room for differentiation. Value investing or stock picking becomes irrelevant. Investors buy everything because they can, except when there’s a signal that QE might be ending. No nuance. All correlation.      The chart, in other words, is a visual representation of the dilemma described in the column above. The all-powerful central bankers who brought us the Great Moderation have run out of ammo.    The Conversation: NFTwitter    It was bound to happen. After weeks of big-money headlines (Beeple’s $69 million sale being the latest) and celebrity endorsements, the NFT phenomenon has hit a backlash.      To critics, non-fungible tokens are no longer tools of artist empowerment. They’re a waste of energy and a symbol of greed and wanton destruction.      We don’t have time to go down the rabbit hole of the longstanding crypto-energy debate. So let’s just grab a sampling of the latest version of that spat on Twitter.      One of the positives of the NFT phenomenon is that it’s pushing crypto into mainstream discussion. Although that comes with some ill-informed opinions, it will ultimately heighten pressure to seek a third way among the divisions. The debate won’t kill off NFTs but it will drive innovators to come up with solutions that make them more inclusive and more sustainable.      We’ll start with a well-known marketing guru, linking to a post he made to his long-running blog that talked of the dire consequences of NFTs:      On the other side, here’s a prominent member of the crypto community metaphorically rolling her eyes at a Wired article that amped up the NFTs-kill-the-planet line, while pointing to many examples of everyday energy excess that rarely get critiqued:      This digital artist passionately called for an end to attacks against Black, indigenous and people of color who are minting NFTs and urged their critics to become better informed about the solutions underway to address the energy challenges:      And, finally, an environmental journalist who parroted some of the more exaggerated claims of crypto energy usage but goes in search of a pro-environment NFT solution:    Relevant Reads: Coinbase’s giant ‘exit’    The week brought news that private trading in Coinbase shares signaled a valuation for the crypto company close to $100 billion ahead of its initial public offering. That staggering number would be the highest valuation for a U.S. tech company’s IPO since Facebook came to market in 2012 at $104 billion. Are Brian Armstrong and his team really worth that much?      In a CoinDesk opinion piece that rains on its parade, Cove Markets head of marketing Thomas Meyer says, “sorry Coinbase, you’re not worth $100 billion.” He warns its trading fee revenue is exaggerated by a temporary boom in crypto markets, and that Coinbase will inevitably face stiff competition from other exchanges and crypto services.      Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of rival exchange Binance, is having none of that. Although he told CoinDesk TV that Binance has no plans to go public, he also thinks Coinbase “should be valued much higher” than $100 billion.      What makes this all difficult, writes Ben Schiller, CoinDesk’s managing editor for Features and Opinion (and editor of this newsletter), is that crypto valuations entail a higher degree of subjectivity. The value of cryptocurrencies – and therefore companies that service the industry – depends less on their definable utility and fundamentals and more on how well each one appeals to a large enough community to gain network effects.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Michael J.

42406047,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeri86,1615572005,How Bananas and Mortgages Can Explain the NFT Craze,"If you’re baffled by the craze for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), those bespoke digital assets selling for millions of dollars, here’s one way to make sense of the phenomenon.      First, keep in mind that a thing can be split into two things. Second, understand that the value of each thing, before and after the split, is in the eye of the beholder.      Now, picture a banana.    Marc Hochstein is CoinDesk's executive editor. This post originally appeared in The Node, CoinDesk's (otherwise essential) daily roundup of the most pivotal news stories on the future of money and Web 3.0. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    When picked from the plant, the elongated fruit is encased in its yellow skin. The skin can be peeled off.  The value of the fruit is obvious: It is edible. To some, the peel itself may have some value as well.      You can use the peels as compost in your garden. Also, banana peels can be used for pranks, such as by leaving one on the floor for someone to slip on or for stuffing into a car’s tailpipe. These are mean tricks so don’t do them.      In the 1960s, there was even a brief fad of smoking banana peels. According to Wikipedia, the “recipe” for extracting a fictional substance called bananadine from the peel was a hoax, but who’s to say those kids didn’t feel some kind of high?      The point is that the value of a banana, and of its peel, is subjective. I throw banana peels into the garbage but there’s a saying: One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.      To recap: One object can become two objects and, both before and after they are separated, the value of each object is in the eye of the beholder – as it is for anything else.      To further illustrate these ideas, let’s consider a much more serious example: the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage industry.    Home sweet home    Unfortunately, the mortgage market is as convoluted as anything in DeFi. I will break it down as simply as I can, and thank readers in advance for keeping up.      If you financed a home with a mortgage, chances are the institution where you send your monthly payment is not the same one that holds the mortgage. It also may or may not be the same bank that loaned you the money in the first place.      That’s because, like the banana, a mortgage is an asset that can be split into parts and sold separately to different entities. Think of the debt itself as the edible part of the banana. It typically gets packaged, with a whole bunch of other naked bananas, into those complex securities you heard about in ""The Big Short.""      Too unglamorous for Hollywood dramatizations, the peel is known as the mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). This is a set of administrative duties your lender may or may not farm out after the loan closes. A servicer manages billing and payments, pays property taxes and hazard insurance on your behalf, writes a nasty letter if you pay late and does other scutwork.      The MSR is part of the whole when the loan is written; it can remain so or be peeled off (mortgage pros even speak of a “servicing strip”). The difference is that while you can eat the banana and keep the skin, when a loan is paid off the MSR disappears.      Like loans, MSRs routinely get aggregated into big packages and sold to the highest bidder. To be clear: The company that wins the peels doesn’t work for you, the borrower, it works for whomever has the bananas, the mortgage holder.      From that investor’s perspective, the debt has value because the holder is entitled to your monthly principal and interest payments over the life of the loan – and, if you fall behind and never catch up, after 90 days or so it can take your house. For the buyer of the peel, servicing rights have value because the servicer earns a fee (a cut of the interest) for its drudgery.    What’s it worth? Hard to say    How valuable are these two assets? The mortgage and the associated servicing rights both generate income for their respective owners. The question is how long the assets will do so.      For both assets, the answer depends on how likely you are to stay in the home before:    Selling it, meaning you pay off the loan early  Refinancing the loan, which also means you pay it off early  Defaulting, which means the servicer takes back your house on the investor’s behalf, and both parties incur costs selling it  Paying down the balance over the full term (as long as 30 years in the U.S.)    All of that, in turn, depends on the outlook for interest rates, home prices, employment levels and probably lots of other things. Wall Street has long employed armies of highly paid propellerheads who crunch numbers to estimate the “prepayment speed” of mortgage assets.      Notice that word, estimate. Forecasts are right or wrong in retrospect, but nobody knows what’s going to happen until it happens. And banks often get rekt when they underestimate how quickly loans pay off.      Once again: One asset can become two (banana/loan, peel/servicing), and the value of each is subjective.      But “subjective” here does not mean “untethered from reality.”    Bragging rights    A couple years ago, someone taped an unpeeled banana to a Miami gallery wall, called it art and sold the work to three different buyers for more than $100,000 a pop.      By “the work,” I don’t mean the banana itself, which was bound to rot. The banana was replaceable, in the artist’s instructions for recreating the work, according to an explanation in Vogue. The buyers got a certificate, which is how there could be three of them and only one banana.      Why would anyone pay six figures for … the right to duct tape a banana to a wall and call it someone else’s creation? I can think of at least two reasons.      One is, you really appreciate the work and want to patronize the artist, because you believe it makes an important statement about ... something. The other is so you can impress your friends (and one-up your rivals) at the next cocktail party.      In other words, the bragging rights.      That may be part of the reason why non-fungible tokens (NFT) are blowing up in these strange times. Digital items can create bragging rights just like their canvas-based counterparts – and are arguably more liquid as an asset class.      (By the way, the title of the banana masterpiece was “Comedian.” Read that however you want.)    Just a JPEG    For a definition of NFTs, I can’t improve upon this by my CoinDesk colleague Nikhilesh De in his “State of Crypto” newsletter:      “They can represent things (like tweets, real estate, real-world assets, etc.) or they can be the things (like art). ... [W]hile anyone can copy and download video clips or image files, an NFT has a record saying that it has only one owner.      “To be clear: You can still download the image file recorded in an NFT. If you sell a tweet, that tweet will still exist on Twitter, visible to all. ... Think of them as autographed football cards. You could print as many copies as you want but if the player signs only one, that’s the card that’ll likely have the most value. For example, an autographed Tom Brady card just sold for $1.32 million.”      You might think: $1 million for a piece of cardboard? Ha, that’s chump change. In this week’s biggest crypto story, someone won an auction at Christie’s by paying $69.5 million for an NFT by the artist known as Beeple.      This mystery buyer outbid noted aesthete and Tron founder Justin Sun, who was ready to pay $60 million. But if either of them simply wanted to appreciate the work, known as “EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS,” they didn’t have to pay a dime. Beeple’s collage is viewable for free online. Because it’s a purely digital work, “owning” it doesn’t confer the same advantage as displaying a painting (or a banana) in your den.      I’d suggest this is the core innovation of the NFT: It has separated the bragging rights (h/t to Bloomberg’s Tracy Alloway) of owning a rare object from possession of the object, much like Wall Street decades ago cleaved servicing rights from the underlying mortgages. Or, in the case of virtual “objects” that no one can solely possess, NFTs have preserved, or resurrected, the bragging rights.      Unlike servicing rights, though, bragging rights don’t have an income stream; their value is psychological (one art critic has called NFT collecting “posing”) and thus presumably even harder to model.      But not impossible to finance! As CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports, there are now decentralized finance markets where you can pledge NFTs as collateral for loans.      I don’t mean to sneer. For one thing, the NFT phenomenon has shown positive side effects. Beeple is likely set for life and can pursue his art without ever worrying about putting food on the table. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has pledged to charity the proceeds of an ongoing auction for the first-ever tweet, last bid at $2.5 million.      And as with fruits or byzantine financial contracts, if you think these valuations are absurd, well, that’s just, like, your opinion, man. The buyers, though, should keep in mind that art markets, just like financial ones, are known to crash. It’s hard to imagine the same can’t happen for “art” you can’t even hang on a wall. So you’d best be ready to savor those bragging rights for a long time. Longer than many Americans stay in their homes.      Paying almost $70 million to “own” a picture anyone can look at for free may sound bananas. But, clearly, the time is ripe to sell NFTs.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/12/how-bananas-and-mortgages-can-explain-the-nft-craze,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b710d2f89ad3d3aa57ab7b36c992ecbd9dfe841-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The most expensive painting ever sold was a Leonardo da Vinci that went for $450.3 million in 2017.      Beeple told CoinDesk the buyer of his piece will be revealed soon, and that he’s working with the buyer to figure out ways to display the NFT in the real world. He mentioned options such as putting it on large screens in public, making a big print for the buyer’s house or projecting it onto a building at Art Basel.      The buyer was initially reported to be Tron founder Justin Sun, but as CoinDesk first reported Thursday, Sun was actually beaten by a last-minute bid.

It’s good for them and it’s good for me if their artwork goes up in value.”      And despite NFTs being seen as a way to fundamentally change the economics of the art world, Beeple seemed skeptical.

42386178,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRd6z,1615560365,Watch Out for These Risks Before Investing in Bitcoin or Ether,"There are a number of risks associated with holding and investing in cryptocurrencies. In the latest CoinDesk Research report, we look at seven different risks, from the regulatory to the technological, that affect bitcoin and ether, and whether you'd want to hold these assets for the long term.      Here is a brief overview of three of those risks, identified in the report “Bitcoin + Ether: An Investor’s Perspective.”    1. Regulatory    Twelve years after the creation of the world’s first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, regulating the asset is still complicated in most countries. Officials want to know, are bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies financial assets? Commodities? Property?      As for ether, the questions are on a different level because of the underlying Ethereum blockchain. So regulators in the U.S., for instance, are wrestling with the kind of information decentralized applications (dapps) and proof-of-stake blockchains (where Ethereum is heading with its Eth 2.0 upgrade) do and do not collect about its users.      In December 2020, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a unit of the Treasury Dept., proposed rules affecting banks and money services companies as well as crypto exchanges. Exchanges would have to collect names and home addresses for the owners of private crypto wallets (also referred to as self-hosted wallets, unhosted wallets or sometimes just “wallets”) receiving more than $3,000 in cryptocurrencies in aggregate in a day.      Read more: FinCEN Extends Comment Period for Controversial Crypto Rules      Such rules, if implemented, could put a big chill on those holding crypto on exchanges, and even on users of Ethereum and its dapp ecosystem. Most of the activity on dapps is as yet untraceable, and the ease of moving value around in a pseudonymous manner through the ether cryptocurrency is still intact. There is the potential for this proposal to be implemented by U.S. regulators in some form but FinCEN is taking public comment and industry feedback until March 29.    2. Technological    The risk of a bug in the Bitcoin protocol's software is low but not zero. The introduction of upgrades such as “Taproot” brings new code to the bitcoin currency’s underlying protocol that may make its technology open to new attack vectors.      The technological risk for ether is much greater than bitcoin because of the Ethereum blockchain’s ambitious upgrade to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. Ethereum 2.0 will radically change how transactions and dapps are secured on the network.      Read more: Ether Uptrend Is Weakening, Could Test Lower Support: Technical Analysis      PoS is a highly experimental technology that has yet to see widespread adoption on the same scale as Ethereum today. Ethereum 2.0 represents the bet that PoS will one day be able to replace Ethereum fully and adopt the network’s existing user base in its entirety.      Due to the ambitious goals of the upgrade, there is a higher probability for code bugs and failures through the implementation of Ethereum 2.0 on Ethereum than Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade.      In addition to protocol upgrades, there is a different type of technological risk that exists for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum systems because they rely on the activity of “mining” for network security. A hostile actor could launch what is called a “51% attack” and censor blockchain transactions or cancel approved blocks by taking control of the majority of miner hash power.      (Hash power is a measure of the computational energy expended by miners on a blockchain to process and finalize transactions.)      Given the current size and spread of the crypto industry’s hash power, the cost of a 51% attack on Bitcoin, and to a lesser extent on Ethereum, is prohibitively expensive, but could be within reach of a state actor.    3. Competitive    Another common risk associated with bitcoin and ether is the potential for a more efficient, secure competitor to replace the assets. But while this is possible given that both are based on open-source code that anyone can replicate on GitHub, it is increasingly unlikely.      The main reason is because the size of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks is becoming an insurmountably high barrier. In Bitcoin’s case, the strength in the network is not just from the number of active addresses, which hit all-time highs in late January 2021. It is also from the number of miners that expend computational power to secure the network.      Read more: Foundry Ends Bitcoin Mining Pool Beta Phase, Adds More Institutional Clients      A competitor would have to steal away bitcoin miners with a more attractive and profitable alternative. Incentivizing miners to switch their machines to a different protocol would require amassing similar levels of user trust and market value.      Ethereum is in a similar position. Network effects matter, even if blockchain interconnectivity becomes seamless because the strength of the developer network and the sprawling web of complementary dapps matter.

Binance hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing and the CFTC may not bring an enforcement action, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg also did not outline a time period for this alleged trading.      Spokespeople for Binance and the CFTC did not immediately return requests for comment. However, in a tweet posted after Bloomberg's report ran, the exchange's founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao, appeared to call the report ""FUD,"" using an acronym for ""fear, uncertainty and doubt"" that is often used to refer to unwelcome news in the crypto industry.      The news comes a day after Binance announced it has hired Max Baucus, a former U.S. senator and ambassador to China, as a policy adviser who would be able to navigate the exchange's relationship with U.S. regulators. Baucus currently operates a consulting business.      Binance does not directly serve U.S. customers on paper, instead using a San Francisco-based entity operating as Binance.US for that purpose. Despite this, the parent exchange has announced at least twice in two years that it would be removing all U.S. customers from its platform.      The probe is another sign regulators are trying to funnel U.S. investors into regulated channels.      Derivatives trading in the U.S. is strictly overseen by the CFTC. The agency brought an enforcement action last year against BitMEX, also on allegations it allowed U.S. customers to trade derivatives products.

42386170,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRd0h,1615546841,"Bitcoin’s Put-Call Ratio Hits 9-Month High, but That’s Not Necessarily Bearish","Bitcoin's put-call open interest ratio, which measures the number of put options, or bearish bets, open relative to calls, or bullish bets, is rising. However, that does not imply traders are positioning themselves for a drop in the market.      The ratio jumped to 0.91 on Thursday, the highest level since June 26, 2020, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      The metric has been rising since the beginning of the year. The spike, however, may have been fueled by increased put selling, which is usually done when the market is expected to consolidate or rally.      Bitcoin's one-month implied volatility, or investors' expectations for price turbulence over four weeks, spiked to record levels in early January, boosting options prices, and remained elevated above its lifetime average of 100% (annualized) until last week.      Traders, therefore, had a strong incentive to sell put options at high prices during that bull run. Volatility essentially represents uncertainty and has a positive impact on options prices. The one-month implied volatility is now hovering below 100%.      Open interest only tells us the number of calls and put contracts that are active, or open, at a given point in time and does not reveal whether investors are buying call/put options or selling (known as “writing” in options markets).      The way the options are currently priced actually suggests bullish bias in the market. One-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, are hovering in negative territory, implying greater demand for bullish calls compared to puts.      Indeed, the put-call skews have recovered from the bull market depths seen earlier this year and options market recently saw some put buying. Again that does not imply a bearish mood, as traders often buy put options as a hedge (protection) against bullish or long positioning in the spot or futures markets.      Lastly, the put-call open interest ratio is closing on parity, which means the market is heading toward neutral positioning. All-in-all, the spike in the put-call open interest ratio shouldn't be a cause for concern for the bulls. However, a continued rise in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield may play spoilsport.

42386175,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRd4T,1615546800,Grayscale's ETF Push Highlights Existential Threat to GBTC Dominance,"For seven years, Grayscale Investments’ bitcoin trust has been nearly the only game in town for investors who wanted to bet on bitcoin’s price without the fuss of handling cryptocurrency.      Lately that’s been changing fast. From alternatives like Osprey’s bitcoin fund to Bitwise’s cryptocurrency index to Canadian bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors now have more choices for hassle-free bitcoin exposure. Arguably, MicroStrategy and even Tesla, shares might scratch the itch now.      The once-sizable premium over the price of bitcoin for shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has flipped to a discount, reflecting a drop in demand for the vehicle.      “I don’t think we’re going to see 40% to 50% premiums again like in 2017,” said crypto analyst Kevin Rooke. “There is institutional awareness now and so many ways to get the same exposure.”      And if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) this year, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) might end up marginalized as the obsolete legacy of a regulatory regime that has since passed.      “If we have a bitcoin ETF in the U.S., there probably will be no more inflows into any bitcoin trust,” said Steven McClurg, chief investment officer of Valkyrie Investments, which has its own pending proposal for a bitcoin ETF.      Grayscale clearly sees the writing on the wall. Far from sitting on its hands, the investment manager (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group) has been buying back GBTC shares, helping to stabilize the price. Perhaps more significantly, the firm is hiring specialists to compete in the bitcoin ETF space.      “Grayscale is continuously exploring new opportunities, such as an ETF, in response to customer demand,” said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein. “We were the first to provide exposure to a digital asset through a regulated wrapper, and our goal is to ensure that we lead the market in whatever future product we bring forward as well.”    Read more: Grayscale, Firm Behind Leading Bitcoin Trust, Is Hiring ETF Specialists    Such adaptive measures show how rapidly the bitcoin market structure is changing as the price trades near all-time highs and the mainstream investors Grayscale has been courting for years are arriving in greater numbers than before. Firms are now adding millions of dollars worth of bitcoin to their corporate treasuries, institutions are buying more bitcoin than what’s being mined, and Goldman Sachs plans to relaunch its crypto trading desk after a three-year hiatus.      Hypothetically, the investment manager could convert GBTC into an ETF, but it would be expensive compared with others already on the market under the current fee structure. CI Global Asset Management has advertised that its Canadian bitcoin ETF would have a 0.4% annual fee.    Grayscale could instead create a bitcoin ETF that’s secondary to GBTC but with a lower fee than GBTC’s current 2% annual fee, said James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ( With around $36 billion in assets under managementhttps://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/, Grayscale rakes in around $700 million annually, Seyffart said.)    That would give Grayscale some wiggle room to convert GBTC into an ETF, giving it the opportunity to create one of the most liquid bitcoin funds in the world, Seyffart added, but the investment manager would have to act fast. Seyffart said he’s become less confident now that Grayscale can hold onto institutional investors after seeing trading volumes soar on Canada’s bitcoin ETFs.      There’s also the possibility that as more institutional investors become comfortable with cryptocurrencies, they will be willing to hold bitcoin directly, instead of doing so through a fee-heavy investment vehicle, Seffyart added.      “People are less interested in holding money in GBTC and want to hold bitcoin themselves,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/12/grayscales-etf-push-highlights-existential-threat-to-gbtc-dominance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2dc62f2e0a52c7728657f6bc6e3b97a3b4f66329-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a letter to the Southern District Court in New York on Thursday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen asked Judge Sarah Netburn to block subpoenas sent to multiple banks seeking eight years'-worth of their financial information.

Specifically, Garlinghouse and Larsen argue their personal financial lives are not relevant, though they have already agreed to provide some financial information. Additionally, the SEC's demands violate privacy interests, they said.

Binance's first merchant client on the platform is Travala, a travel-booking platform that already uses its own cryptocurrency.  Merchant payments services like this generally allow businesses to automatically convert their crypto to fiat at the time of a transaction to counter price volatility.
