42383728,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yEyJ,1589408865,Blockchain Bites: The Government Won't 'Kill DeFi' but FATF Might Compromise Anonymity,"Top Shelf    Progress must keep pace with need. An overriding theme during day three of Consensus: Distributed was that the pace of technological development - driven by interconnected but diffuse organizations - must keep up with (or keep in mind) the needs of actual people and societies.      “To solve a problem you need to see it first,” said Tyrone V. Ross, director of community at Altruist, a platform for financial advisors. Only by working directly with communities can organizations truly come to understand their financial needs.      There’s disagreement in and outside of crypto on how to best orient technological progress for these needs. But the fact is, the industry is hurtling towards a set of rules that will redefine the ecosystem for it. The so-called “Travel Rule,” a new set of guidelines proposed by the Financial Action Task Force last spring, will attempt to inject structure into the largely anonymized crypto economy.      FATF’s Virtual Asset guidelines ask for exchanges and some wallet providers to maintain identifying information about the senders and receivers of crypto transactions. It’s due to become industry-standard this June, with the question remaining whether crypto is ready for it.      “Crypto is not designed to have a Travel Rule solution,” Noah Perlman, chief compliance officer of Gemini, said at CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed virtual conference. While the exchange will work to comply, “it’s hard” to meet the conflicting needs of regulators and their clientele.      “We want to help law enforcement and provide more transparency,” Coinbase’s Chief Compliance Officer Jeff Horowitz said. “It really is a conversation between privacy versus transparency.”      Transparency in this case means righting the wrongs of unchecked technological progress. “Anonymity is a big goal for creators of this technology,” but the experiment went a different way when bad actors began exploiting the systems, said Merav Shor, counsel at eToro. “Anonymity has to be compromised to a certain degree,” she said.      Yaya Fanusie, of Cryptocurrency AML Strategies, agreed. Despite challenges with implementing it right now, these rules are “a path to scalability.” At some point, he argued, crypto needs to meet the challenges and expectations of the traditional financial system.      While some propose that the Travel Rule, and its antecedents like the Bank Secrecy Act (enacted in 1970), are unconstitutional out of hand, many see regulation as a catalyst to mainstream adoption.      Speaking on the DeFi Risks and Regulation Workshop, Jake Chervinsky, counsel for Compound said, “The government isn’t trying to kill DeFi.” “They understand there’s a lot of promise in this space,” with potentially huge benefits for expanding access to financial services.      He added that the government understands that this technology will be built and would prefer the innovation takes place within US borders.

We've already highlighted Binance, Cosmos, Brave, Bitmain, MakerDAO, Besu and the People’s Bank of China, and will continue to announce five new names a day until the end of Consensus: Distributed. You can read the full list here.      Bitcoin Is Still King Bitcoin is the reason why we're writing these words and you’re reading them now. Its implementation 11 years ago kicked off a whole industry composed of competing forms of currencies and novel financial instruments. It got people thinking about what money is, could be and whether they should have direct control over their economic lives. But Bitcoin itself is building: A decentralized group of core developers is keeping its core spinning, while hundreds of other technologists are finding ways to improve its usability, privacy and scaling. The world’s first cryptocurrency, theorized and encoded by the long-silent Satoshi Nakamoto, still dominates this industry, in both market capitalization and brand recognition. Bitcoin is king because no one person controls it. Bitcoin is king because it grants sovereignty. Bitcoin is king because it knows it's not wearing clothes. Full story    CoinDesk COVID Response    #NYBWGives CoinDesk has joined Gitcoin, The Giving Block and Ethereal Summit to support charities helping communities in difficult times.

Consensus Magazine    Generation Crypto Freelance journalist Jess Klein writes about an emerging psychographic of people who see the world through the lens of decentralization. In a series of eight profiles, Klein examines “Generation Crypto,” a diffuse grouping of people of all ages, races and sexes, bound together as “children of Satoshi.”      In this excerpt taken from the series, Klein profiles Tyrone Ross Jr., a financial advisor for the crypto-rich. Read the full series here.      Financial advisor Tyrone Ross, Jr. ducked into a coffee shop in Midtown Manhattan wearing a checked blazer and a pocket square in February to meet with me, a simple activity that’s unimaginable now. He approached with a wide, disarming smile, and its effect was immediately clear: This is a man I would trust with my money.      Ross’s young, tech-savvy clients invest in crypto. Most of them are men, “but there’s a lot of women interest,” he says. For many, crypto was their first investment. “As a black American, someone who was trying to push black folks into stocks for a while, they would never listen,” says Ross. “But for whatever reason, a lot of people just jumped into crypto, and are now reverse-engineering getting into stocks later.”      Not much has changed for Ross’s clients because of Covid-19, at least not in terms of their investment strategies. Ross has also been working with his team virtually for the past two years, so working from home is no obstacle. And as of late March, he had yet to receive a single “panic call” from a client. “I literally had clients calling me, Are we buying here or what?” he says. At least one bought the drop.      After all, crypto investors are used to riding ups and downs in its volatile market. If anything, Ross is hoping that the Covid-19 pandemic will help reveal crypto’s virtue as an option for the un- or under-banked.      “The best example I have of that is my own family,” he says. His parents have gone most of their lives without bank accounts, but now they have one and they’re nervous, asking Ross if they should withdraw their money. “My mom said, ‘I’m not putting my money in any bank,’ and that’s all I need to hear,” he says, to convince him that there’s not enough trust in the traditional financial system. Sure, his mom calls crypto “space money,” but Ross firmly believes that cryptocurrency’s product market fit is with those suffering most from America’s significant class divide—one that’s being blown open even further by the pandemic.      “The fall of Rome is happening,” he says. “The United States is being brought to its knees.” So he’s bullish on bitcoin, perhaps even more so than usual. While much of the world is scrambling or on pause, Ross is building a project that will allow financial advisors to seamlessly access bitcoin, and he’s confident that the smartest people in the world, now all stuck at home, are working on progressive crypto projects, too.      “Once we come out of this…the world is going to look different,” he says. “Digital everything is going to become a thing, and the only thing that’s missing right now is a true global money that’s run on the internet.”      “We have that,” he adds. “Crypto just needs its iPhone moment, and this may be it.”    Best Backgrounds at Consensus: Distributed    Auryn ""Watching the World Burn"" Macmillan    How To Use Brella    To access all of the deeper cuts available through Consensus: Distributed, you'll need to login through Brella , our virtual conferencing platform. You can create an account through Gmail, LinkedIn, Facebook or set one up manually on Brella.

She was a brilliant analyst of monetary policy, and very outspoken in her criticism of the Fed. Legend! Which living person do you most despise? No one. I don’t have enough energy to despise other people. Indifference is more powerful than hate. When and where were you when you first heard about BTC? Don’t recall, but I was working on an M&A project in China when I first started down the rabbit hole, so I was in a random hotel room somewhere in China realizing I actually did not really like my job or my life very much. Do you mine? Would you mine? No and maybe, I do run a full node but mining is a specialized activity that requires scale. Your favorite revisionist moment from crypto history? Everything surrounding the DAO “hack” and what happened afterwards. Even calling it a “hack” is wildly mis-leading. Your favorite non-crypto book? Tie between Siddhartha by Herman Hesse and Dune by Frank Herbert Your most visited webpage? Twitter, of course    Cryptic Lifestyle    What inspires you?

I go into a flow state and have an out-of-body experience. Best ski season was winter 2014-15 when I moved to Breckenridge CO for six weeks and skied every day. What gets you out of bed? I honestly can’t believe that I get to do things I find interesting and challenging as my job, so I don’t really have a strict boundary between “work” and “life” or “office” and “home” so I’m generally just eager to work on whatever I’m working on right now What is your motto? Blowing sh** up What would you like to be? Content Where would you like to live? Wherever I like Your favorite television show or movie? The Life Aquatic is the best film ever Your most vivid memory? All I can say is it involved dancing Your greatest achievement? Whatever I do today. The past is the past, and the future hasn’t arrived, so today is it! What do you rely on? Caffeine and curiosity fuel me What would you change about yourself? Saying no to more things, including books, ideas, thoughts, and people. I’m working on it! Where will you be in 10 years? Wherever I’m supposed to be, I don’t have a “plan,” just a direction of travel Your favorite fiction character? Easy - Molly Millions from the Gibson’s Sprawl trilogy. She is a trained assassin cyborg who wears leather and has mirror eyes and razorblade fingernails. How do you spend your free time? Reading and being outside What do you want your legacy to be? My memoir will be short and sweet - “Meltem. She had a good time.” How would you like to die? In a way that gives my loved ones peace and closure    First Mover    Derivatives May Have Blunted the Halving’s Volatility Spike There now exists a developed derivatives market in the crypto economy, a fact that may affect the calculus of a post-halving bull run. “What's changed is the ease of going short,” CoinDesk’s First Mover team writes in their latest newsletter . “The majority of volumes this week have been in futures rather than spot,” he wrote. “We’re seeing that on the [over-the-counter] side.

42383712,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yEgh,1589404552,IOV Labs Takes on Lightning Network With New Light Client,"IOV Labs, which builds platforms secured by bitcoin’s hashrate, launched Wednesday a light client for the Lumino Payments Network, its smart contract-compatible rival to the Lightning network      Lumino Light Client will run on mobile devices via integrated wallet apps, according to the Gibraltar-based firm.      Light Client comes nearly a year after the firm formerly known as RIF Labs unveiled Lumino. Based on IOV Labs subsidiary RSK’s Rootstock sidechain, Lumino secures smart contracts and ERC-20 compliant tokens via the Bitcoin network in what IOV Labs called a “layer three solution.”      Before Lumino, Gabriel Kurman, an RIF strategist, said 10 full nodes and three “hubs” – nodes that communicate with light clients but do not manage any private keys – comprised the Lumino Network for a processing power of about 100 transactions per second (tps). That’s faster than the bitcoin mainchain (about 3.6 tps by the seven-day average) slower than Visa (65,000 tps capacity) and well below what IOV Labs claims Lumino can scale to: 20,000 tps.      See also: Bitcoin Wallets Are Adopting This Tech to Simplify Lightning Payments      “All the focus now is in bootstrapping the network, and the more nodes, channels and hubs we have the more transactions can be processed in the network as a whole,” Kurman said.      For now, IOV is assuming Light Client will be Lumino's most critical user gateway, “as we expect 99% of the users access it via a mobile Light Client,” Kurman said.      IOV is also attuned to crypto users' increasing appetite for stablecoins.      “Given the growing ecosystem of decentralized stablecoins being launched on RSK & Lumino, such as DollarOnChain (Bitcoin-backed collateralized Dollar), RIFDollar (RDOC), there is a great opportunity for wallets to enable off-chain nanopayments,” Kurman said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/13/iov-labs-takes-on-lightning-network-with-new-light-client,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/620ced8a71e6ba1b6b58f3a89b0c2e979f3af8f1-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383725,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9yEuX,1589402421,Market Wrap: Some Miners Face an Uncertain Future Despite Rising Bitcoin Price,"Despite a post-halving rise in bitcoin’s price Wednesday, the current value may not be enough to keep less-efficient miners operating, and that could shift market dynamics.      At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was trading up 2.3% over 24 hours at $9,106. The world’s first cryptocurrency is trading above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, which is a bullish technical indicator, and has been on a steady uptrend since early trading May 13, 00:00 UTC.      The long-anticipated halving was, “a little uneventful,” said Jack Tan, founding partner at Taiwan-based crypto trading firm Kronos Research. But there has been one bright spot for traders: Bitcoin prices have been going up slowly but surely.      Read more: Bitcoin Steady Near $9K as Trump Touts ‘Gift’ of Negative Interest Rates      But market uncertainty lingers when it comes to cryptocurrency miners. The reward for miners to generate new bitcoin was cut because of the halving to 6.25 BTC, so the business of running machines to secure the network is much less profitable: “I think some of the miners might be in trouble. They just took a 50% pay cut overnight, with prices remaining where they are,” added Tan.      One mining metric that immediately changed after the halving was miner revenue from fees, which jumped from 4.6% right before the halving to 7% Wednesday, according to data provider Glassnode.      Miners bowing out of the business may change the dynamics of the crypto market, said Alexander Blum, of Two Prime, a crypto asset management firm. “The difference is that miners' new net tokens are now not necessarily the primary driving force of sell pressure into the markets,” he said. “That mantle is likely to be taken on by exchanges that make trading fees and have to sell into the market to cover their business expenses.”      Read more: Derivatives May Have Blunted the Halving’s Volatility Spike      Steady exchange volumes are indicative of the market’s health and whether bitcoin can continue to appreciate post-halving, said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at quantitative crypto trading firm ExoAlpha.      “Increasing the scarcity of an asset tends to make it more valuable over time, but only if there's still demand for it,” said Lifchitz. Bitcoin’s price appreciation seems to be increasing in a world where, year to date, bitcoin is performing better than some traditional assets, Lifchitz added, and the numbers back him up.      Bitcoin is trouncing the S&P 500 Wednesday, with the index of large-cap stocks down 1.75%. The cryptocurrency is also doing better than gold, which is up less than 1%. For the year to date, bitcoin is up 27%, gold is in the green 13% while the S&P 500 is down 12%.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are flashing green on Wednesday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), gained 5.4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Other cryptocurrency winners include lisk (LSK) up 7.5%, monero (XMR) climbing 6.7% and iota (IOTA) up by 3%. All price changes were as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET) Wednesday.

42383692,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9Gn,1589401977,'History Has Repeated': F2Pool Explains Message in Last Block Before Bitcoin Halving,"Ushering in Bitcoin's third ""halving,"" by far the most highly awaited cryptocurrency event of the year, mining pool F2Pool rooted a mysterious message into the blockchain that will now reside there forever.      Preceded by a fish emoji signifying the company's logo, the mining pool added the text to a headline from The New York Times: ""NYTimes 09/Apr/2020 With $2.3T Injection, Fed's Plan Far Exceeds 2008 Rescue."" To bitcoin OGs, the significance is clear. It's a reference to a similar newspaper heading Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto embedded into the first-ever block, slyly referencing the 2008's momentous financial crisis and implying bitcoin might be able to help combat associated systemic problems.      By chance, mining pool F2Pool won the last block reward Monday before the much-anticipated ""halving"" event, which cuts in half bitcoin's block rewards, or how much bitcoin is created every 10 minutes, allowing the pool to embed the text.      F2Pool co-Founder Wang Chun said in an interview during CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed conference that it was his idea and the pool had ""carefully"" culled through many headlines over a couple months before finding the perfect message.      ""History has repeated. Due to the coronavirus, there has been yet another ongoing wave of bailout[s] just like the one Satoshi had seen in 2008, but bigger in scale, like Bitcoin reinvented,"" he said in a follow-up email to CoinDesk.      ""With the changes in the global economic environment, central banks of various countries have gradually adopted aggressive [Quantitative Easing (QE)] policies. We have found that Mr. Satoshi Nakamoto’s concerns have been there and are getting more and more serious since the economic crisis of 2008,"" F2Pool CMO Qingfei Li added, referencing QE, a policy where central banks buy long-term capital assets to increase the money supply and stimulate the economy.      The stunt has been a hit with Bitcoiners who are aware of the history and symbolic significance of the genesis block. Cryptocurrency educator Andreas Antonopolous called the act ""iconic,"" while Scalar Capital co-founder Linda Xie tweeted, ""Is it weird I'm crying a little?""    Bitcoin's new age    Back in 2009 when Bitcoin's code ran for the first time, Satoshi embedded the following text in the block: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.""      Though he, she or they never said bitcoin would stop bank bailouts, the community has come to see this secret message as a sign of the goals of bitcoin: to fix some of the issues and corruption inherent in today's financial system.      Chun said his company selected The New York Times because it's like the American version of Britain's The Times, further echoing the initial message.      F2Pool chose the halving in particular to embed this message because it is like a marker for a ""new age"" for bitcoin, Chun said. ""Every time Bitcoin gets halved. We see Bitcoin enters a new age. The boundary is quite clear,"" Chun added.      See also: Bitcoin Halving Arrives: Mining Rewards Drop for Third Time in History      He added it marks the beginning of ""episode III"" of bitcoin, referencing ""Star Wars.""(Chun likes his ""Star Wars"" references. In a video mirroring the classic scrolling ""Star Wars"" introduction, Chun recounts bitcoin's beginnings with a Biblical touch: ""In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth and the white paper."")      You'd think it would be episode IV, but as a loyal programmer he said he starts counting from zero.      The halving is also a sign of bitcoin's maturity, according to Li.      ""[T]he halving of Bitcoin is a very memorable event for the Bitcoin blockchain and all the participants of [the] crypto market, which means that the currency experiment (bitcoin blockchain) has been successfully carried out for nearly 12 years and will continue to run. It is very commemorative to insert the news at such a time,"" Li said.      Chun noted he's not an ""economic expert,"" but summarized a ubiquitous view in the bitcoin community: Bitcoin users have more control.      ""Bitcoin [gave] people back the control, and their freedom, for the first time since banks took it over some 100 years ago,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/13/history-has-repeated-f2pool-explains-message-in-last-block-before-bitcoin-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f6ccb6c06ec8becde8e1ffda49a3c9ec9ada0dd-2036x1588.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383701,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9Pb,1589400350,Fund Manager Got NY BitLicense 11 Months After Hiring Its Architect,"Benjamin Lawsky, the former financial regulator who created New York’s BitLicense in 2015, joined New York Digital Investment Group Asset Advisory LLC (NYDIG) nearly a year before the bitcoin fund manager applied for, and received, that license.      Lawsky’s ties to NYDIG, which has raised $230 million in six separate fund sales since 2018, are documented in the asset advisory’s March Form ADV filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Lawsky is recorded as an “elected manager” of NYDIG with an indirect ownership stake through New York Digital Investment Group LLC. The filing did not define what an elected manager’s role is precisely.      Lawsky had previously served as New York State’s first superintendent of the Department of Financial Services from 2011 to 2015, a tenure capped by his landmark decision – shared in his final speech in office – that New York state would adopt the nation’s first licensing regime created specifically for cryptocurrency businesses.      Lawsky is one of many regulatory veterans who have gone on to work in the blockchain or crypto industry, a pattern that arguably resembles the so-called revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. To be clear, however, Lawsky’s work at NYDIG is not prohibited by law and there is no indication either he or NYDIG acted inappropriately in applying for and receiving the BitLicense.      The controversial BitLicense has been issued sparingly since its introduction five years ago. Less than half a dozen were issued in its first three years, and though the rate of distribution ramped up across 2018 and 2019, only 25 companies hold one today.      Lawsky became an “elected manager” at NYDIG in December 2017, the regulatory filing shows. NYDIG received a BitLicense in November 2018. In its glossary of terms, the SEC lists elected managers as persons who can control an LLC.      Benjamin Lawsky and the New York State Department of Financial Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment.      “It’s not uncommon to see a former regulator going to work for a regulatee,” said Carol Van Cleef, a lawyer at Bradley Arant Boult Cummings. “New York bans former officials from appearing before their former employers for two years.”      Lawsky’s departure from NYDFS in mid-2015 and arrival at NYDIG in December 2017 would appear to place him outside that window.    NYDIG goes big    NYDIG has sold six separate funds, including three that mention bitcoin in their title and one mentioning “digital assets,” according to Form D filings. The latest, NYDIG Bitcoin Yield Enhancement Fund LP, closed Tuesday after raising nearly $140 million.      On Tuesday, Forbes reported Lawsky’s indirect ties to NYDIG via Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC, where he is head of regulatory affairs. Stone Ridge is NYDIG’s registered investment adviser and the Stone Ridge co-founder Robert Gutmann is CEO of NYDIG.      Robert Gutmann did not respond to a request for comment.      After leaving the administration of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Lawsky set up a legal consulting firm that press reports at the time suggested would focus on bitcoin and digital currency concerns. Lawsky denied those rumors in a 2015 on-stage interview with Marc Hochstein, then the editor-in-chief at American Banker and now executive editor at CoinDesk.      “I can’t work at all for life on anything I ever worked on,” Lawsky said at the time. “If someone wanted to hire me to get a BitLicense, no can do.”      As noted, the filing does not spell out what Lawsky does as an elected manager, and nothing in the document indicates he helped NYDIG obtain its BitLicense.      In addition to New York Digital Investment Group, Lawsky is a member of Ripple’s board of directors. While Ripple also holds a BitLicense, the remittance firm received it more than a year before Lawsky joined in late 2017. He was still listed as a member of the board on May 12.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/13/fund-manager-got-ny-bitlicense-11-months-after-hiring-its-architect,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ccd1eea62549e62822aed00e8b7faf60821de606-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Loosely based on the “Proust Questionnaire” – which the French author answered but did not devise – we sent out a survey asking questions about life, money and death. Once a popular parlor game in the fin de siecle, thought to reveal the true personalities of its respondents, we’ve revamped the survey for our own age of transition.      Crypto is a fractured community, removed from the outside world. We’re hoping our respondents' honest answers provide insight into what consensus, even when distributed, can be found.      Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, a base-layer blockchain with a storied past, was the first to respond over email.      Your favorite blockchain protocol? Tezos, of course!

42383703,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9S7,1589395015,Many Ether Whales Might Be Leaving for Bitcoin: Data,"While ether’s (ETH) price has risen by nearly 50% this year, the number of addresses holding large amounts of the currency, popularly known as whales, has declined significantly.      The seven-day average of the number of unique addresses holding 10,000 ethers or more fell to 1,050 on Tuesday. That's the lowest level since January 2019, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      The whale addresses are down nearly 6% from the December high of 1,115. The metric represents externally owned accounts, or the ones controlled by private keys, and excludes contract accounts that have their own code and are controlled by the code.      The decline in the number of ether whale addresses is in contrast to the recent rise in the number of bitcoin whale addresses. The seven-day moving average of the number of addresses holding 10,000 bitcoins or more rose to 111 at the end of April, the highest since August 2019.      “Some ETH whales could have moved into BTC in anticipation of potential price appreciation in the top cryptocurrency due to effects of the mining reward halving,” said Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets data.      The bullish hype surrounding bitcoin’s third halving, which took place on May 11, was quite strong and the event was extensively discussed by analysts over the past few months. The bullish expectations were reinforced by bitcoin's quick recovery to $7,000 in just five days following its drop to $3,867 on March 12.      That may have caused some whales to switch to bitcoin from ether ahead of halving. That is further evidenced by the number of large BTC addresses that jumped by 5% in March while those of ether were on a downward trend.      The divergence could continue to widen because bitcoin is used mainly as a value storage vehicle, according to Jason Wu, CEO and co-founder of the Minneapolis-based digital lending and borrowing platform DeFiner.org. As a result, whales are more likely to hold large amounts of bitcoin than ether, whose main purpose is to facilitate, then monetize, the work done on Ethereum.      Read more: The 3 Factors Fueling Ether’s 2020 Rally      “Ethereum has a big application layer ecosystem, and a lot of transactions happen to meet people’s daily demand for solutions like DeFi, games, rewards, etc. More and more new addresses will be created to hold ETH,” said Wu.      Another possible reason for the decline in the large ether addresses could be the increased investor interest in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      “The address owners may have moved a sizable amount of their holdings to smart contracts of various DeFi protocols that support lending, etc. to make more money,” said Ashish Singhal, CEO, and co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.co.      The number of ether locked up in DeFi rose to a record high of 3.23 million in February and currently stands at 2.65 million, up 28% year on year, according defipulse.com. The rapidly growing DeFi space is dominated by Ethereum, and according to defiprime.com, there are 213 listed DeFi projects at press time, of which 199 are built on Ethereum.    Small addresses grow rapidly    The decline in the large addresses is also in stark contrast to the relentless rise in the number of addresses holding 32 or more coins.      The seven-day average of the total address containing 32 ETH or more stood at a record high of 114,625 on Wednesday, a gain of over 4% this year. “The uptick may be attributed to the bullish sentiment around the rollout of Eth 2.0,” said Singhal.      This is because an address is required to maintain a balance of 32 ETH to become a validator in the impending transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, dubbed Ethereum 2.0.      Read more: Staking, Ethereum’s Mining Alternative, Will Be Profitable – But Barely      In a proof-of-work mechanism (Ethereum’s current protocol), miners solve cryptographically difficult puzzles to complete transactions on the network and get rewarded.      In PoS, instead of miners, there are validators, which lock up some of their ether as a stake in the ecosystem. In layman’s terms, staking is similar to earning interest on a fixed income investment like bonds. Essentially, the protocol upgrade, which might be delayed to the third quarter, will allow holders to earn yield by staking.      It should be noted that the rise in the number of unique addresses holding more than 32 ETH or any balance does not necessarily mean an influx of new investors. A single user can hold multiple addresses.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/13/many-ether-whales-might-be-leaving-for-bitcoin-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f80a296d4a068af6bea8017437f8617512dbda77-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383685,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9AV,1589389319,Less Than 1% of FinCEN's Suspicious Activity Reports Since 2013 Mentioned Crypto,"CORRECTION (May 13, 18:47 UTC): An earlier version of the headline overstated the share of suspicious activity reports that were crypto-related. As noted now, it was 0.59%; the 1.4% figure was a proportion of SARs filed just by money services businesses, one of several categories of reporting firms.      More than 70,000 crypto-related suspicious activity reports (SARs) have been filed since 2013, but the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued a stark warning that some offshore companies may not be doing enough to stamp out illicit behavior.      Speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed virtual conference on Wednesday, FinCEN Director Kenneth Blanco said that around half of these reports were submitted by crypto companies themselves, allowing FinCEN to build a better map of IP and wallet addresses that are linked to potential criminals. Still, the figure represents just 0.59% of the more than 12 million reports FinCEN received between 2014 and 2019 (2013 figures were not immediately available).      Back in December, Blanco confirmed FinCEN received a total of 11,000 crypto-related SARs, with 7,100 filed by crypto companies themselves, between May and December 2019. In August 2018 FinCEN was getting as many as 1,500 filings every month.      See also: JPMorgan Bank Takes on Coinbase, Gemini as Its First Crypto Exchange Customers      FinCEN collects and analyzes data from across the financial sector in order to enforce the U.S.' strict anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.      While better monitoring from traditional financial institutions, as well as FinCEN's improving expertise in covering the space itself, has made it easy to oversee the crypto space, Blanco said self-reporting from industry players themselves remains ""paramount.""      But there were some unresolved issues. Some offshore crypto companies operated as unregistered money services businesses (MSB) with no proper AML policy or commitment to reporting suspicious activity.      ""We are increasingly concerned that businesses located outside the United States continue to try to do business with U.S. persons without complying with our rules,"" Blanco said. ""If you want access to the U.S. financial system, and the U.S. market, you must abide by the rules. We are serious about enforcing our regulations.""      See also: Telegram Abandons TON Blockchain Project After Court Fight With SEC      FinCEN is also beginning to look closely at privacy coins and any company offering them. Blanco added officials would also begin to inspect the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act (AML/CTF) controls in place to ensure exchanges are acting in full compliance.      ""If you're going to avail yourself of the U.S. financial system from abroad, you should not consider it a viable competitive advantage to do so without engaging in the financial integrity practices that make this financial system so powerful,"" he warned.

42383686,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y99F,1589385843,Popular BTC Derivatives Product Goes Live on DeFi's dYdX,"The top bitcoin derivatives product is now available on decentralized finance (DeFi).      Andreessen Horowitz-backed dYdX released its Bitcoin Perpetual Contract from private alpha on Wednesday, bringing the most liquid digital asset derivative to Ethereum’s burgeoning DeFi market for non-U.S. investors. Unlike similar futures products, perpetual contracts don’t expire at a set time.      “For the first time, users can trade the most popular financial product in crypto – BTC perpetual contracts – on a decentralized exchange,” dYdX founder Antonio Juliano said in a private message.      dYdX’s newest derivative will offer 10x leverage and no expiry, with margin and settlement conducted in USD Coin (USDC), the company said in April when the private alpha was first announced.      Zhuoxun Yin, dYdX’s head of operations, told CoinDesk in a phone interview that the contract, which will trade on its own native order book separate from the rest of the exchange, remained incognito for testing and feedback over the previous month. Notably, the contract is not built on the ERC-20 standard like other bitcoin products on Ethereum.      Read more: Coinbase CEO Backs Crypto Derivatives Exchange DydX      Technically speaking, the dYdX smart contract pairs buyers and sellers with BTC pricing fed via Maker’s Oracles V2, a tool for sourcing accurate price data from a number of top crypto exchanges.      As a non-custodial exchange, liquidation contracts can be processed by anyone. Yin said the BTC-USDC liquidations market has “10-20 active participants,” but most remain anonymous. Wintermute Trading will act as one of those known parties, according to The Block.      The bitcoin contract will soon also be joined by ETH/USDC and DAI/USDC trading pairs, although no launch date was given for those products.    Derivatives demand    Creating tight spreads for bitcoin derivatives – let alone dai – on the exchange remains an open challenge, Yin said, adding dYdX has maintained relationships with multiple market makers and has “experience building order books from scratch” for its newest product.      The DeFi platform’s perp contract has a long road when compared with centralized bitcoin offerings from players such as BitMEX. Historically, Seychelles-based BitMEX’s open interest – a measurement of the number of open contracts on the platform – has broken the billion-dollar mark numerous times.      Read more: dYdX’s Crypto Loans Hit $1B Amid Coronavirus-Led Volatility      Lack of liquidity has been a common knock against youthful DeFi trading platforms. In a tweet, Juliano said dYdX’s order book has a way to go to catch centralized exchanges like Coinbase, “but it’s not that far off.”      Yin said dYdX is looking to pass $10 million in average daily traded volume by the end of 2020. In recent months, the exchange has logged a handful of busy trading days breaking that mark, including March 12, or “Black Thursday,” where trading exceeded $20 million, according to data provider Nomics.      Launched in 2017, dYdX has raised $12 million in funding from sources including Paradigm Capital co-founder Fred Ehrsam and Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/13/popular-btc-derivatives-product-goes-live-on-defis-dydx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71df673d351b791c3005560c1b5760411dece6dd-1500x922.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383698,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9Lp,1589378964,Exchange Run by Ex-Morgan Stanley Team Drops Trading Fees for Subscription Model,"Crypto derivatives exchange Phemex is swapping out its existing trading fee structure for a new subscription model it says will make frequent trading more accessible.      The Singapore-based exchange, which only launched in November, said its new Premium subscription model would encourage clients to trade as much as they like on the platform without towering fees. Open only to manual traders, subscriptions start at about $10 a month – paid in the tether (USDT) stablecoin – and will be available as of Friday. Clients using algorithms for trading will still be charged maker, taker fees.      In itself, the subscription-based model isn't revolutionary: many large exchanges already offer a flat fee to larger clients. But Phemex is offering subscriptions for traders who may not otherwise meet the minimum deposits and volume thresholds required on other platforms. Clients that deposit more than 0.02 bitcoin (around $180 at press time) or make more than $1,000 worth of trades a month will be eligible for a 30-day membership.      See also: CME Says Volume Surge Shows Strong Institutional Interest Before Bitcoin Halving      Phemex announced a $3.5 million Series A funding round, led by NGV Ventures, earlier this year. It already offers perpetual contracts – futures without expiry dates – on coins including bitcoin and ether, at 100x leverage. Currently unregulated, the exchange has applied for a license with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.      With eight team members coming straight from Morgan Stanley, the exchange said one of its aims is to add traditional products such as stock indices, commodities and products based on interest rates to the platform somewhere down the line.      In a statement, Phemex CEO Jack Tao – a former senior leader at Morgan Stanley's electronic trading desk – said the new subscription model was ""in line with the blockchain's mission to facilitate financial transactions."" By putting customer needs first, he claimed Phemex would ""empower individuals with all the advantages of our service in a cost-saving manner.""

42383705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9Vt,1589377844,"Blockchain Bites: FATF, Financial Inclusion and Banking Without Banks: A Look Ahead at Consensus, Day 3","Things are settling in on the third day of Blockchain Week.  Tuesday saw Nym’s Harry Halpin give an in-depth demonstration on how to shield your transactions, while Vitalik Buterin walked back a comment he made the previous day.      Here’s what my colleague Nikhilesh De watching for throughout the day:    Good morning folks, and welcome to day three of CoinDesk’s Consensus: Distributed. There’s a lot to look forward to today, but in the interests of keeping this newsletter opening relatively short I’m going to focus on two themes I’m personally interested in: financial inclusion and the Travel Rule.Financial inclusion is an issue that’s pretty important to me. It’s a great goal for fintech and crypto startups to target, but there are underlying issues I’ve seen few companies address, including the infrastructure concern. Even if a project is easy to use and works at scale, how are individuals with limited internet access going to use them? What are the financial and technological on- and off-ramps for these individuals? I’ve had no part in planning today’s workshop, but these are some of the questions I hope are brought up – even if a solution isn’t immediately apparent, the conversation itself is one that desperately needs to happen.The other workshop I’m looking at today concerns the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule Recommendation. A quick recap: Last year FATF, an intergovernmental standards body for financial institutions, recommended nations enforce the so-called Travel Rule on virtual asset service providers (VASPs), meaning exchanges and some wallet providers will be required to know information of recipients of fund transfers even if those recipients aren’t their own customers. Various entities have been trying to develop standards for the industry in the year since. (Check out my colleague Ian Allison’s excellent coverage in this area.) With the implementation deadline coming up next month, it’s an issue that should remain on people’s minds. (Full disclosure: I’ll be moderating one of the panels during this workshop.) - Nikhilesh De  What To Watch    9:00 - 10:00 a.m. ET Oxford: From Cyber Security to Cyber Future - Workshop David Shrier, Oxford futurist, breaks down the interconnections between cyber-worlds, data privacy and crypto.      10:00 - 1:00 p.m. Is Crypto Ready for the Travel Rule? A star-studded panel discusses the FATF’s Travel Rule, a financial regulation that could reshape the direction of the crypto industry. Amy Davine Kim of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Noah Perlman of Gemini and Jeff Horowitz of Coinbase, among others, are scheduled to make an appearance.      11:30 - 1:00 p.m. First Principles for a Decentralized Future Hosted by World Economic Forum, this program featuring Clovyr’s Amber Baldet, Hyperledger’s Brian Behlendorf and the inimitable Meltem Demirors, and many more, will examine how the cryptographic tools being built today can preserve their underlying values.      1:00 - 2:00 p.m. Financial Exclusion: Does Crypto Fix This? One of the chief use cases of crypto is to provide financial infrastructure for emerging markets and those excluded from the banking system. Carlos Acevedo, Karen Bhatia, Susan Oh and Tyrone Ross – all currently testing blockchain for social solutions in New York City – will ask and answer the question: Can crypto bank the unbanked?      2:00 - 4:30 p.m. DeFi Risk and Regulation Workshop Crypto lawyers, builders and founders dive into the regulatory schemes that may affect the nascent DeFi industry.      5:00 - 5:55 p.m. Don't Bank on the Banks: Borrowing and Saving With Crypto Greg DiPrisco, head of business development at the Maker Foundation, will demonstrate how the interconnected world of DeFi can replace and improve upon traditional banking.      6:00 - 7:00 p.m. Research Hub: Crypto Research Happy Hour Join CoinDesk Research’s happy hour to close out the third full day of Consensus: Distributed.    The CoinDesk 50    The CoinDesk 50 is an annual list celebrating the movers and shakers of the crypto industry. We've already highlighted Binance, Cosmos, Brave, Bitmain, MakerDAO, Besu and the People’s Bank of China, and will continue to announce five new names a day until the end of Blockchain Week. Today we look at why Bitcoin is still king. You can read the full list here.      Bitcoin Is King With so many cryptocurrencies and “blockchain solutions” it’s remarkable, yet unavoidably clear, that Bitcoin is still the most exciting project to watch in this space. This cryptocurrency project isn’t run by a group of youthful researchers publishing their homework in the hopes of stress-testing models with other people’s money. Bitcoin isn’t a lifestyle brand, even if some zealots congregate around it. It is just money, already today. It is a tool and not a promise. It’s value doesn’t rely on any single company. And that’s why, while startup dreams come and go like fashion trends, bitcoin remains resilient. Read the full story.

Telegram Abandons TON Blockchain Project After Court Fight With SEC TON is officially dead. Telegram founder Pavel Durov wrote in his public channel Tuesday that the Telegram Open Network project would be discontinued due to the company's ongoing legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      Stablecoin Supply Breaks $10B as Traders Demand Dollars Over Bitcoin The value of assets for all stablecoins surpassed $10 billion Tuesday, having surged by over 70% in just two months, according to Coin Metrics. Stablecoin supply growth comes as more cryptocurrency traders choose to trade alternative cryptocurrencies (or altcoins) using dollar-backed digital tokens instead of bitcoin.      17,000 People Have Filed Claims for Refunds From QuadrigaCX, Auditor EY Says These individual claims have been filed for the remaining assets of defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, totaling anywhere from $167 million to more than $300 million depending on how the assets are valued.

42383688,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9D1,1589374848,Standard Chartered Claims First Yuan-Based Letter of Credit Issued on a Blockchain,"Standard Chartered says it has issued the first blockchain-based international letter of credit (LC) transaction using China's national currency, the yuan.      The London-based bank said earlier this week the transaction, for a deal between Australian mining giant Rio Tinto and Chinese steelmaker Baosteel, was carried out over the blockchain trade finance network Contour.      LCs are particularly useful in international commodities, acting as sureties for the seller that goods will be paid for when they eventually arrive.      Contour's first successful LC transaction was between two major petrochemical companies, also in the Asia region, in August, when the firm was known as Voltron. Standard Chartered, which was involved in the initial pilot, invested an undisclosed sum in the trade finance network back in January.      The Contour platform is built using Corda technology from R3, the enterprise-focused blockchain software firm.      See also: China Injects $4.7M Into Central Bank’s Blockchain Trade Finance Platform      This is the second time Baosteel has used Contour. The steelmaker concluded a similar LC transaction, worth more than 100 million yuan ($14.1 million) with the world's largest listed miner, BHP, on Tuesday. Last week, Vietnam-based HDBank also signed up for Contour membership, eyeing a move away from paper-based LC transactions and the resulting cost and time benefits.      “The opportunity cost in trade finance is huge,” Contour CEO and former R3 Asia head Carl Wegner said in January. “Trillions of dollars in commodities, products and services are transacted daily, but the sector is still characterized by slow, duplicative and expensive processes.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/13/standard-chartered-claims-first-yuan-based-letter-of-credit-issued-on-a-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/099ba333e57b8d8a0bb11f6f33ac7b6045cc51ac-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383702,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9Qr,1589373624,Generation C: Ameen Soleimani – The Entrepreneur,"It was only February when the founder of the blockchain sex worker platform SpankChain, Ameen Soleimani, helped throw a coronavirus-themed party at an Airbnb-ed church during the ETHDenver conference in Colorado – drinking Corona beers with his “shitcoin trading friends, protocol developers, and bitcoin OGs” – but it feels like a lifetime ago.      It was weeks before several of the conference’s attendees went on to EthCC in Paris and got infected with the coronavirus, and one week before Soleimani convinced his mom to take a mass shopping trip to Costco to prepare for a lockdown in California that hadn’t started yet. “I probably could have done more to raise awareness and make people take it seriously,” he says of the church party.    This post is part of Generation Crypto, by Jess Klein.    But still, he was prepared. In addition to the Costco trip, he stockpiled drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – both under testing to see how effective they could be in treating COVID-19 patients, though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against using them at home – and even bought an oxygen tank. “On the off-chance my mom is dying of coronavirus … I’d rather have an oxygen concentrator than $400,” he reasons.      A couple months out from moving out of the apartment he’d shared with SpankChain cofounder Wills de Vogelaerein Los Angeles’s Venice Beach, Soleimani has been isolating at an Ethereum friend’s mansion in West Hollywood. The friend isn’t there – it’s just Soleimani, two other friends, a heated pool and a steam room. “I sort of hit the quarantine jackpot,” he says.      Like many others in his industry, Soleimani was able to prepare so thoroughly thanks to a combination of a global network and shared prepper mentalities. “I’ve been in a Telegram ‘Doomsday Prepper’ group for, like, a month and a half,” he says, where members share “raw feeds from doctors’ Twitters” and the like. “It turns out to be better intel, a lot of the time, than if you listen to the World Health Organization.”      Being a young entrepreneur in the crypto space generally means avoiding the establishment ethos for a more progressive outlook. For instance, Soleimani posted his first porn video to PornHub back in January. Starring him and SpankChain adviser/adult film star Brenna Sparks, it features the pair “role playing” as themselves (a boss hooking up with his sexy adviser). It took a year for Soleimani to muster the courage to post it online but he has no regrets – it’s helping normalize the stigmatized industry his company operates in, he figures.      “The old guard is like: He’s ruined his career, he’s fucked, nobody will take him seriously,” says Soleimani. Meanwhile, younger people in the space found the move iconic and admirable.      Soleimani sees this divide as indicative of business culture moving forward, particularly in the crypto space. “Eventually the old people will die, the rules will go with them and newer generations will set the cultural norms,” he said in February. “As entrepreneurs, it’s part of our role to bring those new concepts into the world.”      In light of the pandemic, this makes for an exceptionally bleak and insensitive take. But in a world where people are only dressing from the waist up for conference calls, rolling with changing cultural norms has become inevitable.

42383696,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9N5,1589372001,CoinDesk 50: Why Bitcoin Is Still King,"With so many cryptocurrencies and “blockchain solutions” it’s remarkable, yet unavoidably clear, that Bitcoin is still the most exciting project to watch in this space.      In the shadow of the coronavirus crisis, small groups of people use this censorship-resistant money to fundraise for emergency medical equipment, secure their savings and conduct international business. The godfather cryptocurrency still represents 64% of the crypto market.      Although it appears such usage is still an extreme outlier compared to speculative trading volumes, there are people who turn to bitcoin because it’s the only accessible tool that works in their particular circumstances.    This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.    Bitcoin is king because it is actually useful to people who want to do more than experiment. This cryptocurrency project isn’t run by a group of youthful researchers publishing their homework in hope of stress-testing models with other people’s money. Bitcoin isn’t a lifestyle brand, even if some zealots congregate around it. It is just money, already today. It is a tool and not a promise. Its value doesn’t rely on any single company. And that’s why, while startup dreams come and go like fashion trends, bitcoin remains resilient.      Lebanese entrepreneur Michel Haber, founder of the remote web services startup cNepho Global, now pays most of his contractors with bitcoin. “They would rather get their payments in bitcoin because they can cash out locally, wherever they are,” Haber said. “I buy bitcoin peer-to-peer, and pay my developers the same way.”    Bitcoin is king because it is actually useful to people who want to do more than experiment.    Bitcoin Core contributor Sjors Provoost said perhaps one of the most bullish observations about the Bitcoin network is that development keeps “chugging along” despite the coronavirus crisis. At a time when central banks are opening the money spigot to combat COVID-19, bitcoin’s fixed scarcity becomes more attractive than ever.      “Lightning has been getting easier to use thanks to apps like Phoenix,” Provoost said, referring to the scaling solution that lets people quickly send small amounts. “We know that with Lightning, we can handle far more usage than the last peak.”    Privacy advances    Tieron senior software engineer Buck Perley, who made an open-source Lightning tool clients use for time-stamping, agreed Bitcoin’s “consistency and resiliency to external shocks” is the technology’s primary feature. Being reliable is precisely what makes the bitcoin currency exciting to watch in uncertain times.      “As a project, the fact that [Bitcoin] doesn’t rely on funding models … that are tightly correlated to the broader economy is also proving to be an aspect of its resiliency,” Perley said.      Blockstream engineer Lisa Neigut said new privacy tools may eventually have Lightning counterparts as well, offering privacy features for a wider range of transaction types. Her company is collaborating with the French startup ACINQ to enable privacy gateways, called “blinded paths,” on the otherwise public Bitcoin ledger.      “Blinded paths are a huge privacy win for services like Jack Maller’s Zap wallet or the Phoenix mobile app that mediate invoice payment on behalf of users,” she said. “The coronavirus has also opened up conversations about doing more intense tracking of people to see the virus move in real time. As commerce moves online, I think more than ever we’re going to need a permissionless option that Lightning (and bitcoin) help provide.”      Even with on-chain fees, Provoost is optimistic about the balance of supply and demand. While some blockchain enthusiasts may see Bitcoin’s slow-moving development process and narrow focus as “boring,” advocates see this as the cryptocurrency’s most valuable feature.      “With persistently low fees, my impression is that bitcoin is on standby for a lot more people to use it,” Provoost said. “Bitcoin, or the idea of it, is an insurance against tyranny. It’s okay if we don’t need it at the moment. As with insurance, it can be good news if they’re not sending you lots of money. And the [bitcoin] price hasn’t dropped through the floor, so apparently owners are still happy.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/13/coindesk-50-why-bitcoin-is-still-king,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8482e8bcfbea046468de7e7218382bdde583f83-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383706,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9TN,1589371200,First Mover: Derivatives May Have Blunted the Halving's Volatility Spike,"Checking CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, you’d be forgiven for not seeing evidence that one of the largest events in the cryptocurrency industry's history had taken place fewer than 48 hours ago.      Wizened crypto greybeards (a status that really only takes about four years of experience in fast-moving digitalasset markets) were less surprised by the lack of price action in response to bitcoin's third halving: The prior two halvings were similarly dull.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.  Prices don’t suddenly go parabolic the moment the block reward gets cut in half. Such a fundamental structural change on the blockchain network appears to exert its influence over weeks and months, not hours or days.  First Mover pointed out a few days ago that immediate market impact of the 2012 and 2016 halvings proved marginal, with prices sliding 0.5% and 2.3%. Zooming out, bitcoin was up 80-fold a year after the first halving; it climbed 30-fold a year and a half after the second halving, reaching an all-time high of $20,000 in December 2017.  So what’s the long-term effect of the 2020 halving? If history’s any guide, bitcoin’s got some soaring ahead.  Maybe this time is different, though. One thing that really struck home was a blog post from CME, the world’s largest derivatives exchange (which began offering bitcoin futures in December 2017), discussing why the 2020 halving might be different from the ones before:    “For the first time there is a robust derivatives market for bitcoin in both futures and options. In previous halvings, market participants could only express their views on bitcoin through the spot market. This time around, firms looking to hedge or speculate have the ability to trade a derivative rather than the underlying and so they can express both positive and negative views on bitcoin’s price action.”    So what's changed is the ease of going short.      Crypto derivatives were a fringe affair at the 2016 halving. BitMEX was pretty much the only show in town. Deribit, now a key hub for bitcoin options trading, had barely launched.  Trading records don't reach back far enough to examine how the crypto derivatives market has evolved since the past halving. But using data from crypto analytics site Skew, it's possible to glean the growth just over the past year, when big spot exchanges like Binance, OKEx and Huobi started muscling in.  Across the board, aggregated derivative-exchange volumes have trended upwards:      Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of cryptocurrency trading firm GSR, noted in an email that recent weeks have delivered a boom in volume to crypto product providers.      “The majority of volumes this week have been in futures rather than spot,” he wrote. “We’re seeing that on the [over-the-counter] side. For example, GSR has had its biggest May ever and we’re only 12 days in.”      One might think the proliferation of crypto derivatives would increase crypto’s price volatility. When over-leveraged BitMEX traders have their 100x positions forcefully liquidated, the swings can get pretty extreme.      But derivatives also aid price discovery. Traders might get it wrong but the act of putting money down forces them to be realistic.      And the two-way betting via derivatives markets might help keep the price in a tighter range.      That might help explain why the halving was such a dull affair, at least initially: Derivatives may have thwarted any volatility spike.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,021 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,001 | 24-Hr Low: $8,662      Trend: Bitcoin has risen back to $9,000 in the last 24 hours. However, it's too early to call it a bull revival because a key bearish pattern confirmed earlier this week is still valid.      Bitcoin fell below the lower end of a rising wedge pattern on Monday, indicating an end of the rally from the March low of $3,867 and putting sellers back in the driver's seat. A move above $9,170 is needed to invalidate the bearish reversal signaled by the wedge breakdown.      That looks unlikely because other indicators have turned bearish. For instance, the 14-day relative strength index has violated the two-month ascending trendline. And the MACD histogram has crossed below zero, indicating a bearish shift in momentum, as noted Tuesday.      Further, there are signs of trend reversal on the longer duration chart. Notably, the cryptocurrency fell by 12% over the weekend, producing a big bearish engulfing candle on the three-day chart. The candle is backed by the highest sell volume (red bars) since January 2018.      So a deeper pullback cannot be ruled out. The immediate support is seen at $8,804 (Asian session low). A violation there would reinforce the wedge breakdown and will likely yield a quick slide to the 200-day average at $8,000.      On the higher side, the halving day high of $9,565 is the level to beat for the bulls.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,"Paddy Baker, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/13/first-mover-derivatives-may-have-blunted-the-halvings-volatility-spike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d1a2efaa8ff30c324149e09d91d51b4d25def82-1500x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Roughly 509 investors from dozens of countries participated in the auction, paying $1 per Celo Gold (cGold) token. Most investors hailed from Germany, the United Kingdom, Turkey, India, Malaysia and Vietnam, according to a cLabs spokesperson. The average buyer spent $19,646.37, which is enough Celo Gold to theoretically become a validator on the network. They often earned 50 bonus tokens for referrals.      The sale, which closed on Tuesday morning, took roughly 12 hours to complete.      The cLabs token sale builds on $30 million in venture capital funding from firms like Polychain Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Polychain, in particular, is among 77 entities already running Celo validator nodes.      The buyers on CoinList expect to receive their cGold tokens on May 18, or at least have that option. CoinList co-Founder Andy Bromberg said buyers can automatically receive the cGLD in their CoinList wallets when the Celo mainnet goes live, or they can opt to send the tokens to an external, self-custodied wallet.      ""As of Monday there's going to be live value on the network,"" said cLabs partner Vanessa Slavich.      Bromberg added this was the second successful token sale on the platform so far in 2020, after a $1.76 million raise for Solana.

42383700,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9OL,1589364644,Bitcoin Steady Near $9K as Trump Touts 'Gift' of Negative Interest Rates,"Bitcoin has ended a four-day losing trend and is trading steady around $9,000 amid rising speculation the U.S. could eventually adopt negative interest rates.      The top cryptocurrency by market value rose nearly 3% on Tuesday, having suffered losses in the preceding four days – the longest daily losing run in over two months, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Tuesday’s price rise coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s renewed call for negative interest rates. “As long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the “GIFT”. Big numbers!,” Trump tweeted.      Under a negative interest rate policy (NIRP), banks are required to pay interest rates for parking spare cash (surplus over and above the norm) with the central bank. Essentially, commercial banks are penalized for holding excess cash in a bid to force them to boost lending to businesses and consumers.      However, countries such as Japan, which are running the negative interest rate policy since 2016, have still not seen a sustainable uptick in growth rate and remain far from their inflation target. Europe, too, appears to have failed in buttressing growth with the help of negative rates, as noted by The Wall Street Journal.      Even so, President Trump wants negative rates. Interest rates markets, too, are toying with the idea of having sub-zero borrowing costs in the U.S. On Tuesday, fed fund futures contracts fell below zero implying that investors expected negative interest rates in June 2021.      Many crypto market analysts believe unconventional monetary policies like negative rates and large-scale asset purchases are inflationary in nature and could bode well for bitcoin, which has a limited supply and decreasing production over time.      While speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed conference on Monday, Saifedean Ammous, author of ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" explained the cryptocurrency’s appeal lies in the fact its programmed monetary policy is superior to traditional central bank reactive monetary policy.      Indeed, traditional central banks are reactive in nature, as their stance will shift alongside changes in the economy. That creates a lot of uncertainty. Contrary to that, bitcoin’s monetary policy is fixed at 21 million units and supply is reduced by half every four years. Bitcoin underwent its third reward halving on Monday, which reduced rewards per block mined by 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.      See: Bitcoin Halving Arrives: Mining Rewards Drop for Third Time in History      While negative interest could bode well for bitcoin, currently Federal Reserve officials don't look inclined to take that route. For instance, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans recently voiced opposition to negative rates.      Chairman Jerome Powell, too, is expected to dash hopes for sub-zero rates during his webcast with the Peterson Institute for International Economics on Wednesday around 9:00 a.m. ET (13:00 UTC).      While not likely, if Powell does signal willingness to consider negative rates in future, bitcoin may potentially find bids and rise above $9,000.      While prices ticked higher on Tuesday, so far a bullish follow-through has remained elusive. The cryptocurrency has yet to find acceptance above $9,000 and is trading around $8,930 at press time, representing a 1% gain on the day.      Some observers expect bitcoin to move sideways for now. “We expect ongoing consolidation between $8000–$9,500 for the short term. Implied Volatility (IV) and trading volume dropped dramatically following the halving, signaling a lack of direction for BTC,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      Daily trading volume on futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell by 62% to $345 million on Tuesday, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew. Implied volatility has declined sharply following the halving, as discussed Tuesday.      From a technical analysis standpoint, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside.    Daily chart    The five-day average has crossed below the 10-day average, signaling a bearish shift in the short-term trend.      The MACD histogram, too, has crossed into bearish territory below zero, as noted by popular analyst Scott Melker. That could be considered a warning of a price drop because it's backed by a ""spinning top"" candle on the weekly chart, representing buyer fatigue.      On the downside, major support is located at $8,000 (200-day average). A move above the halving day high of $9,183 could bring in stronger buying pressure, opening the doors to $10,000.

Concerns over various crypto-related frauds alongside coronavirus-related scams have prompted the two regulators to launch an awareness campaign aimed at keeping communities safe from criminal schemes.      According to the FMA, there has been a ""steady increase in complaints"" relating to a variety of different frauds since March. Social media bitcoin scams that fake celebrity endorsements and news articles were identified as being the most widely reported among the different types.      See also: OneCoin Lawsuit Could Be Thrown Out Over Plaintiff Failings, Warns Judge      The FMA's director of regulation, Liam Mason, warned in a press release that some scams have been aimed specifically at Pacific communities. New Zealand has sizable populations of Pacific Island ethnic groups living in cities including Auckland and Wellington.      “We saw the OneCoin pyramid scheme proliferate through Pacific social and community groups. Last year the FMA also reiterated its warning that Skyway Group (or SWIG) may be involved in a scam and was targeting Pacific groups,” Mason said.      “At the very least, check if they [investment firms] are on the online Financial Services Providers Register, which by law they should be,” Mason said. “Or check if they’re named on the FMA’s Warnings webpage.”      See also: New Zealand Plans to Drop ‘Unfavorable’ Sales Tax Treatment of Cryptocurrencies      The awareness campaign includes bilingual webpages and resources as well as radio ads that will play on popular Pacific radio stations in the Samoan and Tongan languages, the two most widely spoken Pacific languages in the region.      “Our advice is pretty simple: Don’t just trust, check it out. Even if someone you love and trust tells you a money-making scheme is OK, don’t just trust. There are lots of resources you can use for simple research, like Netsafe and the Scamwatch website,” said Joseph Liava’a, associate commissioner at the Commerce Commission, the consumer and competition watchdog.      OneCoin was called a multi-billion dollar pyramid scheme based on ""lies"" by U.S. prosecutors in March of last year when they indicted its leaders, Ruja Ignatova and Konstantin Ignatov.

As cited in local news source Business Standard, the company announced Tuesday it had entered into a partnership with the Indian government to help remote farmers sell their produce on the market in a bid to generate fairer value.      ""Indian farmers have been the unsung heroes of the Indian economy and we wanted to ensure that they get easy access to a global marketplace to sell their produce directly, without any middlemen"" CEO of Agri10x Pankajj Ghode said in a statement.      The partnership provides Agri10x access to the government's national common service centres (CSCs), which would enable rural and remote farming communities to register on the company's blockchain platform through what the projects calls village-level entrepreneurs (VLEs).      Under the existing model, farmers engage with middlemen to sell their produce, who then find an appropriate buyer for the farmer in a particular market. Agri10x hopes its business model will help smaller farmers connect to more buyers without the need to squeeze profit margins from engaging in the middleman process.      See also: Accenture’s New Blockchain App Lets Users Tip ‘Sustainable’ Producers    Another potential benefit is that farmers would receive timely payment in full through the use of smart contracts, as third parties causing delays in the process would be eliminated.

42383697,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y9I3,1589346132,IRS Solicits Contractors to Help Examine Crypto Traders' Tax Returns,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is seeking third-party contractors to help it assess whether certain U.S. taxpayers have properly paid taxes on their crypto holdings.      According to an email posted online by CryptoTrader.Tax and verified by CoinDesk, IRS Assistant Deputy Commissioner John Cardone said the agency is looking for contractors to “assist our Revenue Agents in calculating taxpayers’ gains or losses as a result of their transactions involving virtual currency.” At least one other company in the space, which asked not to be named, also received the email.      ""The IRS can confirm the authenticity of the email,"" the agency told CoinDesk.      The call for contractors comes as the IRS is paying increasing attention to the crypto space, having issued its first guidance on the matter in years last October and adding a question about digital currency ownership to this year’s return form. Privacy-conscious crypto users are likely to chafe at the idea that the IRS may be hiring outside parties to review their transactions.      “I don't think people will be pleased about this. However, those who have been accurately reporting their crypto taxes will have nothing to worry about,” said David Kemmerer, CEO of CryptoTrader.Tax, a software platform used for reporting.      See also: Crypto Holders Still Face Issues Reporting Tax Liabilities, Survey of CPAs Finds      Kemmerer emphasized his firm would not be pursuing the contract. “Our dedication is 100% to our users. We have no plans of working with the government in this regard,” he said.      The email was sent from an IRS government domain, and there is a John Cardone with the agency’s Large Business and International division (LB&I), according to the IRS website.      As CoinDesk reported at the time, Cardone led a session at the IRS crypto summit in March 2020. Cardone, who also welcomed the summit’s audience at the beginning of the event, opened his panel by telling audience members the tax collector was looking for specific issues of interest to the industry.      In his email, dated May 12, Cardone said the IRS is starting with “a few single-case contracts as pilots with a goal of publishing a solicitation and request for proposal for a larger multi-case contract.” Companies that participate will need to sign a non-disclosure agreement and consent to a tax compliance check, the email states.      “I wanted to make you aware of our efforts in case your company has any interest in pursuing this type of work,” Cardone wrote.      Cardone could not immediately be reached for comment.    'Hundreds of thousands' of transactions    An attached six-page “Statement of Work” details what, specifically, the IRS is looking for its potential contractors to do.      According to the document, attached in full below, the contractors would have to look at both on-chain and off-chain data; information obtained through API keys, taxpayer submissions and other sources; determine the gains and losses for each taxpayer and note cost basis; track sales and other transactions; and find any inconsistencies in how the taxpayer is reporting their data.      One section, under the “Services to Be Provided” heading, detailed the complexity of calculating an individual’s tax burden when dealing with cryptocurrencies. The document noted a taxpayer could have “hundreds of thousands of digital asset transactions” per year, which could occur on different exchanges and wallets.      “These transactions need to be aggregated, and the assets involved need to be valued, as part of the process of computing gains and losses,” the document said. “Additionally, specialized technology and infrastructure is required to digest, contain and analyze virtual currency data due to unique requirements such as but not limited to decimal place precision, varying field formats and file formats.”      See also: IRS Crypto Summit Was About the Exchange of Ideas, Not Tax Guidance      While the document detailed examples of how much data the contractors would have to look at, it does not specify which exchanges or types of taxpayers the contractors would assess.      The contractors who take on the project may also need to “testify at trial as a summary witness explaining the calculations derived from the underlying data,” the document said.    Ramping up    Tuesday’s email is the latest in a series of steps the IRS has taken to more closely oversee the crypto space.      In 2019, the tax collector sent three variations of warning letters to thousands of traders it believed to have misreported their tax liabilities after trading on crypto exchanges.      The letters advised traders to look at the exact date and time they conducted a transaction, diverging from IRS guidance from 2014, which said to apply “the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.”      The agency did not update its tax guidance until October 2019, when it published a new FAQ and additional guidance. In the same month, the IRS updated the main form individual U.S. taxpayers use to report their income to include a question about whether they owned cryptocurrencies.      The agency’s lack of detailed guidance has long been a source of frustration for crypto investors, who claim a lot of cryptocurrencies still don’t fall neatly into existing tax laws.
