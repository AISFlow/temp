42427127,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXnh,1478123479,Ethereum Bug Sends Smart Contracts Back to the Drawing Board,"Bugs are a normal part of software, but on ethereum, they may be uniquely hazardous.  That may be the takeaway from an ethereum programming language bug found this week that affects a specific style of smart contract and, because of how ethereum works (it promises applications will run exactly as programmed), most of the contracts affected can't be taken down or changed.  In short, owners of decentralized smart contracts (those that aren't able to be upgraded by one owner) can't do anything to fix the bug.  Two days after the bug report was issued, developers rolled out a fix in Solidity version 0.4.4. But the bug affects some of the addresses and types of data in these contracts so that they still can't be changed with the upgrade.  The good news is that the bug may not have affected many smart contracts.  Solidity creator Christian Reitwiessner told CoinDesk he ran a ""semi-automated"" analysis of every ethereum program listed by a popular block explorer and found that of 12,000 contracts, just four were exploitable.  Reitwiessner said none of these contracts have any ether in them, as they were likely used for testing purposes. But it's worth noting that not all contracts are shown on Etherscan, the selected block explorer. (There are more than 200,000 contracts total, so it’s hard to say how safe the remaining contract funds are).  Overall, it appears to be a minor flaw when compared to The DAO, the most notable example of a smart contract not working as intended. However, it generated discussion about what might happen in the case of other major bugs given that not all smart contracts will have a central owner that can update them if something goes wrong.  One observer on social media, for example, argued that it could be a ""molehill on the side of a big mountain"" of similar issues.  One of the more radical ideas for fixing this problem is to make ethereum contracts upgradeable in the near-term so that owners have some way of deactivating or changing the code in the case of a mishap. But the fear is that doing that could mean stripping away what makes ethereum (or other decentralized platforms) unique.  National University of Singapore PhD student Loi Luu said that it would be better for ethereum if users learned how to deploy secure smart contracts the hard way, in a decentralized manner.  Luu said:  ""I personally don't think its a good idea. It's basically against everything smart contracts are designed for. If ethereum is a beta network, let smart contracts fail, let people learn their lessons.""  But while Luu's comments suggest that it may not be a good idea to make all contracts upgradeable, there are some ways to prepare for potential future bugs, especially while ethereum is still a new technology.  Fixing the problem  Programs written in ethereum's higher level, easy-to-read languages, such as Solidity or Serpent, are compiled into byte-level code before they are added to the blockchain. The problem here was with the technology doing the compiling.  To fix the problem, Reitweissner recommended that developers do two things. One, if compiling a new contract, developers need to upgrade to the new version of Solidity to avoid the bug.  The second way to avoid the problem is the more curious example, since it requires upgrading or defunding smart contracts that are already deployed – something you might not expect is possible with ethereum.  Reitwiessner elaborated on this advice, explaining that there are two types of contracts: centrally controlled and decentralized, where no one has ""special privileges"".  The first type probably offers some upgrading mechanism or a way to remove funds from the contract.  The second type is trickier. On the other hand, since trustless ethereum smart contracts can't be taken down or modified once they’re deployed, there isn’t a lot that developers can do if they didn’t use a centralized smart contract from the beginning.  However, Reitwiessner said that developers can guard against future problems (like those with Solidity) by doing a couple of things.  ""My recommendation for such contracts would be to either keep them short-lived, so that potential bad effects are small or do a proper formal analysis of the bytecode of the contract. We are currently developing tools to help in doing that,"" he said.  Upgradeable contracts  There are some ways to get around this, however.  Ethereum Foundation external relations lead Hudson Jameson described a way of upgrading smart contracts that could potentially be decentralized, arguing that adding a way to upgrade live code is a necessity.  ""The general feeling from our developers is that at this early stage it is important to have fail-safes in your code in order to safely deactivate or upgrade contracts that hold a lot of value,"" he said.  Jameson described some potential smart contract ""fail-safes,"" where owners are able to upgrade their contracts even after they're deployed to ethereum, or where smart contracts can detect when something fishy is going on.  He said they don't necessarily need to be centralized, or under the control of one owner. For example, you could have a smart contract that puts a limit on how much of an asset can be withdrawn at a time.  ""So if an attacker attempts to drain the contract of funds or an asset, it can trigger a decentralized response like locking them out and notifying other people who use the contract that they may need to withdraw their funds,"" he said.  He described a few other methods, including hacking detection, shut-off switches and multi-signature transactions where more than one person needs to sign off on a transaction before ether can be dispensed.  Looking forward  Smart contracts on ethereum classic (the group that split off from ethereum due an ideological disagreement) are also affected by the bug since its blockchain relies on the same set of tools.  But according to its lead organizer Arvicco, developers are exploring a different long-term way of developing a programming language that’s more resistant to bugs.  ""One of the possible ways is to move smart contract language development from object/procedural to functional paradigm,"" he said.  Whatever the possible fix, the discussion implies that ethereum developers shouldn't expect their smart contracts to work without potentially dangerous consequences quite yet, which may or may not be fully apparent to those who already deployed code on the network.  As for Solidity in particular, another unstoppable bug could potentially affect other smart contracts in the future.  Reitwiessner noted that it’s always possible for a compiler to introduce a bug, and it's possible that Solidity or Serpent (ethereum's other smart contract language) have other undiscovered flaws.  However, he noted that in over two years of development, this was the first severe bug found in the smart contract language.

42427126,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXjh,1478120748,ULC Close to Finalizing Model Digital Currency Legislation,"An effort to create a template for digital currency legislation in the US could be finalized next summer.  The nonprofit Uniform Law Commission has been working for the past year on draft legislation, an effort aimed at bringing a degree of harmony, from state to state, when it comes to regulating bitcoin and other digital currencies. It grew out of an earlier project that was focused on legislation for alternative payment systems, including mobile-based tools.  According to a recent blog post by Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh, who attended a meeting in Minneapolis last week, that effort is moving toward the finish line. Though more meetings will potentially be held to continue debating elements of the draft legislation, Van Valkenburgh said he expects the ULC to be able to vote on a final version when the organization meets next summer.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The drafting committee anticipates being done with the bill such that it can be voted on in the coming summer ULC meeting.""  From there, however, it would be up to state regulators and legislatures to actually pursue the process of adopting the proposal or at least incorporating elements of it.  Some states, like North Carolina, have already moved to bring the digital currency under existing statutes. Other states, including Florida, are still at the drawing table in terms of developing legislation. These efforts have taken place against the backdrop of New York’s BitLicense, the first state-level regulatory scheme focused on digital currencies that came into force last year.

42427133,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXxh,1478104654,Swiss Lawmakers Take Steps Toward Bitcoin Regulation,"Its national railway service may have already jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon, but Switzerland is taking a slower approach as it looks to regulate digital currencies and fintech.  Days after Swiss rail operator SBB made international headlines for the decision to sell bitcoin through its network of ticket kiosks, the country’s Federal Department of Finance (FDF) outlined its plans to regulate fintech with an eye to introduce legislation sometime next year.  Key elements include plans for a new kind of license geared specifically toward fintech companies and a so-called regulatory “sandbox” for experimental firms. Under the proposed regime, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority would become the primary regulator of fintech firms working in Switzerland.  Questions remain, however. In a statement, the FDF said that it will pursue additional research into bitcoin and other digital currencies, as well as broader applications of blockchain.  The agency said today:  “...the FDF should conduct additional clarifications in cooperation with the interested authorities on reducing further barriers to market entry for fintech firms, also those outside financial market law (e.g. legal treatment of virtual currencies and assets).”  During a press conference, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer argued that the proposed fintech legislation would help draw in more companies – though the country’s accommodative stance has already led some blockchain startups to make their home in Switzerland.  ""We assume that with the steps we have prepared and the commitment we have to the overall financial services industry we can provide a solution that puts us among the top (countries) in the world that regulate this,"" he said, according to Reuters.

42427123,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXdh,1478099224,Canadian Regulator Seeks Blockchain Experts for Fintech Panel,"The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) is on the hunt for representatives from the digital currency and blockchain industry for a new advisory panel on fintech.  Announced yesterday, the panel will coordinate with and provide advice to the OSC’s LaunchPad, a fintech-focused initiative that serves as a communication point between startups and regulators. Applications for the panel are due by 30th November, the OSC said.  The OSC elaborated in a statement:  “OSC LaunchPad strives to keep regulation in step with digital innovation. The [Fintech Advisory Committee] will meet quarterly, with additional ad hoc meetings as required. The FAC will be chaired by Pat Chaukos, chief of OSC LaunchPad, and will consist of up to 10 members.”  The advisory panel represents the latest effort to bridge the gap between regulators and startups working with disruptive technologies. In August, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state’s central bank, beefed up a technology panel to include representatives from the blockchain space.  The OSC is also co-hosting a forum on fintech and blockchain in Toronto today, which includes a keynote discussion between OSC chair and CEO Maureen Jensen and blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters.  Other speakers include R3 CEO David Rutter, ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin and US Securities and Exchange Commission chair Mary Jo White.

42427131,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXvh,1478093827,Insurance Trade Group Launches Blockchain Research Effort,"An insurance and reinsurance industry trade organization headquartered in the UK is launching a new blockchain research project.  The London Market Group has announced that it will investigatehttps://www.londonmarketgroup.co.uk/survey-to-investigate-the-potential-of-smart-contracts-for-wholesale-insurance the use of smart contracts and blockchain for potential applications in the wholesale insurance market. Members of the trade organization include representatives from major firms like Allianz, AIG and Lloyd’s.  The organization is working with research outfit Z/Yen on the initiative, which according to statements seeks “to create a common view of the potential benefits that smart contracts could bring”.  Justin Emrich, who serves as CIO for Atrium Underwriters, said in a statement:  “There is significant hype around blockchain and smart contracts these days. It is the ‘next big thing’ according to the technology world, so we have commissioned Z/Yen to assist us all in understanding the potential application of these technologies in wholesale insurance.”  The research project fits squarely within an industry modernization efforthttps://www.londonmarketgroup.co.uk/modernisation-overview being pursued by the London Market Group. The group is aiming to release a report compiling the results of its research sometime before the end of the year.  The London Market Group added that it plans to develop additional reports focused on the technology, including educational materials for organization members.  The announcement comes weeks after a group of European insurers and reinsurers announced that they would form a blockchain consortium in a bid to collaboratively develop applications. The companies are weighing whether the tech might lead to material changes in how they do business. The insurance industry as a whole has been looking at potential use cases, driving activity in the startup space.

42427138,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzY7h,1478087747,BitLicense Critic Wages One-Man War,"New York's BitLicense was born into controversy.  Created by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to protect consumers from fraud and loss, critics of the industry-specific licensing regime weren't exactly quiet.  Objections ranged from the potentially prohibitive cost of compliance for startups to the perception that bitcoin companies were being held to a higher standard than traditional financial institutions. Then, last June, the measure was finalized into law, rendering those concerns moot.  But, one man would not give up that fight.  Systems engineer Theo Chino has been refining his one-man battle against the BitLicense over a period of two years and two lawsuits, which culminated earlier this week with the submission of the latest round of documents so he could see his day in court.  The aspiring bitcoin entrepreneur tells CoinDesk his plans to launch a company to help bodegas accept the cryptocurrency were cut short by the regulation, and his time and investment lost.  While his suit is certainly personal, he views his fight in larger terms.  Chino told CoinDesk:  ""If in New York, companies like mine are not allowed to operate, bitcoin is dead for the whole world.""  Filed in October 2015, the lawsuit alleges that the NYDFS overstepped its power by regulating bitcoin in two key ways.  Chino claims that, when the New York state legislature consolidated the Insurance Department and the Banking Department in 2011, the newly formed Department of Financial Services wasn't granted authority to regulate cryptocurrency.  Chino explained that he sees a recent court case in Florida in which a judge ruled that ""bitcoin isn’t money"" as evidence to support his argument that the financial regulator overstepped its bounds by regulating the technology.  But his suit also alleges that even if the DFS did have the power to regulate cryptocurrency businesses, it did so in an ""arbitrary and capricious"" manner.  Specifically, the suit asserts that the requirements demanded of bitcoin companies exceed that of traditional financial institutions.  Chino’s lawyer, Pierre Ciric, explained his client’s position:  ""When the NYDFS formulated its corpus of rules for cryptocurrencies, it created completely different, and in fact more stringent constraints and requirements, for the bitcoiners compared to other financial institutions. And our contention is that that’s not something that’s within the powers of the regulator.""  Taking on the Attorney General  At 9:30am on a crisp Halloween morning, Ciric submitted an affidavit to judge Lucy Billings to argue that the case should proceed in spite of an earlier motion that it be dismissed by New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman.  The sworn affidavit signed by Chino states that he founded two bitcoin-related companies prior to the promulgation of the BitLicense. One, Conglomerate Business Consultants (CBC) Inc, was a distributor of phone minutes to bodegas and provided the bitcoin processing service directly to the shops. The other, Chino Ltd, provided technical services to CBC by processing the bitcoin transactions.  Among multiple exhibits presented as evidence of Chino's investment is what appears to be a signed contract for bitcoin processing services and informal surveys from bodega owners expressing interest in bitcoin.  The documents filed are the latest in a series in which Schneiderman requested that the lawsuit be dismissed on grounds that the NYDFS did not overstep its authority and that Chino did not have ""standing"" to sue because he didn't have a sufficient stake in the industry.  Joining Schneiderman in his request to dismiss is the department's general counsel for banking, Peter Dean, and the assistant attorney general, Anthony Tomari.  Currently, Chino awaits the judge’s decision to either move the case forward or dismiss it. If the case advances, Ciric said there can be no settlement, only an absolute winner and loser.  The lawyer expects that, in either case, there will be an appeal.  The underdog  If Chino’s fight is starting to sound a bit mismatched, that's because it is.  ""The French Robin Hood,"" as news site Frenchly dubbed him, has a long history of fighting the powers that be.  After years of practice, including a 2014 lawsuit also against the NYDFS in which he sought $1bn in damages, Chino filed his most recent suit pro se, meaning he did all the research himself and represented himself during the filing.  Following a failed crowdfunding effort to raise $20,000 for legal fees, Chino finally met Ciric, who specializes in Article 78 cases and accepted the case.  But when he filed his lawsuit, he was still representing himself. Ciric says that at the time his client had expected a slew of bitcoin companies to be lined up at the court with him to fight the regulation.  ""To his surprise,"" said Ciric, ""he was the only one.""  A legislative review  While the lawsuit's immediate goal is to invalidate the regulation, there's a bigger-picture agenda.  The BitLicense was the exclamation mark on inaugural NYDFS superintendent Benjamin Lawsky's career, in which he issued $3bn in fines for corporate shenanigans. Shortly after the law was enacted, he resigned.  Ciric said that part of what Chino hopes to accomplish with his lawsuit is to force a conversation between state-level lawmakers that never happened because of Lawsky's successful efforts. As evidence for the need to have a more widespread dialogue and explicit legislative powers, Ciric takes the recent bitcoin regulation delays in California.  Following two attempts by California legislators to create a framework for bitcoin regulation, the effort was shelved indefinitely earlier this year.  Ciric said:  ""If California legislators lifted up their foot, why did Lawsky go through the floor with his pedal?""

42427140,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzYBh,1478054427,"What is Zcash Worth? As Price Tops $1,000 Traders Remain Unsure","Days after the launch of Zcash, the cryptocurrency markets are still attempting to value the newly released digital currency (ZEC).  While 1 ZEC is trading at roughly twice the price of bitcoin (1 ZEC was worth 1.91 BTC, or $1,388, at press time), this means movements have calmed since tumultuous early trading sessions.  But with limited supply and high demand still propping up prices, digital currency traders largely say Zcash has a long way to go before it becomes less of a speculative investment.  Petar Zivkovkski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, described speculation as still ""rampant"" in the Zcash market.  As evidence, the price of Zcash declined 25% for the day's trading, a figure that was down 200% since it traded at a high last week of 3,299 BTC/1 ZEC (nearly $2m). (Zcash block explorer Zchain suggests just under 3,000 ZEC are currently in circulation).  Trying to make sense of a market with these parameters has become a challenge, traders noted.  Digital currency analyst Kevin Zhou told CoinDesk:  ""ZEC is still pure speculation at this point.""  Relative stability  Given the massive highs observed in the markets, it may be an understatement to say that Zcash prices have calmed. The currency pair’s fluctuations have become far less severe since its launch, with ZEC/BTC fluctuating between 0.81 BTC and 2.82 BTC on 1st November.  Going forward, we may be observing real-time price discovery as supply and demand help Zcash find equilibrium.  It remains notable that the price of Zcash is now above bitcoin's, which puts the digital currency in rare company.  Yet, Zivkovski said this would likely only create new gains which would then be deposited back into bitcoin, which he believes has a stronger long-term value proposition.  ""Early miners and holders are keen to distribute (sell) their Zcash in exchange for bitcoin to capitalize on the high prices,"" he said.  In the short term, this could help stabilize Zcash's price by increasing supply. Further, the hype has also died down a bit from the launch day, as skeptics begin to take a more critical eye to the technology, the first live implementation of the privacy-focused zerocash protocol.  Significant uncertainty  What Zcash's price movements will look like in the short-term is anyone’s guess, but it's also uncertain in the long-term.  Zivkovksi spoke to the progress made by the Zcash team, stating that they have made ""great strides in cryptocurrency research"". He was not alone in emphasizing the potential of the currency’s underlying technology, as ARK Invest's Chris Burniske noted Zcash's selective privacy.  The market is also likely to weigh Zcash against Monero, a cryptocurrency project that has also prided itself on privacy.  But in spite of Zcash's claims to provide anonymity, Zivkovkski emphasized that the currency’s staying power is ""far from proven"".  Thus far, there is no major use for Zcash, he noted.
