42378631,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqYV,1455920815,Inside Bloq’s Bid to Bring Bitcoin's Code to Enterprise Businesses,"Long-time bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik and industry investor Matt Roszak have teamed up to launch Bloq, a new startup ambitiously billed as a ""Red Hat for blockchain"", in a nod to the $1bn open-source software company.  Backed by $250,000 in capital from Roszak’s firm Tally Capital, co-founders Garzik and Roszak said that Bloq aims to provide a engagement layer for enterprises companies that may otherwise be uncertain about dedicating resources to engineering and strategy efforts that leverage open-source blockchain technology.  Though the company debuted in a high-profile article on Bloomberg, the article was perhaps short on how Bloq would implement its vision, and in particular, its theses on the underlying tech for which it would offer services.  In a new interview, Garzik framed Bloq's vision as one that sees the industry evolving toward a ""multi-chain, multi-token"" ecosystem in which bitcoin will serve as the ""root of an Internet of chains"".  As such, Bloq's products take advantage of bitcoin’s features, including its secure blockchain, well-developed code base and global community.  Garzik framed Bloq as a startup aiming to emulate the tested formula created by Red Hat, which he contends was able to successfully mediate between a sometimes divided Linux community and businesses that wanted to build on the open-source operating system that ecosystem had developed.  ""Red Hat stepped in,"" Garzik, who is himself a 10-year veteran of that company, explained. ""Red Hat was the commercial enterprise that could listen to [enterprise] needs, plot them on a long term roadmap and manage the engineering and development of those features with the rough-and-tumble Linux community.""  The common theme in Bloq’s products, Garzik said, is that they will come with the support that large companies require when seeking to leverage open-source tech, adding:  ""Enterprise customers need more than a volunteer, ad-hoc support effort. They need contractual deadlines for responses. Professional 'this feature by X date' product management and more.""  To date, Bloq has already scored high-profile partnerships with industry startups Circle and Noble Markets, and is in discussions with PwC about its offering. PwC said it is still evaluating a more formal engagement with the startup.  Roszak said that Bloq so far boasts 12 employees, and that it will seek to double its staff as it scales its operations. Apart from Garzik, notable saffers include Andreas Schildbach, who today runs the Java-based application development library Bitcoinj.  ""We are just about to build out a more formal sales and marketing initiative, but it’s going to be calibrated. We're building a company for the next 20 years,"" Roszak said.  Product line  At launch, Bloq is billing itself as an ""enterprise-grade blockchain"" service, with initial products including BloqEnterprise, BloqSuite and BloqThink.  Garzik described BloqEnterprise as offering supported access to the bitcoin network, clarifying that it is best considered a ""bitcoin specific"" product.  Specifically, BloqEnterprise includes a supported version of the command-line interface bitcoind; libraries such as the bitcoin network’s replacement for OpenSSL, libsecp256k1; and bitcoinJ, a client library written in Java. Garzik said that a Python library is also on the way.  Additional products at launch include BloqSuite, its proof-of-concept development offering; and BloqThink, its strategic advisory and consulting service.  Both, he said, are aimed at striking a balance between high-level strategy and low-level engineering, and are more agnostic in how they will approach working with blockchain technologies other than bitcoin.  ""BloqThink is 'default bitcoin',"" Garzik said. ""[It's] bitcoin-centric, but not bitcoin-required. We can handle Ethereum-related proofs-of-concept.""  Roszak similarly said that Bloq is focused on helping enterprises build an ""Internet stack"" in the same way that they built e-commerce platforms in the 1990s.  ""We’re seeing a world where you’re going to have a constellation of chains, whether it's Ripple, Ethereum or bitcoin, there's going to be connective tissue of common software layers,"" he said. ""If we want that ecosystem to scale, we need to give [enterprises] those common denominator tools.""  Unrivaled support  Roszak estimated that, today, Bloq has a dozen customers who see value in its model because of its ability to allow businesses to access open-source blockchains, without having to hire full-time developers to help adapt the protocol to their needs.  ""They don’t want to hire five Core devs because they want to manage this wallet or a private chain, they want to build applications for vertical markets, whether it’s health records or clearing and settlement,"" Roszak said.  Unique to its offering is that Bloq aims to offer 24/7 support to its clients, in an effort to better assuage concerns about working with open-source tech. Bloq engineers will also implement features needed by clients into bitcoin’s code, in a similar fashion as industry startup Blockstream.  Garzik described this work as implementing the ""scaffolding"" that has perhaps so far led enterprise businesses to seek to create private blockchain solutions.  ""Open-source projects can be of very uneven quality,"" Garzik said. ""That's really what the Red Hat model is all about – working with the community, yet taking it up a notch, bringing enterprise clients the support that open source doesn't by default provide.""  He further described private blockchains as ""inevitable"", but posited that using bitcoin's code for such projects may be the best way to ensure there is compatibility between all blockchain and distributed ledger systems.  Ex-factors  Of course, given the budget and experience of the Red Hat team, Garzik and Roszak also addressed the need for a company like Bloq even if Red Hat were to enter the market.  Roszak said Bloq would benefit from an imbalance in the amount of interest in the space and the amount of qualified professionals who can work with the new technologies needed to carry out this vision.  Because of the early stage of the technology, however, he said he believes companies like Oracle and Red Hat are unlikely to offer such solutions in the near-term, and that they may even become customers of Bloq given its collected expertise.  ""We look at ourselves as partners to these companies in terms of our go-to market and how we view the ecosystem,"" he said.  Garzik also addressed why he is not concerned about building Bloq as a service focused on the bitcoin blockchain, even amidst the current turmoil in its development community.  Though Garzik is one of the developers working on Bitcoin Classic, an effort seeking to scale the bitcoin network's transaction capacity through a hard fork, he sees Bloq as ""policy neutral"".  ""We are very happy to support customers with Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Classic consensus rules, and that is what we will do moving forward,"" he said.  Garzik pointed to past posts in which he stated he believes both versions of the bitcoin software suffer from governance issues, but that ultimately, Bloq's function is not to present problems to technical debate, but provide choice to customers seeking to navigate such decisions as necessary to their business  ""We provide the choice, and then step back and let the customers choose,"" Garzik said, concluding:  ""Fortune 100 customers shouldn't have to worry about all the minute details of bitcoin forking. They should have a menu of informed options, and choose from there.""

42378630,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqXF,1455913229,Bitcoin Price Passes $420 Mark Amid Institutional Attention,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.  Bitcoin prices rose over the last week, pushing higher as the sentiment surrounding the digital currency strengthened.  Bitcoin was trading at $421.69 at 12:00am (UTC) on 19th February, compared to $377.82 on 12th February at 12:00am (UTC), according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  This increase represents a gain of more than 10%.  This week provided a contrast to the prior seven-day period between 4th February and 11th February, when the digital currency hovered in a range between roughly $390 and $370, additional BPI figures reveal.  The price of bitcoin increased on 12th February, rising from $377.82 at 12:00 am (UTC) to $383.10 at 23:00 (UTC), before continuing this upward climb the following day, reaching $392.34 at 23:00 (UTC). The digital currency suffered a loss on 14th February, but then continued to appreciate for the remainder of the week.  Market participants traded a total of 15.2 million bitcoins from 12th February to 19th February at 10:40 am (EST), according to data from Bitcoinity. China-based OKCoin was responsible for 47.45% of this transaction volume for the week, and 6.785 million bitcoins were traded through this bourse between 11th February and 17th February.  Huobi accounted for another 44.92% of total trading volume between 12th February and 19th February, and market participants transacted 7.412 million bitcoins through this exchange between from 11th February to 17th February.  Blockchain praise  Other developments coincided with the price appreciation that bitcoin enjoyed during the week, as it was announced that the central banks of both the eurozone and China are looking into blockchain technology.  More specifically, the European Central Bank revealed 17th February that it is delving into how this technology could either improve or hamper the infrastructure the region uses to settle securities and payments.  In addition, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People’s Bank of China, stated in an interview with Caixin Weekly that the central bank is exploring blockchain, as well as other technologies, to establish and run an electronic cash network.  The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) provided news of its own, announcing plans to use blockchain tech as part of a technology transformation program. As a result of this initiative, the bourse may develop a new method for settling equities trades.  While these developments may be uplifting, they will not solve bitcoin’s challenges, for example, its current capacity issue, which continues to add uncertainty to global markets.  Once the digital currency’s community overcomes this difficulty, sentiment could improve markedly, with Tim Enneking, the chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, predicting that bitcoin will enjoy a ""major spike.""  Sentiment improves  Bitcoin prices moved higher as the sentiment of global traders improved somewhat. In addition, markets enjoyed tailwinds as the adoption of both bitcoin and blockchain technology grew.  While bitcoin prices had responded strongly to the highly visible exit of bitcoin developer Mike Hearn, plunging roughly 15% on 15th January, the impact of this event began to fade this week.  Hearn, who was a developer of the digital currency for more than five years, declared that the bitcoin network had failed. Several major media outlets, including The New York Times, Fortune and The Guardian, all covered Hearn’s decision to move on.  Because the current bitcoin protocol limits these transactions, Hearn argued, the transaction network is currently highly unreliable at times.  Others see this as the natural growing pains of a new technology.  ""Bitcoin is being challenged because it is a victim of its own success,"" Enneking said. ""If transactions keep increasing at the current rate, bitcoin will have a hard time keeping up.""  Enneking went on to predict that the bitcoin community will hold off on making decisions as long as it can, but that it ""is better off reaching a decision that is suboptimal than not reaching a decision at all.""  While there is still no solution to the transaction limit issue, bitcoin prices have seemingly recovered after hitting a local low of $358.77 in January.  Charles L.

42378627,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqTT,1455902405,PwC Hires Ex-UK Regulator for New Blockchain Consultancy,"A former regulator from one the UK's main financial watchdogs has been hired by global consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to join a recently formed blockchain advisory team.  PwC announced the hire of Patrick Spens, who served as the head of markets monitoring for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in a blog post earlier this week. The hiring comes at a time of increased competition between professional services firms, many of which are seeking to launch blockchain-focused services.  According to the firm, Spens will assist the firm in exploring applications of the blockchain to financial services and its impact ""across all industry sectors, government and wider society"".  Prior to his work at the FCA, Spens founded a hedge fund and served as head of equity and alternative execution trading for Citigroup's EMEA unit. According to a report by the Financial Times, Spens' exit from the FCA comes amid a broad shake-up at the agency.  Michael Rendell, PwC’s transformation and innovation leader, said in a statement:  ""We anticipate growing demand from right across our client base for help understanding the implications and potential applications of blockchain, and Patrick is one of the UK’s leading blockchain experts.""  The addition of Spens to its blockchain team follows a raft of new hires by PwC, which announced in January that it had established an office focused on FinTech in Belfast, Northern Ireland.  The firm said that it expects to grow the size of this team to 40 members over the course of 2016.

42378628,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqUj,1455894009,"Chainalysis Raises $1.6 Million, Signs Cybercrime Deal with Europol","Blockchain startup Chainalysis has signed a memorandum of understanding with Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) that will see the firms collaborating on efforts to fight online crime.  The news comes as the firm closes a $1.6m seed funding round led by Point Nine Capital, with Techstars, Digital Currency Group, Funders Club and Converge VP also investing.  Chainalysis, which is an official investigator for the creditors of collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, says the memorandum it has signed with Europol promotes collaboration and information sharing. The company suggested that the deal arose from the firm's experiences in different cybercrime cases that enable it to give guidelines for investigators when tracing bitcoin funds.  Michael Gronager, the firm's CEO, said in a statement:  ""This new collaboration is an important next step in the endeavour to move digital currencies out of the hands of the criminals and into the hands of consumers and blooming commerce.""  Europol (European Police Office) is the law enforcement agency of the European Union and has headquarters in the Hague in the Netherlands.  Focus on crypto security  While blockchain technology is now widely seen as having major disruptive potential in many different applications and industries, Chainalysis said this enthusiasm has been tempered by negative press where digital currency applications of the technology have been connected to fraud and cybercrime.  A prime example of this, the firm said, being the recent extortion of the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. After millions were demanded, the hospital was eventually forced to pay $17,000 to regain control of its computer systems from hackers.  Chainalysis also cites a Europol report published last year, that said cybercrime is quickly growing and bitcoin is becoming the go-to currency for digital criminals.  The company hopes to change that through tracking digital identities on the blockchain, and said its software is able to detect suspicious activity in real time and provide investigation tools that can assist law enforcement agencies in their work.  ""This is done through a proprietary database of metadata associated to bitcoin transactions. It is at this point that the criminals are most vulnerable,"" Levin explained.  Notably, Chainalysis is one of a growing number of firms working to develop blockchain compliance solutions, with competitors including startups such as Polycoin and Coinalytics.

42378621,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iqNB,1455890770,"Dwolla is Back, But Focused on Blockchain, Not Bitcoin","After a series of mishaps working with bitcoin startups – including the infamous, now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, Dwolla is once again hoping to work as the connector between the emerging technology and traditional financial worlds.  The alternative payment network has been quiet about its foray in the blockchain space, but Ben Milne, Dwolla's founder and CEO, says the company is working closely with startups building solutions for tracking assets on the blockchain.  As assets are sent from one blockchain to another or from one business to another, there will have to be a real-world payment in fiat currency to settle that exchange so people can pay their mortgages and purchase other things that can't be bought with a cryptocurrency or digital assets, Milne contends.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Cash assets between banks have to move so people get paid real cash for the things being exchanged.""  Milne believes as more cryptocurrencies are deployed and blockchain technology advances, whole new asset types will be created.  One of the more interesting ideas for blockchain-based asset exchange is logging the extension of credit.  When certain types of credit are extended, ""it’s good for everyone to know who owns what debt and what debt is where,"" Milne said, adding:  ""Hypothetically, it would have been good to know who held the parts of the collateralized debt obligations during the 2008 crisis.""  Preventing another collapse  Leading up to the financial crisis, banks made poor loans because they could pool various loan types and sell that bundle to third party investors as mortgage-backed securities, passing off the risk.  The complexity of this process can limit investors ability to monitor risk themselves and competitive securitization markets are prone to declining underwriting standards.  But instead of the opaque securitization process in place today, if registered on a blockchain, these exchanges could be transparent helping people manage risk.  The process would not be so much about changing the core ledger systems banks already use for storing assets, but making part of that process public so financial institutions, regulators and experts can have a better picture of what’s happening, Milne says.  Milne wouldn’t divulge the companies Dwolla is currently negotiating with but mentioned the interesting work R3 and Chain are doing. For instance, Chain's partnership with NASDAQ signals that the market is finding ways to leverage blockchain technology to solve organizational problems while also communicating with the status quo, he says.  Uniquely poised  But Dwolla isn’t in the business of determining which assets are moving, just ensuring that the cash equivalent for those assets passes between existing financial institutions.  ""Dwolla has a very interesting asset in [its] alternative payment network which they’ve had before bitcoin and Ripple,"" says Gil Luria, an analyst focusing on bitcoin at Wedbush Securities.  Dwolla launched in 2010 and from its meager start in Des Moines, Iowa, with just a few small bank and retailer clients and two employees, it has grown to 50 employees and 500,000 customers processing more than $1bn annually.  Over the past few years, the company has built relationships with government entities in Iowa, speeding up the payment of cigarette stamp tax, vehicle registration and fuel tax. In October 2014, BBVA Compass partnered with Dwolla for its FiSync real-time payments platform.  ""They’re leveraging a trend right now in financial institution investment to bridge the gap between the blockchain and traditional financial institutions,"" Luria says.  Ripple, R3, Digital Asset Holdings, Eris, Overstock’s tØ and many other bitcoin startups that have pivoted recently, including Chain and Gem, are working in this area.  Blythe Masters of Digital Asset Holdings has spoken specifically about how blockchain technology could change the way bankers and investors trade bonds and loans.  But it’s still early days, says Luria, and Dwolla might be at a slight disadvantage because Milne has been vocal in the past about his skepticism with bitcoin. Although Luria doesn’t suspect this will be too much of an impediment since many of the initial bitcoin companies and entrepreneurs have been overtaken by a new group that sees bitcoin as just one specific implementation of a blockchain network.  Influence of Mt Gox  Of course, this group may also view Dwolla as uniquely experienced given its firsthand issues with bitcoin firms, including Mt Gox, the insolvent bitcoin exchange that would later lose hundreds of millions in customer funds.  The incident may have arguably marked the high water mark for bitcoin as a currency, coinciding with its loss in value over 2014, and with this loss, a decline in investor interest.  Months before, however, the US Department of Homeland Security seized more than $2.9m from Dwolla’s Mt. Gox account under suspicion that the bitcoin exchange was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter.  Milne isn't worried about the past, though, suggesting blockchain offers the company a chance to begin anew in using bitcoin-inspired technology to solve pressing business problems.  Milne concluded:  ""In our eyes, blockchain and bitcoin are totally different. Blockchain isn’t about currency exchange; it’s about recording, managing and moving assets.""
