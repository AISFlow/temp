36636172,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654024,1732141827,297% Spike In Cardano Large Holder Volume Suggests ADA Price Could See Another Uptrend,"The Cardano blockchain has witnessed a surge in trading activity over the past few weeks, with price data relaying this trend. Cardano’s price increase in the past 30 days has been more than impressive, with its price doubling within this period. At the time of writing, the ADA is now trading at its highest point so far in 2024 after breaking above the March high of $0.77. Delving deeper into the forces behind this rally, on-chain metrics suggest that the surge is being driven by strong buying momentum, particularly from large ADA holders. Data from the blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock highlights a noteworthy spike in large transaction volume, which today reached $22.56 billion. This figure marks a 297% spike in large transaction volume in the past two weeks. Spike In Cardano Large Holder Volume The surge in Cardano’s large holder activity is highlighted by the ‘Large Transactions Volume in USD’ metric provided by blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock. This metric captures the total value of on-chain transactions exceeding $100,000 within a 24-hour period, offering insights into the behavior of high-net-worth investors and institutional participants. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Surge To $138,000 Before Recording A 30% Crash Interstingly, the Large Transactions Volume in USD metric recently reached $28.43 billion on November 16, which is its highest so far till date. Such a figure underscores the significant interest and heightened activity on the Cardano blockchain, particularly among large-scale holders who are likely driving much of the network’s momentum. This elevated level of activity has shown no signs of stopping, with the most recent data reporting $22.56 billion in large transactions over the past 24 hours. To provide perspective, Cardano began November with daily large transaction volumes hovering just below $6 billion before experiencing a notable uptick starting November 6. What’s Next For ADA Price? At the time of writing, the ADA price is trading at $0.80, up by about 6.5% in the past 24 hours. This price point marks the highest ADA price since May 2022. Not just large holders; retail holders are also in on the trend. The ADA trading volume has surged by about 29% in the past 24 hours, coming in at $2.31 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Bullish Symmetrical Triangle, Crypto Analyst Says Next Stop Is $100,000 As it stands, Cardano is currently outperforming every other large market cap crypto in the past 24 hours. On-chain data and key market indicators suggest that this bullish momentum is likely to persist, with the next significant price target being a breakthrough above the psychological $1 mark. Beyond the large transaction metric, other metrics such as the net network growth and positive momentum in the futures market suggest a very optimistic outlook.

According to the SEC, the BitClave Fair Fund has disbursed a collective $4.6 million to eligible investors in BitClave’s 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). BitClave’s ICO, which occurred during the 2017 ICO boom, raised $25.5 million from thousands of investors in just 32 seconds.  In 2020, under former SEC Chair Jay Clayton, the SEC sued BitClave alleging that the sale of its Consumer Activity Token (CAT) violated federal securities laws. BitClave settled the charges without admitting any wrongdoing, and agreed to forfeit the entirety of the money it raised in 2017, plus another $4 million in interest and penalties. It also agreed to destroy all uncirculated CAT and request that exchanges delist it as part of the settlement agreement.  Though BitClave agreed to pay approximately $29 million to the SEC’s fund to pay back investors, it had only paid $12 million as of February 2023, according to the SEC’s most recent document detailing the plan for the BitClave Fair Fund. Eligible investors were required to submit their claims by August 2023. The SEC informed claimants if their claims were accepted or denied this past March.  It is unclear what will happen with the remaining $7.4 million in the BitClave Fair Fund. Neither the SEC nor the fund administrator responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment or clarification on the discrepancy between the disbursement amount and the amount in the BitClave Fair Fund by press time.

36633169,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654007,1732136459,"FET Breaches Key SMA Level, Will Bears Push Prices Lower?","The price of Fetch.ai (FET) has slipped below its critical 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), raising concerns about the potential for further downside toward the next support level at $1. This breach marks a pivotal moment for the asset, opening the door for negative pressure to take hold. As FET navigates this crucial phase, market participants are closely monitoring its ability to recover above the SMA or risk deeper declines. FET’s recent slip below the 100-day SMA, a significant technical indicator, and its implications for future price movements will be analyzed in this article. It will also explore whether this breach signals a continuation of bearish momentum or a possible recovery, providing insights into key levels and scenarios to watch in the coming days. Analyzing Bearish Momentum: Is A Deeper Decline Likely For FET? FET has fallen below the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, signaling downbeat strength as the price approaches the $1 support zone. This breakdown indicates reduced buyer interest, giving bears control of the market. Holding at $1 could trigger a reversal, while a breach below may lead to more declines toward lower support levels. Also, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen below the critical 50% level, currently at 44%, indicating a shift toward bearish sentiment and growing selling pressure as FET struggles to regain upward momentum. With the RSI under 50%, sellers are taking control, and if the RSI fails to recover above this threshold, the pessimistic trend may continue. Traders should watch for any signs of a reversal or if the price remains under pressure, potentially leading to further drops. Related Reading: FET At Risk Of Further Decline? RSI Signals Sustained Bearish Pressure On the daily chart, FET is showing strong negative strength, highlighted by a bearish candlestick pattern that has pushed the price below the 100-day SMA. This pattern implies that sellers are firmly in control of the market, relentlessly driving the price lower and prompting a strong likelihood of additional drops in the near term. Finally, the 1-day RSI analysis suggests that FET may face extended losses, as it remains below the 50% threshold, reflecting a continued bearish trend. With selling pressure likely dominating, the chances of further declines are high. A recovery above the 50% level could signal a potential reversal, but FET continues to struggle to regain an upward momentum for now. Navigating Risks And Opportunities In FET’s Price Action Navigating the risks and opportunities in FET’s price action requires a careful assessment of key technical indicators and market sentiment. As FET trades below its 100-day SMA and the 4-hour RSI drops below the 50% threshold, bearish momentum is gaining traction, which could signal more downside toward the $1 support range. Related Reading: FET Price Under Pressure: RSI Flags Extended Bearish Move Toward $0.966 However, opportunities for a reversal may arise if the asset manages to hold above key support levels or if buying pressure resurges, driving the RSI back above 50% and reclaiming the 100-day SMA. Meanwhile, this could pave the way for a potential move toward the $1.8 resistance level.

42415477,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJcou,1732134716,Is the Crypto Conference Circuit Good for Crypto?,"If you’re part of Web3, odds are you’ve spent much of this year traveling abroad. It’s likely you just got back from a conference if you’re reading this. Maybe you’re at one while reading this now. Regardless of where you’re based, you’ve likely hopped from one international conference to another. Over the years, these events have stretched across the United States, South America, Europe, Asia, and might soon make it all the way to Antarctica with the pace of how it’s going now. Around each major gathering, hundreds — soon thousands — of side-events pop up (the recent Devcon in Bangkok featured more than 700).  It’s the reality of working in this space: relentless travel and endless panels. But let’s be honest: it’s time to reconsider the conference circuit.  This isn’t to say all conferences are useless — some, like Consensus, ETHDenver and others, are valuable. But, spending an entire year bouncing from one event to the next is hardly a recipe for adoption. If it were, we’d have more to show for it than empty crowd shots and panelists answering their moderator’s questions to vacant seats. Some photos which got more attention than entire side events. While it makes sense for a decentralized industry with no central hub to meet up in person, it’s become a running joke: even people based in the same city often have to meet at a conference halfway across the world. It’s neither efficient nor sustainable.  It’s true that, for now, most networking in this space happens at conferences, and until a central industry hub emerges, that will likely remain the case. But collecting a handful of new Telegram contacts and snapping selfies with promises to reconnect doesn’t compare to having focused time at home to create real value. The reality is that most of those chats become a graveyard of forgotten messages, never evolving beyond the initial promise to “connect after the conference.” And unless there’s some sort of return you can quantify every quarter for all the cost then it doesn’t make sense.  Will mass adoption really come from panels where everyone agrees, speaking to rooms with mostly empty seats? And of those in attendance, how many are there simply to reinforce the same views? All this, financed by a “pay-to-play” model that rewards stage time over genuine merit, leaving little room for truly innovative ideas to spread. Instead, it creates an echo chamber where fresh perspectives are rare, and real differentiation of thought is almost nonexistent.  Even worse, how many more parties do we need to attend where some large DJ act that doesn’t know or care about the industry comes to play a set when bull runs are in effect? Isn’t anyone else tired of this? Isn’t anyone else thinking how much money is being wasted?  Currently, it seems the primary goal is to become the most influential crypto company or figure — within the crypto world itself. But with finite funding, even for well-funded companies that have or haven’t launched their tokens, it’s worth re-evaluating the cost-benefit of this approach. If it were truly effective, would we be facing a reality where chains with multi-billion-dollar market caps struggle to attract even single-digit daily active users? It's harsh but it is also necessary to look at it through this lens.  First, even the best-staffed teams in crypto are lean compared to traditional corporate setups. If these teams are meant to focus on driving adoption, who really benefits when we pull large portions of them away, covering $1,000+ conference tickets, flights, hotels, daily stipends for food and transport — and worse, the lost hours spent traveling, multiplied by their pay? In all honesty, the only true product-market fit this industry seems to have found is in hosting events.  Next, let’s talk about the money poured into the hundreds of side events held alongside each main conference. At Token2049 in Singapore this past September, there were nearly 600. Renting out hundreds of venues, finding sponsors, arranging keynotes and panels — all while an expensive main event is already in progress — only spreads the audience thin, leaving rooms empty and diminishing any real engagement. At best, we get photo ops that let us feel important, convincing ourselves that sharing a nice-looking stage with peers is an achievement. In reality, it’s a vain exercise, serving no one but the egos of those on stage.  In any industry aiming for credibility, leaders are expected to evaluate their spending — what’s being spent, why, what it achieves, and what the returns on those spends are. So, if crypto wants to be taken seriously, why aren’t we asking the same questions? Right now, all of this is propped up by venture capital and token launches — both limited resources. Even as Bitcoin nears an all-time high, companies like ConsenSys are laying off 20% of their staff and dYdX laid off 35% of their staff just this week. So, what exactly is the purpose of this conference circuit?  This isn’t to say we should avoid conferences altogether. But is it logical to spend an entire year on the road, jumping from event to event? Shouldn’t Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge serve as a wake-up call? What was that team doing to achieve the largest and most successful acquisition in our industry to date — by a non-crypto-native company, no less? Stripe saw the potential in this space and took a forward-looking step that might actually lead us toward mass adoption.  If we consider all the money spent on conferences each year and redirect even a portion toward innovative onboarding strategies, we’d be far better off. Let’s experiment with explaining our ideas simply to the users we claim would love and use our tech. Otherwise, we risk remaining in a category seen as a passing fad — until real use cases with real users finally emerge.

42415474,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJcrQ,1732134250,"Crypto Agents and Verifiable Systems Are the Future of Safe, User-Centric Tech","As technology continues to progress, a critical question surfaces: how can we build systems that empower individuals while safeguarding against misuse? The answer may lie in an emerging class of autonomous digital technology, commonly being referred to as “agents.” Agents are self-governing systems designed to operate independently, securely, and transparently on the Internet.  Now, when we think of autonomy in tech, it often triggers visions of runaway AI, out-of-control systems, and an unsettling loss of human oversight. “Giving power to the machines,” if you will. There is much talk at the moment about agents “transforming human’s jobs,” and prominent recent examples in crypto involve trading memecoins and interacting autonomously on-chain.  But agents can be designed to complement human efforts, not replace them. These verifiable autonomous systems enhance user empowerment by embedding trust in technology and managing high-stakes tasks efficiently, removing the possibility of tampering. That being said, both the agent's autonomy and transparency in their operations is crucial for fostering trust and aligning with human values, which is why decentralized protocols are so important to their development.  When autonomous technology is thoughtfully implemented, it could become a powerful ally, especially as we confront the potential challenges and consequences of increasingly powerful artificial intelligence.  What Are Crypto Agents?  A crypto agent is autonomous technology – a specialized software program that operates on a blockchain or within a decentralized environment. It uses cryptographic tools to carry out transactions, make decisions, and interact with on-chain and off-chain resources without human intervention.  As opposed to “generative” AI, think of crypto agents as smart, impartial technology that maintains security and integrity by design. They follow predefined rules or AIs, making them predictable, tamper-resistant, and suitable for high-stakes applications.  Importantly, this autonomous technology is not limited to futuristic, high-tech situations. Such automation can already be seen in isolated instances such as the Pittsburgh-based Surtrac traffic system that uses it to coordinate city traffic lights, reducing wait times by 40%.  Crypto agents bring this level of intelligent autonomy to the widely composable landscape of blockchains, securely performing tasks like executing smart contracts and signing transactions. With the right tools they can even interact with traditional Internet platforms and applications, all with minimal risk.  Empowering Users  Properly implementing autonomous tech on blockchains is leading us toward a user-centered tech future by embedding trust directly into systems, enabling transparent and secure interactions across applications. Currently, only one network, Lit Protocol, is live with a sufficiently secure setup to ensure agents are autonomous via the management of decentralized keys. Specifically, Lit Protocol is a network that manages a distributed private key (MPC TSS) that is programmable and across a network of nodes running cryptographically sealed encrypted virtual machines (TEE).  By executing complex tasks autonomously, these agents enhance security, reduce dependence on central authorities, and eliminate intermediaries. This empowers users to have more control over their digital interactions, while minimizing the trust they need to extend to these agents.  Applications for this technology span finance, data sharing, education, and beyond. For instance, platforms like Genius Terminal use agents for decentralized digital asset trading, while in data sharing, agents allow users to control their information, choose who gets to use it, and either sell it or exchange it for personalized recommendations. In education, they link LLMs for assessing the accuracy of answers to blockchains for transparent verification and real-time rewards that engage learners. This is really just the beginning, as these agents get more advanced, they’ll be able to take on more sophisticated tasks too.  Beyond what this autonomous technology can improve for our lives, there are also important ways that it may be able to protect us as well. As AI-generated content surges, agents may become essential for verifying data and authenticating sources, providing clarity amid information overwhelm.  With companies like Fox and TIME exploring blockchain-enabled content verification, crypto agents may be positioned to act as digital stewards of authenticity, empowering users to navigate a secure, transparent, and verified digital landscape.  Decentralized infrastructure like Lit Protocol provides the essential tools that allow these agents to operate autonomously and securely. This is made possible by the defense in depth architecture of running MPC TSS across a network of bare metal TEEs. Networks like Lit Protocol that provide secret management and private, immutable computation permit autonomous technology to perform sensitive tasks independently, ensuring privacy,data integrity, and user control.  Such capabilities are critical, allowing agents to handle private information and make decisions without reliance on centralized systems, which establishes the trust and transparency foundational to their role.  The Future of Verifiable, Autonomous Technology  Crypto agents represent a shift towards secure, user-centered technology that operates independently, with robust guardrails to keep interactions safe and verifiable. As they perform critical tasks – from verifying information to managing digital assets – they help create a trust-based internet where transparency, empowerment, and privacy coexist.  Rather than “giving power to the machines,” users gain more autonomy as agents handle complex processes, acting as reliable allies in an increasingly complicated and opaque digital landscape. Crypto agents could provide the foundation for an internet that empowers individuals, ensuring they stay at the center of an efficient, secure, and authentically verifiable experience.

42435288,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kosEc,1732132800,Frank McCourt's Decentralized Internet Project Enters Ethereum Ecosystem With Consensys Partnership,"Project Liberty, which is building a decentralized social media ecosystem, is working with Consensys to expand into Ethereum (ETH).  The project is ""meeting the zeitgeist"" and is population-scale ready, founder Frank McCourt said in an interview.  Project Liberty, billionaire Frank McCourt's attempt to create a decentralized social media platform, is partnering with Ethereum developer Consensys to enter that blockchain's ecosystem.  Under the agreement, announced on Wednesday, Project Liberty's Frequency blockchain will become compatible with Consensys' technology, including the Linea layer-2 network that uses ""zero knowledge"" privacy technology to achieve massive transaction throughput and the MetaMask self-custody wallet, which has 30 million monthly active users.  The added compatibility may help spur interest in Frequency and its Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), an open standard for moving data around, while generating fee income for Linea. Frequency is already one of the largest parachains in the Polkadot environment, and the plan is to add other blockchains as the non-profit organization looks to expand its reach to a wider user base.  Project Liberty says it wants to reduce consumer reliance on monolithic social media companies, such as Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) and Meta's (META) Facebook. User dissatisfaction has already led to an exodus from X, including to Meta's alternative called Threads. Many have flocked to Bluesky, which is set up as a public benefit corporation and embraces decentralization principles that echo Project Liberty's, following the U.S. election two weeks ago. Bluesky has added 1 million accounts on some days and this week crossed the 20 million user threshold.  ""We all know how the network effect works, and when you own so many relationships and so many people in your walled garden, you have a privilege versus everyone else,"" McCourt said in an interview. ""By opening up and creating this universal social graph that's accessible by everyone, where individuals control their stuff, you then have the network effect embedded in the internet.""  The scope of Project Liberty's vision is wider and deeper than just tackling some of the more prominent abuses found in social media, however. According to the company, it's about building a fairer internet, devoid of walled gardens and surveillance capitalism, closely aligning the project with Web3, a concept originally espoused by technologists like Consensys chief Joe Lubin.  ""This is a transformative moment, in my opinion,"" McCourt said. ""We're meeting the zeitgeist where it is with something that's been extremely well engineered and thoughtfully done with a massive amount of time and money invested in it. We need an internet where we're not eventually clicking on the terms and conditions of use of apps, but the apps are clicking on our terms and conditions of use for our data.""  Over five years in the making and with some $500 million backing it, Project Liberty says it's ""population-scale"" ready. Interoperability is the key to realizing this goal and is inevitable, McCourt said, recalling a telecommunications company called RCN that his family started back in the early 1990s, which foresaw the harmonization among large incumbent telcos that happened later in the decade.  People will look back in 10 years and find it absurd that you had to be on Facebook to talk to someone on Facebook, McCourt said.  ""I think when people are empowered, they're going to move fast,"" McCourt said.

36630250,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653974,1732131018,Analyst Predicts $200k Bitcoin On Incoming ‘Massive Supply Shock’,"Crypto Rover, a prominent crypto analyst, has identified critical indicators in the market dynamics of Bitcoin, such as a decline in exchange reserves and a favorable chart pattern that suggests a price target of $200,000. Related Reading: Poland Could Lead With Bitcoin Reserve, Presidential Hopeful Says His analysis is consistent with Bernstein’s long-term projection, which serves to bolster the notion that Bitcoin may experience substantial growth in the years ahead. These predictions have investors and analysts alike anxiously anticipating Bitcoin’s next significant move, as the market is currently in flux. Decreasing Exchange Reserves May Indicate A Supply Shock The consistent decline in Bitcoin reserves on exchanges is one of the most noteworthy trends identified by Crypto Rover. Despite the increasing price of Bitcoin, an increasing number of investors are transitioning their holdings to private wallets. For the first time in #Bitcoin history, the balance of $BTC on exchanges is dropping during a bull run. This cycle is different. A MASSIVE SUPPLY SHOCK IS COMING.🚨 pic.twitter.com/Yw5ZSJ4l0z — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) November 18, 2024 This transition underscores an increasing preference for security over liquidity, particularly in light of persistent concerns regarding cyberattacks and breaches. As the quantity of Bitcoin on exchanges declines, there could be an upcoming disturbance. Less coins for trading suggest that demand would soon exceed supply, which would cause prices to rise significantly. This tendency questions the conventional market dynamics, which usually show reserves rising in bull markets. Bernstein’s $200K Target And Rover’s Bull Flag A bull flag pattern is forming on the price charts of Bitcoin, as revealed by Rover’s technical analysis. This pattern frequently indicates the continuance of an upward trend. Rover predicts that Bitcoin may shortly surpass the $200,000 threshold if it surpasses critical resistance levels, as indicated by this pattern. Bernstein analysts further align with this positive sentiment as they reaffirm their Bitcoin price target to reach $200,000 in 2025. Bernstein’s price objective of $100,000 is increasingly plausible, and the long-term forecast of achieving $200,000 by 2025 is gathering momentum, given that Bitcoin is already trading at approximately $92,000. 🚀 Daily Crypto Movers Nov. 19 •Bitcoin to $200K as Bernstein predicts a 2025 bull run 📈 •MicroStrategy adds 4.6B BTC at 88K avg 🎯 •Goldman Sachs launches tokenized products 🌐 Learn more⤵️#Bitcoin #CryptoNews #KuCoin — KuCoin (@kucoincom) November 19, 2024 They attribute this potential increase to a variety of factors, such as the favorable political and regulatory conditions for Bitcoin, which are notably prevalent under a pro-crypto U.S. administration. Related Reading: Solana Market Cap Hits Milestone: $400 Price Target Gains Traction Market Outlook And Investor Strategy Strong technical indicators combined with declining exchange reserves point to Bitcoin about to undergo a major comeback, which would be advantageous for investors. Little changes in demand could cause significant price swings as liquidity drops. This creates risks as well as possibilities, hence a careful plan and timing are especially important. Bernstein also points out as a major influence the larger political terrain. Under the direction of incoming President Donald Trump especially, they hope that an atmosphere better suited for Bitcoin’s growth would help to drive its expansion even further.

42435283,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kos9C,1732129269,The Subtle Way AI Data Centers Boost Bitcoin Mining Economics,"The rapid proliferation of AI data centers may have a positive impact on the bitcoin mining industry.  AI data centers are just as hungry for cheap energy as miners are, so they reduce the number of new mines being spun up.  Down the line, cheap electricity may be in such short supply that hashprice will stop falling.  The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers might turn into a boon for bitcoin miner economics — even the ones that don’t work with AI.  The reason? The competition between AI data centers and bitcoin miners for cheap electricity could end up establishing a floor on hashprice, a crucial metric used by miners to measure their revenue.  “Every potential mining investment now goes through this filter: is it better to use this site for AI purposes or mining,” Spencer Marr, president of bitcoin mining firm Sangha Renewables, told CoinDesk. “Every time they choose AI or other forms of high-performance computing, that means hashrate won’t climb, and hashprice won’t be negatively impacted.”  Hashrate is a term that refers to the total combined computational power backing a Proof-of-Work blockchain, in this case Bitcoin. Hashprice, meanwhile, is the amount of bitcoin that a miner can expect to earn each time their machines perform a certain number of hashes, or computations, on a given timeframe.  At press time, bitcoin’s hashrate totalled 770 exahash per second (EH/s), per Hashrate Index data, with bitcoin’s hashprice coming in at $61.12 per petahash per day. Hashprice has been steadily decreasing as mining has grown more competitive. Back in 2017, for example, it wasn’t uncommon for hashprice to clock in above $1,000 by that measure.  Establishing a floor on hashprice would be valuable for miners as it would guarantee that computing power will never go below a certain threshold in terms of value, no matter the conditions.  “In the competition for access to cheap electricity, miners are starting to be squeezed out by more willing purchasers in the form of other forms of compute,” Marr said. “It's a specific game theory, because as the miner, you like to see other people deciding to use cheap electrons for other purposes than Bitcoin compute because of the competitive nature of mining.”  But the squeeze may simply lead bitcoin miners to move away to other jurisdictions across the globe where AI data centers aren’t sprouting left and right, Jaran Mellerud, co-founder of bitcoin mining hardware and hosting services firm Hashlabs Mining, told CoinDesk.  “I don't think the competition for power from AI facilities will significantly impact hashprice,” Mellerud said. “The Bitcoin mining network is a self-correcting mechanism, so reduced hashrate in one country will simply increase profitability of miners in another country, giving them more room to grow.” “My thesis is that the U.S. will have less than 20% of the hashrate by 2030 due to competition from AI facilities, while hashrate will grow elsewhere, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia,” Mellerud added.  Marr agreed these were valid points, though he pointed out that at the end of the day, “there is a finite number of rock bottom cheap electrons.” AI data centers are also trickier to operate than bitcoin mines; they require constant uptime, for example, and are much more expensive to build and run.  “Maybe in the end the competition for electrons slows down but doesn’t stop hashrate growth,” Marr said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/20/the-subtle-way-ai-data-centers-boost-bitcoin-mining-economics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99e535ba4020c492f00afc441dad123a1128f3b9-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36639491,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102207,1732129222,"Top Holder Keeps Solana Until It Hits $5,000, But There’s a New Rival","Solana (SOL) has become one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in recent months. Its price now sits at $235.95, and many people are confident it will grow much more. Some experts believe Solana crypto could hit a massive milestone of $5,000 in the future. This prediction is bold, but supporters say it’s possible due to Solana coin's speed, low fees, and rising popularity.However, there’s a twist. A new cryptocurrency, Minotaurus (MTAUR) , is on the horizon. Some believe this rival could reach 5,000 USDT even faster. This competition has caught the attention of many in the crypto world, making the race more exciting. Solana’s Path to $5,000. What Does the Future Hold?The current Solana price of $235.95 reflects steady growth over the years - there have been big leaps and steady bearish pressure in the past. With a market cap of $111.99 billion, Solana USD is ranked as one of the top cryptos globally. Those watching the Solana price prediction are optimistic that it could eventually reach $5,000, although it will require significant growth.One reason behind the optimism is Solana coin's ability to handle many transactions quickly. Its blockchain is known for being fast and efficient, which attracts developers and businesses. As more people use the Solana wallet for decentralized apps, the demand for Solana token is likely to grow.To hit $5,000, Solana crypto would need to increase by more than 2,000%. This might seem like a lot, but supporters point out that other cryptos have seen similar jumps in the past. Solana news about partnerships and new projects often boosts community confidence, adding momentum to the Solana price prediction.Despite recent dips, Solana price remains stable, and analysts believe it has the potential for long-term success. Its position as a leader in the DeFi space and its growing adoption make Solana USD price one to watch.Minotaurus (MTAUR): A Smart Addition for SOL Holders?While Solana has the loyalty of many, Minotaurus (MTAUR) is drawing in new fans daily with its ongoing presale. At just 0.00005984 USDT, today’s price is 70% less than the listing price of 0.00020 USDT. Those who joined at the start for 0.000040 USDT are already seeing 50% growth, and the presale is still gaining momentum.This isn’t just about buying tokens. It’s about joining a game that’s revolutionizing casual gaming. Use MTAUR to unlock unique features and dominate the maze. The gaming market is booming, and Minotaurus is set to ride that trend.The presale has already crossed 200,000 USDT, with new people joining every day. A 100,000 USDT giveaway and community bonuses make it even more exciting. Don’t miss your chance—secure your MTAUR before the presale ends and the price goes up!ConclusionBoth Solana and Minotaurus (MTAUR) have great potential to grow. The Solana price has already shown its strength, with predictions that Solana USD could reach $5,000 in the coming years. Its fast transactions, growing ecosystem, and active community give it a strong foundation.At the same time, MTAUR is creating buzz as a new competitor. With every passing week, the projections seem to get more and more positive . Targeting a booming market and offering tons of perks, Minotaurus is shaping up to be a can't-miss opportunity.

42435292,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kosFW,1732127178,"The Protocol: ENS on Bitcoin; Worldcoin, Without the Eyeballs","Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I'm Marc Hochstein, CoinDesk's deputy editor-in-chief for features, opinion and standards.  IN THIS ISSUE:  Imagine Worldcoin … but without the creepy eyeball scans  Aave weighs expansion to a Bitcoin L2  ENS, on top of Bitcoin  What Mark Zuckerberg can teach DAOs about governance  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  THE EYES DON'T HAVE IT: Over two years ago, Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI, launched Worldcoin, a blockchain project known for its distinctive metal orb used to scan eyeballs. Recently rebranded as “World Network,” the platform provides users with digital passports — verified through the iris scans — to help online services differentiate humans from bots in an AI-driven internet. Now, as CoinDesk's Sam Kessler reported this week, a group of crypto veterans, including the co-founders of decentralized finance juggernaut Lido, are preparing to launch “Y,” a blockchain identity platform aimed squarely at competing with World Network. Sam obtained an internal planning document for the new project. It lays out a vision for a new blockchain-based identity platform that skips World's controversial eyeball-scanning Orb. Read more.  CRAWLING THE WEB, AS IT WERE: Aave, the largest decentralized-finance (DeFi) lending platform, is canvassing its community to gauge the level of interest in deploying on the Bitcoin layer-2 network Spiderchain. The Aave-Chain Initiative (ACI), the driving force behind the protocol, published a call for comments on the proposal by Spiderchain developer Botanix Labs to expand the lender, which has more than $17 billion in total value locked, into the emerging Bitcoin DeFi environment. The idea of deploying on a Bitcoin layer 2 highlights the appetite for bringing functionality that is common elsewhere in the crypto ecosystem to the original blockchain. The bitcoin (BTC) price soared above $90,000 for the first time last week. Developers of projects native to other networks may be seeking to harness the deep reserves that are held in BTC. Read more.  ENS ON BITCOIN? Spaces Protocol, a decentralized naming system built on Bitcoin, is set to launch on mainnet Wednesday at around 2P ET (block height 871222). If it sounds like the Ethereum Naming Service except on a different blockchain, founder Mike Carson claims that Spaces improves on ENS in several ways. Spaces, he told CoinDesk, is ""designed to scale (top level spaces are on bitcoin, second level are done with zero knowledge proofs as a second layer on bitcoin). ENS is just .eth on Ethereum. ENS is run by a foundation, they have their own token, and Spaces has no foundation [and] no token. We built Spaces to be truly cypherpunk – no separate chain, no separate token, no foundation, with the Bitcoin used for auctions [of namespace] burned to avoid any conflict of interest.""  MORPHEUS AWAKENS: Morpheus, one of several blockchain projects seeking to decentralize artificial intelligence, is up and running in the wild, the team behind it announced Monday. Like other decentralized AI networks, Morpheus seeks to curtail the negative side effects of AI, such as centralization, censorship, and monopolistic control of data. Morpheus was built using the codebase for Lumerin, a protocol that runs on the Arbitrum blockchain (which itself is a layer-2 running atop Ethereum, the largest smart contract network). The network's native MOR token works on L2s Arbitrum and Base; on the main Ethereum chain; and on DeFi protocols Uniswap and Aerodrome.  What Zuck Can Teach DAOs About Governance  BANGKOK – It's all but impossible to carry out a governance attack against Meta.  Shareholder activism is a non-starter in Mark Zuckerberg's empire, because the company's dual-class share structure – where insider-held Class-B shares have more voting weight than Class-A shares available to the public – means he maintains roughly 58% voting control of the company.  But in the world of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which are in many ways analogous to corporations, it's one vote for one token.  That is how a whale – a large token holder – who goes by the handle Humpy and his ""GoldenBoys,"" an affiliate group directed by Humpy or perhaps Humpy himself, ran what some called a ""governance attack"" against the lending protocol Compound in July.  They used their collective voting might to allocate $24 million worth of COMP tokens into a yield-bearing protocol called goldCOMP, controlled by them, to generate passive income for token holders.  This month, a court filing by the FTX estate appeared to ""dox"" – or name – Humpy and accused him of having ties to criminal networks. Nawaaz Mohammad Meerun, the person allegedly behind the alias, denied the accusations of criminal connections in a statement to CoinDesk.  Although some described the ""attack"" as a consequence of voter apathy, OpenZeppelin, a security audit firm that Compoud's DAO has an engagement with, and an active participant on the DAO's governance forum, sees things differently.  In an interview with CoinDesk at the sidelines of Devcon last week, Michael Lewellen, OpenZeppelin's head of solutions architecture, described what Humpy did as an exploit on the model itself.  ""Governance models that are token holder-dominant, where there are no checks on token holders in any meaningful sense, are ultimately all susceptible to this. It’s just a question of when,"" he said.

This bullish signal comes on the heels of recent gains in the Solana (SOL) price, which have pushed it significantly above the $200 mark, indicating strong upward movement. Solana Price Targets $4,000 Breakout A Crypto analyst identified as ‘CryptoRus’ has shared a longstanding prediction that suggests Solana could reach $4,000 by the end of the current market cycle. The analyst has based this bullish outlook on a technical pattern called the “Cup and Handle.” Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Possible 40% Crash For XRP Price With Gravestone DOJI Candle Formation According to CryptoRus, Solana has just broken out of its Cup and Handle pattern formation on its price chart. This unique chart pattern is considered a bullish signal and, in technical analysis, signals an extending upward trend. The analyst’s chart illustrates Solana’s price action on the weekly time frame, using the aforementioned technical pattern as the basis of analysis. From 2022 to mid-2024, Solana experienced a period of consolidation and recovery, as seen in the cup part of the technical pattern. The “handle” in the chart pattern also shows slight consolidation; however, the analyst has pinpointed a breakout signal at the end. This breakout is set to occur once Solana can surpass resistance levels between $195 and $255. After the anticipated breakout, the analyst suggests a solid upward trend, with projections implying a greater upside above $4,450 to a staggering $5,000. A surge to this impressive target would require Solana to experience a 2,027% rally from its current price. Earlier this week, when Solana was on the verge of breaking out of its Cup and Handle technical pattern, the analyst revealed in a previous X post that the Cup depth of the pattern suggests a bullish price target of $400 for Solana in this market cycle. A surge to $400 would represent a 70.21% increase from present market values. Update On Price Movements Recently, the Solana price has been on a significant upward trend, recording impressive gains amidst the bull market. This bullish price movement comes as Bitcoin sees massive gains that have pushed it to a new ATH above $93,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Bullish Symmetrical Triangle, Crypto Analyst Says Next Stop Is $100,000 As one of the world’s leading altcoins, many analysts have projected bullish targets for the Solana price, expecting it to hit new all-time highs as the bull market heats up.

While the cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume of $6.8 billion is down by 12.32%, Solana still shows promise of a surge if market conditions remain favorable.

42435286,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kosBu,1732125600,Digital Currency Group’s Barry Silbert Bets Big on AI Blockchain Bittensor,"DCG chief and Yuma CEO Barry Silbert said he believes Bittensor could be as transformative as bitcoin.  Yuma will operate as an accelerator for startups looking to explore Bittensor, and as an incubator to partner up and build subnets.  Digital Currency Group (DCG), an early champion of cryptocurrencies and the digital asset industry, is now turning its attention to AI as well. Not just any artificial intelligence, but a decentralized version that drives the Bittensor ecosystem.  The conglomerate led by Barry Silbert has unveiled a new company, Yuma, focused on incubating and building new businesses that use decentralized AI to perform tasks and earn rewards.  At its core, Bittensor is a decentralized network for AI that creates incentives for people to contribute data and computing power for activities ranging from text translation and data storage to predicting the structure of complex protein chains.  “If you ask five people: 'What is Bittensor?' You will get five different answers,” Silbert, a cryptocurrency OG investor and evangelist, said in an interview. “If you remember early bitcoin, some people would say it's money, some people would say it's gold. Some people would say it's this blockchain [...] The way that I look at Bittensor is as the World Wide Web of AI.”  There's no doubt AI is a foundational technology with all sorts of possibilities, but it also has the potential to hand way too much power to the Microsofts, Facebooks and Googles of this world as users shovel their data in the corporations mighty computers. Decentralized AI may help avoid that, not only when it comes to harnessing vast untapped computational resources, but also removing some of the tech’s opaque and creepy reputation.  Bittensor’s native cryptocurrency, $TAO, is used to incentivize an army of decentralized workers: either miners contributing advanced computing services to certain tasks or validators assessing contributions for quality and allocating rewards.  This interest in AI didn’t happen overnight. DCG made its first investment into Bittensor in 2021. More recently, DCG’s asset management firm, Grayscale, added funds dedicated to AI including the $TAO token. Underscoring his belief in the project, Silbert will step into the CEO position at Yuma, which will have some 25 employees on day one.  In some respects, the Yuma incubation and design studio is to Bittensor what Joe Lubin’s Consensys model was to Ethereum. But rather than owning 100% of the subnets grown under Yuma’s auspices, it's more like the Y Combinator model of a venture capital firm mixed with an accelerator, Silbert said.  “There are two flavors of subnet partnerships,” Silbert said. “We are doing an accelerator, so if you are a startup or an enterprise who has an idea and wants to explore the world of Bittensor and launch a subnet, we will help you. Then we have a subnet incubator, where we will partner up with somebody to build from scratch a new subnet.”  So far, Yuma has five subnets that are live. Four went through the accelerator program and one through incubation. Another nine are in development and should go live in the coming weeks, one of which is in incubation and rest in the accelerator. The current roster constitutes a good mix of use cases, said Evan Malanga, Yuma's chief revenue officer.  “We've got human detection, like bot detection subnets,” Malanga said in an interview. “We have time series prediction subnets coming online. We've got a few academic ones as well; AI research, leveraging the miners in the subnets to go do that work for them, some security ones, and a role-play one. And sports predictions. Lots of sports predictions.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | BITTENSOR,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/20/digital-currency-groups-barry-silbert-bets-big-on-ai-blockchain-bittensor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ebc73d66178e155ba371ee9902041203b4b4c86-1668x938.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wang immediately met with prosecutors after FTX's collapse in 2021. His cooperation deserved a ""world of credit,"" the judge said.  He was the last FTX executive to be sentenced.  Former FTX chief technology officer and close friend of Sam Bankman-Fried, Gary Wang, won’t have to serve prison time for his involvement in the crypto exchange’s fraud scheme, The New York Times reported.  Wang pled guilty to four criminal counts in December 2022, including wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit commodities fraud.  It is thanks to his extensive cooperation with U.S. prosecutors in putting Bankman-Fried behind bars that Wang has avoided prison time, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who has presided over the entire FTX case, said.  Wang immediately met with prosecutors after FTX’s collapse, making him one of two key cooperating witnesses in Bankman Fried’s trial, alongside former Alameda Research CEO and Bankman-Fried’s former girlfriend, Caroline Ellison. For that, he deserved a “world of credit,” Kaplan told Wang during his sentencing.  Wang was the last FTX executive to be sentenced after Ellison was sentenced to two years in prison in September. Nishad Singh, the former director of engineering at FTX, was also spared prison time in October. The harshest sentence was received by Ryan Salame, who is spending seven and a half years in prison for campaign finance fraud.

36624165,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653984,1732120213,Dogecoin Forms A ‘Nasty Triple Top’: Analyst Reveals What’s Next,"The Dogecoin price is currently exhibiting a highly bearish chart pattern on the 4-hour time frame, signaling potential caution for investors. After forming a bullish falling wedge pattern between November 12 and 19, the anticipated breakout was short-lived and failed to meet bullish expectations. On November 19, Dogecoin broke out of the formation, sparking initial optimism among traders. However, crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) had predicted the breakout would be weak, and subsequent price movements validated his forecast. Where Is Dogecoin Price Heading Next? The memecoin faced a sharp rejection at a significant resistance level, specifically the macro 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. Kevin emphasized that until this level is “broken cleanly and violently, there’s nothing to get overly crazy about.” He also pointed out that Bitcoin (BTC) is at major resistance, suggesting that Dogecoin’s next significant move will likely coincide with Bitcoin clearing the $100,000 mark. “Until then, everything’s just gonna mosey around,” he noted. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Falling Wedge Pattern – Analyst Reveals Target Urging traders to temper their enthusiasm, Kevin stated, “Please control your excitement as there is nothing in the short term to be excited about. BTC is still at major resistance and so is Dogecoin. Nothing has broken yet.” He highlighted the importance of Bitcoin’s movements, adding, “It’s more important to provide technical analysis on BTC than on Dogecoin at the moment. DOGE is just trading sideways, waiting for Bitcoin to make a decision on higher or lower. Where Bitcoin goes, Doge will go in the short term.” Analyzing the 4-hour chart, Kevin identified a “nasty triple top” at the macro 0.786 Fibonacci level for Dogecoin—a bearish signal that could indicate upcoming downward pressure. He warned that if a correction to $0.30 occurs, as he had previously suggested, “a lot of blind perma bulls are gonna need to do some explaining.” A triple top is a bearish reversal pattern in technical analysis that signifies a potential shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. It occurs when the price reaches the same resistance level three times, each time retreating after failing to break through. Dogecoin’s repeated inability to surpass the 0.786 Fib at $0.41 suggests weakening bullish momentum in the short term. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Rapid Dogecoin Surge To $1: The Timing May Surprise You Kevin emphasized that Dogecoin hasn’t truly broken out yet: “Until it breaks the macro 0.786 Fib cleanly at $0.41, it’s just trading sideways.” Looking ahead, he outlined a bullish scenario contingent on overcoming this key resistance level. “If Dogecoin breaks that macro 0.786 Fib with force, then $0.80 to $0.85 is on the table. Lots of work to do though. Need BTC to push higher,” he explained. For several days, Kevin has been forecasting a deeper correction for Dogecoin. The triple top formation and rejection at the 0.786 Fibonacci level support his primary hypothesis. He outlined his initial price target: “A level we will want to hold for Dogecoin is the $0.30 to $0.26 range, which is the golden pocket retrace levels.

42435294,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kosK2,1732119392,DeFi’s Renaissance,"The repercussions of historically stringent cryptocurrency oversight are well-documented, but the ensuing sea change is perhaps not fully appreciated. With pro-crypto legislators likely to replace the current regulatory regime, we anticipate a more favorable environment for crypto applications. Decentralized finance (DeFi), in particular, is well-positioned to reap these benefits. From opening the door for traditional finance (TradFi) to partake in DeFi, to enabling fee switches and U.S. user access to protocols, it’s hard to overstate the impacts for DeFi and stablecoins that can come with regulatory clarity. With DeFi TVL up 31% and the stablecoin market cap up 4% since the election, it’s clear that users share this sentiment.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Historically, institutions have hesitated to move on-chain due to regulatory risks. However, with bitcoin ETF AUM inflows on track tosurpass the gold ETFs’ AUM within a year, finance and tech companies exploring the technology and offering crypto products, and corporates adding digital assets to their balance sheets, institutional interest in crypto has never been higher. That said, the coexistence of off-chain and on-chain capital thus far has mainly involved using on-chain capital to capture off-chain yield (e.g., Tether purchasing billions of dollars in U.S. treasuries). With regulatory clarity, we are now in the early stages of off-chain capital moving on-chain. Post-election developments, like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton expanding their tokenized money funds to new chains, exemplify the substantial capital ready to enter DeFi and are likely just the tip of the iceberg. And beyond tokenization, Stripe recentlyacquired stablecoin startup Bridge, McDonald’spartnered with NFT project Doodles, and PayPal isusing Ethereum and Solana to settle contracts. This streamlines asset management, enhances market efficiency and liquidity, improves financial inclusion, and ultimately accelerates economic growth. Regulatory clarity will add an accelerant to this already-burgeoning activity.  Similarly, DeFi projects like Ethena and Blur are starting to adapt to the evolving environment as they anticipate improvements in regulatory clarity. A frequent criticism of altcoins is their lack of inherent utility. Addressing this, Ethena approved a proposal to allocate a portion of protocol revenue ($132 million annualized) to sENA holders, bridging the gap between revenue generation and token holders. Once executed, the proposal could increase participation and investment in Ethena by directly rewarding token holders, thus setting a potential precedent for revenue sharing in DeFi. This move might also encourage other protocols to consider similar mechanisms, enhancing the appeal of holding DeFi tokens. In addition, protocols may also enable US users to access front-ends and partake in airdrops, compared to the current default of restricting US users. At the same time, development and innovation should flourish, with founders more confident about the reduced risks of building in the U.S. By expanding token utility to benefit from protocol success, enabling access to fair and free on-chain services often without rent-seeking intermediaries, and removing barriers to innovation that have made this country so great, we may be on the brink of a new era for DeFi development and usage.  Collectively, these factors indicate that DeFi may be on the brink of a new growth phase, potentially expanding beyond its crypto-native user base to interact more directly with broader financial systems. The DeFi renaissance is here.

42435282,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kosA6,1732119222,Miners Going Nuclear: A Symbiotic Synergy,"Spurred by the recent Republican electoral trifecta earlier this month and the prospect of federal policy facilitating further and more widespread adoption, bitcoin notched a new all-time high above $90,000. While all eyes have been largely fixed on the regulatory outlook in Washington, Wall Street is taking note of the new margins for miners. Just as higher prices and lower costs magnify margins for traditional commodity producers, higher bitcoin prices and lower energy costs can make mining operations more economical. Beyond the increasing proliferation of bitcoin within investment portfolios, mining operations have become a focus of a new wave of mergers and acquisitions on Wall Street.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Talen Energy’s recent 100% acquisition of TeraWulf’s Nautilus Cryptomine on October 3rd is an illustrative example of this trend. The Nautilus Cryptomine draws its power from Talen’s adjacent Susquehanna nuclear facility. This symbiotic relationship between a Bitcoin mining operation and a traditional nuclear power plant has the potential to become a prototypical model for both cyptominers and energy producers. Nuclear power can supply miners with reliable and relatively inexpensive energy, while miners can supply a consistent revenue stream to maximize the value per megawatt of nuclear power.  As big tech searches for ways to meet its voracious energy demands and policymakers search for cleaner alternatives to secure energy independence, nuclear has increasingly become a nexus for both Wall Street and Washington. On Capitol Hill, senators and representatives have passed nuclear legislation this year with overwhelmingly broad bipartisan support. In an era defined by bitter partisanship, the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act passed the Senate by a vote of 88-2 and passed the House by a vote of 393-13. This followed the House’s Atomic Energy Advancement Act and Senate’s Fusion Energy Act, both of which enjoyed significant bipartisan sponsorship and support. The White House also recently unveiled a framework to deploy 200 GW of net new nuclear capacity by 2050, tripling U.S. nuclear energy capacity. In short, nuclear now enjoys significant support on both sides of the political aisle.  As legislators look to clear regulatory hurdles for both crypto and nuclear, this dynamic could continue to facilitate a symbiotic synergy between the two. It is a developing trend worth following, given that bitcoin and uranium may continue to be lifted by the same tide as the US shifts its sentiments towards both investments and power production.

42435277,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kos5a,1732118430,Juiced USDS Yields Woo Solana Traders to Sky's Stablecoin,"Solana traders are quickly embracing the newest stablecoin to join their decentralized finance (DeFi) fray: USDS, issued by Sky (formerly MakerDAO).  Less than a day into launch, USDS's circulating supply on Solana has already surpassed $89 million. Such launch day largesse puts the coin formerly known as DAI well ahead of the other recent entrant, PayPal's PYUSD, as Solana's fastest-growing stablecoin out of the gate.  The heady growth is about as preordained as anything could be in DeFi. Sky is spending $2 million a month to incentivize traders that swap into USDS and deploy it, said Rooter, the pseudonymous leader of borrow and lend protocol Save, which is handing out 400,000 worth of USDS a month to suppliers of the new stablecoin.  ""With Sky heavily incentivizing it's no surprise"" that USDS is growing so fast, Rooter said.  USDS lenders on Save, Drift and Kamino are chasing yields in excess of 20% because of the rewards boosts provided by Sky. The rate juicing makes USDS farming competitive with USDC, the most popular stablecoin on Solana.  It's not uncommon for new token issuers to boost their asset's initial adoption through incentive payouts. PayPal's stablecoin also benefitted from juiced initial yields. Rooter said that program spent around $10 million.  ""Onboarding a new stable has a formula now: start with liquidity, start with supply then grow borrowing,"" said Marius Ciubotariu, co-founder of Kamino, which is giving hundreds of thousands of dollars-worth of USDS a week to liquidity providers and lenders.  Sky is going a step further by incentivizing traders to move their money into Solana via Wormhole, a token bridging service. That's further boosting circulating supply.  Yield-chasing stable farmers are a fickle type, and the free money won't last forever. When incentives start to dry out the USDS converts may swap back into USDC or other stablecoins, as they did with PYUSD, said Rooter.  ""It's all about making inroads while the incentives are live, getting brand recognition or integrations,"" he said.",POSITIVE,USDC | PYUSD,BLOCKCHAIN | MKR | SOL | USDC | PYUSD,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/20/juiced-usds-yields-woo-solana-traders-to-skys-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b9fb78dcf3c5fa3789a4f8f9a6815aad4d7f57e-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chainlink intends to provide this feature by tokenizing an Electric Bill of Lading (eBoL) on the blockchain and using it to make on-chain settlements for purchased commodities. Chainlink will also provide Delivery versus Payment (DvP) and Payment versus Payment (PvP) options.

Bitcoin surged past $94,000 on Tuesday, achieving an all-time high as BlackRock launched new Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) options. The development has reignited interest in crypto markets, with analysts pointing to the ETF's success as a catalyst for further price increases.Additionally, Grayscale Investments has also revealed plans to introduce options trading on its spot Bitcoin ETFs, set to launch on Wednesday.Bitcoin Whale Activities Amid Options ETFAmid these institutional activities and the surge in BTC's value, on-chain insights platform Spot On Chain highlighted a rise in whale accumulation. For instance, a notable wallet identified as ""bc1qc"" withdrew 750 Bitcoin tokens worth $68.9 million from Binance within 24 hours. https://twitter.com/spotonchain/status/1859166720327667735When Bitcoin is withdrawn from exchanges, it indicates that holders are likely moving their assets to private wallets.The transactions included three separate inflows: 300 BTC valued at $27.98 million, 250 Bitcoin worth $23.31 million, and 200 Bitcoin totaling $18.65 million. The wallet’s total holdings now stand at 24,660 Bitcoin, equivalent to $2.3 billion. Notably, the portfolio's value increased by 0.311% on the day.Meanwhile, a group of six first-time wallets collectively withdrew 500.2 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), valued at $46.3 million, from Binance. These withdrawals occurred at an average price of $92,599 per WBTC. Notably, the funds were transferred to Aave via subsidiary wallets, marking a strategic shift in allocation.Pre-option ETF Launch EngagementThe activity seen in the past 24 hours aligns with a broader accumulation trend among whales. Two days earlier, a whale associated with a $33 million unrealized profit withdrew 75.8 WBTC worth $6.96 million from Binance. Historical data reveals this entity has acquired a total of 1,368 WBTC since July 4, at an average price of $67,598, resulting in an unrealized gain of 35.5%.This pattern suggests sustained whale engagement, with Binance serving as a key liquidity hub.

36621917,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102193,1732115220,Top Analyst Says Cardano Could Overtake Ethereum,"Leading analyst Dan Gambardello predicts Cardano (ADA) could surpass Ethereum, citing key partnerships and technical developments driving its growth. With recent price movements and fundamental developments fueling bullish investor sentiment, Cardano has gained momentum. Gambardello, a well-known Cardano analyst, believes the market is still underestimating ADA's potential, urging the community to adjust its outlook in light of recent developments.Major Cardano Partnerships Fueling Bullish ViewFirst, Gambardello pointed to potential collaborations with Bitcoin, Ripple, Stellar, and Dogecoin, which could position ADA as a key player in the crypto ecosystem. He referenced recent posts from influential figures like Jed McCaleb, founder of Stellar, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who have expressed positive sentiments about Cardano's future.Notably, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, has been proactive in fostering these relationships. He recently stated his plans to hire a dedicated team to make Cardano the dominant platform for Bitcoin DeFi. This move seeks to leverage Bitcoin's capital base while integrating ADA into decentralized finance, which could bring substantial volume to Cardano’s ecosystem. Gambardello calls this a “game-changing approach” that underscores ADA's long-term potential.Cardano to Overtake EthereumInterestingly, he argued that Cardano’s partnerships with Bitcoin and other major networks are incredibly bullish factors that could allow ADA to surpass Ethereum in the coming years.Looking at Cardano from the Technical SideOn the technical side, Gambardello highlighted ADA's attempt to break out of a symmetrical triangle pattern with a potential target of $0.90. While this short-term technical analysis shows promise, he advised caution.Gambardello acknowledged that ADA could face some consolidation soon, pointing to a possible pullback to the $0.58–$0.60 range before continuing its upward trajectory. This comes after multiple days of green candles. The analyst noted that the projected resets are necessary for sustainable growth, aligning with similar patterns observed in previous cycles.Essentially, Gambardello remains confident in ADA in the long term amid the project’s fundamentals and recent developments . In his words, ""the current macro landscape for Cardano is incredibly strong,"" and he believes patience will reward long-term investors.With the bull run entering a new phase, Gambardello believes ADA is poised to become a leading force in the market.At press time, Cardano is trading at a multi-year high of $0.8331, following a 14% surge in the last 24 hours. These gains further amplify ADA’s impressive two-week performance, showing a 134% growth.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/20/top-cardano-analyst-says-you-are-not-bullish-enough-on-ada/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-cardano-analyst-says-you-are-not-bullish-enough-on-ada,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36621251,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653987,1732114834,$13 XRP? Analyst Says It’s Closer Than You Think,"Recently, XRP has experienced a significant increase in value, reaching a three-year peak of $1.27. The token is currently trading at $1.09 on a sustained weekly increase of 80%, and many investors are contemplating whether this marks the beginning of a new bull run. Related Reading: Solana Market Cap Hits Milestone: $400 Price Target Gains Traction Nevertheless, a seasoned analyst is uncertain. She cautions that XRP has demonstrated bullish potential; however, it is probable that a correction will occur before the altcoin can make its next significant move. XRP Hits 3-Year High – What’s Next? The recent increase in the price of XRP to $1.26 has piqued the interest of traders, indicating a resurgence in market optimism. For the first time in years, the altcoin surpassed the $1 threshold, a feat that many believed was unattainable. CasiTrades advises caution in spite of this encouraging trend. She anticipates that the altcoin will experience a temporary decline before it can resume its upward trajectory. XRP is currently trading at $1.09, a decrease of approximately 3.5% from its weekend peak. This suggests that there may be a short-term cooldown. This decline may indicate that the market is anticipating a more advantageous entry point before attempting to increase the price. Anticipating The ‘Appropriate Entry Point’ CasiTrades has identified several critical price levels for potential buy-ins. She suggests that the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.98 be monitored. The 0.5 level at $0.88 could also be a good opportunity to enter the altcoin before the price heads back up if the price declines further. These retracement levels indicate that XRP is currently in a typical consolidation phase following a significant rally, providing investors with an opportunity to enter the market prior to the next significant surge. Although the correction is anticipated to be temporary, it offers a significant opportunity for those who have been hesitant to invest to do so at a more favorable price. I’m back with an important update on #XRP! Exciting times ahead, but a reminder to avoid chasing price action.

She is of the opinion that the altcoin could experience substantial gains once the market stabilizes and establishes new support levels. A firm bullish outlook is indicated by the price targets for XRP, which range from $8 to $13, provided that the market conditions are in alignment. The analyst said there’s no change in her long-term outlook. “$8-$13 target is not too far from here,” she added.

The Securities and Exchange Commission was accused of overreaching in the crypto space by 18 US states in lawsuits filed last Thursday. Despite the fact that the lawsuits have not explicitly referenced XRP, the case has the potential to facilitate the establishment of a more supportive regulatory environment for crypto assets, which would likely be advantageous to Ripple and XRP. A pullback may be imminent in the near future. However, the future of XRP appears promising for those who approach it correctly, given the firm support and heightened bullish sentiment.

36621916,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102140,1732113573,"XRP Reaches $1 Before Dogecoin and Cardano, What’s Next","With XRP soaring past $1 ahead of Cardano and Dogecoin, discussions have emerged regarding whether it could challenge Ethereum as the second-largest crypto asset. XRP stunned the crypto market over the weekend after it soared past $1, ahead of Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Before this surge, the crypto community had been entangled in a debate regarding which assets among XRP, ADA, and DOGE would first hit the $1 mark. XRP Hits $1 Before ADA and DOGE For context, both XRP and ADA had traded above $1. However, they plunged below this level due to a broader sell-off that started immediately after the 2021 bull run. While ADA and DOGE first saw a significant uptick recently, XRP hovered around the $0.57 mark for several days. Consequently, DOGE surpassed XRP in the global crypto ranking, pushing it to the eighth position. Interestingly, things changed for XRP following reports that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse met with U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump. This triggered speculations of an imminent resolution of the Ripple lawsuit. Amid the speculation, XRP rallied tremendously, spiking above $1 for the first time since 2021. Ever since, XRP has surpassed Dogecoin, cementing its position as the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency with a $62.2 billion market cap. XRP and ETH Rivalry Following XRP’s remarkable performance, there are speculations that it could be aiming to challenge Ethereum (ETH) for second place. In 2014, XRP was ranked as the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, just behind Bitcoin. It maintained this position until Ethereum launched the following year, putting both assets in a tight contest for second place. However, Ethereum gained complete control of the second position in June 2018 after former SEC Director William Hinman declared ETH a non-security. Things worsened two years later when the SEC charged Ripple with violating federal securities laws through its past XRP sales. This pushed XRP to the seventh position last year, with Dogecoin recently extending the asset’s ranking to the eighth spot. With the recent rally, XRP looks set to rechallenge Ethereum for the second position. Can XRP Reclaim Second Position from Ethereum?XRP’s potential climb to the second position in the global crypto ranking would be challenging. Currently, Ethereum is the second-biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $376.45 billion. This suggests that XRP’s market cap must grow by 505.22% to reach ETH’s $376.45 billion valuation. A growth rate of this magnitude would take XRP’s price to around $6.59 from the current level of $1.09, assuming the coin’s circulating supply remains fairly constant at 56.93 billion. While XRP’s surge to the $1 mark bolsters investors’ confidence in the asset, challenging Ethereum for the second position requires the alignment of several initiatives, ranging from institutional adoption to regulatory clarity. Interestingly, XRP received the highly anticipated clarity in July 2023 when a federal court labeled it a non-security. Furthermore, strong institutional demand for XRP is expected to follow suit should the U.S. SEC approve the launch of one or more ETFs tied to the asset. Despite this, it remains unclear whether XRP can challenge ETH for second place in the global crypto ranking. XRP’s future price actions will be instrumental in determining whether it can pose a threat to Ethereum.",POSITIVE,ADA | DOGE | ETH | XRP,ADA | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/20/xrp-reaches-1-before-dogecoin-and-cardano-whats-next/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-reaches-1-before-dogecoin-and-cardano-whats-next,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Ali Martinez, a market veteran, had previously forecasted in late October that ADA could record an impressive move. Despite receiving backlash and bearish criticism, the recent price action suggests that his predictions are unfolding as expected.On Oct. 29, Martinez analyzed a chart comparing ADA’s historical price movements to its current trajectory. His analysis suggested that Cardano might replicate its performance from 2020. Initial ADA AnalysisData from the chart shows that from 2018 to early 2020, ADA traded within a tight accumulation range. Following the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, ADA staged an impressive 75% recovery. However, after this 75% upsurge, Cardano witnessed a steep 56% correction before it resumed the uptrend. The new uptrend culminated in a meteoric 4,095% price increase, ultimately leading to the ATH above $3 by 2021. Cardano 1W Chart | Ali Martinez Martinez highlighted similarities between the 2020 accumulation phase and ADA’s price action from 2023. From mid-2022 to late 2023, ADA fluctuated within a similar horizontal range for 455 days. However, the token eventually rallied during the first phase of the bull run from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024, rising 75% to $0.81 in March 2024, exactly as it did in late 2020. This mirrored its earlier pre-bull phase, suggesting a major breakout was imminent. The chart also highlighted a downside of 65.93% from March to August 2024 which followed the 75% increase. Despite this drop, Martinez said in late October that Cardano was on the verge of repeating the massive uptrend from the previous cycle. He predicted that Cardano could record an impressive surge by Nov. 18, two weeks after the U.S. elections on Nov. 5, with a target peak around September 2025. At the time of his initial analysis, Cardano was changing hands at $0.345.Latest Cardano OutlookInterestingly, the current market trajectory already has followed Martinez’s theory. As of Nov. 20, just weeks after the U.S. elections, ADA has risen 140% from the Oct. 29 levels. Most of these gains occurred immediately after the elections, with ADA recently surging past the $0.81 resistance level. This price spike confirms the bullish momentum Martinez anticipated.In the latest analysis , he maintained his projection that Cardano’s current rally could mirror its 2020-2021 performance. If history repeats, the chart suggests a potential climb to $6.6, which would mark a 2,288% surge from recent levels. This forecast places ADA near an all-time high by September 2025. Despite his accurate predictions, Martinez faced skepticism when he initially shared his analysis. Many dismissed the potential for ADA’s recovery, instead emphasizing bearish sentiment in the market. In his recent update, he expressed frustration over the backlash, noting that he does not understand why Cardano attracts so much hatred. He urged traders to focus on actionable opportunities rather than emotional biases. At press time, Cardano trades for $0.8305.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/20/analyst-says-he-does-not-understand-the-hate-on-cardano-maintains-6-ada-target-amid-140-spike/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-he-does-not-understand-the-hate-on-cardano-maintains-6-ada-target-amid-140-spike,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The asset manager called its new version the Ethereum Core Staking ETP, providing fund holders with staking functions.With the update, holders of the Ethereum ETP—with ticker ETHC—can now stake their stash for rewards. This allows users to profit on two fronts: holding the ETP that tracks Ethereum’s performance while also reaping staking rewards.Low Expense Rate, More ProfitabilityPer the announcement , 21Shares noted that its Ethereum ETP would maintain a competitive total expense ratio (TER) while providing users with alternative means to earn more from holding the fund. Notably, the fund charges a management fee of 0.12%, one of the lowest in the ETP market.Meanwhile, the Ethereum Core Staking ETP is available for trade on major European exchanges, including the SIX Swiss Exchange, Euronet Amsterdam, Euronet Paris, Deutsche Borse Xetra, and the London Stock Exchange.0% Management Fee Reacting to the update, 21Shares’ CEO, Tom Wan, noted that the staking could mean zero management fees for investors. He emphasized that the staking yield on Ethereum is about 3.2%, and even if the issuer invests 25% of the total asset, it will still cover the management fees investors pay.Furthermore, Wan stated that 21 Shares ’ debut of staking services could improve the overall amount of Ethereum staked. The CEO noted that asset managers like VanEck and Bitwise are already big on staking, and a combined force from ETPs could add 500,000 to 1.3 million ETH to the staked Ethereum volume.Meanwhile, efforts to bring staking services to the United States have yet to yield fruit.

36619839,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102167,1732112213,Market Analyst Highlights How Long Before Dogecoin Cracks $3,"Amid the recent spectacular performance from Dogecoin, market watchers share their views on how long it will take for DOGE to break into the unit price range. In a recent post on X, Crypto Yapper, a notable technical analyst, shared his short-term price prediction for trendy crypto assets like Dogecoin. According to Yapper, Dogecoin could reach $1 and $3 as early as six months from now, which would place the timeline around May 2025.Currently, DOGE is worth $0.3894, up by 1% over the past day. Yesterday, Dogecoin attempted to break out of its week-long consolidation phase by re-entering the $0.40 range with a 12% surge. However, it quickly encountered resistance after reaching $0.4183 and was unable to push higher. It later dropped to $0.3778 amid the Bitcoin-induced volatility last night.While Dogecoin's bulls struggle to regain momentum for another massive rally like the one from two weeks ago, Yapper believes that, despite the challenges, DOGE will trade within the $1 to $3 range in the next six months. If things go poorly, it could take up to 12 months.Dogecoin Potential to Reach $3Notably, from its current floor value of $0.3894, DOGE would need a rally of 156% to break the $1 mark, which enthusiasts have been waiting for since the 2021 bull run. For context, Dogecoin took just seven days to rally by 156.11%, from $0.1702 to $0.4359, between November 5 and November 12.Meanwhile, for the projected upper boundary of $3, Dogecoin would need a more substantial price increase of 670%. Remarkably, over the past 12 months, Dogecoin has surged by 658% from its October 2023 low of $0.05747 to its recent high of $0.4359, which aligns closely with the 12-month timeline Yapper suggested for Dogecoin to achieve another 650% price growth.Notably, at $3, Dogecoin would have a market cap of $440 billion, compared to just $56 billion today. This market cap would far exceed Ethereum's current $373 billion valuation, possibly making DOGE the second-largest crypto asset if no other token surges higher.Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices When Dogecoin Hits $3However, Yapper also expects Bitcoin to reach between $220K and $260K during this period. With Bitcoin currently priced at $93,183, reaching the projected target would imply an additional 179% price growth.For the underperforming altcoin king, Ethereum , the technical analyst suggests it could rebound significantly, reaching between $12K and $16K within the next 12 months.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/20/market-analyst-highlights-how-long-before-dogecoin-cracks-3/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=market-analyst-highlights-how-long-before-dogecoin-cracks-3,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The American businessman and author took to X to reflect on a bold prediction from MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, who, in September, set a target of $13 million for Bitcoin.As reported earlier, Saylor predicted that Bitcoin would trade at $13 million over the next 21 years, specifically by 2045. Saylor expects Bitcoin to experience strong demand within this timeframe, capturing 7% of the global capital.Two months after this prediction, Kiyosaki emphasized that he agreed with it, describing Saylor as ‘one smart boy.’How to Become a Millionaire Via BTC Furthermore, he suggested that investors who acquire a fraction of Bitcoin at $90,000 can become millionaires when BTC hits $13 million in 2045, as Saylor projected. Specifically, he mentioned that Bitcoin was trading at $90,000 at the time of the post. The financial guru indicated that investors could acquire 0.1 BTC for $9,000, automatically making them millionaires if Saylor’s prediction comes to fruition.At a target of $13 million, a portfolio of 0.1 BTC would be valued at $1.3 million, representing an ROI of 144,344%. Kiyosaki Slams Conventional Approach to Building Wealth He contrasted the Bitcoin investment decision with obtaining a $50,000 student loan. He argued that the latter only rewards the borrower with a ‘flimsy MBA’ after studying for several years. Conclusively, he encouraged his 2.6 million X followers to make smart investment decisions by investing in Bitcoin. His remark portrays Bitcoin as a wealth-building tool compared to the conventional approach, which requires pursuing academic success before achieving financial stability.His Support for Bitcoin Kiyosaki has been one of the major Bitcoin advocates, promoting the asset as a hedge against economic uncertainties. Earlier this year, he revealed that his decision to invest in Bitcoin rather than stocks was to prevent the U.S. Federal Reserve and Wall Street from orchestrating mechanisms like inflation and market manipulation to siphon wealth from the public. In August, he drummed support for U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump, describing his pro-Bitcoin stance as financial wisdom. His recent comment follows Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high of $94,339. Bitcoin is priced at $94,305 at press time, marking a surge of 2.42% over the past 24 hours.

This debut comes after the ETF received regulatory approval in January and has since attracted significant inflows. Increased Liquidity And Reduced Volatility On The Horizon According to Bloomberg, the introduction of options trading on the $43 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust is anticipated to reduce volatility while broadening Bitcoin’s investor base. Related Reading: VanEck Gives Official Backing To Donald Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Strategy Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, stated during a Bloomberg Television interview that as Bitcoin becomes more widely held, its volatility is likely to decrease. “Options will help dampen volatility, and as volatility comes down, people can take larger position sizes,” he explained. Thorn noted that a decrease in volatility could shift investor sentiment, encouraging them to view Bitcoin as a viable asset for fundamental use cases rather than merely a speculative gamble. The availability of options will also enable institutions to hedge their positions more effectively, increasing liquidity and potentially impacting retail trading during bullish market conditions. Call Options Dominate BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF On Day 1 Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart reported that on the first day of options trading, the total notional exposure for IBIT reached nearly $1.9 billion, spread across 354,000 contracts. Of these contracts, 289,000 were calls, while 65,000 were puts, resulting in a bullish call to put ratio of 4.4:1. Seyffart claimed that this overwhelming interest in call options contributed to Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs of $94,000 during Tuesday’s trading session for the market’s leading crypto. Balchunas, on the other hand, pointed out that the majority of options contracts are bullish, especially the December 20 call option, which essentially bets that the Bitcoin price will double within a month. This means that based on current prices, investors are expecting BTC to hit a new record high of little over $180,000 by that date. The put/call volume ratio for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF was “impressive,” according to Balchunas, who noted that the ratio of 0.17 indicates strong bullish sentiment compared to other ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) with a ratio of 1.1. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches New High Of $94,000: Blockstream CEO Anticipates $1 Million Ahead Market expert Marty Party highlighted in a social media post that options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust will settle in actual Bitcoin. This means that when an option contract is exercised, settlement will involve the delivery of Bitcoin, giving investors direct exposure to BTC price movements without the need to interact with crypto exchanges. At the time of writing, the market’s leading digital asset is trading at $91,580, up 4% in the weekly time frame after today’s bullish move to its new high.

Với vốn hóa thị trường cán mốc 1,8 nghìn tỷ USD, BTC giờ đây đã vượt mặt bạc và trở thành tài sản lớn thứ tám trên thế giới. Chúc mừng Bitcoin! Chỉ trong vòng 9 ngày, giá Bitcoin đã tăng vọt 39,5% , đánh dấu cú tăng trưởng thần tốc nhất kể từ tháng 1 năm 2021. Đây cũng có thể là một trong những lần dòng vốn ngắn hạn lớn nhất đổ vào bất kỳ loại tài sản nào trong lịch sử. Phải chăng Bitcoin đang dần trở thành tài sản quốc dân? Các quỹ ETF Bitcoin giao ngay tại Mỹ cũng đang ăn nên làm ra với 84 tỷ USD tài sản được quản lý, tương đương 66% tổng tài sản của các quỹ ETF vàng. Dòng vốn từ các tổ chức đang đổ vào khiến ETF Bitcoin lên ngôi nhanh chóng. Liệu đây có phải là dấu hiệu cho thấy Bitcoin sẽ tiếp tục “bay cao” trong tương lai? Bên cạnh những tin tức tích cực, thị trường cũng chứng kiến sự hạ nhiệt nhẹ từ các nhà đầu tư với khoảng 640 triệu USD dòng vốn ròng chảy ra trong hai ngày giao dịch cuối tuần. Tuy nhiên, với đà tăng trưởng hiện tại, Bitcoin vẫn được kỳ vọng sẽ tiếp tục “làm mưa làm gió” trên thị trường tài chính. Nền kinh tế Mỹ vẫn cho thấy sự kiên cường, nhưng cũng đối mặt với những thách thức mới, đặc biệt là lạm phát. Tháng 10 vừa qua, lạm phát đã tăng do chi phí nhà ở và giá xe cũ tăng cao. Thị trường lao động vẫn duy trì sự ổn định với tỷ lệ sa thải thấp và tiền lương tăng, thúc đẩy chi tiêu tiêu dùng. Tuy nhiên, các chính sách tài khóa mới có thể làm tăng áp lực lạm phát, khiến Fed đau đầu trong việc điều chỉnh lãi suất. Trong khi đó, Chủ tịch SEC Gary Gensler có thể sẽ “chia tay” với vị trí hiện tại. Robinhood chơi lớn khi bổ sung Solana, Cardano, Ripple và Pepe vào danh sách tài sản tiền điện tử giao dịch được. Đề xuất về dự trữ Bitcoin quốc gia của Mỹ cũng đang nhận được sự quan tâm lớn từ cộng đồng. Tất cả những điều này cho thấy sự phát triển không ngừng của thị trường tiền điện tử và khả năng thích ứng nhanh chóng với nhu cầu của thị trường. Và đó là bản tin tóm tắt từ Bitfinex Alpha 131.

42435295,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kosKw,1732108076,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hits New Highs as ETF Options Traders Go Degen,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,981.79 +0.61%  Bitcoin (BTC): $93,634.61 +2.04%  Ether (ETH): $3,090.71 -1.65%  S&P 500: 5,916.98 +0.40%  Gold: $2,628.53 -0.15%  Nikkei 225: 38,352.34 -0.16%  Top Stories  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is eyeing record highs once again heading into Wednesday's U.S. session. The largest crypto is trading just below $94,000, the new record from Tuesday, and leading the broader market with a 2% climb over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index was little changed and large-cap altcoins ether {{ETH}} and solana {{SOL}} fell. Options on BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw staggering first-day trading activity yesterday, pushing the BTC price higher, analysts noted. Most of the activity focused on calls, representing a bullish view, with some traders betting on a doubling of IBIT's share price. ""It’s pretty interesting to see 'professionals' degen into $100 strikes (this effectively means a doubling of BTC prices given IBIT trades near $50),"" crypto quant researcher Samneet Chepal noted. Options on other BTC ETFs will follow in the coming days, fueling more activity. It's not only bitcoin where the crypto action is concentrated, though. Trading volumes for popular altcoins dogecoin {{DOGE}} and XRP {{XRP}} surpassed BTC's on South Korean crypto exchanges Upbit and Bithumb.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) broke into the top 100 U.S. publicly traded companies by market capitalization as its share price closed Tuesday's session at a record $430, far above its dotcom bubble highs. The firm owns the largest corporate bitcoin treasury in the world and its shares have rallied 528% this year, outperforming bitcoin and chipmaker giant Nvidia (NVDA). The developments keep coming for the firm, CoinDesk analyst James Van Straten noted. On Monday, it announced a $1.75 billion 5-year convertible senior note issuance at a 0% coupon. ""We are waiting on further developments if this convertible note has been oversubscribed, which would increase its issuance by $250 million, for a total of $2 billion,"" Van Straten said.  Robinhood (HOOD) is poised to benefit the most from crypto deregulation in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump, broker Bernstein said in a report. The trading app can drive higher revenues by listing new tokens and introducing new crypto product lines to target the wider opportunity, the report said. Robinhood's acquisition of EU-based exchange Bitstamp and its European platform should ""further boost value added crypto services,"" the authors wrote. Bernstein raised the price target for Robinhood shares to $51 from $30, which would translate to a 45% appreciation from Tuesday's closing price.  Chart of the Day  This might be the most important chart in financial markets. The yield on the U.S. 10-year note, the so-called risk-free rate, is at a make-or-break level.  It could break out above the downtrend line or turn lower, forming a head-and-shoulder top. The latter will likely bode well for risk assets, unless accompanied by a black swan.

42435275,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kos3m,1732104090,"Bitcoin ETF Options Introduction Marks Milestone, Despite Position Limits","IBIT options surpassed $2 billion in notional exposure.  The launch of options on bitcoin ETFs had the approval of just 25,000 contracts as a position limit.  According to Bitwise's head of alpha strategies, Jeff Park, by industry standards, bitcoin ETF options should have seen around 400,000 contracts.  Another Bitcoin-linked product, another success story. This time, it's options tied to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which went live on Nasdaq Tuesday giving them a one-day head start over some competitors, which begin trading later Wednesday.  IBIT, which has a market cap of $44 billion, saw over $2 billion in options trading in notional value. The ETF itself traded over $4 billion in volume, surpassed only by SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) and iShares Russell 2000ETF (IWM), which all have much higher market caps, according to Coinglass data.  Senior Bloomberg ETF analystEric Balchunas hailed the success of the day-one performance of the IBIT options. However, it hasn't challenged the top ETFs yet, but he expects that to come in the next few days or weeks.  “$1.9b is unheard of for day one. For context, BITO did $363m, and that's been around for four years. And also this is with 25,000 contract position limits. That said, $1.9b isn't quite a big dog level yet, though,GLD did $5b today, but give it a few more days/weeks”, Balchunas says.  The interesting part of Balchunas's statement is that the position limit size in IBIT and other bitcoin ETF options is tighter than those in traditional finance They have been approved for just 25,000 contracts, meaning that a market participant can only hold or control a maximum of 25,000 contracts at a given point of time.  Jeff Park, the head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, went into length about the unfair treatment that the ETFs received.  Park explained on X that the exercisable risk, representing the total value of option contracts exercised or converted to actual shares, equates to less than 0.5% of IBIT’s outstanding shares. Meanwhile, the industry standard is closer to 7%, which would represent a comparative figure of 7%. To show how small the 0.5% figure is, bitcoin CME futures contracts are allowed to trade 2,000 contracts, which is the equivalent of 175,000 for IBIT.  Park went on to say that he believes the CME Group prefers to trade bitcoin primarily as a futures asset rather than in options. The regulators at the CFTC and the SEC put this cap in place to prevent market manipulation.  “It’s clear to me that CME Group would prefer Bitcoin to trade primarily as futures, positioning itself as the dominant market with launches like ""BFFs [Bitcoin Friday futures]."" If the CFTC had been as politicized as the SEC, we might not have had a fair launch at all”, Park says.  Even with the shackles on bitcoin-linked products, BTC managed to break to new all-time highs above $94,000 yesterday.  In addition, Glassnode data shows that options open interest, which is the dollar value of the number of active contracts, surpassed $40 billion for the first time. Options are a much smaller product than futures, however, with futures open interest, at $60 billion it has some catching up to do. But with the launch of these options products, that could happen soon.  To add to the explosive news of the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, Farside data shows that they saw a net inflow of $816.4 million.

36614793,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653940,1732104019,Aptos Following SUI’s Lead? Analyst Says APT’s ‘Explosive Breakout’ Targets $20,"Aptos (APT) recorded a 37.6% surge in the last two weeks, reclaiming its Q1 levels. According to some market watchers, the cryptocurrency’s recent performance follows SUI’s lead, which has set the stage for a massive rally toward a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Parabolic Phase Just Begun’, Is BTC Hitting $100,000 This Week? Aptos To Follow SUI Steps Aptos has recorded a remarkable performance amid the market’s rally. Following the US presidential elections, the cryptocurrency has climbed from the $7.8 mark to reclaim the $11 support zone for the first time since late April. According to some crypto analysts, APT’s chart displays a similar trajectory to SUI’s. Analyst Alex Clay pointed out APT’s performance is “following SUI steps perfectly,” suggesting that a breakout might be coming soon. Per Clay’s post, Aptos’s chart displays the same price action as SUI, starting with a decline from its 2023 highs followed by a rise toward March’s highs. After Q1’s performance, the cryptocurrencies retraced over 70%, making a higher low (HL) from last year’s bottom and rising near March highs. However, SUI took the lead and is currently in its “price discovery mode” after surpassing its March ATH a month ago. In the last month, the token surpassed its previous high several times, setting its latest ATH of $3.92 two days ago. Based on this, the analyst suggests that investors should “wait for APT to breakout and price discovery.” Another market watcher previously noted that SUI and APT were moving in a “catch-up trade” path for the last year. The trader explained that the cryptocurrencies followed a similar path before SUI “decoupled” twice. Following SUI’s takeoff, APT experienced an over 40-day lagging period before resuming its run. At the time of the report, Aptos was two weeks away from catching up on SUI, which now coincided with the post-election run. An SUI-like breakout could see APT surpass the $18 mark and soar toward a price discovery zone above the $20 range. APT Eyes $20 Target Crypto analyst Quinten highlighted APT’s recent performance, asserting that it is “reclaiming its dominance, printing consistent higher highs and higher lows.” He also noted that the token’s chart shows “strong accumulation leading up to this explosive breakout.” Last week, the token soared over 40% toward its monthly high of $13.3, a level not seen in seven months. Since then, the cryptocurrency has moved sideways, consolidating between the $11.5-$12.6 price range, briefly losing the lower range when Bitcoin (BTC) retraced toward $87,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns of Potential Bitcoin Market Shift as Exchange Reserves Decline The $11 mark was a significant resistance throughout Q3, with APT being rejected from this range several times. However, the token has successfully held above this level for seven days. As a result, the analyst believes the current momentum could send Aptos to a new ATH, as the “next big psychological and technical target” is at the $20 mark. At the time of writing, APT is trading at $11.79, a 2.2% decline in the daily timeframe.

36619836,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102164,1732103651,Bitcoin Hits $94K All-Time High as Key Metrics Signal Possible Market Top,"Amid a new peak value for Bitcoin, CryptoQuant cites metrics like the Fear & Greed Index, money flow, and UTXO profits to suggest a potential market peak. Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto, recently hit a new all-time high, trading over $94,000 before slightly easing to $92,000. The bullish momentum persisted, pushing prices up another 1.5% in the latest session to surpass $93,000. With this surge, on-chain analytics provider CryptoQuant has raised questions about whether it is time to sell or hold. Analysts at CryptoQuant have closely monitored several key metrics to better understand the potential direction of the market.Fear & Greed Index Signals CautionOne of the key indicators under review is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which is widely used to gauge market sentiment. The index, currently above 80, reflects heightened greed among investors. Historically, such levels have often preceded market tops, suggesting the need for caution. While the market can sustain upward momentum during periods of extreme greed, the likelihood of a reversal increases as the index remains elevated. New Money Flow & Long-term Holding BehaviourAnother critical factor affecting Bitcoin’s price sustainability is the flow of new capital into the market. CryptoQuant pointed out that insufficient new money inflow could increase selling pressure. Realized Cap Growth over a 365-day period is being monitored as a tool to track this trend. Without sufficient inflows, sustaining the current rally could prove challenging, potentially marking a near-term peak.Further, long-term holders’ behavior is another crucial metric drawing attention. CryptoQuant observed that market tops often coincide with the activation of dormant Bitcoin . Coin Days Destroyed, a measure of long-held Bitcoin being moved, has reached levels exceeding 15–20 million, which historically aligns with market tops.Bitcoin Exchange Flows & UTXOsAdditionally, exchange flow data provides further insights. The Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) tracks Bitcoin movement between spot and derivative exchanges. Recent data indicates bearish signals as Bitcoin flows shift toward derivative platforms, often a precursor to downward price adjustments. Previously, CryptoQuant’s CEO pointed out the heightened euphoria driving the current rally. With 99.3% of Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) in profit, the market is in an extremely bullish phase. While such phases have historically lasted three to twelve months, analysts are urging caution due to the possibility of sudden reversals.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/20/bitcoin-hits-94k-all-time-high-as-key-metrics-signal-possible-market-top/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-hits-94k-all-time-high-as-key-metrics-signal-possible-market-top,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36614314,https://blog.kraken.com/?p=26701,1732103205,Kraken adds 15 new margin collateral currencies,"We’re committed to providing traders with greater flexibility and control, and are excited to announce a significant expansion of our margin collateral options on Kraken Pro. With this update, the number of collateral currencies you can use for margin trading increases from 23 to 38, offering a broader range of assets to integrate into your trading strategies. Start Margin Trading on Kraken Pro What is a collateral currency? A collateral currency can be fiat, crypto or stablecoin you can use for trading on margin. Unlike standard spot trading, margin trading allows you to open long or short positions by borrowing funds directly from Kraken. When you trade on margin, Kraken’s margin pool is used for the purchase or sale of the cryptocurrency, while your collateral secures the extensions of margin. The collateral currency you use does not need to match the trading pair of the order book you’re trading on, allowing for greater flexibility to go long or short in any margin enabled trading pair . Note: Both unstaked and Kraken Rewards assets can be used as margin collateral. However, assets held in Kraken Pro on-chain staking are ineligible to use as margin collateral. Maximizing the benefits of margin trading Expanding the range of collateral currencies empowers traders in several ways: Diversification of collateral : By using multiple collateral currencies, you can better manage risk and reduce exposure to volatility in any single asset. This is particularly valuable for traders seeking to safeguard their positions in unpredictable markets. Improved liquidity : With more assets eligible as collateral, you can free up funds for other trading opportunities while maintaining robust positions on margin. This ensures your portfolio remains active and responsive to market changes. Strategic flexibility : The ability to combine assets with different haircuts enables fine-tuned margin strategies tailored to your risk tolerance and market outlook. Whether you prefer conservative or aggressive trading, expanded collateral options provide the adaptability you need. Hedging and short selling opportunities : With access to margin trading and a diverse range of collateral currencies, traders can hedge their existing positions or take advantage of downward market movements through short selling. This opens up opportunities for profit regardless of market direction. Leverage and capital efficiency : Margin trading lets you amplify your buying power, allowing you to take larger positions than your available capital. This capital efficiency is further enhanced by the ability to use a broader range of collateral currencies, enabling you to maximize potential returns while optimizing resource allocation. Tax advantages : In some jurisdictions, using digital assets as collateral rather than selling them outright can defer taxable events. By leveraging collateral currencies for margin trading, traders can potentially reduce immediate tax liabilities while maintaining exposure to their holdings. New collateral currency choices Here’s the list of the 15 new assets being added to Kraken’s margin collateral lineup, bringing the total to 38 options. Asset Haircut AAVE 20% DOGE 20% FTM 30% NEAR 30% PAXG 5% PEPE 30% RENDER 30% RUNE 30% SHIB 30% STX 30% SUI 30% TAO 30% WIF 30% XLM 10% XRP 10% In addition to the above, we have also reduced the haircut size for AVAX, XTZ & TRX from 50% to 30% Understanding haircuts When using a currency as collateral, Kraken applies a “haircut” to determine its effective value. This haircut reflects the percentage reduction applied to the asset’s value to account for potential price volatility. For instance, if you hold $1,000 worth of an asset with a 20% haircut, its collateral value is calculated at $800. This approach ensures greater stability and reduces the risk associated with using volatile assets as margin collateral. What to keep in mind It’s important to note that collateral assets used to open margin positions cannot be exchanged for other currencies or withdrawn while the position is open. These assets remain reserved as collateral and are visible in your account balance, but they are restricted from trading or withdrawals. You can check the availability of your collateral assets at any time through the Funding tab in your Kraken account. Start Margin Trading on Kraken Pro Availability of margin trading services is subject to certain limitations and eligibility criteria . Trading using margin involves an element of risk and may not be suitable for everyone. Read Kraken’s Margin Disclosure Statement to learn more. Trade with caution. There is no guarantee that a limit order will execute. There is no guarantee of margin pool availability at all times. There is also no guarantee of a market order executing at a certain price.

VanEck, a major asset management firm, has openly backed the idea, calling for Bitcoin to be integrated into state and national reserve strategies. VanEck’s support highlights growing institutional interest in Bitcoin’s potential as a modern reserve asset. Michael Saylor and prominent politicians like Senator Cynthia Lummis have also voiced support for Bitcoin reserves. Lummis recently proposed selling parts of the U.S. gold reserves to purchase Bitcoin, arguing that diversifying with digital assets could enhance the nation’s financial strength. States like Florida and Pennsylvania are already exploring state-level Bitcoin reserves, indicating decentralized support for the movement. Globally, the trend is catching on. Poland’s libertarian leader, Sławomir Mentzen, has pledged to pursue a Bitcoin reserve strategy if elected, reflecting Bitcoin’s appeal as a tool to combat inflation and strengthen fiscal independence. Despite growing enthusiasm, not everyone is convinced. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has taken a cautious stance, refraining from endorsing a Bitcoin reserve. Instead, it focuses on tokenization, a broader application of blockchain technology. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has seen significant growth, but the firm remains skeptical about Bitcoin’s role as a government reserve asset. Critics also argue that Bitcoin’s volatility and divisive nature make it unsuitable for national reserves. Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz expressed doubts, stating that political hurdles and Bitcoin’s fluctuating value could prevent its adoption as a reserve asset. The U.S. election results have added optimism for Bitcoin’s future. President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and pro-crypto politicians gained seats in Congress. This political support, combined with a favorable regulatory environment, could accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption in financial strategies. As debates continue, the campaign for Bitcoin reserves has sparked global interest. The question remains whether Bitcoin will emerge as the digital age’s gold standard or face resistance from traditional financial systems and cautious policymakers.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/vaneck-backs-bitcoin-reserves-amid-growing-debate,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png

Saylor revealed that he has been granted just three minutes to make his case, during which he will outline how adding Bitcoin to Microsoft's portfolio could make the company’s stock more stable and less risky. Set a reminder for this post-US election bombshell discussion with @SenLummis , @saylor , @matthew_sigel @JanvanEck3 as they dive into lessons from El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment for the US, next steps for Senator Cynthia Lummis' BITCOIN Act (the strategic BTC reserve) and… — VanEck (@vaneck_us) November 8, 2024 This proposal was initiated by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), which praised MicroStrategy's Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategy. The organization highlighted that MicroStrategy’s stock has outperformed Microsoft significantly this year, despite being a smaller business. Saylor shared that he previously offered to discuss the matter privately with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, but his proposal for a confidential meeting was declined. Nevertheless, he plans to submit the pitch directly to Microsoft’s board. Saylor argues that companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google, with substantial cash reserves, are missing opportunities by not investing in Bitcoin. According to him, these companies are reducing shareholder value by failing to diversify their assets. He believes that allocating a portion of their enterprise value to tangible assets, such as Bitcoin, could enhance the stability and long-term value of their stocks. Microsoft's board, which includes high-ranking executives from firms like Disney, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, has recommended voting against the proposal. They assert that they already evaluate a broad range of investment options, including Bitcoin. However, the vote on this shareholder initiative will take place on December 10, and it could force Microsoft to publicly justify any decision against Bitcoin investment. Saylor insists that Bitcoin can make Microsoft’s stock less risky by anchoring some of its value in tangible assets. He estimates that 98.5% of Microsoft’s valuation is tied to quarterly earnings, leaving only 1.5% linked to physical assets. Incorporating Bitcoin, he claims, would provide a stronger foundation and improve shareholder confidence. While Microsoft's leadership has expressed skepticism, the proposal is sparking a broader conversation about how major corporations manage their cash reserves. If successful, Saylor's pitch could inspire other large companies to consider Bitcoin as a viable investment option, potentially reshaping corporate finance strategies.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | RESEARCH,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/saylor-urges-microsoft-to-invest-in-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36612144.jpeg

While the financial details remain unclear, the potential acquisition aligns with Trump's broader crypto strategy, which includes building a bitcoin reserve and proposing regulatory changes for the industry.

If confirmed, Lutnick will oversee a broad department responsible for managing trade, economic data, technology funding, and even weather monitoring. His close connections to top business leaders make him a strategic choice for this role. Lutnick, a co-chair of Trump’s transition team, has been part of Trump’s inner circle and once appeared on The Apprentice . This nomination underscores Trump’s preference for appointing business leaders to key government roles. Lutnick was Elon Musk’s preferred pick for Treasury Secretary.

While Lutnick didn’t secure that position, his nomination as Commerce Secretary places him in another pivotal role within the administration. He strongly supports Trump’s tariff plans, which propose significant taxes on imports, including a 60% tariff on Chinese goods. Lutnick has described tariffs as a vital tool to protect American workers and create leverage in trade negotiations. Critics, including many economists, argue that tariffs could harm the economy, but Lutnick aligns closely with Trump’s vision on trade policy. Lutnick’s personal history includes a tragic loss during the September 11 attacks. He lost his brother and 658 of his employees at Cantor Fitzgerald when the World Trade Center was struck. Despite this unimaginable tragedy, he rebuilt the company, earning recognition for his resilience. Trump highlighted Lutnick’s ability to overcome adversity, calling him “the embodiment of resilience.” A major advocate for cryptocurrency, Lutnick has championed digital currencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ), comparing them to gold and advocating for global free trade of cryptocurrencies. He has also supported broader adoption of crypto technologies, reflecting Trump’s positive stance on digital currencies.

The company’s energy strategy, converting flared gas to electricity, significantly reduces power costs to 1 cent per kWh, aiming for over 1 GW capacity of low-cost energy. Recent acquisitions and facility upgrades are expected to increase computing power by 70% by late 2025, with potential operational cost reductions using its 2PIC tanks. Falling Bitcoin prices, ongoing share issuance, and negative sentiment toward non-mining expansions are some big risks to consider. Following the 30% decline in the share price, MARA's low valuation ratios and strong growth prospects make this stock a speculative strong buy. MARA Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) has seen its share price decline by over 30% following the release of Q3 earnings. Seeking Alpha With the company planning to release more details on potential partnerships with hyperscalers in the upcoming quarters, I considered reviewing in this article some of the arguments made by the CEO, Fred Thiel, against expanding into AI/HPC hosting independently , opting instead to pursue partnerships with big data center and cloud computing players. I will advance in this introduction that I fully agree with his arguments, including the challenge of competing in price with hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud once they have fully deployed their infrastructure over the next two years. I will also discuss the company's expansion plans, including its technology advancements and energy strategy. Overall, considering these factors and the company's attractive valuation ratios, I rate this stock as a strong buy. As a matter of fact, I have started a long position in this company, taking advantage of the pullback following Q3 earnings. As always, I will include a risk section where I will discuss some factors that could potentially wipe out my investment (i.e. highly speculative bet) in this company. CEO Skeptical About Entering AI/HPC Hosting Independently Fred Thiel emphasized during the last earnings call that the AI/HPC hosting market will soon face a ""race to the bottom"" in terms of costs and profits, as hyperscalers dominate. I think anybody else trying to go into this business today is looking at a race to the bottom from a cost perspective and a very challenging capital market, once people wake up to the fact of how difficult it really is to run an AI HPC hosting business when you're not a hyperscaler yourself. One of the key points he mentioned was the decline in GPU rentals. He used the H100 rental prices as an example. The rental prices for this high-end GPU model from NVIDIA (widely used for AI workloads) have plummeted by 75% in six months. He also mentioned another reason for his apparent hesitation about getting into AI/HPC hosting independently: the rapid obsolescence of GPU hosting for AI tasks. If you think that the technology obsolescence of Bitcoin mining is aggressive, welcome to the world of GPUs. It is even more aggressive. Anybody who comes from the Bitcoin mining side , who is excited about going into the hyperscaler or large-scale data center for AI HPC hosting business is in for what I believe will be an abrupt surprise come two or three years when the hyperscalers deployments of the data centers they have in production today start coming online Instead, I believe Mara will focus on partnerships with large-scale AI hyperscalers. As the old saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them. These partnerships with hyperscalers would allow MARA to leverage its technology, such as 2PIC immersion cooling, and its expertise in low-cost energy generation to support the needs of hyperscalers. Although no specific details have been announced about these partnerships, the company plans to announce more specific details in the upcoming quarters. In my opinion, an official announcement of a partnership with a major hyperscaler could be a big catalyst for the company, especially if the share price keeps its current declining path until this event happens. Energy Strategy And 2PIC Technological Advancements In October, MARA launched a 25 MW microdata center operation with NGON across wellheads in Texas and North Dakota. These data centers convert excess flared gas, (i.e. a waste by-product in oilfield operations) into electricity to power co-located data centers. The benefit of using excess flared gas to generate electricity is a significant reduction in cost per kWh, from the typical market price paid by miners using grid energy of 4c/kWh, down to 1c/kWh. Aside from cost benefits, this method is highly beneficial for the environment, with a 99% methane mitigation efficiency This initiative is part of Mara's broader strategy to identify and develop sites with high potential for on-site power generation. Additionally, in the last shareholder letter , the company mentioned its long-term goal of expanding its gas-to-power capacity to more than a gigawatt in the next few years. We believe MARA's ability to pair onsite demand to onsite power (fueled by low-cost natural gas) will unlock hundreds of MW-if not more than a GW-of low-cost and long-duration gas-to-power opportunities. Moving on with other initiatives, by the end of this year, Mara will have installed 40 2PIC tanks across its facilities, including the new one in Ohio. What I find encouraging about this technology is the high-power density of 1MW that can be achieved per each 2PIC tank. As a matter of fact, 2PIC tanks can achieve up to four times the power density compared to traditional cooling methods. As a side note, the 2PIC technology offers superior thermal management by submerging equipment in a dielectric fluid. This results in up to a 60% reduction in cooling energy costs. Additionally, in the past quarter, Mara has secured its first commercial orders for its 2PIC tanks from third-party miners and data center operators. In my view, this is a strong indication of the benefits of this proprietary technology. Expect a 70% Increase in Computation Capacity By the End of 2025 Since the beginning of 2024, Mara has secured about 1 GW of nameplate capacity through acquisitions and new developments. The company's operational footprint now spans over 15 data centers across four continents, with plans to expand further in the Middle East and Africa. As a matter of fact, the company's total owned and operated computing capacity is expected to increase by over 70%​ by the end of next year. This includes two recent acquisitions in Ohio, along with the development of a 150 MW greenfield operation that will provide 372 MW of capacity by the end of 2025. Salman Khan, the CFO of the company, mentioned during the last earnings conference a significant reduction in operating costs for one of the newly acquired centers. Owning the sites will provide us with greater operational control and could further reduce our operating costs at Hopedale data center, which is part of this acquisition, up to 50%. I believe they will mass deploy the 2PIC tanks at this facility to achieve this cost savings. Aside from these acquisitions, the company has upgraded and expanded the capacity of five of its existing facilities: Ellendale and Jamestown, Garden City, the Wolf Hollow facility in Texas, and the Kearney facility in Nebraska. Overall, the company expects to achieve a fleet efficiency of 19.5 J/TH by the end of 2024. To put things in perspective, this is a 14% improvement from last quarter's efficiency of 22.7 J/TH. Valuation Considering the 30% decline in the share price following the Q3 earnings release, most valuation ratios have cooled off to attractive levels when compared to some of its direct competitors. An example is the price to sales ratio, which trades now below RIOT's value (see table below). Seeking Alpha Another example is the EV/EBITDA ratio (both FWD and TTM), with Mara's value being the lowest among its competitors. The historical chart below shows that most of the company's valuation ratios are trading close to the 5-year minimum. Stock Rover Therefore, I believe there is solid evidence to suggest that Mara is undervalued at best, or fairly priced at worst. Risks I believe one of the biggest risks to my bull thesis, is the current negative sentiment surrounding the expansion into AI/HPC hosting. As I already mentioned, I don't believe Mara will go into AI/HPC hosting independently. It all points out that the company will partner with hyperscalers. However, considering that most of the shareholders support the company's Bitcoin mining operations, any news related to the expansion of their operations away from mining could drive a potential selloff. Other risks include the high volatility of Bitcoin prices. At the end of last quarter, the company had over 27,000 BTC on its balance sheet. Therefore, a pullback in Bitcoin's price could erode the value of the company's assets. Finally, I am not particularly encouraged by the recent dilution of shareholder value. In the past year, the company has raised a significant amount of capital ($1.5 billion TTM) by issuing shares. TradingView The recent $850 million offering of zero-coupon convertible senior notes (due 2030) allows noteholders to convert their holdings into MARA's common stock under certain conditions. I have included here more details about this offering, although I believe this offering increases the risk of further dilution in the long term. Conclusion I rate this stock as a strong buy for highly speculative investors, like myself. As we all know, Mara is the largest publicly traded miner in terms of market capitalization and hash rate. Therefore, I am highly encouraged by the company's decision to avoid jumping into the AI/HPC hosting business independently (emphasis on this last word), given the high obsolescence risks and low margins in this space once the hyperscalers fully deploy its infrastructure in the next 2 years. Instead, Mara plans to partner with these hyperscalers (think of AWS, Microsoft, or Google), leveraging its advanced 2PIC cooling tanks and cheap energy solutions to support their infrastructure expansion. Speaking about the company's energy strategy, its gas-to-power projects could cut power costs to just 1 cent per kWh. The company is scaling these projects, with a goal of exceeding 1 GW of low-cost energy capacity in the next years. From an operational perspective, the recent acquisitions, combined with upgrades to existing facilities, are expected to increase the company's computing power by 70% by the end of 2025. Even more encouraging is the potential for some of these facilities to cut in half their operating costs thanks to the company's 2PIC tanks. Risks to my bull thesis include the negative shareholder sentiment to expand into AI/HPC hosting through partnerships with hyperscalers. I think an official partnership announcement could upset investors focused solely on its mining operations. On top of that, I believe that the current dilution could continue into 2025, which could weigh on the share price. However, I believe the company's low valuation ratios compared to its peers, combined with its growth rate and technological advantages, make it a strong buy. Nonetheless, this is a speculative play, which could take several years to potentially yield positive results.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4738926-mara-holdings-if-you-cant-beat-hyperscalers-partner-with-them?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36611735.jpeg

36611656,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653918,1732098645,Bitcoin Is About To See A Historically-Profitable Crossover In This Metric,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Puell Multiple is about to undergo a crossover that has historically been very bullish for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Puell Multiple Could Cross Its 365-Day MA In Near Future As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has been approaching its 365-day moving average (MA) recently. The “Puell Multiple” here refers to a popular on-chain indicator that tells us about how the revenue of the Bitcoin miners compares against its yearly average. BTC miners earn their income through two sources, the transaction fees and the block subsidy, but in the context of the Puell Multiple, only the latter is relevant. Block subsidy is the reward miners receive as compensation for adding blocks to the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hashrate Falls Off, Miners Expecting Pause In Bull Run? When the indicator’s value is greater than 1, it means the miners are currently making a higher revenue than the average for the past year. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the miners are earning less than usual. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Puell Multiple, as well as its 365-day MA, over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Puell Multiple had plunged under the 1 mark earlier in the year, but recently, its value has seen a sharp rise back towards the mark. The reason behind the earlier plummet was the occurrence of the fourth BTC Halving. “Halvings” are events coded into the blockchain that automatically shave off the asset’s block subsidy in half every four years. As the Puell Multiple keeps track of the block subsidy, it naturally makes sense that the Halving would drastically affect the ratio’s value. Outside of the Halvings, the block subsidy remains constant in BTC value and is more or less given out at a constant rate. However, the ratio’s value can still change at times other than Halvings because it measures the USD value of the miner revenue. The rewards that miners get are in BTC and so, their value is also tied to the USD rate of the asset. With the cryptocurrency observing a sharp rally recently, the miner revenue seems to be back to the same as the 365-day MA. The 1 mark isn’t the only important level the Puell Multiple has risen to; it is now near its 365-day MA. In the chart, the quant highlighted what happened the last three times the metric broke above this line. It would appear that the asset went on to rally at least 76% each time. Related Reading: Is $135,000 Bitcoin’s Current Ceiling? This Model Says So It remains to be seen whether the Puell Multiple could break above this line, potentially giving a bullish signal for Bitcoin, or if the retest would fail. BTC Price Bitcoin has recently witnessed a cooldown in bullish momentum as its price has fallen to a sideways movement. At present, BTC is trading at around $91,900.

Ethereum has been facing a challenging market environment, with its price struggling to stay at par with the broader bullish trend. Despite significant movements in other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has yet to show signs of a robust recovery, sparking investor concerns. However, analysts are closely watching whether ETH can break through key price levels, including the $4,000 mark. In a post on X, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that Ethereum could soon outperform Bitcoin (BTC). According to Martinez, Ethereum has historically experienced periods of dominance over Bitcoin during market cycles, but this phenomenon has yet to occur in the current cycle. Martinez points to Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Momentum as a key indicator, suggesting a bullish phase might be imminent.MVRV Momentum and Price IndicatorsEthereum’s MVRV momentum is reportedly nearing a critical threshold. Historically, when this metric crosses its 180-day moving average, it signals a period of substantial price appreciation. Recent data shows Ethereum’s price improving from $2,400 to $2,800, but the anticipated MVRV cross has yet to occur.According to Martinez, this delay could indicate that the most significant gains are still to come.Whale Activity and Institutional InvestmentsIn addition to technical indicators, significant on-chain activity indicates growing investor confidence in Ethereum. Martinez highlights a notable shift in Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have transitioned from distribution to accumulation. Specifically, over the past two weeks, over $147 million in ETH has been acquired through these funds. This confirms heightened institutional interest.At the same time, investors have significantly boosted their Ethereum holdings, purchasing more than $1.4 billion in ETH during this period. This trend aligns with expectations of a price rally, as whales often accumulate assets during undervaluation phases.https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1857130376889598200These large-scale acquisitions are considered a positive signal for Ethereum’s near-term prospects. Per Martinez, Ethereum's current formation of an ascending parallel channel indicates potential price tests at $4,000 and $6,000 levels.Critical Support for EthereumEthereum’s price trajectory also hinges on critical support levels, which analysts believe must hold to maintain a bullish outlook. Martinez identifies $3,000 and $2,400 as pivotal zones where significant buying activity has occurred. Specifically, over 6.14 million ETH were acquired at these price points.Broader Market Correlations with Likely $10K TargetBeyond crypto-specific factors, Ethereum’s performance is drawing comparisons to traditional markets. Martinez earlier noted Ethereum’s price movements closely resemble the S&P 500 index. This parallel trend suggests that Ethereum may eventually follow the S&P 500’s bullish breakout, potentially targeting levels as high as $10,000.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/20/expert-says-ethereum-is-set-to-outperform-bitcoin-as-it-targets-10k-citing-technical-details-that-support-bullish-view/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-ethereum-is-set-to-outperform-bitcoin-as-it-targets-10k-citing-technical-details-that-support-bullish-view,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This marks a significant rise in optimism around the world’s largest cryptocurrency, driven by several factors influencing its recent rally. Bitcoin’s price has been on an upward trend, supported by growing interest from institutional investors and increasing speculation about regulatory clarity in key markets. Analysts point to improving macroeconomic conditions, particularly cooling inflation and lower interest rate expectations, as key drivers behind this renewed confidence. Additionally, the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) in the United States is fueling excitement. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock , have submitted applications for such ETFs, which many believe could unlock substantial investment from traditional markets. If these products are greenlit, it could open the doors for new capital inflows, potentially propelling Bitcoin toward the six-figure mark. The crypto market has also benefitted from rising trust among investors following positive developments in blockchain adoption and financial technology. Despite lingering concerns about regulatory uncertainties, sentiment among traders remains bullish. Some experts caution, however, that unforeseen events—such as government crackdowns or major hacking incidents—could still impact the market's momentum . In summary, the odds of Bitcoin hitting $100,000 are now higher than ever, according to Polymarket.

As a trendy meme coin in the crypto market, BONK has now achieved a market cap of $4.17 billion. It has increased by 71% over the last 7 days and has surpassed the $0.000050 psychological mark. Moreover, the coin has entered the top 30 cryptocurrencies as its bullish momentum continues. Let's dive into a quick technical analysis of BONK's price action.BONK Technical AnalysisThe daily chart reveals a breakout rally, with BONK's price gaining momentum. The rally began with a Morning Star pattern formed from a key support trendline, driving the market price up by 221%.Starting the rally at $0.00001717, BONK is currently trading at $0.00005525. It has posted an intraday gain of 5.89% and is on track for its second consecutive bullish candle amid a largely passive market. BONK price chart The rally has extended over the past 16 days, with only three red candles. The price has even reached a new all-time high of $0.000060. Using Fibonacci levels, the uptrend has already surpassed the 1.272 level and is now targeting the $0.000062 (1.618) level.The increased bullish sentiment is reflected in the positive alignment of the 50-, 100-, and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs). Additionally, the ADX line, which measures trend strength, has crossed the 50% threshold, indicating strong momentum. Currently, the ADX is at 51.14%, surpassing previous peaks of 42.51%. Notably, the ADX has previously spiked above 90%, signaling significant potential for continued growth in BONK prices. Smart Whales Move into BONKAs BONK's bullish trend accelerates, a whale with a track record of profit from the PopCat meme coin is now shifting focus to BONK. The same whale previously netted $4.84 million in profits from PopCat. Over the past two days, this whale has invested $3.4 million USDC to accumulate 65.4 billion BONK tokens.With the backing of a well-positioned whale, confidence in BONK’s potential for further gains has grown, significantly increasing the chances of a continued uptrend.BONK Price TargetsConsidering the broader market growth, the uptrend at this meme coin is likely to hit the 2.272 Fibonacci level at $0.000080. This also increases the chances of the meme coin reaching the $0.00010 psychological mark. On the flip side, the meme coin could find support at the psychological mark of $0.000050.",POSITIVE,USDC | BONK,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | USDC | BONK,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/20/is-0-00010-within-reach-for-bonk-after-221-surge-pushes-it-into-the-top-30/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-0-00010-within-reach-for-bonk-after-221-surge-pushes-it-into-the-top-30,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

With Cardano's market cap of $28 billion, the altcoin is gradually inching closer to surpassing USDC to take the eighth position. In parallel, ADA's price is setting up for a potential 52-week high, putting the $1 target within reach.Will the intraday recovery drive Cardano to $1 after XRP’s rally? Let’s find out. Cardano Price AnalysisCardano is currently trading at $0.793, with an intraday gain of 7.45%. This creates a bullish engulfing candle that crosses above the 100% Fibonacci level at $0.776. Cardano Price Chart Furthermore, it marks the third consecutive bullish candle at play as it inches closer to the recently recorded 52-week high of $0.819. The strong bullish trend in Cardano continues to build momentum, with the price having surged 147% in just 16 days from $0.32. This parabolic price movement has been accompanied by a golden crossover between the 100-day and 200-day EMA lines, signaling continued bullishness.With a surge in trend momentum, the ADX line is now at 48.76. Based on the previous price action, the ADX line highlights the peak formation near the 50 and 61 levels. Hence, the indicator shows room for growth. 145% Increase in Cardano Accumulation by Whales Cardano whales have been accumulating ADA tokens during the last few weeks amid the massive rally. Specifically, whales that typically hold above $10 million worth of ADA increased their holdings by 145.72%. Likewise, holders with positions between $1 million and $10 million in ADA have increased their positions by 82.97%. Additionally, holders with positions ranging from $100,000 to $1 million have increased their portfolio by 105.66% over the last 30 days.The recent bull run and the broader market recovery are the key factors, as the worth of the Cardano holder's position skyrocketed with the surge in market price. Will ADA Price Reach $1?Based on previous price action, the ADX typically peaks around the 50.75 and 61.76 levels, which suggests further upward potential.Using Fibonacci levels, the high-momentum double-bottom reversal in Cardano now suggests price targets of $0.994 and $1.363, based on the 1.272 and 1.618 Fibonacci extensions.On the other hand, a minor retest of $0.776 remains a possibility, provided the daily candle closes above this level.",POSITIVE,ADA | USDC,ADA | ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/20/is-cardano-1-rally-now-on-cards-after-this-massive-breakout/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-cardano-1-rally-now-on-cards-after-this-massive-breakout,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

With ADA trading at $0.8127, the altcoin has experienced an explosive rise of over 115% in the last two weeks, breaking an eight-month high. While profit-taking by retail investors briefly pushed ADA below the $0.80-mark, large investors (whales) are determined to send the asset higher with massive accumulation.Large Cardano Transactions Surged by 297%Analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted data from IntoTheBlock, revealing a 297% surge in large Cardano transactions over the past two weeks. As of yesterday, the total volume of these transactions reached $22.56 billion.Notably, the value of large ADA transactions was at a seven-day low of $12.25 billion on November 13. However, it more than doubled in just three days, climbing to $28.43 billion by November 16. Despite the recent dip, the current figure of $22.56 billion indicates that strong momentum is still ongoing. Cardano Whales Accumulate More by 145%, with Holding Reaching $12BMeanwhile, the impact of these large-value transactions is further underscored by additional data showing that whales have vigorously stockpiled ADA tokens over the past month. Investors holding over $10 million in ADA have increased their positions by 145.72%, now holding a total of $12.11 billion worth of ADA as of November 18.This group of high-net-worth holders has seen the largest 30-day growth in their ADA portfolios. Close behind are wallets with ADA holdings between $100K and $1 million, which experienced a 105.66% increase over the past month, now totaling $4.36 billion. Similarly, wallets holding between $1 million and $10 million in ADA saw an 82.97% rise, bringing their total ADA holdings to $3.9 billion. Other groups accumulating ADA include those holding between $1K and $100K.On the other hand, the lowest retail tier—those holding less than $1 in ADA—reduced their holdings by 39.46%, with their total dropping to just $285,490. Investors holding between $10 and $100 in ADA also reduced their positions, with a 7.65% decline, leaving them with $41.91 million in ADA. $52B ADA Transactions in One WeekIn a separate report , intelligence platform Santiment revealed that Cardano has seen $52.26 billion in transaction volume this week alone, marking a seven-month high. The report also highlighted that there have been over 8,900 whale transactions for the second consecutive week, a six-month high. Cardano Now Decoupled from AltcoinsAs a result, Santiment noted that Cardano is now decoupled from the broader altcoin market. Additionally, it observed that ADA’s price ratio against Bitcoin is approaching an eight-month peak. The last time Cardano experienced this level of transaction and whale activity was in June, just before the ADA/BTC pairing saw a 26% surge.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/20/cardano-whales-push-ada-higher-145-increase-in-holdings-52b-in-volume-as-price-spikes-above-0-81/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-whales-push-ada-higher-145-increase-in-holdings-52b-in-volume-as-price-spikes-above-0-81,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36608276,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653923,1732093230,Is Ethereum Undervalued? Investors Hold Firm While Price Targets Rise,"Ethereum has experienced a noticeable surge in its price recently, trading above the psychological $3,000 price mark, which has reignited interest in the crypto market. According to on-chain analysis, retail investors appear to be adopting a “hold” strategy, resisting the urge to sell despite the increase in ETH’s value. Market analysts view This holding behavior as significant, especially considering the broader market sentiment influenced by the so-called “Trump Trade,” which has contributed to easing risks and enhancing market conditions. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Readies for a Fresh Climb: Will Momentum Build? Limited Ethereum Deposits To Exchanges According to the onatt, the CryptoQuant analyst behind the analysis, this trend of holding ETH without significant profit-taking suggests that many investors still perceive the cryptocurrency as “undervalued,” even at its elevated levels. Another factor onatt mentioned supporting this observation is the limited inflow of ETH to major exchange deposit addresses such as Binance and OKX, indicating that traders are not moving their assets to sell. Generally, large volumes of ETH flow into exchanges typically signal impending selling pressure. However, this has not been the case, reflecting a cautious but optimistic outlook among retail market participants. Key Metric Highlighting Investor Sentiment Another major metric the CryptoQuant analyst highlighted reinforcing this “hold” sentiment is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which tracks the profitability of spent coins. onatt reveals that this metric remains close to 1, indicating that most Ethereum transactions are happening near breakeven levels. This data indicates a lack of significant profit realization among ETH holders, highlighting a strong “buy and hold” sentiment. According to the analyst, when paired with low exchange inflows, this metric also suggests that investors are maintaining confidence in Ethereum’s long-term growth potential. Furthermore, onatt’s analysis suggests that as long as ETH maintains levels above $2,800, it could pave the way for a swift move toward the $4,000 range. So far, Ethereum is currently still trading above just above $3,000. While the asset’s price increase is nowhere near that of BTC, it has managed to maintain stability above the crucial psychological price level. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Confronts Barriers to a New Surge—Can Bulls Prevail? At the time of writing, ETH has surged by 0.2% in the past day with a current trading price of $3,100—a price mark that brings Ethereum a 36.4% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 registered in 2021. Analysts have suggested that the current market price of ETH is a notable buying opportunity for the asset.

42435290,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kosHK,1732092406,"Dogecoin, XRP Trading Volumes Flip Bitcoin’s in South Korea","XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) have seen significantly higher trading volumes than Bitcoin on South Korean exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb.  XRP and DOGE have experienced over 100% price increases in the past two weeks, driven by factors like favorable U.S. regulatory changes for XRP and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk for DOGE.  While South Korean trading frenzy might indicate market froth, XRP's price stability above $1 suggests potential for further gains.  Trading volume in XRP and dogecoin {{DOGE}} is much higher than that of bitcoin {{BTC}} on South Korean crypto exchanges this week, a frenzy that may have helped raise prices of the two tokens in the crazed market.  CoinGecko data shows XRP and DOGE have cumulatively accounted for as much as 30% of trading volumes on Upbit, the country’s biggest exchange, and nearly 20% on Bithumb in the past 24 hours. That is unusually higher than usual leader bitcoin and indicates a short-term demand for the tokens in the country.  Part of these volumes could be attributed to wash trading, however, where automated programs continuously trade a token to give the illusion of a heavily traded market.  Upbit led XRP volumes in dollar terms across all global exchanges in the past 24 hours, including venues such as Binance and Coinbase, the data shows. (These trades were placed against Korean won but have been converted to U.S. dollars at current exchange rates).  Binance and Coinbase, however, lead DOGE trading volumes across global exchanges.  XRP and DOGE were the best-performing majors in the past weeks as BTC hit new lifetime highs. Both tokens are up more than 100% in the past 14 days, data shows, with their futures products surging to yearly highs.  In crypto circles, South Korean traders are known for pushing euphoric rallies on tokens, contributing to buying pressure and possibly influencing prices.  Gains in XRP started last week as the shifting U.S. regulatory climate supported growth in tokens related to companies hampered by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) actions (XRP is closely related to Ripple Labs).  Meanwhile, DOGE has surged following a Republican win at the U.S. elections and a renewed promotional push by technocrat Elon Musk — who has been picked to lead the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) non-governmental unit under a Trump administration.  As such, attention from South Korean markets may mark a local top for tokens as it a sign of froth, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted.  However, CoinDesk markets analyst Omkar Godbole sees growth in XRP prices in the near term.  “XRP is holding steady above $1 after a powerful rally—the strongest in three years! While intraday charts hint at a possible pullback, it could set the stage for another upward move,” Godbole said.  “Momentum indicators on longer charts are firmly bullish. Key supports to watch out for are 96 cents and 65 cents. Resistance looms at $1.26 and $1.40, echoing the supply zone from September 2021,” he added.  XRP trades at just over $1 as of Asian afternoon hours Wednesday. DOGE is just under 40 cents.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | XRP,BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | TRADING | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/20/dogecoin-xrp-trading-volumes-flip-bitcoins-in-south-korea,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcc7259e9bd7c703b239d949221d9b9a66874c9c-4240x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The development originated with CEO Chris Pavlovski’s November 19 tweet enquiring if Rumble should add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Pavlovski then added a poll in a separate tweet, asking users to vote for or against Rumble creating a strategic reserve for the leading cryptocurrency.However, things got interesting when MicroStrategy’s chairman and Bitcoin advocate, Michael Saylor, commented on the tweet. Saylor responded to Pavlovski’s question, affirming that the video-sharing platform should hold a Bitcoin stash.Notably, Saylor not only recommended the asset but also volunteered to walk Pavlovski and Rumble through the procurement process. The CEO showed interest in the venture, stating he would discuss further details with Saylor privately. https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1858945523258159169Rumble’s Stock Soars 9%Following the discussion, Rumble’s stock quickly gained bullish momentum, soaring 9% to $5.93. However, the stock (RUM) has relinquished most of the gains, keeping just 2.53% of it to trade at $5.68 at the time of writing.Notably, Rumble’s stock could rally further if the video-sharing firm adopts Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. This pattern has persistently played out among publicly traded firms holding the premier crypto asset.For instance, Metaplanet’s stock (3350.T) has increased substantially since adopting MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin playbook. The stock has surged over 450% since May and is up a staggering 1,313% year-to-date.Another valid example is MicroStrategy’s stock performance. MSTR is up 528% YTD, outperforming major traditional companies and even Bitcoin’s 109% appreciation since January. Notably, MSTR trades at an all-time price high of $430, mirroring Bitcoin’s bullish momentum.Other Firms Adopting BitcoinMeanwhile, the adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve is becoming common among public companies and states following the asset’s bullish momentum and the United States' similar stance .For context, e-commerce platform LQR House announced it would adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset, noting it would launch the reserve with a $1 million Bitcoin purchase. Pharmaceutical firm Cosmos Health also revealed on Monday that it would store part of its reserve in Bitcoin and Ethereum.Furthermore, states like Pennsylvania and Florida have proposed investing part of their funds in Bitcoin, holding it as a reserve asset.

42435281,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kos8I,1732088030,Mark Zuckerberg Could Teach DAOs Like Compound a Governance Lesson,"DAO governance needs a re-think, and shares should have a multi-classed structure similar to Meta and other Silicon Valley giants, says security firm OpenZeppelin.  Such a change would help prevent governance attacks, like the one carried out last summer against Compound, says Michael Lewellen, OpenZeppelin's head of solutions architecture.  BANGKOK – It's all but impossible to carry out a governance attack against Meta.  Shareholder activism is a non-starter in Mark Zuckerberg's empire, because the company's dual-class share structure – where insider-held Class-B shares have more voting weight than Class-A shares available to the public – means he maintains roughly 58% voting control of the company.  But in the world of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which are in many ways analogous to corporations, it's one vote for one token.  That is how a whale – a large token holder – who goes by the handle Humpy and his ""GoldenBoys,"" an affiliate group directed by Humpy or perhaps Humpy himself, ran what some called a ""governance attack"" against the lending protocol Compound in July.  They used their collective voting might to allocate $24 million worth of COMP tokens into a yield-bearing protocol called goldCOMP, controlled by them, to generate passive income for token holders.  This month, a court filing by the FTX estate appeared to ""dox"" – or name – Humpy and accused him of having ties to criminal networks. Nawaaz Mohammad Meerun, the person allegedly behind the alias, denied the accusations of criminal connections in a statement to CoinDesk.  Although some described the ""attack"" as a consequence of voter apathy, OpenZeppelin, a security audit firm that Compoud's DAO has an engagement with, and an active participant on the DAO's governance forum, sees things differently.  In an interview with CoinDesk at the sidelines of Devcon last week, Michael Lewellen, OpenZeppelin's head of solutions architecture, described what Humpy did as an exploit on the model itself.  ""Governance models that are token holder-dominant, where there are no checks on token holders in any meaningful sense, are ultimately all susceptible to this. It’s just a question of when,"" he said.  In Lewellen's mind, while decentralization is critical for blockchain technology, one that ensures trustlessness and security, it's a challenge for governance.  “Decentralization is like an objective good, but it’s not a good in governance the same way it’s a good in blockchain,"" he said. ""More voices in that discussion aren’t necessarily better if a lot of those voices are not aligned with the DAO and are not informed.”  Know-your-customer (KYC) initiatives are part of the future of DAO governance, Lewellen says, and the industry needs to figure out how to authenticate participants to introduce accountability without compromising privacy.  “There should be a way to verify this is a real person, and they’re not pretending to be others. For instance, zero-knowledge cryptography can help verify identities without exposing personal information,” he said.  Such measures would also prevent actors like Humpy from creating multiple delegate profiles to manipulate governance.  “If someone has significant governing power, they should be upfront about it,” Lewellen argued. “People should have the chance to recognize exactly what sort of influence they have and have the ability to counter it if necessary.”  And to prepare for another ""Humpy,"" DAOs need to engage in wargaming exercises.  “Threat modeling for worst-case scenarios should be a standard practice,” Lewellin said. “Teams need real answers to questions like: What if a malicious actor acquires significant voting power? How do we respond on-chain?”  Apathy remains a significant challenge in DAO governance, with voter participation often low, showing a need to incentivize good civic behavior. Somehow, DAOs need to adopt governance models that ensure critical decisions – especially those involving user funds and protocol security – are handled with care and expertise, rather than left solely to those holding the most tokens.  “We need to give token holders reasons to be responsible stewards of the protocol,” Lewellen said. ""By rewarding participation, we can ensure that governance decisions are made by informed and engaged stakeholders.”  In an ideal world, DAOs that handle billions of dollars would structure their governance more like Meta and less like their current iteration, Lewellen said.  ""We need governance systems that reflect this reality, systems that balance decentralization with safeguards to ensure long-term sustainability.”  UPDATE (Nov. 20, 2024, 16:30 UTC): Replaces photo; edits throughout for clarity.",NEUTRAL,COMP,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/20/metas-mark-zuckerberg-could-teach-daos-like-compound-a-governance-lesson,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a77a3e7a8bc29df4ce5573f990b62ebe47b1e4d9-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36604766,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653930,1732087804,Bitcoin Closing In On $100K: The Case For A Future Valuation Of $1 Million,"Since November 5, the day President-elect Donald Trump secured another term in office, Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable uptrend, reaching a new all-time high of $93,300. Since then, BTC has been trading within a narrow range between $89,000 and $92,000, positioning for a potential move toward the $100,000 milestone. This raises an intriguing question whether a price of $1 million per coin is feasible over the next decade. A Long-Term Vision For Investors Market expert VirtualBacon has conducted an in-depth analysis of these possibilities, delving into the numbers, trends, and catalysts that could propel Bitcoin to experience a surge of nearly 1,000% from its current price levels. Within the current market cycle, the expert forecasts that Bitcoin could hit $200,000 in the next one to two years. However, he notes that while this milestone is significant, altcoins may offer higher returns at a greater risk, often crashing by 80% to 90% in bear markets. In contrast to altcoins, which face increasing regulatory scrutiny, Bitcoin stands out as a safer long-term investment. VirtualBacon argues that Bitcoin’s potential is not just confined to the next few years but spans a decade or more. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: Fundstrat Sees BTC ‘Comfortably’ Over $100,000 This Year To understand why Bitcoin’s price could reach $1 million, VirtualBacon asserts that investors need to consider its fundamental utility as a store of value. Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, its global accessibility, and its resistance to censorship and manipulation make it a compelling alternative to traditional financial assets. The expert suggests that if Bitcoin is to become recognized as the digital gold of the 21st century, reaching a market capitalization that rivals gold’s estimated $13 trillion is not merely a theoretical possibility but “a logical outcome.” Key drivers for this potential growth include increasing participation from asset managers, corporate treasuries, central banks, and wealthy individuals. Recent data indicates that Bitcoin ETFs have seen record inflows, with $1 billion invested last week, reflecting growing institutional confidence. Additionally, discussions among corporations, such as Microsoft considering Bitcoin reserves, further enhance its strategic value. Wealthy individuals are also beginning to adopt Bitcoin as a standard portfolio allocation, with even a modest 1% investment becoming commonplace among billionaires. What Does Bitcoin Need To Reach $1 Million? For Bitcoin to reach the $1 million mark, two critical factors must be analyzed: global wealth growth and portfolio allocation. VirtualBacon notes that in 2022, total global wealth was estimated at $454 trillion, and projections suggest this could grow to $750 trillion by 2034. Currently, gold holds approximately 3.9% of global wealth, while Bitcoin is at a mere 0.35%. If Bitcoin’s allocation in global portfolios rose to just 3%, still significantly below gold’s share, its market cap could soar to $20 trillion, pushing the price to $1 million per coin. Historically, gold’s market cap saw significant growth following the launch of exchange-traded funds in 2004, with its portfolio allocation increasing from 1.67% to 4.74% over the next decade. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Rapid Dogecoin Surge To $1: The Timing May Surprise You If Bitcoin follows a similar trajectory, its allocation could rise from 0.35% to 1.05% or more, translating to a market cap of approximately $7.92 trillion, equating to about $395,000 per Bitcoin. Therefore, reaching $1 million doesn’t require Bitcoin to surpass gold; it must capture about 57% of gold’s projected market cap by 2034. With gold representing 4.7% of global portfolios compared to Bitcoin’s 0.35%, a modest increase in Bitcoin’s share of global wealth to 3%—just 60% of gold’s allocation—could “easily” result in a $20 trillion market cap and a $1 million price point. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $92,240, up 7% every week.

Most activity was concentrated in call options, representing a bullish bias, with some traders betting on doubling the ETF price to at least $100. The Nasdaq-listed ETF closed Tuesday at $52.70.  The $100 strike call option saw a trading volume of over 32,000 contracts, according to data tracked by analytics firm ConvexValue. Most of the value happened in the Dec. 12 expiry, which was also the most popular settlement overall, accounting for 40% of the total trading volume of 354,000 contracts.  ""It’s pretty interesting to see 'professionals' degen into $100 strikes (this effectively means a doubling of BTC prices given IBIT trades near $50),"" Samneet Chepal, crypto quant researcher, Samneet Chepal, said on X.  The notable uptake for the $100 IBIT call is consistent with activity on offshore crypto options exchange Deribit, where $381 million in notional open interest is locked in the $200,000 strike bitcoin call. Assuming those buyers are investors and not market makers, it's safe to say that they are bracing up for the doubling of the spot price.  Note that Tuesday's most traded IBIT option was the call at the $55 strike, and the overall volume of call options was four times higher than that of put options.  A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, looking to profit from or protect the short spot/futures market position from an expected price surge in the underlying asset.  According to Deribit, the stateside demand for calls and the resulting ""trend trading"" by market makers to hedge their books could set the stage for a gamma squeeze higher in BTC's price.  ""U.S. institutions and retail who can't trade on Deribit, the largest crypto options market, will now be able to enter the space and create more open interest around certain price levels, which can further trigger volatility and gamma squeezes in addition to Deribit,"" Luuk Strijers, Deribit's chief executive officer said in an email, echoing opinion of other analysts.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/20/pro-crypto-traders-are-leveraging-ibit-options-to-bet-on-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-doubling-to-100-observers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5c08dc9387d1092dc49e57a74c1093c66d43773-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Woo X plans to invite bets on weekly copy trading competitions between the most copied human traders and George, the AI.  Cryptocurrency exchange Woo X has added an AI-powered lead trader, called “George AI,” to the platform’s copy trade application unveiled earlier this year, letting users emulate a machine learning crypto sentiment engine, and also allowing for weekly bets on man versus machine.  Woo X has partnered with Kaito, a firm led by former Citadel technicians that has built a machine learning search engine for crypto sentiment across platforms like X and Discord.  Sentiment analysis of social media platforms, done through a branch of AI known as Large Language Models (LLMs), have been applied to traditional trading in stuff like Apple or Nvidia stock. But when it comes to so-called Crypto Twitter, the signal is about an order of magnitude noisier, and is also driving a huge amount of retail trading, according to Yu Hu, CEO of Kaito.  “Because of how noisy the data are, nobody has been able to deploy a strategy quantitatively,” Hu said in an interview. “We've come up with a solution by indexing many information sources and leveraging the AI to understand tweet by tweet terms of sentiment and a semantic understanding of future trends. From our perspective, we really want to democratize advanced AI technology and bring it to the hands of average traders.”  Woo X plans to invite bets on weekly copy trading competitions between the most copied human traders and George, the AI, trying to predict who will come out on top.  Drawing on iconic battles between man and intelligent machines, like the computer Deep Blue versus Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, a partly tongue in cheek promotion of this clash asks the question: “Are human traders becoming obsolete?”  Asked if the weekly battle is likely to be close fought or depressingly dystopian, a Woo X spokesman said: “We are literally seeing this roll out along with the users.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/20/crypto-exchange-woo-x-adds-ai-powered-trader-george-ai-to-its-copy-trade-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fb356bf10ba443a65f09cc7086fd10a1218efea-1280x731.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Interestingly, the analyst predicted that Bitcoin could rally to $138,000 and then experience a 30% price crash. Why Bitcoin Could Rise To $138,000 And Crash After In an X post, Martinez alluded to historical trends to explain why the Bitcoin price could rally first to $138,000 and then crash by 30% after. He stated that during the 2017 bull market, Bitcoin surged 156% past its previous all-time high (ATH) before the first major correction of 39%. Similarly, BTC rallied 124% in the 2020 bull run before it witnessed a 32% correction. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP’s 11-Year SuperCycle Is Coming To An End, Why A Surge To $3.4 Is Imminent If history were to repeat itself, Martinez predicts that the Bitcoin price could rally to at least $138,000 before experiencing its first major pullback. Bitcoin has cooled off in the last few days following its parabolic rally after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections. However, the analyst recently mentioned what needed to happen for the flagship crypto to break above $100,000 and possibly reach this $138,000 target. He stated that the BTC price needs to achieve a sustained daily close above $91,900 to invalidate its bearish outlook at the moment and rally to $100,680. This came as he explained why Bitcoin could witness a price correction soon enough. Martinez noted that the greed index was currently at its peak, which is usually bearish for the Bitcoin price since investors could be overleveraging their positions, leading to a massive flush. Meanwhile, in his most recent X post, Ali Martinez indicated that this Bitcoin price rally above $100,000 would happen before the significant price correction. This time, he upped his target to $150,000, stating that the breakout could happen the next day or two before the 30% price correction. Price Could Double From Previous ATH In Next Three Weeks Crypto analyst Kevin Capital predicted that the Bitcoin price could double in the next three weeks. He noted that in every Bitcoin cycle after BTC broke its previous ATH, the crypto went into price discovery and doubled its price in four to six weeks. According to Kevin, BTC is 45% to 50% away from doubling its price from the previous ATH of $73,000 and is on week three of price discovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Large Transactions Surge 41% With 35% Uptick In Daily Addresses, Will Price Follow? The analyst stated that if the BTC price doesn’t record this 45% to 50% rally in the next three weeks, it is technically underperforming previous bull markets. However, it is worth mentioning that this cycle is the only one in which the Bitcoin price has reached a new ATH before the halving event, which took place earlier this year. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $91,900, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42435279,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kos6U,1732081239,"Coinbase Delists Wrapped Bitcoin wBTC, Citing 'Listing Concerns'","Coinbase has begun phasing out wBTC, and will suspend trading on Dec. 19 citing ""listing standards"".  This move comes after Coinbase has launched a competitor to wBTC called cbBTC.  Coinbase (COIN) says it is in the process of removing Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) from the exchange citing its “listing standards.”  wBTC is a token that represents bitcoin on ethereum and other blockchains. While wBTC is offered by BitGo, other similar products have the same concept: custodied crypto on one end, and a representation of the token on its non-native blockchain on the other.  This move came shortly after Coinbase announced its own version of wrapped bitcoin called cbBTC, which exists on the Base blockchain.  Recently wBTC has come under a considerable amount of scrutiny after BitGo announced it was entering into a joint venture with BiT Global, a custodian partially owned by Justin Sun.  While many in the crypto community expressed concerns about Sun’s involvement, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe was quick to point out that Sun has minimal operational control over BiT Global – the custodian’s legal structure means that no individual has more than 20% ownership – and the keys are split between multiple parties.  In an earlier interview with CoinDesk, BitGo’s Belshe said that critics of the BitGo-BiT Global tie-up weren’t being “intellectually honest”; promoting their own project’s interests over thoughtful criticism of wBTC.  ""We are a fiduciary today, and it’s our duty to ensure that the assets are protected, regardless of where they are held,"" he said, while taking aim at Coinbase’s ‘cbBTC’ for being, in his opinion, too centralized.

42435305,xYK0rIu5vMPYEKIa4kothq,1732079684,"Bitcoin ETF Options Attract $2B on Day One, Shifting BTC’s Market Structure","On their first trading day, IBIT options amassed nearly $2 billion in notional exposure, an unusual volume for new options. More call options were traded compared to puts (4.4:1 ratio), likely contributing to BTC’s new record highs.  Introducing IBIT options is expected to increase institutional involvement in bitcoin, as options provide new avenues for investment and risk management strategies.  Options trading on IBIT can lead to shifts in market structure by enhancing liquidity, offering hedging tools, and allowing for speculation on BTC’s price movements, thus influencing market dynamics.  Options tied to BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund IBIT racked up nearly $2 billion in notional exposure on their debut, a feat some analysts term “unheard of” for those metrics.  “1st day of options is just shy of $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded via 354k contracts. 289k were Calls & 65k were Puts,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said in an X post. “That's a ratio of 4.4:1.”  “These options were almost certainly part of the move to the new #Bitcoin all time highs today,” Seyffart added, pointing to bitcoin move to new record nights in late U.S. hours Tuesday.  IBIT options went live Tuesday in a first, a move that market participants widely expect to draw more institutional interest in bitcoin (BTC). In September, the U.S. SEC approved options for several of the 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on several exchanges, and more options products are expected to be available in the coming days.  Unwrapping Options  Options are financial derivatives that provide the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a certain date.  A call option gives the holder the right to purchase an asset at a specific price, known as the strike price, within a set time frame. A put option gives the holder the right to sell at the strike price within the specified period.  Call options are purchased when expecting price increases; if correct, traders can exercise the option to buy at the strike price or sell it for profit. Put options serve as insurance against price drops or for betting on declines, enabling selling at the strike price if it exceeds the market value.  How IBIT Options Could Change BTC market structure  Using options can open up a plethora of trading strategies for professional investors — which may bring more liquidity to the market and impact the market structure.  Institutions that are particularly averse to trading on offshore unregulated avenues can use IBIT options to hedge bullish exposure while selling calls to generate additional income. Speculators can use IBIT call and put options to benefit from price swings, while bypassing the hassles of owning the underlying asset.  Traders can also sell options and earn premiums, a passive income, which is particularly appealing in a stable or slowly declining market where the options might expire worthless. Such strategies are already popular among traders over leading options exchange Deribit.  Speaking of the impact on the market structure, some analysts are of the opinion that the expected overwriting of IBIT calls would dampen the implied volatility over the long term. In the short term, especially during a bull run, investor demand for calls could set the stage for a GameStop-like gamma squeeze.  Market structure colloquially describes how trading involves participants like investors and traders, how assets are bought or sold, and the regulations around specific asset classes.  Options give more ways to trade, making it easier for professional investors to buy or sell without big price changes. Tracking options data could show what traders think will happen to prices, helping everyone understand market expectations.  Near expiry dates, options can also predict and cause price swings — creating a window for short-term trading.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/20/bitcoin-etf-options-attract-2b-on-day-one-shifting-btcs-market-structure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79c87ed24d9e6fb0695064744696769b7b958db8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36597166,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653917,1732077005,"Whale Accumulation Points to Bitcoin Gains, But Here’s Why Investors Should Stay Alert","Bitcoin price movements often correlate with large-scale investors’ actions, commonly called “whales.” These individuals or entities hold between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, and their trading behavior is a critical indicator of market trends. With that being said, recent data indicates that these whales have been increasing their Bitcoin holdings, which has fuelled momentum in the Bitcoin market thereby capturing the interest of more investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market Is Still In An ‘Healthy Growth’ Phase, Says Analyst—Here’s Why BTC Whales Continue Accumulation: Implications and Risks A CryptoQuant analyst known as Datascope recently highlighted the trend of increasing BTC whale accumulation, noting that a positive 30-day percentage change supports the accumulation of Bitcoin by whales. This trend according to the analyst, represents a shift that can significantly impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory. When these major players accumulate, it often signals more liquidity in the market and a likely impending price surge. Datascope discloses that the correlation between whale balances and Bitcoin’s price “highlights the growing dominance of these investors in the market.” The CryptoQuant analyst added: Whale Accumulation and Its Impact on Price Whales accumulating Bitcoin is seen as a significant signal of an upward price trend. It indicates a period of market confidence and sufficient liquidity. Additionally, the 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA30) helps analyze the long-term tendencies of whale behavior. A positive slope in the moving average suggests potential for upward price momentum. However, datascope mentioned that there are potential caveats to this accumulation trend. He noted that the accumulation phase can lead to upward momentum, but it inherently carries the risk of a sharp reversal when these large holders decide to sell their assets. Selling pressure from whales, especially if executed suddenly, could lead to rapid price declines, reversing gains during accumulation. The analyst concluded by noting: Thus, monitoring whale accumulation and selling cycles is critical. Understanding the current market phase and timing exits correctly are key success factors for investors. Bitcoin Market Performance While the accumulation of BTC from whales continues, the asset appears to be gearing up for another rally. It is worth noting that prior to today’s price performance, Bitcoin has remained just above $90,000 following its sharp decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) of $93,477 registered last week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit 5-Year Low—What Does This Signal? However, today, the asset is beginning to see a return of upward momentum. Particularly, at the time of writing, Bitcoin has increased by 1.9% to a current trading price of $91,635, bringing it to a 1.7% decrease away from its ATH.

36593321,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653867,1732071607,"Bitcoin Price Forms Bullish Symmetrical Triangle, Crypto Analyst Says Next Stop Is $100,000","The Bitcoin price movements have recently formed a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern, a technical indicator that often precedes significant upward momentum. This pattern formation has come amidst a back and forth between $93,477 and $85,970 after the Bitcoin price reached an all-time high of $93,477 on November 14. The observation of this bullish symmetrical triangle was highlighted on the social media platform X by the crypto analyst known as Stockmoney Lizards, who is also credited with developing the Satoshimeter indicator. Symmetrical Triangle Points To A Bitcoin Price Breakout A symmetrical triangle is formed when a descending resistance line and an ascending support line converge, indicating a period of consolidation. As the price approaches the apex of this formation, it typically breaks out in the direction of the prevailing trend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Large Transactions Surge 41% With 35% Uptick In Daily Addresses, Will Price Follow? In the case of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin price action on the daily candlestick timeframe has been one of a series of lower highs and higher lows for about the past week. This formation has led to the Bitcoin price trading in an increasingly tightening range, which is ultimately going to breakout in either direction. For Bitcoin, the existing uptrend suggests a potential breakout above the upper trendline of the symmetrical triangle, which is just below $91,000. To confirm such a breakout, analysts look for a spike in trading volume and at least two consecutive closes beyond the trendline. Commenting on this setup, the Stockmoney Lizards stated, “The current setup suggests a potential breakout to the next level. All eyes are on 100k. This is when retail investors will crush the candy store and the real fun will start.” Such a breakout, if confirmed, could lead Bitcoin to establish new highs above the six-digit threshold of $100,000, which in turn would trigger a wave of inflows into other cryptocurrencies. Next Bitcoin Price Target: $100,000 The psychological milestone of $100,000 has been a focal point for Bitcoin enthusiasts and analysts since the beginning of this bull cycle. Notably, the calls for a $100,000 price target have been even more pronounced since the Bitcoin price broke above its March high of $73,737 earlier this month. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP’s 11-Year SuperCycle Is Coming To An End, Why A Surge To $3.4 Is Imminent At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $91,770, having reached an intraday high of $92,653 in the past 24 hours. This means it has effectively broken out of the symmetrical triangle since Stockmoney Lizards’ technical analysis. Interestingly, the analyst highlighted this breakout in an update to his analysis. Now that the breakout of the symmertical triangle has been effectively confirmed, it remains to be seen whether the Bitcoin price can reach the coveted $100,000 price mark before the end of November. All indicators point to go, with the demand for Bitcoin currently far outpacing the supply.

As the blockchain ecosystem gains traction, both analysts and investors are beginning to pay attention. This surge reflects the growing appeal of its blockchain, which offers fast, low-cost transactions, making it an attractive option for decentralized applications (DApps) and developers searching for a more efficient platform. Related Reading: Poland Could Lead With Bitcoin Reserve, Presidential Hopeful Says Solana’s value boost isn’t temporary. It signals a bigger trend in cryptocurrency investing toward alternative financial systems. As blockchain usage grows, Solana leads due to its technical skills and growing recognition of its possibilities. DeFi Hotspot: Solana’s Growing Influence It’s hard to overlook Solana’s rapid proliferation in decentralized finances (DeFi). On November 17, the network’s infrastructures were credited with among crypto’s highest processed fees to date. Five of the ten most significant fee-charging platforms were built on the Solana blockchain. Raydium, a famous automated market maker, led the list with over $11 million in fees, followed closely by Jito, a liquid staking protocol, with close to $10 million. The surge in activity is being fueled in part by the resurgence of memecoin craze, as investors return to the market with renewed enthusiasm. As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana grows, its capacity to execute massive transaction volumes without breaking the bank positions it as a leading contender in the fast developing blockchain race. Price Predictions: Will Solana Reach $400? With the given upward momentum, analysts are becoming more positive about the Solana prospects. Titan of Crypto has also commented that SOL can possibly reach $400 as it seems to be creating a break out pattern. This pattern is known as Cup & Handle and is seen as a positive signal for further gains, especially when Solana hits its all-time high. #Altcoins #SOL $400 is next! 🚀#Solana is breaking out from the Cup & Handle pattern on the monthly timeframe. Once it clears its previous ATH, it could soar straight to $400! pic.twitter.com/CILozp95uN — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) November 17, 2024 Another famous figure in the crypto field, Peter Brandt, has expressed similar comments, saying that Solana’s swing upward will drive its price further higher. Solana’s recent performance supports these predictions—only this week, SOL achieved a high of $248, representing an 11% increase in just seven days. SOL, at the time of writing, was trading at $246. Often times price moves in swings whereby the swings are relatively equal in price. I am sure Elliott traders get quite precise (as they tend to do ) but I just use swing targets as a guide pic.twitter.com/QBGzOAZTHi — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) November 18, 2024 Solana’s surge has also enabled it to surpass Binance Coin (BNB) in market capitalization, cementing its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. This confirms its position as one of the most powerful players in the industry, putting it on course to compete with other important assets, such as the stablecoin USDT. Related Reading: XRP On Fire: Over 90% Weekly Growth Catapults Altcoin To Fresh 2-Year High The Road Ahead For Solana However, Solana seems to be poised to continue upward momentum in the future. Solana is very well positioned for future growth thanks to great performance in the DeFi sector, favorable price expectations, and ever-increasing market capitalization. If it is able to maintain the level of performance at present and attract even more developers and users to its ecosystem, then it play an even more important role in the blockchain world in months and years to come.

This cycle. The market is skeptical on meaningful follow through for now, so that is not at all priced in,” Back stated. if the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve happens prepare for 7 figure bitcoin. this cycle. the market is skeptical on meaningful follow through for now, so that is not at all priced in. — Adam Back (@adam3us) November 18, 2024 The bold prediction sparked discussions among industry experts and enthusiasts. James Van Straten, a noted crypto analyst, responded, “7 figures? I don’t think I’m mentally prepared for 6.” Acknowledging the market’s doubt, Back replied, “That’s a fairly big ‘if’ though. At least if we infer from market price, the market thinks a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is unlikely. If that becomes real, I’d expect a rapid repricing.” Can Bitcoin Rise To $1 Million Per Coin? The conversation highlights the market’s skepticism regarding the feasibility of the US government accumulating such a significant Bitcoin reserve. Van Straten, like other experts, suggested that a nation might consider “front-running” this potential scenario, to which Back noted, “There’s no good way to buy 1 million BTC other than very, very quietly. Even then, once it leaks, the entire world gets FOMO and a price teleport happens.” Related Reading: Is $135,000 Bitcoin’s Current Ceiling? This Model Says So Portal, a custodyless interoperability protocol for Bitcoin, weighed in on the discussion via X: “If the US starts one, surely the rest of the world will start to follow suit as well.” This sentiment underscores the potential global ripple effect of a US-initiated SBR on Bitcoin adoption and valuation. Skepticism was also voiced by X user AndyLiteMan (@LiteAndy), who critiqued Back’s astronomical prediction: “As much as that would be exciting, it’s not going to happen. We hear this every cycle.” Back maintained his position, emphasizing the conditional nature of his prediction: “I said ‘if,’ and that market doesn’t believe it so far.” Adding another layer to the unfolding narrative, Dennis Porter, CEO and founder of the Satoshi Act Fund—a US nonprofit advocating for Bitcoin adoption—claimed on November 18 that Donald Trump’s team is considering an executive order to establish a national SBR, as Bitcoinist reported. “I’ve heard that the Trump team is considering an Executive Order for a National ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ in order to beat any state from passing it into law first,” Porter disclosed via X. “I can confirm that US Senate offices are backing this plan up. Game on President Trump. The race is on.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market Is Still In An ‘Healthy Growth’ Phase, Says Analyst—Here’s Why Porter, deeply involved in legislative efforts surrounding Bitcoin adoption, noted that his information stems from “private conversations with people familiar” with the matter and his direct involvement in promoting SBR language across the United States and internationally. Notably, it is crucial to distinguish between the proposals being discussed. Porter’s reference to Trump’s consideration pertains to an executive order that would establish a national SBR. This contrasts with Trump’s previous suggestion at the Bitcoin 2024 conference to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve by retaining all “seized coins” obtained through law enforcement actions. Furthermore, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the Bitcoin Act, which proposes the US government purchase 1 million BTC over five years, allocating 200,000 BTC per year. Addressing this legislative initiative, Back commented on a Polymarket prediction market screenshot showing a 36% chance for “Will Trump create a national Bitcoin reserve?” He clarified, “Optimistic IMO and depends on what they mean. ‘Not selling seized coins’ is very different from Senator Lummis’ SBR bill to buy 1 million BTC.” The latter could send the Bitcoin price skyrocketing. Back highlighted the logistical challenges of such a substantial acquisition: “There’s no good way to buy 1 million BTC other than very, very quietly. Even then, once it leaks, the entire world gets FOMO and a price teleport happens.” At press time, BTC traded at $92,329.
