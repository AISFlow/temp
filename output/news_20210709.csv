Between December 2016 and this February, the SEC says Apostolos Trovias, who used the screen name “The Bull,” claimed to be “an actual office clerk working in a trading branch” and sold stock tips to buyers through monthly and weekly subscriptions as well as one-off sales. Trovias also occasionally sold unpublished earnings reports of public companies.      Trovias used several dark web marketplaces to hawk his wares, including the now-defunct AlphaBay, Dream Market, Nightmare Market and ASAP Market. Trovias also created his own website to sell subscriptions to his ""tips.""      All of Trovias’ sales were payable in bitcoin, which the SEC’s complaint says was used to hide his “insider trading scheme.""

42406899,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8TwF,1625862967,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rises After Volatile Week,"Cryptocurrencies traded higher on Friday after a volatile week. Bitcoin was holding above $33,000 support at press time and is roughly flat for the week. Technical charts suggest buyers will remain active above $30,000, although upside momentum is starting to slow heading into the weekend.      “The possibility of price action dropping into the mid-$20,000 range is alive, but traders looking for a retest of previous all-time highs will likely be disappointed,” Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $33422.1, +1.25%  Ether (ETH) $2127.6, -1.43%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4369.55, +1.13%  Gold: $1808.4, +0.31%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.358%, compared with 1.297% on Thursday    “The May price drop was dramatic, whereas the on-chain reaccumulation of the bitcoin sold in that downturn into longer-term holders has occurred throughout eight weeks of sideways price action,” Rooney wrote. “This sets up well for an end-of-summer rally heading into the fourth quarter.”    Bitcoin shorts pile up    More than 5,000 bitcoin shorts were added on the Bitfinex exchange on Thursday. “When shorts close their positions, they do so by going long to offset their short exposure,” tweeted Delphi Digital.      The recent buildup in shorts is still below peak levels in June, which suggests pessimism could continue as bitcoin remains in an intermediate-term downtrend that began in April.      Eventually, extreme pessimism could lead to a short squeeze as buyers respond to oversold conditions, fueling a price rally.    Ruffer sold bitcoin on signs of froth    Ruffer Investments, a U.K. investment manager, booked a $1.1 billion profit from a bitcoin investment in five months. “So, what’s changed? The price,” Duncan MacInnes, investment director at Ruffer, wrote in a Friday blog post.      “Last November, we gained exposure to bitcoin,” MacInnes wrote. “We viewed it as an option on an emerging store of value with a highly skewed and attractive risk/reward profile.”      However, retail speculation and peak liquidity indicated frothy market conditions earlier this year, which prompted Ruffer to sell all of its bitcoin exposure in April.    Bitcoin vs. commodities    In recent weeks, bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 has started to rise, while the correlation with commodities continues to fall. That divergence could make bitcoin attractive for investors looking to diversify exposure across equities, commodities and cryptocurrencies.      Mike McGlone, commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, expects bitcoin to outperform Brent crude oil this year.      “The relative discount in the bitcoin price vs. the premium in crude oil may show that technicals and fundamentals are aligned for resuming the upward trajectory in the ratio,” McGlone wrote in a Thursday report.      “Akin to similar conditions at the end of 2016, we see the bitcoin-to-crude ratio well poised to resume its uptrend, especially if a new low in relative bitcoin volatility at the end of 2020 is a guide.”    Traders sells “strangles” as bitcoin goes quiet    Though bitcoin has gone comatose in a narrow range above $30,000, less than half the all-time high reached just two months ago, some options traders are busy as ever, taking relatively high-risk strategies to profit from the cryptocurrency’s continued price consolidation.      One of those strategies involves putting on “short strangles,” essentially a bet that bitcoin’s price won’t break out anytime soon.      “Our favorite trade continues to be short BTC strangles within the $30,000 to $40,000 range,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram post on June 30. “With psychological resistance at $40,000 and strong support at $30,000, there’s a good chance that BTC trades in this $10,000 range in the near future, which would likely cause implied volatility to collapse.”      Short strangles involve selling out-of-the-money (OTM) call and put options with the same expiration dates. OTM calls are ones at strike prices higher than bitcoin’s current level, while OTM puts have strikes lower than bitcoin’s going price.    USD Coin's potential    USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, has the potential to become “the most widely used iteration of the U.S. dollar,” Mati Greenspan, CEO and founder of Quantum Economics, wrote in a note, after the currency’s backer, Circle, announced its plan to go public.      “At the moment, there is only one that is widely circulated and is compliant with all known U.S. regulations, and that's USD coin,” Greenspan wrote.      USDC is gaining more shares as the stablecoin industry grows fast. Meanwhile, some of the top decentralized finance (DeFi) sites provide higher yields for staking the largest stablecoin USDT than USDC.      “Even though tether is more readily available and more liquid, USD coin is just seen as a more stable investment vehicle,” Greenspan wrote.    Altcoin roundup  EOS price hike: The price of EOS surged 20.3%, after its creator, Block.one’s unit Bullish, announced its plan to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a merger with Far Peak Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Bullish is planning to launch a cryptocurrency exchange, while the deal will value the combined company at $9 billion.  Growth in Euro Stablecoins: As the circulating supply of euro-pegged stablecoin EURS tokens more than doubled this year to nearly 80 million, some token issuers are picturing a future of foreign exchange markets on digital rails. However, challenges remain with financing and regulations.

42406888,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8TnO,1625862504,What Investors Need to Know About Circle's Listing,"Circle, a longtime fixture of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, announced yesterday it will go public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, at a valuation of $4.5 billion. Though the big money will be going to insiders already in the SPAC, it still gives retail investors an opportunity to make a long-term bet on a company that has a real shot at becoming central to the crypto-economy. If you’re considering buying into the offering, read on for some key facts and factors.      Circle was founded in 2013, making it truly venerable by crypto standards. But the company spent many years wandering the desert in search of a defining purpose: it has at various times dabbled with Bitcoin, with non-crypto payments, and with crypto exchanges.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    Starting in 2018, Circle seems to have truly found its calling with the USDC stablecoin. Stablecoins come in a few flavors, but USDC is of the fully-backed variety: In exchange for deposits of low-tech dollars or equivalents, Circle prints dollar tokens to Ethereum and other blockchains.      Currently, stablecoins are mostly used by crypto traders looking for a way to safely park funds without making the expensive and slow swap to true fiat currency. But as crypto continues to grow as a sector, they’re expected to have many more everyday financial applications, from payments to decentralized finance-based loans.      (Disclosure: Circle has previously partnered with DCG, CoinDesk’s parent company.)    Where Circle fits In crypto    Circle was founded in 2013, a longevity that attests to solid management. From the start, Circle was very much on the corporate and careful side of the cryptoverse, aiming at mainstream applications and high-profile partnerships. If Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is crypto’s robotoid Mark Zuckerberg, Allaire is a crypto mini-Jamie Dimon, with the finance world’s old-school sheen. That cultivation of respectability and trust has likely helped Circle establish its largest current revenue source, treasury and management services.      But the real story for Circle is USDC. The stablecoin is a joint project between Circle and Coinbase, through an entity called Centre. USDC has been growing at a huge rate over the past year-plus, from $1 billion to $25 billion of USDC in circulation. That makes it a truly viable competitor to tether, currently the top stablecoin with about $63 billion in circulating supply. Circle, in a recent presentation, projected $83 billion in USDC issued by next year, and $200 billion by 2023. That would have a direct impact on Circle’s bottom line through growing transaction fees and interest on reserves.      Circle has been consolidating to focus on its success with USDC, primarily by unloading trading assets. In October 2019 it sold the Poloniex exchange, acquired just two years prior. In its SPAC filings, Circle disclosed it lost $156 million overall on Poloniex. Circle also sold its over-the-counter trading desk to Kraken in December 2019, and unloaded its retail trading app, Circle Invest, in February 2020.    USDC: Big potential, big regulatory risk    In a best-case scenario, the management of a USD stablecoin by a public, regulated U.S. entity could be a watershed, both practically and conceptually. At the highest level, it would be perhaps the most direct currency competition between a private company and the U.S. government since the post-Civil War crackdown on private bank currencies.      Within the cryptosphere, if USDC establishes trust it could continue to displace tether, which many critics see as a systemic risk because of its lack of reserve transparency. It could even be an alternative to a USD-backed stablecoin managed by the Federal Reserve, and some see the private route as preferable.      However, there are doubts about whether that will happen. In recent conversations, Allaire has failed to answer questions about Circle’s reserves to the satisfaction of onlookers, particularly regarding unknown “approved investments” backing USDC. Allaire has reaffirmed a commitment to transparency in a Twitter thread on June 8.      Circle also faces obvious regulatory risk. Stablecoins are so novel that it’s still unclear exactly what compliant management of one would mean. Many existing rules certainly apply in novel ways, and regulators may also want to create new rules over coming years. Those are both looming unknowns for would-be investors in Circle stock.      Circle has a major potential advantage with regulators: Centre has ultimate control of USDC, including the ability to lock user's holdings: In June, Centre froze $100,000 at the request of law enforcement. This level of control will, of course, be a barrier for the token’s adoption by users who prioritize finality, or those who object on principle to a centralized token taking on a systemic role in crypto.      But at least for now, stablecoins are primarily of interest to traders more focused on money than ideology, so the objections have been fairly muted. Either way, it’s a bit of a devil’s bargain – with truly decentralized stablecoins showing signs of long-term fragility, the main choice would seem to be between a centralized coin and one that appears quite risky.    Read more: USDC Stablecoin Backer Circle to Go Public in $4.5B SPAC Deal    Though initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, versions of USDC now run on a surprising number of blockchains, including Stellar and Solana. That diversity is important because while there are methods to connect an ERC-20 to systems outside of Ethereum, native stablecoins are crucially faster for trades or operations on a given network. Tether, USDC’s main competition, also runs on a number of networks, including EOS and Tron.    The SPAC Factor    If Circle has at points seemed like a company in search of a purpose, the timing of its public listing could also suggest a certain lack of ferocity. The listing will take place through a SPAC, essentially a reverse merger with an existing publicly listed entity. These offerings have lower reporting and transparency requirements than a traditional initial public offering, and saw a huge surge during 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic somehow sent the New York Stock Exchange into overdrive.      Many of those SPACs have become disasters for retail investors, leaving serious egg on the face of promoters like Chamath Palihapatiya. With the bloom off the rose, the SPAC frenzy has fallen off dramatically.      While Circle is late to the SPAC party, that may actually be in its favor. The wave of SPAC deflations has led the Securities and Exchange Commission to tighten some SPAC reporting standards in April, another cause of the SPAC slowdown. That suggests that many past or pending SPACs had leaned on the reporting loophole, while Circle is comfortable going to market under tighter standards and could improve on SPAC’s spotty track record.",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | USDC,David Z.

Levine, CoinDesk’s managing editor of Podcasts. He discusses the reappearance of inflation in the U.S. economy and the long-running ways in which elites in Washington, D.C., and Wall Street tend to downplay the threat. The debate, of course, is important for how people think about bitcoin: if prices are rising faster than official statistics suggest, a fixed-supply cryptocurrency is likely to become more attractive to investors and users.      This week’s “Money Reimagined” podcast is taken from a recording that Michael and co-host Sheila Warren made during CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in May. It looks at the growing demands for companies to comply with environmental, sustainability and governance (ESG) standards and how blockchain technology could help them do that. The episode, which is divided into digestible segments, features appearances from Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of CoinShares, Mike Colyer, CEO of Foundry (a miner and sister company to CoinDesk) and Julius Akinyemi, founder and CEO of UWINCorp, among other guests. Have a listen after reading today’s newsletter.    The CPI's False Comforts    After a long period of complacency in the U.S. about inflation, the threat has suddenly reared its head. But look closely and you’ll see it's been there all along.      It’s an article of faith among mainstream economic observers that we live in an era of low inflation – in other words, that the purchasing power of the dollars in your bank account have held fairly steady, especially compared to the period of historically high inflation in the 1970s and early 1980s.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Just look at the consumer price index (CPI), the pundits will say. By that measure, they’re not wrong. Since 2001 official inflation, as measured in 12-month changes in the CPI, peaked at 5.6% in July 2008, and only briefly, before plunging to negative levels in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.      This goes a long way toward explaining why goldbugs and their intellectual heirs in the Bitcoin community are mocked as cranks by the “blue check” class. Inflation? What inflation? From this perspective one of the vaunted use cases for the original cryptocurrency – a store of value that can’t be debased by central bankers’ printing presses – may be relevant in Venezuela but surely not in Virginia or Vermont.      Lately, inflation concerns don't seem quite so risible, even by the accepted measurements of the Washington and Wall Street intelligentsia. As the economy recovers from coronavirus-related lockdowns, we’re closer to that peak post-2000 rate than at any time since, with May 2021 CPI clocking in at a toasty 5%.      This inflation, which the U.S. Federal Reserve calls “transitory” (Beltway-speak for “temporary”), comes at a time when the traditionally obvious activity of collecting interest on your savings from your bank yields effectively nothing. The extremely low cost of money comes courtesy of the continued extraordinary monetary policy experiment underway at the U.S. central bank, whose congressional mandate is to maintain “full economic employment and stable pricing,” which the Fed says means keeping inflation at around 2% per year.      To be clear, 5% inflation means that, in broad terms, what cost a dollar in May of last year costs a dollar and five cents this year. In practice inflation is lumpy; some areas like energy and airline fares have seen massive increases of 30% and 24% year over year while a pair of items (medical care commodities and alcoholic beverage components) saw small drops (-1.9% and -0.2%, respectively). These changes in price are then weighted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the BLS) to create the modern CPI.      The CPI is one of the most important ways that we measure how our world is doing and is vital when planning for the future. In fact, CPI is so important that in 1972 Congress tied it to cost of living adjustments (COLAs) for government support programs like Social Security.      When inflation eats away at purchasing power, COLAs adjust the amounts beneficiaries receive, providing more money to keep things fair and purchasing power predictable. The goal is to ensure that someone who receives Social Security today will be able to afford the same standard of living, taking inflation into account, for as long as the person receives the entitlement.      Which makes sense – if you’re giving people $1,000 per month because that’s how much additional support they need to live, the value of that money dropping each year puts the goal at risk.      And so, perhaps naively, I was floored recently when I set out to understand the history of how we calculate this all-important metric and how those calculations have changed over time. What I found can plausibly be described as political calculus run amok and the most serious case of missing the forest for the trees to beset the American people in my lifetime.    Flashback    By all accounts, the 1970s were a rough time for purchasing power. I wouldn’t know – I was born in 1984 – but history tells us it was an era of escalating prices and myriad government attempts to ease that pain.      Prior to 1975, COLA adjustments for programs like Social Security were set by Congress, which made it a bit of a Sophie’s Choice situation. Congress could vote to increase amounts paid to recipients that would keep purchasing power stable, at the cost of an ever-growing portion of taxes being used for that purpose. Politically there was no winning choice, just a question of who you most wanted to avoid angering.      In 1972, Congress hatched a plan to automate the process and offload the decision to the BLS, which maintains CPI, the official measure of inflation. Starting in 1975, we’d put our best data to work, scientifically determining whether and how much Social Security benefits should be increased or, at least in theory, decreased to provide that consistent, stable standard of living.      In practice, this only made things worse. Between 1975 and 1982, annual cost-of-living adjustments were between 5.9% and 14.3%. Over just seven years, government spending for social security alone increased by a total of 94.43%.      This was, as you might imagine, a huge problem that quickly turned political. It was also a problem that had no good solutions, really just two bad ones. Congress could unhitch COLAs from CPI, at which point politicians would reclaim control over the decision and bear responsibility for whether and how much to change payments. Alternatively, it could leave the automated adjustments in place. Given how long inflation had run and the repeated failed attempts to control it in the 1970s, it was more than feasible that all the money collected in taxes could eventually, and not too distantly, go toward paying for programs like Social Security.      The story goes that in the early 1980s “inflation was tamed” by the legendary Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. But concurrent with Volcker’s actions, the BLS embarked on the first of a series of changes in how inflation was measured.      These changes to the math and methodology used to calculate official inflation, without exception, decreased the readings.      Even if we assume these changes were necessary refinements to bring the CPI measurement closer to reality, they made it impossible for mainstream economics to compare our present with our past. Very few even independent economists still calculate the CPI using original BLS methodologies but everybody still calls our official measure of inflation the “Consumer Price Index.” This means that when you ask a mainstream economist if inflation today is as high as it was in the 1970s, that person will tell you it’s not, referring you to the modern CPI as if comparing a reading from today’s modified inflation measurement to the original are equivalent.      The BLS is a fact-finding agency, and the principle of charity (or at least Hanlon’s razor) requires us to assume until proven otherwise it made these changes in good faith. But looking at the effect of its decisions, one could be forgiven for drawing this conclusion: Because the government couldn’t change actual inflation, it changed the way it was measured and talked about it to make it seem like there was less of it.      If so, politically speaking, this was brilliant. The government slowed the rate at which spending for our most needy grew without the backlash that would rightly come from abandoning them to an ever-declining standard of living.      By any non-political standard, this would be, in my book, one of the biggest, most regressive scandals you’ve never heard of.      In the nearly 40 years that have followed, the difference between actual inflation as the BLS measured it before 1983 and inflation as officially measured for COLA purposes has exploded. It’s exactly the outcome the 1975 CPI-COLA tie was designed to avoid: a declining standard of living for society’s neediest, because the money they are paid is worth less. Its impact goes far beyond government programs, with CPI-driven cost of living adjustments finding their way into everything from private salary negotiations to alimony payments.    Broken compass    There’s a whole other story to tell about exactly what was done to the CPI that resulted in benign inflation readings.    In 1983 home prices were replaced with “owner occupied equivalent renthttps://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/owners-equivalent-rent-and-rent.pdf,” which is a made-up number for how much homeowners would charge themselves to rent their house to themselves. In practice, this resulted in a reduction in measured inflation compared to the pre-1983 CPI calculations using the same data and, it stands to reason, at least contributed to the “taming of inflation” for which Volcker is credited today.    But by the end of the 1980s, even the “improved” CPI was showing inflation on the rise. In 1990, Social Security saw a COLA increase of 5.4% (which would have been higher without the 1983 change). Further changes would be required to keep things from going off the rails.      The early 1990s saw two more changes: “hedonic adjustments” and “substitutions.”      Hedonic adjustments introduced a way for actual price increases to be transformed into price decreases. Imagine that last year a television set cost $300 and this year it costs $400. That price increase would indicate that inflation is, depending on how you do the math, somewhere between 25% and 33%.      But what if that $400 TV had a better screen resolution? Instead of 1080p, it was 1440p. The BLS might determine that, although the purchase price had increased by $100, the value of that TV had increased by $150 thanks to its improved resolution. That would mean that the adjusted price of the TV was $250 – a savings of $50 and, for inflation purposes, something that would lower the total CPI reading by off-setting other categories which increased in price during the same time period.      Substitutions accomplished largely the same thing in a different way. If the CPI tracks the price of steak and steak is 20% more expensive this year than it was last year, you would think that would result in a higher official measure of inflation. Instead, the BLS says, “Steak is expensive! We’ll substitute ground beef in our inflation measurement in its place because who in their right mind would buy steak at these prices?”      Outside of measuring inflation, that assertion could be correct. Surely many people substitute cheaper products when what they normally buy becomes more expensive. But for the purposes of accurately calculating inflation, it’s nonsensical and obviously undermines that goal.      In practice this second round of changes to how inflation is officially measured further reduced measured inflation.      While the government no longer tracks CPI using the original, unmodified methodology, it can still be compiled from available data. Economist John Williams, publisher of “Shadow Government Statistics,” has been calculating the index using the original methods and comparing it against the subsequently revised methodologies since the early 1980s. The resulting picture is pretty sobering:      The official misrepresentation of inflation is bad on its own, but has also tainted most of the data we use to make decisions, notably GDP which is exaggerated to the upside (good for whoever is in power) because it is growth minus inflation. If you replay the numbers with actual inflation, we've had mostly negative GDP growth for the last 20 years.      That's despite the incredible productivity gains from the internet and technology broadly, which could lead one to believe that government as practiced in the U.S. has been aggressively detrimental to society and prosperity at all levels.      Like the blue pill in “The Matrix,” the CPI has given Americans a falsely comforting perception of reality. When even this metric jumps 5%, we’d better hope it’s a glitch.      –-Adam B. Levine    Off the charts  Bitcoin's Puell Multiple shows better days ahead    While Bitcoin miners have received an increasingly smaller amount in block rewards over the years, the USD value of their rewards peaked in 2021 Q2 as BTC price hit a new all-time price high of $64,889. By the end of the quarter, BTC plummeted 46% off its price high, pushing miner revenue back down to pre-bull market levels.      Analyzing bitcoin miner revenue can reveal important insights about the timing and magnitude of crypto market cycles. The Puell Multiple is a metric that is often used to identify market peaks and troughs by measuring periods of time in which miner rewards are overvalued or undervalued, compared to historical returns.      The Puell Multiple is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of bitcoins in dollars by the one year moving average of daily issuance value. The green zone from 0.3 to 0.5 in the Puell chart here has historically been a support zone and a strong indicator that bitcoin price has found a bottom.      Since 2012, the Puell Multiple has dipped into the green zone a total of six times. Notably, each dip has been followed by a bitcoin price surge. A few notable Puell bottoms are November 2011, before bitcoin moved from $2.50 to $950, December 2018, where bitcoin ran from $3,500 to $12,500 in the following seven months, and March of 2020.      Last month, the Puell multiple appeared to find support briefly in the green zone and now we wait to see if history repeats itself.      –-Teddy Oosterbaan",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Adam B.

42406875,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8SC1,1625856063,Traders Make Money Selling 'Strangles' as Bitcoin Goes Quiet,"It's turning out to be a boring summer for directional traders in the bitcoin market: The cryptocurrency has gone comatose in a narrow range above $30,000, less than half the all-time high reached just two months ago.      But some options traders are busy as ever, taking relatively high-risk strategies to profit from the cryptocurrency's continued price consolidation. One of those strategies involves putting on “short strangles,” essentially a bet that bitcoin’s price won’t break out anytime soon.      ""Our favorite trade continues to be short BTC strangles within the $30,000 to $40,000 range,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital, said in a Telegram post on June 30. ""With psychological resistance at $40,000 and strong support at $30,000, there's a good chance that BTC trades in this $10,000 range in the near future, which would likely cause implied volatility to collapse.""      QCP said this week its conviction about the short strangle has only strengthened, given the lack of market-moving catalysts in the short term.      ""Right now, our trading plan follows the 2018 BTC analog where we expect a dampened trading environment from here to August (short volatility), followed by a rally,"" the firm said.      Also read: Bitcoin Options Open Interest Hits 2021 Low as Frenzy Cools, or Maybe It’s Soccer      Short strangles involve selling out-of-the-money (OTM) call and put options with the same expiry. OTM calls are ones at strike prices higher than bitcoin's current level, while OTM puts have strikes lower than bitcoin's going price. At press time, bitcoin is trading near $33,600. So calls above $33,600 and puts at lower strikes are out-of-the-money.      Deribit data tracked by Swiss-based Laevitas shows a high concentration of open interest at $30,000 put and $40,000 call expiring on July 30. It means recently executed short strangle trades mainly involved selling July expiry $30,000 put and $40,000 call.      ""It's the most popular trade right now,"" said Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange. ""For July, open interest remains highest for $30,000 strike puts, and $40,000 strike calls as traders write this range to collect the premiums."" Selling is referred to as writing in options parlance.    A risky bet?    Selling strangles is akin to taking a bearish view on implied volatility – the degree of price turbulence expected over a specific time. The implied volatility has a positive impact on the options price because demand for hedges typically rises during uncertainty. The metric drops during consolidation and picks up during a strong directional move.      When traders take a short strangle by selling higher strike calls and lower strike puts, they are essentially betting the market will consolidate, leading to a drop in implied volatility and the option's price.      A call seller offers insurance against a bullish move above a particular price level and receives compensation or premium for taking the risk. That is the maximum money a call seller can make, and the call buyer can lose.      Similarly, a put seller offers protection against a bearish move below a particular price level and receives a premium for providing insurance. That is the maximum profit a put seller can make and the maximum loss the buyer may suffer.      Also read: Bitcoin at $200K by Year’s End? Some Crypto Options Traders Make That Bet      So, when traders sell short strangles, the profit is limited to the extent of the premium received for selling calls and puts; that is, offering protection against bullish and bearish moves. However, the loss can be huge if the market breaks out of the range, charting a strong bullish or bearish move, and call/put buyer claims insurance.      Let's consider an example. Assume a trader foresees bitcoin's continued range of between $30,000 and $40,000 and executes a short strangle on Deribit by selling the July 30 expiry $30,000 put and $40,000 call.      The $30,000 put is currently drawing a premium of 0.0365 BTC, and the $40,000 call is changing hands at 0.0169 BTC. So, by selling both the strangle writer receives a total premium of 0.0534 ($1,794 at bitcoin's current price of $33,600).      The trader will retain 0.0534 BTC, or $1,794, if bitcoin remains between $30,000 and $40,000 until July 30. Deribit settles options at 8:00 a.m. UTC. The position will yield a loss if bitcoin trades above $40,000 or below $30,000 on expiry.      Theoretically, the market can rise to infinity and fall to zero, meaning losses can be in multiples of the max gain, as suggested by the inverted U in the graph below.      As Charles M. Cottle, author of ""Options Trading: The Hidden Reality,"" says in the book: ""The ideal situation for a premium [strangle] seller is to go to sleep after initiating the trade and wake up at the expiration with the price of the underlying at the short strike price."" (Or in this case, at $30,000 or $40,000 or anywhere in that range.)      However, the market never lets the trader, especially an option seller, rest. ""Be careful when selling premium,"" Cottle noted in the book, saying the market stretches out the trader's wallet from time to time, causing him to react for protection.      For example, if bitcoin rises above $40,000 in the next few days, the premium for the $40,000 call would rise, yielding a loss for the seller. As such, the seller may have to square off the position or buy the cryptocurrency in the spot market or futures market to compensate for the losses in the short call position.      In other words, selling a strangle and then managing the position is a costly affair best suited to traders or entities with ample capital supply.    Flavor of the season    Though a risky bet, QCP Capital and other trading firms have favored short strangles for quite some time. ""There is yield to be harvested by selling calls and puts or strangles, if we think the market is going to consolidate around these levels,"" Shillian Tang, chief investment officer at the $135 million crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime, told CoinDesk last month.      That's because bitcoin's one-month implied volatility traded significantly higher than its lifetime average and realized volatility following the mid-May sell-off. In other words, the volatility explosion looked overdone, and options appeared relatively costly and ripe to sell. Implied volatility is mean-reverting and cyclical in nature: a period of high volatility is followed by low-volatility consolidation.      The one-month implied volatility peaked above 140% on May 23. At press time, the gauge is seen at 83%. However, it's still richer than its lifetime average of 76%, according to data provided by Skew.      ""If bitcoin manages to hold the bottom end of the current range convincingly, then one can expect strong range selling activity and implied volatilities getting crushed,"" Balani said. ""The seven-day implied volatility is at 87%, while the realized volatility is at 74%.      Also read: Reflation-Trade Rethink Keeps Bitcoin Under Pressure      Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers said these low-volatility strategies are traded occasionally but do not amount to a significant percentage of the exchange’s volume yet.

42406872,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8SA3,1625855106,Growth in Euro Stablecoins Spurs Dreams of Digital Forex Market,"Could foreign exchange markets (forex) end up on the digital rails?      At the moment, cryptocurrency markets are a long way from supporting anything close to the $6 trillion-plus a day that changes hands every day in traditional foreign exchange.      But glimpses of recent growth in euro-backed stablecoins have some token issuers thinking of a future where digital versions of national currencies easily flow on blockchain-based markets between cryptocurrency exchanges and the fast-developing trading and lending platforms of decentralized finance (DeFi).      “It's hard to go a day without hearing someone within blockchain saying they wish there was a euro stablecoin,” Michael Richards, a member from Astral Money, a European market-focused crypto project powered by blockchain protocol Terra, said in an email to CoinDesk.      The circulating supply of euro-pegged stablecoin EURS token has more than doubled this year to nearly 80 million from just about 30 million, based on data from Glassnode.      EURS – which Stasis, its issuer, says is the oldest euro stablecoin project – features a token built on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard claiming to be backed 1:1 by euros in the issuer’s accounts. The market capitalization of EURS sits at about $96 million.      Such amounts are tiny compared with the market for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins led by tether (USDT), which now has more than $60 billion outstanding, and USDC (USDC), at about $26 billion.      But the ambitions are grand.      Forex is by far the largest financial market in the world, according to Investopedia, where trades take place on an over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace. It is also considered more opaque than other traditional financial markets, and large institutions tend to play a significant role in determining prices.      “One of my biggest hopes for the crypto market is to disintermediate this forex market going forward because it’s one of the most untransparent and shady markets left in the whole financial market space,” Gregory Klumov, CEO and founder of Stasis, said. ""There is no single exchange where say EUR/USD is traded.”      According to Klumov, interest in euro-backed stablecoins – just as with U.S. dollar-pegged versions – took off last year as more institutional investors from traditional finance entered the crypto market.      “There has been an anti-dollar narrative, which started last year after the United States started spending money like crazy, giving stimulus checks and all the rest of the anti-dollar measures,” Klumov said. That turned ""attention to the second-biggest currency after the dollar, the euro.”      The sharp growth of EURS since the beginning of this year in particular can be attributed to “a lagging penetration of crypto in general across Europe” compared with the U.S. or Asia, Klumov said.      In June, Switzerland’s Sygnum Bank announced the launch of custody and trading services for a range of DeFi tokens, including aave, aragon, curve, maker, synthetic and uniswap. It also started helping institutional clients get staking rewards from Ethereum 2.0.      “I think once the EUR-denominated DeFi springs up, there'll be a lot of people looking towards automation to take advantage of the forex opportunities rather than seeing shifts as a risk,” Richards said. “This is very much probably going to be a good early move for TradFi (traditional finance).""      On the popular DeFi protocol Synthetix, which creates on-chain synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets, synth sEUR (SEUR) is the No. 4 synthetic asset by market capitalization, just behind Synthetix’s own token Synthetix (SNX), synth sETH (SETH) and Synth sUSD (SUSD), according to data from DeFi Market Cap. Synth sEUR also contributes to 20% of Synthetix’s total debt pool for synthetic assets, behind only sUSD’s 34% and sETH’s 30%.      “The demand for euro-pegged stablecoins – as with other currency denominated stablecoins – is in an interesting place in that USD stablecoins built up such a lead that the vast majority of total value captured within blockchain ecosystems is dominated around them, and most protocols are built with them specifically in mind,” Astral’s Richards said. “However, the European Union is one of the largest markets in the world by number of consumers.    Too early to call    But for the majority of the crypto market, it is still too early to determine whether euro-backed stablecoins will eventually grow as big as those backed by the U.S. dollars, partly because of concerns around regulations.      As CoinDesk reported on Thursday, the EU has said that it will propose a new agency and rules to crack down on crypto-asset transfers, in responding to calls for tougher action fighting money laundering.      “The coming EU regulation will be very strict for stablecoin issuers as well as providers of services on such stablecoins,” Faustine Fleuret, president and CEO at French crypto trade association ADAN, said. “It is likely that issuers will need to get authorized as credit institutions or e-money institutions [and] decentralized stablecoins will probably be forbidden.”      Finding a bank partner in Europe that is willing to open accounts for crypto-related transactions poses another hurdle for many crypto companies, including stablecoin issuers, according to market participants.      “Even if you have a company operating under a single jurisdictional law, the Virtual Financial Assets Act [in Malta], you have no banks who would be willing to open bank services for you,” Klumov said, citing a negative interest rate environment across Europe.      “In the whole EU, finding a bank partner is quite impossible,” Fleuret said. “Crypto companies can't even open bank accounts to develop their business or subscribe to payment or credit services. That is why it is not surprising that banks are not willing to be involved in stablecoin projects [for] keeping the collateral.”      After all, despite the SEUR’s popularity on Synthetix, with a daily trading volume at merely $500,000, it will be a long way before crypto or DeFi can really challenge the traditional forex market.      “From a forex perspective, Synthetix lacks liquidity on the SEUR/SUSD when EUR/USD pair has generally a volume of over $500 billion per day,” Jean-Baptiste Pavageau, a partner at Paris-based quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha, said. “The forex market has not entered DeFi yet, but we see some projects and protocols looking to take over the forex market opportunity.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/09/growth-in-euro-stablecoins-spurs-dreams-of-digital-forex-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bef27850f8090145f1aebc7c555d08ac049a776c-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While most of the criticism has focused on Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, its closest rival USDC, which Circle operates, has also been called out for the lack of detail in its monthly “attestations.”      Circle announced Thursday that it is going public via a merger with Concord Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), in a deal that values the payments infrastructure provider at $4.5 billion. The company projected a USDC circulation of $190 billion by 2023, seven times more than it is now.      When asked Friday why Circle hasn’t provided more information about USDC’s reserves, Allaire said the company has been involved in a complex process for months preparing the Concord transaction.      The parties are required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to file a Form S-4 detailing the proposed merger, he noted, suggesting that more pertinent information would come soon.      “Our intention is to include greater reserves transparency there,” Allaire said.      SEC filings are “the appropriate venue and medium to publish and share that kind of information,” he said.    Bypassing SWIFT    Allaire also spoke about the possibility of stablecoins challenging the decades-old SWIFT messaging system as a medium of international transactions.      “Dollar digital currencies can transact globally without touching SWIFT and other currencies like bitcoin can transact globally without touching SWIFT,” he said, noting that electronic currency is an invention that goes beyond stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).      “Internet-native money is here, it is growing rapidly and will continue to grow and that’s something that the world has to adjust to,” he said.",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT | USDC,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/09/usdc-assets-to-be-disclosed-in-sec-filings-circle-ceo-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5933b8b98d0721cfd9ddfdc8bdcf5dd48f8c0948-1200x968.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406867,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8S94,1625850466,Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained,"Cryptoculture    Cryptocurrencies are best understood by examining the community structure and cultural values they exhibit, rather than the economic activity they create. Cryptocurrencies are really ""cryptocultures"" and these cultures are many, a plurality. I define a cryptoculture as an open source community with its own micro-economy. Each culture embeds its values into their blockchain. It’s a sociotechnical arrangement: The values and technology are mixed up with one another.    Dr. Paul J. Ennis is an assistant professor in the College of Business, University College Dublin.Crypto Questioned is a forum to discuss the ideas and philosophies that drive the cryptocurrency industry.    Many assume cryptocurrency culture is monolithic, essentially a Bitcoin culture, but those involved long term come to know each blockchain as a particular point of view: Dogecoin (memelogy), XRP (corporate), Monero (privacy), SushiSwap (degen) or Polygon (efficiency). Those responsible for managing the blockchain, usually developers and miners (or a variant), constitute the ""blockocracy.""      The Bitcoin blockchain is designed to express a belief in scarcity premised on a right libertarian commodity theory of money. Bitcoin is a “theory of society” predicated on the collapse of the fiat monetary system. The project is sustained by the discourse around bitcoins as a scarce digital gold, digital metallism. In particular, scarcity is built into difficult-to-change code, algorithmic authority.    Ethereum    Bitcoin’s political philosophy is well known, but we rarely ask what political philosophy animates Ethereum.      The Ethereum blockchain is often conceptualized as a shared world computer. This computer is agnostic about what happens on it. Ethereum says we are just the infrastructure and how you organize yourselves is up to you. In the white paper, Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian computer programmer who co-founded Ethereum, suggests some applications, but those are just suggestions. But to be the neutral infrastructure is deeply political because it expands Ethereum from an economics experiment, like Bitcoin, into an experiment in public goods provisioning.    Ethereum is not in the business of confronting the state    The closest Ethereum came to formalizing a political philosophy was its flirtation with Eric Posner and Glen Weyl’s radical markets or radical liberalism. Radical liberalism shares with Ethereum a desire to reimagine the inherited political economy – corrupted democratic institutions, neoliberalism – by creating alternative market arrangements.      Buterin and Weyl co-wrote an academic paper on one such reimagining: quadratic voting for the provisioning of public goods. That found its way into Ethereum with Gitcoin’s quadratic funding mechanism, where smaller voters are matched by a large pool to ensure the spread of infrastructural funding is varied and reflective of the entire community.      Providing and maintaining infrastructure is central to the Ethereum mind-set, to the Ethereum cryptoculture.    Mutualist Minarchism    Author and philosopher Craig Warmke argues Bitcoin is a case of hyperauthorship. The Bitcoin community collectively tracks the narrative of the movement of bitcoins.      Ethereum is a case of hypergovernance. The Ethereum community collectively creates the infrastructural conditions for new forms of governance. These new forms are alternatives to the inherited ones and implicitly propose to replace them. These surrogates will provide functions previously provided by corrupted democratic states and neoliberalism, but in more decentralized ways.      Ethereum is ""minarchist."" Minarchism is a libertarian position advocating a night-watchman state. Associated primarily with philosopher Robert Nozick, minarchism advocates an almost completely anarchist position where all government functions are eliminated except those related to security (police, army, justice).      In Nozick’s hands, the night-watchman state is a right libertarian concept, but in Ethereum’s it morphs into a left libertarian one. The community mutually provides and maintains a shared public good, the Ethereum world computer, but after that it’s hands-off, i.e. libertarianism.      Ethereum is not in the business of confronting the state, but I do believe it proposes a version of latent minarchism where it provides better infrastructure than the state can. These services would slowly replace their centralized analogues in the traditional world. They cover the broad areas of community well: organizational (decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs), financial (decentralized finance, or DeFi), cultural (non-fungible tokens/social tokens). Minimal mutual governance.    Hash, Bash, Cash    What unites cryptocultures in achieving their various aims is a ""hash, bash, cash"" model of decentralized organization. Users hash it out by treating the blockchain as a shared locus of cultural truth and ensuring it remains so. Bashing it out refers to the discourse and cultural values expressed socially among the community. Cashing it out refers to the centrality of money in the cryptocultural experience: investing, trading, exiting. All these experiences bind the community as a culture.      We hash, bash, cash for different reasons, and the assumptions found in one cryptoculture do not carry into another. In Ethereum’s case, the community hashes, bashes and cashes in order to provide and maintain a shared world computer, a public goods infrastructure. That’s the mutualism. This infrastructure then houses experiments in hypergovernance, that’s the minarchism. Ethereum’s political philosophy is mutualist minarchism.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Paul J.

42406868,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8S85,1625850366,Debasing the Currency: Putting Crypto in Context,"In the fifth century B.C., Diogenes of Sinope, the son of a disreputable moneychanger, was thrown out of his hometown on charges of “defacing the currency.” He wandered west to Athens, moving from a backwater trading hub to the intellectual capital of the ancient world, on the advice of an oracle who said to continue trashing the drachma.      The Greek word for coinage, nomisma, is related to that of law or standards, nomos, the classicist Peter France noted. “So when Diogenes was told to alter the currency, he came to accept this as a divine command to change the ways people behaved,” France wrote in ""Hermits: The Insights of Solitude."" The plot started off reasonably enough.    Crypto Questioned is a forum to discuss the ideas and philosophies that drive the cryptocurrency industry.    Diogenes lived an austere life – calling only a cloak, staff and empty wallet his own – demonstrating the virtue of living without wealth. He begged for bread, spilled wine, burned a lamp during the day, wandered the countryside barefoot and lived rent free in a bucket. He confronted people with the idea that their money was mispriced or their values misaligned. Why would a statue cost more than a quart of barley? Why are worthless goods bartered for the better?      When a coin is defaced, it’s removed from circulation. The same can’t necessarily be said for customs or traditions, try as Diogenes might. But his acts of defiance may have got people thinking. In fact, he spurred an entire school of thought called cynicism, which aimed to square human nature with nature itself.      The same might be true of the cryptocurrency movement. It’s sometimes said that Bitcoin doesn’t provide all the answers, but it is getting people to ask the right questions. This 12-year-old experiment in monetary openness, independence and restraint is a foil to a global economic system that gives special interests advantages over sovereign decision-making. If bitcoin exists, why the alternative?      Diogenes was more than an eccentric tramp, he was an affront to the ruling elites of the day. He attended an archery competition and sat next to the target, saying that’s where he felt safest. After Plato said Man was a “featherless biped,” Diogenes gatecrashed the Academy with a plucked chicken. Alexander the Great once offered him anything in the kingdom; Diogenes asked for the monarch to step out of his light while he tanned.      Fighting an uphill battle against all the trappings of wealth, fame and power, the cynic had a few tools at his disposal: a commitment to frank speech (parrhesia), a total shamelessness (anaideia) and complete disregard for convention (apatheia). The first “cosmopolitan,” or citizen of the world, Diogenes was committed to exposing the truth, wherever it lay, even (or especially) if it was heretical.      Crypto is not cynicism, but the two movements share some common means and ends. Namely, to expose the fraudulence of the current regime simply by existing. A global, multivariate universe of people, ideas and protocols, crypto is often contradictory more than it is correct, in conflict more than it is cohesive, but there are a few underlying values.      There’s the commitment to disintermediation, to open access – for speech and finance – and the sovereign individual. In debasing fiat, crypto has implications for the whole social, cultural and political order (most of which have yet to be understood). Crypto can be funny, fascinating and downright strange, but it’s also a philosophical puzzle. It’s a new lens to think about knowledge, justice and love.      Are blockchains truth machines? Is code superior to law? Can you fall for an avatar in the metaverse?    Read more: Why Care About Bitcoin? Here’s One Philosopher’s Take    In a new series, ""Crypto Questioned,"" CoinDesk is inviting some of the industry’s most interesting thinkers and builders working through the dilemmas crypto presents. We invite you to participate.      It’s said Diogenes passed away in old age, after spending the last years of his life as a slave and tutor to a wealthy Corinthian family. The city erected a statue to him and buried him in honor next to the city gate.

42406866,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8S67,1625840104,Why China's Ban on Crypto Mining Is More Serious Than Before,"In recent weeks, China has come down hard on crypto mining by shuttering operations across at least five provinces or regions that are rich in either coal or hydropower.      China’s own environmental policy is a key factor in the mining crackdown, industry pros said. Specifically, China’s carbon neutrality policy created an energy shortage within the country due to its drastic reduction in coal-fired power, which contributed over 57% of the country’s energy use.      “The carbon neutrality policy cuts back coal power, which has been a major energy source for the country,” said Winston Ma, an adjunct law professor at New York University and author of “The Digital War – How China’s Tech Power Shapes the Future of AI, Blockchain and Cyberspace.” “China will have to search the edge of its power grid to make up that gap.”      China’s carbon neutrality policy has two goals. It aims to make the nation’s carbon emissions peak before 2030 and realize carbon neutrality by 2060, which means reaching net-zero carbon dioxide emissions at some point before that deadline.      According to that policy, China needs to halve its carbon dioxide emissions from coal-based power plants by 2030. To that end, it must shut, retrofit or put into reserve capacity as much as 364 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power, a third of the country’s total, according to London-based climate data provider TransitionZero.      “For financial stability and energy security reasons, the government would want to crack down on crypto mining and trading,” said Arthur Lee, founder of SAI, a Beijing-based clean energy mining company.    A hard cap    China has set hard caps on carbon emissions and will strive to meet the climate targets, according to a report by state media People’s Daily on Sept. 30, 2020, which was reposted on the central government’s official website.      Local governments, especially those that are dependent on coal-fired power in northern China, have been struggling to meet aggressive climate targets set by the central government. Major coal-based power producers such as Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, which were previously the top two crypto mining hubs in China, have been among the first regions that received directives to crack down on high energy consumption companies, including bitcoin mining businesses.      Such drastic changes have faced backlash from companies and local governments, China’s state media Oritental Outlook reported. The general manager of a coal liquefaction company said it had to completely shut down its factories to meet the planned coal power reduction, according to the report.      One local government in North China even turned off street lights at night to comply with the carbon neutrality policy, the report said.      In the People’s Daily report, senior government officials said there are “voices” that call for lower emission caps. But the officials did not directly respond to whether the central government would make any concessions on these absolute caps on carbon emission, while calling for unity between different authorities and stressing the importance of meeting the targets.      Against this backdrop, the Financial Stability and Development Committee of China’s State Council called for a crackdown on crypto mining and trading on May 21.      “Members of the committee are senior officials from key government agencies such as [National Development and Reform Commission], the Ministry of Public Security, China Securities Regulatory Commission,” Lee said.“The crackdown is well coordinated between these departments and historically policies of such scale have been fully carried out and can hardly be reversed in the future.”    Not only crypto mining    The total energy consumption by all the bitcoin mining operations in China combined is about 2.2 GW, according to estimates by Nick Hasen, CEO of Seattle-based crypto mining firm Luxor.      That number pales in comparison to the 364 GW energy gap created by China’s forced reduction in coal-based power. To meet climate targets, crypto mining is apparently just one of many high energy consumption industries that have been targeted by the policy.      Tangshan, one of the largest steelmaking centers in Hebei province of central China, scaled back as much as 50% of its production to meet its carbon neutrality targets in March. Construction, manufacturing, transportation and petrochemicals are also on the list of high energy consumption industries.      “The policy aims to drive out coal-fire power, while using more hydropower and developing wind and photovoltaics,” Lee said. “One reason why crypto mining has been explicitly pointed out is that a significant portion of energy use for crypto mining is coal-based.”      While Chinese miners take advantage of excessive hydropower in southern provinces during the rainy season, they tend to move to major coal-based power producers like Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia in the dry season.      Crypto mining could also be an easy target because of how the business operates.      “You can go to a building (mining farm) and see the building using 100 megawatts (MG), where that is generally not very common unless you go to a mega factory,” Hasen said. “So that does make it an easy target.”    Firm stance    The central government’s website reposted another People’s Daily article titled “China Is Serious About The Realization of Carbon Neutrality”on March 29, shortly after the policy was officially passed by the National People’s Congress during the Two Sessions, which is the largest political gathering every year to make major policies, and discuss and pass new laws.      In that article, the Chinese government touted that it has cut its coal-fired power down below 50% of the total energy use, while doubling down on developing wind and solar power to replenish the nation’s power grid in the long term.      Chinese miners are wasting no time in leaving the country, given the magnitude of the ban on crypto mining.      “From my conversations (with Chinese miners), I don’t think anyone is waiting in China,” Dave Perrill, CEO and founder of Compute North, a crypto miner hosting services provider. “I think the writing is on the wall, the shutdown is there and it is not going away.”      “In recent weeks, 85% of miners that have been asking about hosting services are Chinese miners and that is really due to the mass exodus,” Perrill said.      The Minneapolis-based firm now has three data centers in Nebraska, Texas and South Dekoda with over 100 megawatts computing power combined. It aims to build out five new mining sites and increase its total capacity to 1.2 gigawatts by the second quarter of 2022.      “What I see more is, I don’t think they necessarily need or want to go to the U.S., they simply want out of China,” Perrill said. “The big push now is the acceleration to bring forward those sites for our Chinese customers and make sure they are happy.”      The firm has provided services to at least five public mining companies, including Bit Digital and Marathon.    A 180-degree turn    The carbon neutrality goals were written into the 14th Five-Year Plan in late 2020. The plan is China’s blueprint for social and economic developments.      However, the mention and magnitude of this climate initiative in the plan struck a stark contrast with the central government’s attitude on coal from a year ago.      China has made energy security and economic growth top priority since 2019 by encouraging energy companies to increase fossil fuel output and revive coal-fired power plants. In 2020, the country commissioned 76% of the world's new coal plants, up from 64% in 2019, according to the report by TransitionZero.      The country planned to increase coal production, and the capabilities to transport and store coal in the coming years, according to a guideline issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) on June 18, 2020.      Government researchers expected China to have a coal-fired power plant construction spree before September 2020. However, they have been forced to revise their old drafts and prioritize the climate initiative in the five-year plan later that year, Reuters reported.      It remains to be seen whether there will be a sharp drop in coal-fired power given how recently the carbon neutrality policy has been implemented.      While it remains unclear whether China would continue to enforce these hardline energy policies on the local level, the central government appears to be intent on fully implementing related measures to meet climate targets.    Why hydro    China’s carbon neutrality policy may explain why it's cracking down on coal, but it doesn’t explain why the country is also clamping down on bitcoin mining supported by moving water, or hydropower.      “China sees a better way to use the excessive hydropower in the southern provinces is to transit it to the eastern provinces and cities that do not have enough electricity supply,” Lee said. “While crypto mining has been suspended in hydro-based mining hubs such as Sichuan, China continues to build out the infrastructure that enables hydro-rich regions to transmit electricity to the eastern cities.”      Guangdong province of South China, which is home to one of the world’s largest factories Dongguan, has faced an energy crunch in May due to the summer heat wave and manufacturing companies’ sudden demand for electricity because of China’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.      Several cities in the province ordered factories to suspend operations for hours or even days due to the electricity shortage. Local electricity firms issued notices to stop the factories’ production during the peak hours from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. local time. Spot electricity prices in the region soared as much as three times of the benchmark during the period, according to local media reports.      The shortage in coal supply is one of the contributing factors to a slowdown in factory activity growth in China in June, according to a June 30 statement from China’s National Bureau of Statistics.

42406871,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8S76,1625831051,Reflation-Trade Rethink Keeps Bitcoin Under Pressure,"While bitcoin's blockchain data shows signs of green shoots, the macro environment doesn't appear conducive to a bullish revival.      In particular, the unwinding of the reflation trade – or bets that benefit from a pickup in growth and inflation – might be keeping bitcoin under pressure, analysts say. Evidence for the unwinding comes from a recent slide in bond yields and weak commodity-linked currencies.      ""The unwinding of the reflation trade is impacting bitcoin,"" Noelle Acheson, head of markets insights at Genesis Trading, told CoinDesk, adding that many investors allocated the cryptocurrency to their portfolio as an ""inflation hedge"".      Reflation refers to an increase in economic activity and inflation after a depression or recession. When anticipating reflation, investors typically buy industrial commodities, currencies linked to commodities such as the Australian dollar, shares of economically sensitive companies and perceived inflation hedges like bitcoin and gold. They tend to sell bonds, driving yields higher.      The so-called reflation trade became popular after March 2020, when policymakers worldwide pledged unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus and raised hopes for a V-shaped recovery in economic activity and inflation.      The trade picked up steam in November after the U.S. presidential election, as evident from AUD/JPY (Australian dollar/Japanese yen) currency pair's rally from 72 to 84 in the five months to March and the uptick in bond yields (bond prices and yields move in opposite directions).      Bitcoin also charted a sixfold rally to almost $60,000 during that period, moving in lockstep with AUD/JPY. The currency pair might be a better indicator of reflation sentiment than most traditional assets, as the Australian dollar is sensitive to commodity prices and the yen is seen as a haven. Australia is one of the top exporters of copper and iron ore.      The positive correlation suggests that the reflation theme played a big role in bringing money into the bitcoin market.      Both bitcoin and AUD/JPY peaked in March and April. Bitcoin tanked in May on renewed concerns of tighter regulation and Tesla's decision to delist the cryptocurrency as a payments alternative, and AUD/JPY has begun to lose altitude in recent days, hinting at an unwinding of the reflation trade and flight to safety.      The bond market is signaling the same thing, with longer duration yields falling sharply in recent days. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to a 4 1/2-month low of 1.25% on Thursday. ""The bond market is telling us that inflation could be transitory,"" Acheson said.      For now, there is less incentive for investors to pour money into inflation hedges, including bitcoin. The cryptocurrency may face selling pressure if markets continue to unwind reflation trades, leading to a full-blown sentiment to avoid assets deemed to be risky.      ""The reflation rethink is beginning to take a toll on equities, and if risk aversion worsens, bitcoin may see a deeper decline,"" said Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange.      U.S. stock benchmarks dropped on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing more than 250 points and futures down almost 500 points at one point earlier in the day. Bitcoin also fell by nearly 5% to $32,100.      ""Bitcoin is still considered to be an emerging market and is thereby somewhat exposed in periods of intense risk-off, at least for now, despite the longer-term store of value proposition,"" Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, said.      Sentiment appears to have stabilized at press time. Dow futures are currently trading 0.55%, or 180 points, higher, and bitcoin is unchanged on the day at about $32,900, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

Resistance is seen at the 50-day moving average, which signaled an intermediate-term downtrend since the May sell-off.  The relative strength index (RSI) is neutral after rising from oversold levels over the past month. That suggests the price could stabilize within the current range with support at $30,000.  Momentum is slowing, however, and the weekly RSI is not yet oversold. There is risk that a break below $30,000 could resume the downtrend since April.

In a paper published Friday, the BIS said central banks are focusing on domestic issues, even though the implications of CBDCs go beyond borders. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund contributed to the report.  If CBDC projects in different jurisdictions are coordinated effectively, the ""clean slate presented by CBDCs might be leveraged to enhance cross-border payments,"" the paper concluded.  Cooperation could take various forms, the report said. That could include establishing common standards between CBDCs to allow for interoperability or international payment infrastructures.  Additionally, given that CBDCs will roll out at different paces in different jurisdictions, there needs to be interoperability between CBDCs and existing payment systems.

Over the last 24 hours, bitcoin's price slumped to as low as $32,000 before buyers drove prices to an Asia intraday high of around $33,319. It is currently changing hands at $32,900, CoinDesk data shows.      On Thursday, bitcoin broke below initial support at $34,000 as regulatory concerns resurfaced, with China's central bank having issued a warning about stablecoin risk.      Prices, though, are still well within a holding pattern that has kept them locked between tightening support and resistance levels.      ""I’m watching Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) continue to plummet, and whale wallets slowly accumulate while bitcoin trades in a bound range,"" BCB Group CEO Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie told CoinDesk via Telegram.      CDD is Glassnode's metric measuring economic activity that affords more weight to coins that have not been spent in a long time. The metric is calculated by taking the total number of coins in a given transaction and then multiplying that number by the total number of days developed since those coins were last spent.      ""CDD weakens resistance, whale wallet accumulation strengthens support,"" Landsberg-Sadie said, referring to holders of large amounts of crypto. ""Any real good news will be the tipping point for a breakout that returns to the long-term upward trend.""      Indeed, the daily chart for bitcoin shows prices have been caught between $36,000 and $31,000 since at least June 21. Meantime, volume among most exchanges, including in regions where large transactions take place, has slumped.      ""We have a long way to go to catch up with the Stock to Flow projections,"" said Landsberg-Sadie, referring to a model that suggests bitcoin's price should presently be sitting around $77,900.      How long that will take is anyone's guess.      ""Volumes are still quite thin across most major exchanges,"" Blockstream CSO Samson Mow told CoinDesk.
