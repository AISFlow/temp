42425163,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHtezh,1386008201,UK Banking Safeguards: Can They Protect Bitcoin Consumers?,"Storing personal wealth in bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, is clearly revolutionary. So much so, it's going to take a long time for mainstream consumers to actually understand the concepts and potential behind these currencies.  One of the areas people should rightly be concerned with is the safeguards that are in place when making purchases with digital currency.  The UK's established financial institutions already provide certain guarantees and safeguards against fraud and retail disputes. None of these are currently offered by bitcoin services. Here are some of the services that fiat currencies offer. Hopefully they provide food for thought to bitcoin service businesses.  Savings  In the UK, we have the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which applies to financial organisations regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  Banks covered by this scheme carry a government guarantee that will cover losses up to £85,000. This is per customer, per licence (ie institution), not per account.  If your bank goes bankrupt, the government will compensate you up to £85,000. If you have more cash than that, it's probably wise to store it across several banks rather than putting all your eggs in one basket.  Other banks in the European Economic Area have a similar guarantee, with a minimum protection of €100,000. That's approximately the same as the UK guarantee, depending on the exchange rate.  Debit cards  Debit cards in the UK have a scheme called ""Chargeback"" to deal with disputed transactions. In the case of damaged goods, or undelivered goods or services, UK debit card users have 120 days to raise a Chargeback claim to reverse the transaction. Chargeback rules between Visa and MasterCard-backed cards may vary.  Debit cards have less protection than credit cards as they are not covered under the UK's Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. By definition, debit cards do not constitute any form of credit agreement.  Credit Cards  As mentioned above, credit cards in the UK are covered by Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This means the credit card company is held jointly liable with a merchant for providing goods and services.This also applies to domestic and foreign transactions.  The benefit of this comes when a customer and retailer are in dispute, and there is no way for the customer to get a refund when they reach an impasse with the merchant.  Section 75 applies to transactions above £100 and below £30,000. However, most credit card companies are now applying the “Chargeback” policy used with debit cards to credit card transactions below the £100 threshold.  PayPal  PayPal has a much more hands-on approach to claiming refunds, and is not subject to Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. However, PayPal will honour chargebacks made on transactions that were funded with a credit or debit card.  In direct user-to-user transactions (those that didn't involve a credit/debit card transaction), customers must open a dispute. Here, the customer and merchant have to negotiate a solution. If the issue can't be resolved, customers can escalate their dispute to a “claim”, which will be investigated by PayPal staff. It's worth bearing in mind that all of this takes time and there are no guarantees that the issue will be resolved in the buyer's favour.  Merchant refund rules  The UK has many regulations to ensure trading is fair. There are the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, Distance Selling Regulations and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 to name just a few. While all of these regulations are concerned with what retailers and customers can reasonably expect of each other, none of them directly address transfer of currency.  What does this mean for Bitcoin?  All of the mechanisms of contemporary retail payment systems are possible to implement in cryptocurrencies. The primary difference between credit card and digital currency transfers is that the latter cannot be reversed.  Companies like Visa and MasterCard are intermediaries between payer and payee, so they control their own ledgers and can dictate which transactions are upheld and which are not. This model doesn’t exist with digital currencies because they're decentralised – no one company controls them – and if they did, the whole system would collapse.  Unfortunately, this means no one is there to enforce refunds for unsatisfactory goods or services paid for using digital currency.  Those paying for goods and services in cash can also face this problem if they lose their receipt or proof of purchase. Let's say you buy a light bulb from a shop using cash, but you get it home to find it doesn't work. If you don't have a receipt, the shopkeeper could well refuse to give you your money back. Many will, because it's good conduct, so one would hope the same would happen in the digital currency space.  In the fifth Core Development Update, published by Bitcoin’s lead developer Gavin Andresen, there was mention of a new type of transaction that would have a piece of 80 byte data attached. This would give people the chance to associate their own data with their bitcoin transactions, which could result in a kind of proof of purchase.  This would, however, increase the complexity of a transaction, unless a purpose made e-commerce system could automate such a transaction.  It's likely intermediaries will be used to improve the safety around consumer spending. These intermediary companies will act as a proxy for all transactions, and will be required to have sufficient reserves to satisfy any disputes that arise.  Further to transaction mediation, there is the question of the security. There have been a number of instances over recent weeks and months where bitcoin wallet providers have been hacked and every single Satoshi taken, which has put more than a few people off getting involved in bitcoin. Furthermore, if you are backing up your own wallet you could always lose your keys, like James Howells.  Plenty of people distrust the banking system, given recent failings, but a lot of people do – like it or not, banks have a history and a reputation of being a safe place to store funds. Bitcoin is still in its early years, so that trust has to be earned, but for this to happen, it could be that bitcoin 'banks' have to adopt some of the safeguards traditional finance has in place.

42425149,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHtePh,1386001459,Directory.io Prank Proves Bitcoin Protocol's Strength,"Bitcoin users around the world can relax: reports indicating thousands of private keys were released into the public domain have been dismissed.  A site called directory.io caused a brief panic yesterday when it supposedly listed every bitcoin private key alongside its corresponding public address. Headlines around the web proclaimed bitcoin doom, with some speculation that bitcoin’s minor drop in value was a direct result. It was, however, quickly revealed to be a false alarm, and then, a joke.  Reddit user fiveturns, claiming to be behind the site, said:  “I'm the owner of directory.io. This isn't an attempt at a scam. The first entry isn't ""fake"". It is a private key with the value of zero. The next private key is one, after that comes two etc.”  “All of these keys (apart from zero) are valid. It is simply a joke. Remember when you've been told that it is almost impossible to generate a key-pair identical to somebody else’s? This is a visual representation of that improbability. Look how many pages there are!” he added.  Heads-up  The site’s lengthy header should have been a giveaway: as fiveturns wrote, the site features a list of computer-generated private key addresses that correspond to nothing in particular. Thus, there is no chance of your address being in there.  [post-quote]  Directory.io is actually a worthwhile demonstration of how strong the Bitcoin protocol is, and the (incomprehensibly massive to non-mathematicians) numbers protecting it too. In all those pages, there isn't a key that matches any existing bitcoin key.  A better guide on your chances of finding someone else’s private key can be found here.  Generating the directory.io list “could be done with a 50 line script,” according to one expert. While they are genuine bitcoin private keys, they are all empty. This was quickly discovered once users attempted to import the keys to their own wallets.  Essentially, every time you create a new bitcoin address you’re doing what directory.io did, on a much smaller scale.  Private keys  While bitcoin addresses, or ‘public keys’ allow users to send money to one another more smoothly than email, it’s your ‘private key' that determines how much bitcoin you have, and whether you have the right to spend it.  Private keys are (hopefully) guarded securely by wallet software or printed on ‘paper wallets’, as anyone who discovers that key can access all the bitcoins stored at its corresponding address.  Having your real private key published on the internet would indeed be catastrophic, especially if you’re holding a large amount of bitcoin there.  Losing your private key (either by deleting it or throwing it somewhere you can’t retrieve it) means the bitcoins linked to that address are gone too – both to you and the world.  Rock-solid  It’s important to remember that, despite exchange heists, wallet shutdowns and individual hacking crises, the Bitcoin protocol has remained rock-solid since going live in 2009 and (as of December 2013) has never been successfully compromised.  The bitcoin wiki says it all:  “It is safe to say that the currency itself has never been 'hacked'. However, several major websites using the currency have been hacked, often resulting in high profile bitcoin heists. These heists are misreported in some media as hacks on bitcoin itself. An analogy: Just because someone stole US dollars from a supermarket till, doesn’t mean that the US dollar as a currency has been 'hacked'.”  Directory.io’s creator even managed to earn some bitcoin for the work, and posted:  “I did not create this to crash the price of bitcoin, and it didn't. People keep calling this fake or not real. Most people know how to generate every single bitcoin key-pair in existence. This doesn't make it insecure. It's secure because doing so is impossible. This is what people need to understand.”  He added that his donation link was there ""for people that found it funny – some people did :)”.

42425155,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHtebh,1385993559,BTC China in Discussion With Regulators Over Bitcoin Recognition,"UPDATE: with some extra clarification from BTC China CEO Bobby Lee.  The world’s busiest bitcoin exchange, BTC China, has been in talks with regulators that concern bitcoin's level of recognition as an official currency, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.  While there have so far been some local-level discussions on relevant issues, the company has not yet made progress arranging high-level meetings, said BTC China CEO, Bobby Lee.  It's still very much in the early stages and BTC China hasn't clarified exactly which government arm, if any, will ultimately decide bitcoin's status.  ""We already consult with a number of local commissions and bodies in various capacities,"" said Lee.  ""For example, the securities regulation commission, the Ministry of Information Technology when we register a site, law enforcement if there's a crime, that sort of thing.""  ""What we want to make really clear is that we're eager to talk to government bodies about regulation. We're eager for that to happen but there's no concrete progress yet. We want to show that we're completely out in the open, not trying to hide anything at all.""  This isn’t surprising, given the reluctance of governments worldwide to make official statements about the currency’s legal status.  Official approval  To grant official approval would likely cause a spike in activity, with many fearing activity on such a grand scale could undermine one of government’s key economic powers: overseeing fiat currencies.  This hasn’t stopped a recent flurry of interest from high-level government officials, as bitcoin's value soars too high to ignore. At the time of writing, the bitcoin price on BTC China was 6,267 CNY, or $1,027. Mt. Gox’s price was $1,050, and it was around $990 on the Coindesk BPI.  The upper echelons of government feature many opinions on bitcoin, including some that have shifted over the years. Senator Chuck Schumer, who in 2011 described bitcoin as “an online form of money laundering,” and called for a crackdown, recently tweeted that the cryptocurrency had “significant potential”.  Deputy governor of China's People’s Bank, Yi Gang, hinted at a personal (unofficial) approval of bitcoin exchanges and people’s ability to trade in and out of digital currencies, but also said it would be impossible for the central bank to recognise bitcoin “in the near future”.  Grey area  BTC China has taken Gang's comments on board, and Lee has continued to hold discussions with local regulators.  He has also answered questions about how bitcoin should be regulated, remaining optimistic about the long-term, describing bitcoin’s current status as:  “Not on the black list and not on the white list. It’s in the grey area.”  In the bitcoin universe, anything short of a call for blacklisting can be taken as progress. But while its ""grey area"" status allows exchanges and payment processors to function reasonably well at the moment, many think some form of recognition and subsequent regulation is necessary for bitcoin to gain widespread acceptance.  Though stories of bitcoin's black market usage have faded, they have been replaced by regular exchange security failures and thefts on nearly every continent.  China has not been immune to this: the so-called ‘Hong Kong’ bitcoin exchange GBL, which was later found to have its servers located in mainland China, closed suddenly and vanished on 26th October, along with $4.1m of its customers’ money.

42425156,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHtehh,1385985644,Bitcoin Alliance Launches in Canada,"The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada will launch today, aiming to assist users and promote the currency nationwide.  Based in Toronto, the Bitcoin Alliance was founded by Anthony Di Iorio, a bitcoin entrepreneur who sold the online gambling site Satoshi Circle in August. The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada (BAC), designed to unite bitcoin businesses and users across Canada, will provide resources and outreach services for bitcoin members.  Di Iorio conceived the Alliance when the price of the cryptocurrency skyrocketed back in April, although he had been organising bitcoin events long before that. The entrepreneur said:  “I got the concept for the Alliance when I realised that representation for bitcoin was lacking.”  The BAC has made some public statements in the interim, like announcing its board in July, but today sees the official launch of its website and membership structure.  The Alliance will offer free memberships alongside a paid two-tier model. Free members will get a 10% discount on bitcoin events, as well as access to educational resources.  There will be two other membership tiers; premium, at the BTC equivalent of CA$25 per year; and a lifetime membership, for CA$125 in BTC.  Premium members will get a 15% discount on events, and will be able to participate in forums and Q&A sessions with the board. Lifetime members will receive a 25% discount, plus the other benefits and surprise promotions. All paid members are eligible for voting rights.  Bitcoin Expo 2014  One of the first events in the BAC's calendar will be Bitcoin Expo 2014, a conference running from 11th - 13th April in Toronto.  Users can register in January to see a number of speakers, including; Cody Wilson, a DarkWallet developer and the founder of 3D weapon printing advocacy group Defense Distributed; Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Bitcoin Education Project; David Bailey of YBitcoin; and CoinKite’s Rodolpho Novak.  The Alliance is taking pro bono legal counsel through its general counsel Stuart Hoegner, and it hopes to reach regulators to cement bitcoin’s position in Canada, Di Iorio said.  The Alliance was developed at arm’s length from the Bitcoin Foundation, which has been busy setting up international chapters.  Di Iorio had originally discussed becoming a chapter of the Foundation, but negotiations fell through. The Foundation sent through an agreement that would have required the Alliance to merge its membership with the Foundation’s own. Di Iorio said:  “The board unanimously decided not to go forward with that agreement. When we got it, we were really disappointed with it. We had to push ahead with our membership structure, but still left the door open for some kind of working relationship with them.”  “We are looking forward to working with them in a friendship role, in a way that we retain our independence,” he added.  The Alliance’s next step is to reach out to groups in other countries and collaborate with them in a spirit of decentralised cooperation.  Board members for the Alliance are; entrepreneurs Eric Spano, Howard Patosh and Curtis Albrecht; telecoms investigator Michael Perklin; community technology advocate Jeff Coleman; and Reed Holmes, the business development manager for incumbent Canadian bitcoin exchange Virtex.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/02/bitcoin-alliance-launches-in-canada,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d9070cb7a3e9b5ca7d2e5047cc382ec9a9c7a31-1466x1055.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
