35887298,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652009,1731022233,Shiba Inu Hits Monthly Peak — Is Another Record-Breaking Rally Coming?,"Recently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has exhibited promising momentum, thereby attracting the attention of both investors and traders. After achieving a significant 30-day high, SHIB has embarked on an upward trajectory, leading many to speculate about its potential to attain new heights—perhaps even its all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Solana Rockets Past BNB To Claim Coveted 4th Spot In Crypto Ranks With increasing buying volume, confidence in SHIB’s future is growing. Some individuals are beginning to believe that this could signal the onset of something more substantial; however, there remains a crucial obstacle: a resistance level at $0.00001900, which must be overcome. Shiba Inu: Breaking Through Resistance SHIB needs to break out above this zone of resistance, thus keeping the upward momentum intact. It has acted as a barrier in the past and hence inaccessible for SHIB to record more. If successful at breaking through, there is high hope for higher levels-and that may just kindle the hopes among investors that anticipate SHIB to test its all-time high again. A significant volume break at this level would, however, bolster the bullish sentiment. Conversely, if it fails to overcome this obstacle, SHIB might encounter a pullback toward its support levels, which are around the 50-day moving average, where it could consolidate and gather strength for another attempt. A More Favorable Market Environment? The timing of this likely breakout also looks pretty good in the context of a much larger, more favorable market environment. With the US elections out of the way, political uncertainty has diminished significantly, and investors appear to be willing to take on risk once again. This has caused a “de-risking” environment, and the asset here is a beneficiary. The overall crypto market is slowly showing a recovery trend, and it will bode well for SHIB in the long term. This would be especially true if short-term runs continue to favor SHIB. The next week to 10 days will be pivotal as to whether SHIB can sustain this trend or not. Related Reading: Binance Coin Breaks $600! Is There More Upside Ahead For BNB? Bold Vision Besides the technical details, there is a vision for the future of Shiba Inu. Recently, principal developer Kusama introduced an ambitious initiative designed to place the US as a global leader in blockchain technology through “Strategic Hub for Innovation in Blockchain” (S.H.I.B.). This project that has the potential to convert US into the “Silicon Valley of Crypto” will aim at attracting blockchain talent, stimulating innovation, and generating employment. However, despite these requiring hefty investments estimated between $1.3 billion and $2.35 billion for the next decade, it shows the growing ambition behind Shiba Inu and its much bigger role in the fast-changing blockchain landscape. At present, if it can break through the critical technical barriers and the market remains favorable, there is always the potential for significant growth down the line. Statistics from CoinCheckup indicate a six-month prediction increase of 107% for the meme coin, with a one year forecast of 77%.

42435180,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLRFB,1731021802,Jack Dorsey's Square to Invest More in Bitcoin Mining and Shut Decentralized 'Web5' Venture,"Jack Dorsey's payment firm Block (SQ) plans a renewed focus on building equipment for bitcoin {{BTC}} miners and its self-custody crypto wallet, funded partly by giving up on creating a new decentralized internet dubbed ""Web5"" and investing less in music streaming app Tidal.  The decision was revealed the same week that Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, promising a far-friendlier environment in the world's largest economy for crypto. Bitcoin mining was an industry he pledged while campaigning to foster — likely welcomed news to a business suffering from dramatically lower profitability following the so-called halving earlier this year, which cut mining rewards by 50%.  ""We are scaling back our investment in TIDAL and winding down TBD [the business developing Web5]. This gives us room to invest in our bitcoin mining initiative, which has strong product market fit and a healthy pipeline of demand, and Bitkey, our self-custody wallet for bitcoin,"" the company said in its third-quarter shareholders letter.  The restructuring isn't a complete surprise as Block said earlier this year that it plans to cut headcount by as much as 10% by the end of 2024, explaining that ""the growth of our company has far outpaced the growth of our business and revenue.""  Alongside the shareholder letter, Block reported third-quarter financial results on Thursday. Its revenue of $5.98 billion, missed the average estimate from Wall Street analysts of $6.24 billion, according to FactSet data. The company's stock price sank as much as 10% in the aftermath.  Block doesn't mine bitcoin, but sells equipment to firms that do. Its initiatives include building its own mining computer. The payments firm said in April that it completed the development of a 3-nanometer mining chip, which it had been working on since April 2023. In July, one of the largest bitcoin miners, Core Scientific (CORZ), said it will use Block's mining rigs for its operations.  Square is also focusing more on its self-custody wallet, Bitkey, which the company started shipping in March. At the time, the company said that Bitkey will not only provide standard wallet functionality, but also connect to Block's payments platform Cash App and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) to allow buying and selling BTC.  TBD was started by Block in June 2022 to create Web5 (not to be confused with the better-known notion of Web3) as ""a group of technologies that enhance the Web with decentralized identity, personal data storage and verifiable data exchange capabilities."" Meanwhile, the company bought Tidal, a music and entertainment platform, in 2021 for nearly $300 million.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/07/jack-dorseys-square-to-invest-more-in-bitcoin-mining-and-shut-decentralized-web5-web-venture,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e4e36322604f2027a10a701f2213cc55e2a52bf-1148x646.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Fed’s Second Consecutive Rate Cut On Thursday, the Federal Reserve announced its decision to cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.50%-4.75%, adding to the bullish sentiment surrounding crypto prices. This marks the second consecutive rate cut, following a half-percentage point reduction in September. The unanimous vote at this meeting, which included participation from Governor Michelle Bowman, reflects a shift in the Fed’s approach to balancing inflation control with labor market support. Related Reading: CNBC Projects Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 Before Presidential Inauguration – Details In its post-meeting statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted a revised assessment of economic risks, indicating that the outlook for achieving employment and inflation goals is now seen as balanced, a departure from the previous month’s more optimistic stance. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit commented on the recent surge in both stock and crypto markets, suggesting that the price increases were in anticipation of the Fed’s rate cut. He predicts that continued rate cuts in the coming quarters could further drive up prices for both stocks and cryptocurrencies. Positive Trends For Bitcoin And Ethereum Post-Election In an exclusive interview with NewsBTC, Nansen’s Principal Research Analyst, Aurelie Barthere, highlighted that Bitcoin rise above its previous all-time high, coupled with high trading volumes, signals a strong positive momentum in the market. The analyst noted a period of “de-risking” in the run-up to the election, likely influenced by unfavorable polls for Trump, but observed a subsequent rush to “re-risk” as confidence returned following the election result, further evidenced by the rise in prices. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance – Top Analyst Sets $300 Target Barthere also pointed out that the Republican victory in the House of Representatives could further amplify this rally. However, she cautioned that profit-taking may occur in the coming weeks as new policies are tested, particularly regarding the potential political pressure on the US SEC chair to step down. The analyst pointed out that Ethereum is also gaining traction as expectations rise for a resurgence in decentralized finance (DeFi). Barthere noted an interesting uptick in the ETH/BTC price ratio, accompanied by significant net inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), totaling $52 million on the day of the election results. The analyst suggests that these continued inflows into the recently approved ETF market are seen as indicative of broader retail interest in the second largest cryptocurrency, which she ultimately believes has yet to see significant adoption. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $76,629, up nearly 10% in the seven-day time frame.

35883307,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651996,1731016827,Solana Bulls Aim High: $194 Breakout In Sight Amid Market Optimism,"Solana is making waves in the market as bullish sentiment propels it toward the crucial $194 resistance level. With positive pressure on its side, SOL is drawing attention from investors eager to see if this push will mark the beginning of a major breakout. A successful breach of $194 could set the stage for a substantial rally, highlighting Solana as a key player in the current market upswing. With SOL edging nearer to the pivotal $194 level, this analysis delves into its breakout potential at this key resistance point, examining the upside movement driving the price upward. By assessing key technical indicators, resistance and support levels, and market sentiment, this piece provides insights into whether SOL bulls can push through and achieve new gains, highlighting the opportunities and risks for investors in this trend. Bullish Momentum Building For Solana On the 4-hour chart, Solana has exhibited strong bullish momentum, with its price pushing decisively above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) signaling renewed buying interest and a shift in market sentiment as SOL approaches the critical $194 resistance level. Breaking past the 100-day SMA has strengthened the upward case for SOL, suggesting that the asset may have the strength needed to challenge higher price levels. Also, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for SOL is displaying positive signals, as both the SMA line and the signal line have risen above the zero level and are nearing the overbought zone. Typically, this movement indicates that buying pressure is intensifying, showing that buyers are becoming increasingly dominant in the market. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Rallies Strongly, Setting Sights on $200 Additionally, the daily chart shows Solana is on a solid upward trajectory, underscored by a strong multiple bullish candlestick that reflects sustained buying pressure. SOL’s position above the 100-day SMA further supports this positive price action, reinforcing the likelihood of continued gains. Trading consistently above this key SMA signals strengthening positive sentiment, as buyers maintain control and push the price toward higher levels, possibly setting the stage for a test of upcoming resistance zones. A closer look at the 1-day composite trend oscillator shows Solana in a bullish phase, with a crossover indicating strong upbeat momentum. As the indicator moves toward the overbought zone, it signals increasing buying strength and market enthusiasm, reflecting a potential for continued gains if optimistic sentiment holds. What A Successful Breakout Could Mean For SOL’s Future If SOL successfully breaks through the $194 resistance level, it could open the door for additional gains, with the next target being its all-time high of $209. A clear breach of this level may trigger a rally that may lead to the formation of new price highs, signaling continued bullish strength. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Push Past $164 Barrier, Momentum Signals More Gains However, if SOL fails to breach $194, there is a risk of a pullback toward lower support levels, such as $164 or $137, where buyers may step in to stabilize the price.

The 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF is highly volatile and risky due to its 2x leverage, high expense ratio, and futures contango, making it unsuitable for long-term holding. Short-term speculation with BITX is possible, but sophisticated investors should consider direct futures, while unsophisticated investors should consider simpler ETFs. Holding bitcoin and shorting BITX was profitable before bitcoin ETFs, but now this niche has dried up. I have written a couple of articles recently looking at Bitcoin ETFs, as I believe Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) to be very well positioned among the world of potential investments. Bitcoin has proven itself to be the highest-returning asset class time and again since its inception in 2009. By comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( SPY ) has returns that look like a drop in the bucket: Data by YCharts Even in a relatively quiet year for Bitcoin and a roaring one for SPY, Bitcoin smashes the index: Data by YCharts Investors looking for alpha would be remiss to avoid the single best-performing asset class for their portfolio. But past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Why would Bitcoin continue its ascent from here? Bitcoin and Money Fundamentally, my long-term case for Bitcoin remains the unstable nature of modern monetary policy. The US dollar emerged from the post-WWII Bretton Woods agreement as the sole global reserve currency, and has retained its status more recently through the tenuous petrodollar system. This dependence on the dollar has artificially strengthened its value, leading to ever-expanding trade and budget deficits that cannot continue indefinitely (known as Triffin's Dilemma ): Treasury.gov You might notice some spikes in spending around 2008 and 2020 in response to economic shocks, times when government spending can keep the economy afloat long enough for the private sector to regain its footing. But what about the steady climb from 2015 through today? How long can that kind of deficit expansion go on? The deficit has increased by approximately 416% since 2015, while revenue has only increased by about 14.4% (GDP 19.7%) in the same period, so the money is not being spent productively. The modern fiat system has only been around for about 50 years (post the demise of the Gold Standard ), and the dollar has lost almost 90% of its value since then. But whatever is bad for fiat systems, like deficits, inflation, and capital controls, is good for Bitcoin. It is reasonable to assume that as the world changes, so will its monetary policy, and that Bitcoin will be a larger part of the future than it has been in the past. To go along with this kind of hedging characteristic, Bitcoin's ever-important hash rate has continued to climb steadily: Data by YCharts That is another chart I would like to buy into! Institutional adoption continues to increase, and I believe that we are still in the early innings of Bitcoin's acceptance into more mainstream financial outlets. Leveraging Bitcoin Being bullish on the prospects of Bitcoin is one part of the story, but the question remains how to participate in further upside. January 10th of this year was a monumental moment for cryptocurrency when the SEC approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing investors to buy Bitcoin exposure with a few clicks of a button in the brokerage accounts they already owned. Buying these ETFs, holding Bitcoin in a private wallet, or holding on an exchange like Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) are all reasonable options. Some investors have been intrigued by the possibility of adding leverage to their Bitcoin holdings, for truly explosive results. One of the easiest and most straightforward ways to do this is to buy the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ) by Volatility Shares, which aims to double the return, both positive and negative, of Bitcoin. This sounds good, but in practice, it is not quite as straightforward as it seems. There are a few factors to keep in mind. Extreme Volatility First, Bitcoin is already extremely volatile, so amping up the volatility even further is extremely risky. Bitcoin is about 4 times as volatile as the S&P 500 ( SPY ): Data by YCharts Doubling that would mean something like 8 times the volatility of stocks, and that is unlikely to go well for very long. Bitcoin on its own has experienced a 75%+ drawdown on four separate occasions since 2010. A drawdown like that would almost surely wipe BITX out completely. Most leveraged products currently on the market have not been around long enough to fully evaluate their track record during stressful times, as markets have experienced a protracted bull run. One product that I know of, though, ProShares Ultra S&P500 ETF ( SSO ), which has been around since before 2008. It is only 2x leveraged to the S&P 500 (recall that BITX is equivalent to around 8x leverage on the S&P 500). While it did survive 2008, it did not catch back up to the unlevered index for almost a decade afterward. Wrong directional calls using leverage for only a short time can offset years of potential gains. Data by YCharts Price Decay Second, BITX targets twice the daily returns of Bitcoin. Over the long run, its performance will vary greatly, but generally, it will not be equal to 2x the return of Bitcoin. For example, since inception, during a strong 123% bull run for Bitcoin, BITX managed to just about match Bitcoin's return, with much greater risk: Data by YCharts That is a far cry from the over 200% gains we would want by doubling Bitcoin's performance in the period. Over time, the performance of BITX will correlate with the performance of Bitcoin, but it will slowly decay and underperform expectations. This is due to several factors. The simplest factor is the hefty 1.9% expense ratio that BITX charges to manage the ETF. Every year, then, BITX will lose almost 2% of its value from fees, compounding over time. The next simplest factor is pure volatility decay. BITX is designed to match 2x the daily return of Bitcoin. So, if Bitcoin goes down 5% one day and then up 5.5% the next, it will end up with about a 0.2% gain. It would be wonderful if BITX ended up with a 0.4% gain! But what actually happens is that BITX loses 10% and then gains 11%, which results in a slight loss. So even though Bitcoin is heading up, BITX is heading down. These are small moves, but compounded over time, they result in massive underperformance from BITX compared to what we would expect. Futures Contango This is the biggest factor to consider when investing in BITX, and evaluating its performance: BITX does not actually invest in Bitcoin at all, but in Bitcoin futures , a derivative of the actual price. These futures are almost always in contango, which means that later-dated futures are pricier than nearer-dated ones. Here are the latest quotes from CME: CME Group The important thing to notice is that later futures are more expensive than nearer ones. These are the costs of holding futures, which can be leveraged, rather than holding Bitcoin itself. The issue with BITX is that it tries to maintain exposure to near-month expirations as much as possible, holding the shortest-dated futures. Here are its current holdings , which are concentrated in the front month November futures, but are beginning to roll into December futures: Volatility Shares Presently, then, it is selling November futures for 76615 and buying December futures for 77435. Then it will sell those December futures and buy January ones for an even higher price. On and on this goes, selling the cheaper future and buying the more expensive one. Over time, this will erode value at a steady and significant pace. These are essentially locked-in and guaranteed losses for BITX. Speculation So far, BITX is not looking like a good long-term hold. It does not tend to meaningfully outperform holding Bitcoin itself, and has tremendous risk, including what I believe to be a rather likely risk of total loss if held long-term. There are two other possible uses for BITX, however. The first, what leveraged ETFs are generally known for, is short-term speculation. If an investor believes that Bitcoin will go up in a very short time frame, then BITX can be a way to speculate on this move. This is a very risky strategy, as it can go very wrong in a very short amount of time, and take longer than expected to recover. Bitcoin is volatile enough. Buying the coins may be enough to profit from a short-term rise in their price. If an investor is dead set on leveraging their bet, then buying futures directly is likely a better play, avoiding BITX's other negatives (expense ratio, rolling costs, and daily decay). This is what futures are designed for, but it requires a significant amount of capital and knowledge of futures markets, limiting the play to sophisticated investors. For unsophisticated investors, I cannot recommend such a complicated product as BITX, so sticking with Bitcoin ETFs is preferable. Cash and Carry Arbitrage Long-term, I believe Bitcoin itself is a better play than BITX. Short-term, I believe Bitcoin futures are a better play than BITX. But there is again another use case, a more interesting one. The mention of futures to anyone who has followed Bitcoin for a long time should bring up the thought of the cash and carry arbitrage trade. Recently, it could produce a largely risk-free return of 25%+, and even higher rates in past years. The theory is simple. Buy Bitcoin, and sell Bitcoin futures. In that case, contango works in your favor, and you profit from the difference in price between Bitcoin and the futures. It is a neutral strategy in that it does not matter if Bitcoin skyrockets or crashes, you only earn the spread between the spot price and the futures price of Bitcoin. Arbitrage opportunities are usually quickly taken advantage of and corrected in the markets. In this case, though, there are some issues that prevented correction. Bitcoin is expensive, and a futures contract at CME is worth five bitcoins. So that is over $300,000 in notional value to short a single Bitcoin futures contract. Then you would have to buy another $300,000 in Bitcoin to offset the contract. That is a lot of exposure for most investors to stomach in the crypto market. Larger institutional players were also prohibited from or simply avoided dabbling in the crypto world and buying digital currencies themselves. So this left a fairly small group of hedge funds and very wealthy individuals to profit from the cash and carry arbitrage trade in Bitcoin. And they did make massive profits. BITX's Role This is the landscape that BITX entered in 2023. Now, BITX cannot come out and say ""Short us!"" However, they include some very interesting information in their pamphlet on how BITX works (emphasis mine): Put simply, arbitragers and market makers can cost-effectively hedge their Bitcoin futures positions with spot Bitcoin. For example, arbitragers can buy $1 of Bitcoin for every $1 of futures sold - or in the case of BITX, buy $2 of Bitcoin for every $1 of BITX sold . This cash and carry arbitrage is very common in the futures markets and helps explain how liquid futures can track their underlying so closely. In some sense, then, the cash and carry trade is integral to why BITX exists in the first place. Instead of paying $300k to short a Bitcoin futures contract, a smaller investor (or ""arbitrager"") could short BITX shares for a few thousand and hold half as much Bitcoin to hedge against it. This opened up the cash and carry trade to a greater retail audience. While there were costs involved, the potential 25% risk-free upside was enough to make it worthwhile to attempt. Indeed, this trade would have returned 39% since July 2023, with only a 5% max drawdown: Portfolio Visualizer Keep in mind that in 2023 when BITX was created, an arbitrager would still have to hold their own bitcoins. That changed this year when spot Bitcoin ETFs were introduced. Current Landscape The trade is now much easier since you can hold a spot Bitcoin ETF like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) in the same account as a short position in BITX, and the margin requirements should be much smaller. This opened up the trade to institutions as well, and indeed the arbitrage opportunity is now much less prolific. MarketWatch reported back in June: While Bitcoin ETFs saw five consecutive weekly inflows as of the end of last week, there was also a record number of Bitcoin futures being shorted by hedge funds...The basis, or the price difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures, was in the range of 25% to 30% when Bitcoin ETFs were launched in January. However, the basis now stands in the range of 7% and 9%. With the basis between Bitcoin spot and futures prices narrowing, the carry trade may once again not make sense for smaller traders navigating high notional values, margin requirements, and borrowing costs on vehicles like BITX. The reward no longer justifies the costs. I do find it interesting that Volatility Shares mentioned shorting BITX in their very own description of how the fund works. I believe they may have had the idea of smaller traders using BITX as a way to short futures in a brokerage account on a smaller scale. Unfortunately, now that spot Bitcoin ETFs exist, the arbitrage opportunity is much smaller and may not be worth the costs. For my part, BITX can still be an intriguing play using options. Holding a Bitcoin ETF and selling naked short calls on BITX can be a way to profit from BITX's steady loss of value compared to Bitcoin. But this is not a true market-neutral position and is thus more of a hedge to existing Bitcoin holdings. Summary To sum up, BITX is a poor long-term hold due to extreme volatility, high expense ratio, daily volatility decay, and losses due to futures contango. There is a significant risk of losing one's entire investment in BITX. Holding Bitcoin is likely to outperform over the long run, though. In the very short term, it can be used to speculate on Bitcoin price movements. However, I believe that sophisticated investors can do this better by buying futures themselves, and unsophisticated investors should probably stay away from such a nuanced product as BITX. Bitcoin itself provides plenty of upside potential. Holding Bitcoin and shorting BITX was profitable before the arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs. It may no longer be worth the costs now that institutions have entered the arbitrage trade. It may be worth considering shorting calls on BITX to profit from BITX's downside. I am assigning a hold rating because BITX can be used in so many ways depending on one's view and desired outcome. It should be viewed as a tool more than an investment. But since I am bullish on Bitcoin itself, I cannot assign a pure sell rating here. It is worth noting that patient investors may wish to wait for options on Bitcoin ETFs to arrive, having already been approved by the SEC. These will provide even more opportunities to express directional opinions and apply leverage to Bitcoin's price movements. Distributions Astute investors may be curious about the stated 11.22% dividend yield on Seeking Alpha. This further complicates the investment. It is not itself an investment case. The dividend is largely a return on investors' original capital. For more information, I suggest reading the ""Tax Risk"" section of the summary prospectus . Basically, the fund can identify as an RIC and avoid paying taxes on its gains if it distributes them to shareholders. It is quite complicated. But the short answer is that by paying distributions of capital back to shareholders, the fund can avoid being taxed on its gains. So there is nothing magical or exciting about the income potential of the dividend, it is just capital gains being returned to investors that will be reflected by a corresponding decline in the share price of the ETF. Risks I hope the risks of this investment are sufficiently clear. On the long side, leveraged Bitcoin's extreme volatility means that investors in BITX could easily see their entire investment wiped out in a short period of time. Please review the risks of leveraged ETFs as explained in the linked SEC bulletin before placing any trades in this product. These risks include extreme volatility, time and volatility decay, and the real possibility of losing all of your investment. The normal risks can be exaggerated with single-asset ETFs such as this. Only experienced traders who fully understand the risks should trade them. This article further explains the important risks of such ETFs with examples. Increased contango in the Bitcoin futures market for any reason would significantly erode the value of BITX as it rolls its contracts from one expiration to the next. The high expense ratio and daily volatility decay all but guarantee that the fund will lose value over time. This is not suitable as a long-term investment. In the sponsor's own words : ""The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not actively monitor and manage their portfolio."" On the short side, the daily leverage in BITX can result in greater than 2x returns when compared with Bitcoin. So it is not a perfect hedge and can rise at a rate much faster than double that of Bitcoin in a strong bull market. As risky as this investment is to hold, it is also risky to short. The extreme volatility is present on the upside as well as the downside. Any protracted bull market or rapid rise in the price of Bitcoin could see BITX well outperforming the coins themselves. In the short term, BITX is a bet on those movements that may indeed pay off, even if the long-term picture for BITX is not positive.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734536-2x-bitcoin-strategy-etf-a-sophisticated-tool?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35882372.jpeg

42435182,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLR6j,1731015429,Detroiters Will Be Able to Pay Their Taxes in Crypto Next Year Using PayPal,"Detroiters will soon be able to pay their taxes and other city fees with crypto through PayPal, according to a Thursday announcement from Detroit’s Office of the Treasury.  The crypto payment option, which will be offered through a ""secure payment platform managed by PayPal,"" according to the release, is expected to go live in mid-2025. A spokesperson for the city told CoinDesk the city will only accept the cryptocurrencies supported by PayPal — bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin, and PayPal’s own stablecoin, PayPal USD — but all crypto payments will settle in USD.  Once Detroit officially begins accepting crypto payments, it will be the largest U.S. city to do so. Two other cities — Miami Lakes, Florida and Williston, South Dakota — already accept crypto payments for some city fees, utility payments, or taxes, as well as three states — Colorado, Utah and Louisiana. Each has partnered with a third party payment processor like PayPal or BitPay that converts crypto payments into U.S. dollars.  According to the city’s announcement, Detroit’s decision to allow crypto payments comes as part of a larger push to embrace new technologies to foster economic growth and encourage blockchain and technology companies to move to Detroit.  ""Detroit is building a technology-friendly environment that empowers residents and entrepreneurs,"" said Mayor Mike Duggan in a press statement. ""We are excited to be one of the first major U.S. cities to explore blockchains civic applications and allow residents to use their cryptocurrency as a payment option.""  In addition to announcing the new crypto payment option, Detroit is requesting crypto entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas for blockchain ""civic applications"" with a focus on ""enhancing transparency, improving data security and streamlining public services"" to the city’s first Director of Entrepreneurship and Economic Opportunity Justin Onwenu.  ""This announcement represents our openness to new ideas and dedication to positioning Detroit as a place for entrepreneurs and bold ideas to thrive,"" said Onwenu in the press statement. ""Blockchain technologies have the potential to drive greater accessibility, efficiency, transparency, and security and we’re excited to hear from entrepreneurs at the forefront of this work.""

42435181,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLRAx,1731013717,"Coinbase Brings Bitcoin to Solana, Spurring High Hopes for DeFi Surge","Coinbase introduced cbBTC, which brings bitcoin to the Solana blockchain.  Bitcoin helps power trading, lending and borrowing on centralized crypto exchanges, but this crucial functionality requires extra effort in DeFi.  Some hope Coinbase's move will spur more DeFi activity on Solana.  Nearly two years ago, FTX's collapse blew a bitcoin-sized hole in Solana-based decentralized finance that hadn't truly been filled — possibly until now.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} remains a benchmark asset for trading, lending and borrowing on centralized crypto exchanges. It takes extra effort to bring that crucial financial functionality to DeFi on other blockchains. Basically, someone must issue a token backed by and pegged to bitcoin on the chain.  Exchange giant Coinbase is trying to fill that role on Solana {{SOL}} with cbBTC. Launched Thursday, it lets traders swap in and out of the bitcoin-backed token by sending it between the exchange and their Solana wallets. That ease of entry and exit has contributors at many Solana-based protocols hopeful cbBTC can become a gold standard that ripples across the entire ecosystem.  One high-ranking official in Solanaland said there's ""much higher hopes"" Coinbase's cbBTC will be a hit — especially at a time when bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, is ripping to new all-time highs in the wake of Donald Trump's election.  Solana DeFi hasn't enjoyed a comparably straightforward bitcoin stand-in since the mysterious demise of the last standard-bearer, soBTC. That wrapped bitcoin token is widely believed to have been controlled by FTX. It died with the fraudulent exchange in November 2022.  SoBTC's failure left the chain's entire DeFi ecosystem without a widely recognized standard for trading bitcoin on Solana. This put it at a disadvantage to Ethereum DeFi, which has long had its own solution (including a new one from Coinbase itself) that Solana protocols accessed via bridging.  Coinbase's native issuance of cbBTC on Solana ""reduces the risk surface by half,"" said InfraRay, a contributor to popular Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium.  ""We could see a surge of BTC liquidity on-chain, which could increase usage"" in many different DeFi protocols, Tom said. ""It’s early, but the hope is that robust liquidity for cbBTC could get some of those flywheels going.""  That's only if Coinbase succeeds in turning cbBTC into Solana's standard stand-in for bitcoin. Other companies have failed at that effort. 21.co has less than $1.5 million worth of its 21BTC circulating in Solana DeFi. Threshold's tBTC hasn't done much better.  By comparison, Coinbase has nearly $10 million worth of cbBTC ready to deploy into Solana DeFi, according to blockchain data. An additional $500,000 of cbBTC is already sloshing around trading pools on Meteora and Orca and in a reserve on trading protocol Kamino.  ""I think and hope it’s gonna be big,"" said Kamino co-founder Marius Ciubotariu. ""There’s no reason for most BTC DeFi stuff to happen on Ethereum.""  Coinbase hasn't historically participated in Solana DeFi. CbBTC is its first token issued natively on the Solana blockchain. The exchange is much more involved in the Ethereum world, particularly via its own layer-2 network, Base.  ""Unlocking BTC utility for our customers across the on-chain economy is at the heart of our decision to launch cbBTC. Expanding support to Solana and potentially other chains gives our customers more options and aligns with our overall strategy of bringing billions of users on-chain,"" a company spokesperson said.  In September, Coinbase first rolled out cbBTC on Base and Ethereum with the promise of supporting more chains later. But cbBTC traders moving bitcoin to Base get a small leg up on those moving bitcoin to Solana.

35879354,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652019,1731011402,"Dogecoin Price Looking To Close Weekly Candle Above The Yellow Line, Why $10 Is Possible If This Happens","A crypto analyst has disclosed that the Dogecoin price may be positioning itself for a significant move upward as it approaches a critical weekly close. The question arises as to whether Dogecoin can close the weekly candle above the yellow line. With this line acting as a critical resistance level for the Dogecoin price, the analyst has predicted a breakout to $10 if Dogecoin can successfully close above it. Dogecoin Eyes $10 Breakout Above Key Level Crypto analyst Dima James Potts has shared a new Dogecoin price analysis via X (formerly Twitter), predicting that the number one meme coin could rise to $10, marking a historic all-time high. Based on technical patterns observed in past cycles, Potts disclosed that the Dogecoin weekly chart has often been used to decipher Dogecoin’s performance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Touches $75,000 ATH: Analyst Says This Is What You Should Expect Next He referred to the green and red lines on the Dogecoin weekly chart, highlighting that historically, when these lines cross a certain way, it tends to trigger a positive or “green” weekly performance for Dogecoin. Potts has revealed that the Dogecoin price movement is showcasing this same pattern in this current cycle, suggesting a potential for upward price momentum. Interestingly, this recurring pattern formation also involves a “Yellow Line,” which appears to act as a critical resistance level for Dogecoin. According to Potts, when Dogecoin can rise above this line on the weekly chart, it often leads to a parabolic upward move. With this in mind, the analyst has suggested that if Dogecoin closes the week above $0.18, it could confirm a breakout and the start of this historically occurring “parabolic move.” To further support his bullish Dogecoin price prediction, Potts shared Dogecoin’s previous performance when it closed above the yellow line. After crossing this level, The analyst revealed that Dogecoin surged by more than 8,373.35% during the first market cycle. Similarly, the meme coin skyrocketed by 18,376.25% in the second cycle. Given these past performance and technical indicators, Potts is confident that a similar trend could repeat for Dogecoin in this third cycle, with the potential for a more significant move towards the $10 target. Dogecoin Price Drops 8%, Can It Get To $10? Amidst the bullish forecast of a Dogecoin price rally to $10, the cryptocurrency has recently declined by more than 7.2%, experiencing volatility with the rapid shift in market conditions and sentiment. A rise to $10 would require Dogecoin to continue on a significant upward momentum, driven by optimistic market sentiment and certain bullish factors. Related Reading: This Crypto Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Rise To $75,000, Here’s The Full Prediction A few bullish factors have been driving the Dogecoin price towards higher levels. Excluding its strong community support and increased wallet addresses, the Dogecoin price has been rising steadily due to the influence of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) proposal. With Musk’s D.O.G.E set to gain endorsement from the 47th US President, Donald Trump, analysts believe that the influence could drive Dogecoin even higher than $10, hitting somewhere between $4 and $23 soon.

42435176,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLQpp,1731009486,Intense Competition — Not Technology — Will Fuel Blockchain's Rise to Dominance,"Finance is full of misconceptions. TradFi isn’t, for example, very centralized. The global banking system is incredibly decentralized, with all different kinds of national and regional authorities and entities tying it together.  Another myth is that old technology is costly and causing people to not have access to banking services. This isn’t true either. Often, high prices or low levels of access can be traced back to cumbersome regulations or a lack of competition. Mainframe transaction processing is cheap and efficient and those “legacy” mainframes are mostly just a few years old, even if the code they’re running contains elements written decades ago.  For these reasons, I have long believed that blockchains may struggle to replace credit cards, debit cards, and traditional bank accounts. Older technologies have the advantage of excellent performance, lower costs, and large installed user bases. However, what banking and traditional finance are missing, might be the extreme competition that is arriving from the blockchain sector.  In theory, blockchains should NEVER be more efficient than centralized systems for simple transaction processing like payments. A blockchain ends up copying payment data across many nodes while a centralized system processes the transaction just once. However, a similar kind of logic applies to telephone calls. The internet is just about the worst possible way to set up a telephone or video call. Packet networks without quality of service (aka the internet) are just plain unreliable. Voice over IP calls and video calls have much lower quality and are less reliable than traditional circuit-switched phone calls.  Despite the internet’s inherent drawbacks, it has come to dominate communications because it is cheap, widely available and internet communications services are intensely competitive.  The same factors may be starting to shape the future of finance. Blockchains may be, technically, less efficient than centralized transaction processing, but the intense competition and innovation are both driving down costs and adding features at a pace that legacy service providers do not seem to be able to match.  Blockchain transaction prices are already consistently below those of traditional banking providers. Blockchains like Solana, Aptos and multiple Ethereum Layer 2 networks are shaving costs per transaction to well below a penny. Internal research conducted at EY shows that, if we were able to move all of our own internal financial transactions on-chain, we could save more than $100 million annually.  So why aren’t companies and individuals moving their transactions on-chain, then? They are, but slowly. An entire ecosystem of financial services is emerging on-chain, including companies like Franklin that can handle payroll in both on-chain and off-chain environments, and at lower costs than traditional providers. The effects of inertia are even larger in the business space than with consumers, and blockchains still lack key features like robust levels of regulatory compliance, mature fraud prevention analytics, and importantly, privacy.  These gaps are not deal breakers; they are just speed bumps. I get pitched on one blockchain security solution a week and many smaller banks are eyeing deep integration with on-chain finance as a key differentiator. The programmability of blockchains means that missing features are easy to add, and Moore’s Law means that implementing those features gets cheaper every year.  For the traditional finance ecosystem, the coming decade is critical for shaping the finance sector of the next century. Banks should heed the fate of telecom giants prior to the explosion of the internet and mobile technologies; virtually none retained their original form or structure, even if some brand names still exist.  How much time? In the United States, the entire cycle of deregulation, monopoly break up, reconfiguration, and shift to internet and mobile took place over 20 years. Please set your timer.

Trump’s administration is likely to support cryptocurrencies, enhancing Bitcoin adoption and providing regulatory clarity, making IBIT a strong buy. Bitcoin's price surge post-election reflects market anticipation of Trump's crypto-friendly policies, including a national Bitcoin reserve and reduced regulatory pressure. Despite risks from rising treasury yields, I believe the Bitcoin bull market is here to stay. The cryptocurrency (and ETF) has strong upside from here. Investment Thesis Former President Donald Trump’s presidential election victory is a big development for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and in this case, specifically for the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Trump’s cryptocurrency policies, characterized by a slate of deregulatory proposals and a pronounced skepticism toward central bank-driven financial interventions, will fit Bitcoin's appeal as a decentralized, non-sovereign asset. Trump’s administration will likely lean toward a lighter regulatory stance on financial innovations, including cryptocurrencies, which will help benefit Bitcoin adoption within the US financial system. With Bitcoin hitting a record-high in the wake of his election win, I think the market is just starting to price-in these instrumental policy changes. Under his new administration, which is expected to support cryptocurrencies from a regulatory and monetary perspective, Bitcoin is in a strong position to benefit from regulatory clarity and a more accommodating government stance on digital assets. With Bitcoin facing strong upward pressure as the result of changing political winds, I believe shares of IBIT are a strong buy. Why I'm Doing Follow-Up Coverage To be clear, I previously covered IBIT and the potential effects of a Trump administration. In my last piece of analysis from over the summer, I highlighted how the strategic reserve proposal could impact Bitcoin prices and lead to IBIT benefiting as well. Trump’s win on Tuesday has set off a surge in Bitcoin’s price, driven by the expectation of favorable policies. Bitcoin quickly moved past $75,000 (to a record high). Other crypto-related stocks, such as Coinbase ( COIN ) and Robinhood (HOOD), have also moved higher this week as investors bet on reduced regulatory pressure and increased consumer access to crypto trading. SEC Chairmen Gensler's likely departure at the end of the Biden administration will finally remove a major obstacle in the US for the crypto industry. Many cryptocurrency analysts have viewed his leadership as hostile due to his enforcement-heavy strategy​. The purpose of me doing this follow-up coverage is to dive into the parts of his policy proposals that are now likely to come true in a Trump administration. What A Trump Win Does While Trump previously denounced Bitcoin as “not money” and “based on thin air,” Trump has fully acknowledged the value of the crypto sector during his 2024 campaign, where he has championed digital assets. He even accepted Bitcoin donations after declaring bold measures like creating a national Bitcoin reserve and defending Americans’ right to self-custody of digital assets. His goal was to win over key constituents that hold crypto across the nation's 7 swing states. I believe he succeeded. A big part of Trump’s crypto policy centers around promises he made during the BTC conference in Nashville in July that included keeping all of the BTC the US government currently holds. His goal is to stop the supply of additional tokens hitting the market for sale. Crypto investors also poured in millions of campaign funds, and were rewarded with the win of blockchain entrepreneur Republican Bernie Moreno in the Ohio Senate race. The Republicans also earned enough seats to win the majority of the Senate. In an interview before he was elected, Moreno announced his support of the crypto industry, having established his own company before: As you know, I started a blockchain company that was a commercial application of blockchain for car titles very familiar with crypto. I sold my bitcoins, I didn't want to have any nonsense from liberal reporters saying that I'm pro-crypto because of financial interests (by the way, that cost me a lot of money). I sold it last year, but here's the reality: if you went to a sporting event, threw a baseball out into the stadium, whoever caught that ball is more qualified to regulate crypto than Joe Biden or Sherrod Brown or Elizabeth Warren. We need people who understand the technology, know that it is essential to give them regulatory certainty so that this technology and future technologies get developed here in America, and these jobs and technology in America doesn't go overseas. And we're on the verge of that and the crypto community understands this election isn't an existential threat to their existence here in America. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan announced on X (formerly Twitter) that the industry is on its Golden Age following Trump’s Victory: We are entering the Golden Age of crypto. For the last four, and indeed the last eight years, crypto has been operating with one, or maybe two arms tied behind its back. It's faced aggressive persecution from the SEC, multiple lawsuits, and a regulatory cloud that kept mainstream out of crypto. That is going to be washed away my expectation in the first 100 days of the new administration, and we're going to get a fair, balanced plan, where we will see what crypto can do. That will mean stable coin legislation, it will be market clarity legislation, and most importantly, it will remove the cloud hanging over crypto and allow institutional investors to evaluate it for what it is. From my perspective, that's going to be more flows, and more adoption, and a strong bull market for years to come. CIO Hogan also added that he expects ETF demand to accelerate next year: We are already in a bull market prior to last night's election, with multiple significant catalysts pushing us towards all-time highs. We have record institutional investment into crypto. You can see that in the $23 billion of net flows into Bitcoin ETFs, by the way, I expect to accelerate in 2025. We had the effect of Bitcoin happening in April this year, reducing supply in the market. We have record fiscal deficits. U.S. debt is now $6 trillion, and adding a trillion dollars every 100 days -- and I don't expect that to slow down in the new administration. We have real world use cases emerging like stable coins, and prediction markets, and gaming, and we have blockchain technology improving at accelerating rate. I was already very bullish before last night's election; now I've been most bullish ever been. To review, we now have a potential strategic reserve on the way for Bitcoin, a much more favorable regulatory environment, and a cultural mandate that allows financial advisors to tell their clients to invest in Bitcoin ETFs (like IBIT) with confidence knowing these ETFs are legal, and the core asset is legitimate. The industry has never had this many tailwinds at once. Valuation In my previous analysis , I argued for a price target of $148,000 per BTC. The foundation of my analysis was based on the halving (back in April) that reduced daily supply by ½ and the support for a Bitcoin strategic reserve. In essence, the demand for Bitcoin will likely double between the increased investor demand and also the strategic reserve in the US. At the same time, daily supply has roughly decreased 50%. This creates upward pressure on the digital asset that is 4x stronger than it was at the beginning of the year before the ETF approval. With this, at the current price of approximately $43.40 /share for the Bitcoin ETF (and an underlying price of $75,000 per coin), achieving a target of $148,000 implies an upside of about 97.33% from here. Bitcoin is facing upward pressure that is 4x higher than it was earlier this year. I think a roughly 2x in price for a 4x increase in upward pressure on the cryptocurrency is reasonable. Risks Post election, Bitcoin’s main risk is actually the rise in US Treasury yields, which have recently hit three-month highs. Rising yields, driven by stronger-than-expected economic data, indicate investors want to earn more on their invested capital, which could weigh on riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Higher 10 year yields make traditional investments like bonds more attractive, drawing capital away from speculative assets such as Bitcoin. For Bitcoin, there is a concrete history of higher rates negatively impacting the coin, as rising rates increase borrowing costs and reduce liquidity in the market. During the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes from 2022 through mid-2023, Bitcoin fell over 75% from its highs at one point on the back of reduced risk appetite from investors who favored safer assets like bonds​. In this case, while the cryptocurrency has seen a historical negative correlation with treasury yields, I expect this correlation to break post-election. Here’s why: in August, Trump promised that he will lower interest rates to reduce borrowing costs and make capital more accessible. This week (specifically today as of the time of this writing) the Federal Reserve is planning to cut rates another 25bps which will help keep treasury yields lower. Adding to this (and what will break the correlation), I believe these new sources of demand both from retail and from the US government will be buying Bitcoin irrespective of treasury yields. The vast majority of the investor community still does not own Bitcoin as an asset class in their portfolio. There is a value in diversification, and I think investors will pursue this irrespective of where treasury yields are at. Bottom Line With former President Trump’s win this week, Bitcoin’s appeal as an asset, (and also ETFs like IBIT) is set to see a fundamental transformation in its market perception. His administration is expected to promote a crypto-friendly environment, removing many of the regulatory hurdles under SEC Chair Gary Gensler to better make Bitcoin a more appealing asset class compared to fiat currency-based options right now. Adding to this, Trump’s policy proposals (including establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve) are going to legitimize Bitcoin to millions of Americans who don’t have the asset in their portfolios right now. With Bitcoin-related ETFs like IBIT in place, Trump’s proposed policies will likely offer a huge upside as crypto adoption increases and market receptance grows. I think the coin (and the ETF as well) could nearly double from here. The political shift resulting from Tuesday’s election is a game changer now that it's happened. With this, I believe shares of IBIT remain a strong buy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734456-ibit-what-a-trump-win-does-for-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35914323.jpeg

Newton will allow for wallet solutions to plug into the AggLayer, which is a Polygon-backed effort to connect affiliated chains and allow tokens to freely move between them. Magic Labs claims its the first dedicated network for wallet solutions and chain unification.  Newton, which is still in a private testnet, is supposed to enable liquidity sharing across multiple blockchains plugged into the AggLayer.  The AggLayer is one of Polygon’s latest innovations, aimed at unifying liquidity and fragmentation across various blockchains. Blockchains that are not built with Polygon’s technology also have the option to plug into the AggLayer to gain access to other networks in Polygon’s ecosystem.  Since the Polygon team announced the AggLayer in January 2024, all sorts of projects have shared plans to integrate with AggLayer, like Move developer Movement Labs and blockchain interoperability project Union Labs. Now Magic Labs is following suit.  “Chain unification is inevitable — like ACH or SWIFT for crypto,” said Sean Li, CEO of Magic Labs, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “Developers can build user experiences that eliminate barriers. Users should only care about transaction cost and speed, not the chain. Eliminating UX barriers will unlock the best use cases.”  Memorably, Magic Labs was one of the first users of magic links in Web3, a passwordless sign-in method that numerous crypto wallet providers have embraced. In February 2023, crypto wallet startup Dfns found a critical vulnerability in magic links, which Magic Labs patched and resolved quickly thereafter.

Importantly, the technique would not require changes to Bitcoin's main underlying code, a notoriously fraught process where consensus is typically seen as the threshold required to greenlight major upgrades known as a ""soft fork.""  The announcement was detailed on Thursday in a research paper titled, ""ColliderScript: Covenants in Bitcoin via 160-bit hash collisions.""  The publication comes as Bitcoin, the oldest and largest blockchain, has attracted hordes of developers trying to add programmability and additional network layers that could lead to not only more applications being built atop the peer-to-peer network but also faster and cheaper venues for transaction execution. The goal is to catch up to what Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, has achieved — but with Bitcoin's famously robust security.  'Pretty awesome idea'  The team was led by Ethan Heilman, who separately is one of the authors of a proposed technique known as OP_CAT that could increase Bitcoin's programmability.  However, that effort would require changes to the Bitcoin software, as would a separate proposal for covenants known as OP_CTV, proposed by the developer Jeremy Rubin.  Other authors of the new research paper include Victor Kobolov and Avihu Levy of the StarkWare project and Andrew Poelstra, a longtime Bitcoin developer who currently serves as head of research at Blockstream.  StarkWare's official account on X posted a link to the paper on Thursday, writing:  Until recently, it was believed that implementing covenants on Bitcoin would require a soft fork of an additional opcode, such as dedicated ones like OP_CTV or indirect ones like OP_CAT. In this paper, we show that covenants may already be feasible on Bitcoin today without any soft fork. While our solution is computationally intensive, we believe there’s significant room for optimization.  Robin Linus, a Bitcoin developer who has made waves for a project known as BitVM and more recently BitVM2 that could unlock greater programmability, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that the research paper was ""not really practical"" in its current form but represented a ""pretty awesome idea.""

According to Binance rerport, the rise of memecoins coincides with the expansion of the world’s money supply. As money and capital become readily accessible, risk-on investments like Bitcoin, altcoins, and memecoins become attractive options. Related Reading: Solana Rockets Past BNB To Claim Coveted 4th Spot In Crypto Ranks Although memecoins promise a strong upside, they are also a high-risk investment since they’re highly speculative and have few use cases. However, their recent performance seems to defy the odds—their market cap was up by 22% immediately after the US election. Doge and PEPE coins are two of the top gainers among coins this Wednesday, adding 15% and 11% to their values, respectively. Binance Research: 75% Of All Memecoins Were Launched Last Year According to a November 2024 Binance research, meme currencies are growing in popularity because people are now looking at risk-on investments. The report adds that the global money supply is expanding, and many retail investors are looking at alternative ways to generate wealth. This niche’s market value has tripled since 2022, thanks to these coins’ popularity. Binance’s report also mentioned the regulator’s distrust of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). With this order, developers will now consider private venture capital funding (VCs) to promote their projects. Experts call this the “Low Float and High FDV” approach, meaning only a few tokens are available for trading but boast a higher valuation. Memecoins Remain An Accessible Investment Option While the approach benefits developers and early adopters, it may put regular investors at risk. As such, many retail investors look for memes as alternative investment options. These are the primary reasons why meme tokens are popular and highly accessible to all. Binance adds that roughly 75% of all meme currencies were launched last year. The Binance team acknowledged that many found launching these projects easy, but sustaining their operations is challenging. According to the same report, around 97% of all memecoins have died, and the rest struggle but managed to ride on the election hype this year.

Ether outperformed by rising 8% in the last 24 hours ahead of Federal Reserve policymakers' meeting.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} just made a new all-time high, continuing its powerful advance following Donald Trump's election victory.  The top cryptocurrency is currently up 2.3% in the last 24 hours and trading for $76,600, buoyed by former President Trump's win, as well as market expectations that the Federal Reserve will announce a 0.25% federal interest rate cut after Thursday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.  It's been less than a day since bitcoin notched its last all-time high of $76,480 — a price that broke a seven-month-old record.  It's not the only coin doing well. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, exchange tokens and memecoins — is up 4.3% in the last 24 hours. Surprisingly, Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} has proved to be one of the index's best performers.

35905308,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100811,1731004900,"For The Travel Industry, Web3 Says “Out With The Old, In With The New”","When it comes to certain things in life, the old version can be a pure classic. An espresso from a traditional machine vs. some plastic capsule device. The unchanged beauty of a European city center vs. a suburban string of mini-malls. The view from a mountain peak vs. the cheap imitation from a VR headset.However, we can’t always look to the past, and what is old is not always considered “classic.” Sometimes the old version is there simply because it is waiting for something better to come along and replace it. Sometimes the new really is better, faster, cleaner, more enjoyable. Sometimes it’s okay to throw out the “old” to make room for the “new.”The trick, as with all things, is to know when . Some things are better left untouched because they are classic. Others aren’t broken, and maybe don’t need to be fixed. But in the world of travel, especially with traveling the world, there are plenty of aspects in sore need of improvement. We’ve experienced a massive change in everyday life the last few decades, with the internet, social media, and advanced logistics making life more interconnected and simplified. However, this can’t always be said of global travel. With the extra barriers of geographical borders, political systems and their laws, currencies, cultures, and overall technology levels, this same desire to integrate has been left wanting, and many travel services are still behind the standard practices of other industries (especially those more focused in a particular country or region).Web3, with its interesting elements and benefits, may be exactly what the travel industry has been waiting for. After all, Web3 is especially focused on decentralization, borderless currencies, trustless/smart contracts, and tokenization of products, services, and even Real World Assets (RWAs). These are all areas where the travel industry has suffered from global complexity the most, and there is an especially interesting opportunity to apply Web3 throughout the travel industry that can throw out the old practices and usher in the new. Let’s look at some examples of where Web3 is already working to help transform the travel industry. At the forefront of this effort is the Web3 travel organization Camino Network ; however, a transformation this large will take many Web3 partners to fully transform our current global travel system. Booking/SchedulingBeing able to lock down a particular event, service, or product can still be difficult to do from afar. While common elements like making hotel reservations have become much easier, the ability to use a Web3 booking app can allow a smart contract to interact with future guests and ensure that reservations are accurate, logged, and without issue. Customers are able to see their reservation on-chain, and perhaps hold an NFT or other type of token as proof of reservation. This can also lead to interesting opportunities for secondary market sales where allowed, ensuring that hotel cancellations do not end in a forfeiture but could be resold to another guest.An example of this in action is Sleap , a Web3 platform that takes the basic hotel booking model and incorporates a Web3 layer. Users can search for hotels in a given area, and while they can pay using a standard credit card, there are major discounts offered once a Web3 wallet is added to the platform and is used to schedule the stay. In addition, the platform has its own NFT collection of highlighted destinations, with each NFT offering various travel rewards for the holder.This same concept of booking and scheduling could be used to span into ride-sharing apps, replacing the traditional taxi experience. Depending on the location around the world, transportation can be problematic, with dubious taxi companies operating, long taxi queues, and the ability to book in advance. Tour booking shares this opportunity, with the added bonus of an interactive app that can provide updates and information beneficial to those on the tour.The ability to prove that you have reserved something is very important, especially when in a foreign country where you are more vulnerable to scams and want to be sure that you are getting what you pay for. Elements like paper tickets for events are quickly replaced by not just eTickets, but NFTs. As eTickets can still be scams, it takes something on-chain to show that a ticket is legitimate. Likewise, travel elements such as travel insurance can be purchased and proven through an NFT format, creating an on-chain representation of your contract and service.PayingClosely linked to scheduling and booking things is actually paying for them. With the taxi example above, being able to pay through Web3 tokens could be tremendously helpful in some regions, as there are limitations on the ability to use a standard western credit card as payment. Using tokenization can help greatly with this, keeping the currency borderless.If you are paying with a borderless currency, it also solves two other key issues. First, a borderless currency doesn’t have to be converted upon payment, so the transaction is much simpler. Second, removing the need to trade out currency beforehand or during the transaction is helpful because it eliminates the harsh exchange fees and poor rates received when converting currency, saving you money very quickly. As mentioned above, the Camino Network is involved heavily in this along with reservations and does so by partnering with a growing number of travel companies globally.On top of saving you money, the ability to simply pay with crypto instead of with cash would make a travel experience much smoother and easier, especially if the travel takes you to multiple countries with different currencies. The “new” in this case saves time, money, and effort; it’s hard to want to go back to the “old” with this many benefits.ExploringFinally, there is simply the traveling aspect of exploring. Web3 can continue to take the concepts described above and apply them to many different use cases that the average traveler would encounter. It could be as simple as sending an NFT postcard instead of mailing a physical postcard. It could be a dynamic travel agency that has booked your initial trip but can expand the trip in real time as you see new things on your travels, the app shares locations and trends with the Web3 smart contract, and the contract offers up new experiences for you to potentially enjoy.As a last example, the element of rewards is especially transformative with Web3.

42415562,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJzi0,1731004556,Here's How Quickly Gary Gensler Could Lose His SEC Chair Gig Under Trump,"One of President-elect Donald Trump's many promises — to fire Gary Gensler and appoint a new chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission — could happen as soon as Jan. 20, the day of his inauguration.  Gensler, for example, took office less than 11 weeks after being appointed by President Joe Biden on Feb. 3, 2021.  Gensler could also step down before Trump takes office, in which case the Democratic Party would appoint an interim chair.  U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's many endorsements from crypto leaders — the Winklevoss twins, Marc Andreessen and Ryan Selkis, just to name a few — were the result of the real-estate mogul's many promises to support the expansion and continued development of the digital asset industry in the United States.  Arguably one of the most crucial promises Trump made to pull the crypto community onto his side was this: ""On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler.""  While he can't force Gensler to step down as a commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he can name a new interim SEC chair as soon as he's inaugurated on Jan. 20. He can also nominate a new commissioner to the Senate, which has to confirm the pick.  Given Republicans have retaken control of the Senate after flipping several seats during Tuesday's presidential election, Trump's pick would have a good chance of making it through the vote and a new chair could take office within a few months.  Gensler, for example, was nominated by current President Joe Biden on Feb. 3, 2021, confirmed by the Senate on April 14 and sworn into office on April 17.  Gensler has made many enemies in the crypto sector due to his insistence that the agency has sufficient rules and regulations for the industry already, a status quo crypto leaders disagree with. One of the most fundamental differences is Gensler's insistence — one he shared with his predecessor, the Trump-appointed Jay Clayton — that most cryptocurrency transactions on centralized exchanges violate federal securities laws.  Excluding this year's launch of the spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds, which were approved by the current SEC after years of conversations and a legal victory by asset manager Grayscale, the financial regulator hasn't done much to help stir crypto companies in the right direction of what is legal and illegal, as it has yet to be determined whether all cryptos are securities or not.  Gensler has been on the forefront of those actions, being openly skeptical of cryptocurrencies. Just last month, he reiterated his views haven't changed. Speaking at NYU's School of Law in Manhattan in October, he said: ""With all respect, the leading lights of this field in 202[4] are either in jail or awaiting extradition right now.""  Read more: SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Crypto: 'It's Unlikely This Stuff Is Gonna Be a Currency'  Knowing Trump's plan for him, Gensler could also choose to resign before the new President takes office in January. If that were to happen, an interim chair would be appointed by President Joe Biden from the remaining Democratic commissioners until Trump is inaugurated, before Trump names his interim after taking office.  Whoever Trump nominates would probably replace Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who is currently up for renomination. If Gensler resigns from the commission entirely, he'll also need to be replaced through the nomination and confirmation process.

42415553,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJzcy,1731004387,"We’ve Been Thinking About Blockchains Wrong. They’re About Time, Not Money","Blockchain technology has momentum. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have catalyzed mainstream entry into the crypto investment space. Meanwhile, DeFi and other decentralized projects continue to grow their users and assets. Regulators in many jurisdictions appear to be looking for ways to work with the technology, rather than against it. This all boils down to an unprecedented moment of opportunity for those developing projects based on blockchain technology.  We’re at risk of squandering it.  The blockchain community has always been marked by a kind of “wait till next year” optimism. We thought once Ethereum moved to proof-of-stake, in 2022, we would solve the scalability problem and open the door to widespread adoption. Similarly, there is an assumption that once the regulatory situation is clearer, institutions will come into the space en-masse. Then the bright, decentralized future will finally arrive.  But it won’t – not on the industry’s current path. Just as communism collapsed because it never delivered its promised utopia, so will crypto if the community doesn’t change its thinking.  This would be a tragedy.  Blockchains are technical marvels. But the current state of blockchain development is equivalent to giving the world the iPhone with only the Notes app. Or perhaps more aptly, only equipped with a few betting apps that are maddening to use but potentially highly lucrative. It’s no wonder we haven’t won over regulators or the broader public.  Two things are holding blockchains back from achieving their potential. One is a perception: most people outside the crypto space still believe the technology is purely about digital money and derivative financial platforms: essentially bitcoin, dogecoin, and the exchanges where they trade.  This perception is driven by the second obstacle, which is substantive: blockchain projects have focused too heavily on financialization. This has led not only to a vast underutilization of the capabilities of the tech, but also to an insider-first, semi-closed ecosystem in which small groups of people design, develop, and use these platforms.  Blockchain technology is touted as tearing down gatekeepers and extending the benefits of finance to all. So it is the height of irony that it should come to be dominated by an even smaller and more impenetrable group of elites than the legacy finance and government structures it seeks to replace.  What are blockchains for?  The key to slashing this Gordian Knot is to rediscover what blockchains are really about: not money, but time.  A blockchain is, fundamentally, a clock. It records when transactions take place in a transparent and untamperable way. This is the key to its potential: in a world of declining trust, this blockchain clock can serve as a universal source of reality.  Every transaction in blockchains carries within it the answer: who did what, when and why. It is something that is provably true and does not require a person to trust the bearer of the information. Time waits for no one. It does not ask for trust, and it goes on whether we trust it or not. Time is the ultimate trustless key to our lives, and so, as clocks, are blockchains.  That is its transformational power. There is almost no limit to the things we can build if we understand what blockchains are really for. We can build systems that can offer advantages over legacy infrastructure developed before the invention of jet-powered aircraft. We can deliver a world that is fairer, faster, and more lucrative.  But, today, outside of a few financial products, we don’t. True, there are crypto projects that allow people around the world to overcome runaway inflation or political repression. These stories should be celebrated and supported, but they remain edge cases. For the most part, blockchains today are the foundations of an arcane, semi-exclusive universe of financial products where those in the know seek outsize returns on their capital.  It’s time – pun intended – to reclaim the true purpose of the blockchain. That will require all of us – developers, founders, VCs, evangelists – to rediscover the original ethos behind decentralized infrastructure. It will require us to remember that blockchains are really about time, not money.  It’s time to build products that matter  With this understanding, the industry can start to deliver essential products for real people. After all, the thing that truly holds crypto back isn’t the SEC. It’s not internecine squabbles between different factions of Ethereans. It’s the simple fact that crypto remains irrelevant to most people.  If the government tried to ban e-commerce sites like Amazon, there would be an outcry. People from schoolchildren to grandparents would oppose such a move because it would make their lives materially worse. When governments attempt to block social media platforms like X and TikTok, they face severe backlash from the millions upon millions of people who use those services. Public support is strong for these platforms even when they arguably facilitate harmful activities.  But crypto? No one really cares. Crypto’s main defenders are those funding, building, and benefiting from its complex financial platforms. But these entrepreneurs and investors have primarily succeeded in driving two things: market cap and public skepticism. Not only would most ordinary people not care if crypto disappeared; they wouldn’t even notice.  This is a dire state of affairs, and the reason for it is simple. We’ve forgotten why we believed in decentralized technology in the first place, and gone down a path of financial opportunism and insiderism.  The good news is it’s not too late. We need to look past the allure of financialization and remember that blockchains, as universal timekeepers, can do so much more. The possibilities are almost unlimited. We can enable strangers on different continents to share information and ideas securely, transparently, trustlessly. We can use our favorite apps that have become essential to our lives – but without the anxiety that we might be tracked and listened to. We can chat with strangers on the Internet and enjoy online news with full certainty that it is humans and not bots that we are interacting with. We can rethink money, supply chains, auctions, transportation, corporate voting, and almost everything else. We can make sure promises are kept. We can make blockchains truly indispensable for people around the world.

35871300,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652047,1731000600,Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance – Top Analyst Sets $300 Target,"Solana has finally broken through a crucial resistance level that has kept the price subdued for months, sparking fresh optimism among investors. However, the breakout has yet to be confirmed, leaving room for excitement and caution. Prominent analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on Solana, highlighting that the cryptocurrency is on the verge of breaking out from a massive bullish pattern. According to Runefelt, if the breakout holds, this setup can propel SOL toward a $300 target in the coming months. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sets $3,400 Target Once ETH Breaks Key Resistance – Details The days ahead will be critical for SOL as market sentiment and trading volume determine whether this push is a sustained rally or a bull trap. For Solana to confirm this breakout, it must maintain its upward momentum and establish support above the previous resistance. Investors are closely watching these levels, as a failure to hold could lead to a retracement. However, if SOL can solidify its position, it could begin a powerful rally toward new highs. The outcome will shape Solana’s trajectory as it attempts to secure a place among the top-performing assets in the crypto market. Solana Testing Crucial Supply Solana is currently testing a critical supply level, a zone that will either drive SOL to new highs or send it back into consolidation. After pushing above the $185 mark—a key price level that now needs to hold as support—Solana is poised for a significant move. According to top analyst Carl Runefelt, who shared his technical analysis on X, Solana appears to be breaking out from a massive Symmetrical Triangle, a well-known bullish chart pattern. In his view, a confirmed breakout above this level could trigger a rapid surge to $300, a move that he believes would “destroy bears” and reinvigorate bullish sentiment. However, the coming days will be crucial in determining Solana’s direction, especially as the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision is set to be announced today. If the Fed signals a rate cut or maintains current rates, it could fuel the rally by boosting risk-on sentiment in the market. A favorable environment from the Fed could lead to increased buying pressure on SOL, pushing it beyond its recent highs. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Short Liquidations Send BTC Above ATH – Trump Win Sets A Bullish Environment Conversely, if the $185 level fails to hold, SOL might re-enter a consolidation phase, temporarily stalling the upward momentum. For now, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve’s decision and how it might impact broader market sentiment, which will play a critical role in determining whether Solana’s bullish trajectory continues. A successful breakout here would not only confirm strength but could set the stage for Solana to challenge $300 in the coming months. SOL Technical Analysis Solana is currently testing the final resistance at $190, a crucial level that could pave the way for a challenge to its yearly highs around $210. For the bullish momentum to remain intact, SOL needs to break above and hold this level as support. However, achieving this may take several days as the market continues to digest the impact of Donald Trump’s victory and awaits the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates. If SOL fails to break above the $190 resistance, a consolidation phase between $180 and $190 could be healthy for price action. This range would allow the market to reassess and stabilize before making another attempt at breaking higher. However, it’s important that the price remains above the $180 mark during this consolidation. If SOL holds above this level, the uptrend can continue, with a potential push toward yearly highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Shares Correlation With S&P500 – Last Dip Before It Hits $10,000? On the other hand, if the price drops below $180, it could signal a shift in momentum, putting the current uptrend at risk. For now, bulls must maintain control by keeping SOL above $180 while the broader market awaits the Fed’s decision, which could impact risk sentiment and Solana’s next move.

A French national made global headlines this month by placing large and ultimately successful bets on Polymarket that Donald Trump would win the U.S. election.  French gambling regulator Autorite Nationale des Jeux, also known as the National Gambling Authority (ANJ), said on Thursday it is examining the operations of Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market, which logged record betting volumes on the recent U.S. presidential election.  ""We are aware of this site and are currently examining its operation and compliance with French gambling legislation,"" a spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""We will come back to you shortly to inform you of the outcome.""  French-language crypto news outlet The Big Whale reported on Wednesday that ANJ, which regulates licensed gambling platforms, is expected to ban access to the site soon.  ""Even if Polymarket uses cryptocurrencies in its operations, it remains a betting activity and this is not legal in France,"" an unnamed source close to the ANJ told the news site.  The scrutiny comes after a French national, known only by his first name, Theo, profited handsomely on Polymarket by placing large, and ultimately correct, bets that Donald Trump would win the U.S. presidential election, despite polls that indicated the contest with Kamala Harris would be a toss-up. According to the Wall Street Journal, Theo is set to make $50 million on his trades.  Polymarket allows traders to buy and sell shares representing future outcomes. Each share pays out $1 in the USDC stablecoin if the prediction comes true, and zero if it doesn't, so the prices, expressed in cents on the dollar, represent the odds the market is giving each outcome.  The New York-based platform is not accessible to Americans and relies on a global audience. It has been blocking U.S. IP addresses under a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which said it was operating without the appropriate licensing.  Polymarket declined to comment.  Proponents of prediction markets argue they have positive spillover effects by offering the public a better forecasting method than polls or punditry because participants are putting money on the line and thus have a motivation to do deep research and bet on what they believe will happen, not what they want to happen.  But election betting is controversial in many countries.

35867282,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652023,1730995246,How High Can Bitcoin Go In 2025? Legendary Trader Reveals,"Legendary trader Peter Brandt, with nearly five decades of experience in trading since 1975, has shared a bullish forecast for the Bitcoin price trajectory in 2025. Taking to X, Brandt stated: “Bitcoin $BTC is now in the sweet spot of the bull market halving cycle that should top in the $130k to $150K range next Aug/Sep. I measure cycles differently than most.” How High Can Bitcoin Go In 2025? Brandt’s analysis is rooted in the historical patterns observed in Bitcoin’s halving cycles. His chart, covering Bitcoin’s price action from early 2022 with projections into 2026, highlights two significant periods of 518 days each. These periods represent critical phases in Bitcoin’s market behavior, representing the cyclical nature of its price movements. A notable technical pattern identified in his chart is the breakout from a broadening wedge. This formation, characterized by diverging support and resistance lines, suggests increasing market volatility as prices make progressively higher highs and lower lows. The successful breakout from this pattern is considered a strong bullish signal. Related Reading: CNBC Projects Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 Before Presidential Inauguration – Details In a detailed blog post from June titled “The Beautiful Symmetry of Past Bitcoin Bull Market Cycles,” Brandt elaborated on the significance of halving events. He observed that the halving dates have “represented the half-way points of past bull market cycles,” showing an almost perfect symmetry within these cycles. Specifically, the number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle to the halving dates has been nearly equal to the number of weeks from the halving dates to the subsequent bull market highs. Based on this symmetrical pattern, Brandt posits that if the sequence continues, “the next bull market cycle high should occur in late Aug/early Sep 2025.” He suggests that the highs of past bull markets align well with an inverted parabolic curve, and if this tendency persists, “the high of this bull market cycle could be in the $130,000 to $150,000 range.” Related Reading: Economist Predicts ‘Blow-Off Top’ For Bitcoin At $123,000 Post-Trump Win Despite his optimistic projection, Brandt maintains a cautious stance. He emphasizes that “no method of analysis is fool-proof” and admits to avoiding being “dogmatic about any idea.” While this view is his preferred analysis, he acknowledges it is not his only interpretation. Brandt notes that he continues to place a 25% probability that Bitcoin’s price has already topped for this cycle. Should Bitcoin fail to make a decisive new all-time high and decline below $55,000, he would raise the probability of an “Exponential Decay.” The crypto community has been actively engaging with Brandt’s analysis. Popular crypto analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) responded on X, agreeing with Brandt’s top estimation and highlighting the importance of accurately calling the market top. Astronomer remarked: “I think you’re spot on with that top estimation Peter! As for calling the bottom, now it is our duty to call the top ideally in one single try. The terminal price does that very well. I have 6 other metrics in place. If they all line up, it is a sell. Location at $160,000.” In a further exchange, an X user inquired about the implications for the Bitcoin to gold (BTC/GLD) ratio, suggesting it might imply a much higher price. Brandt responded, “Eventually, yes. But let’s take one step at a time without become too dogmatic.” At press time, BTC traded at $74,940.

In today’s issue, Jason Leibowitz from Hashnote looks at Trump’s policies, how they could impact the crypto industry and how the market is already responding to the results.  Then, Roshan Dharia, CEO of Paxful, answers questions about crypto and the regulatory environment in Ask an Expert.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Election Aftershock: How Crypto Markets Priced in Trump’s Victory  On election night, Nov. 5, bitcoin surged to an all-time high, breaking past $75,000 as Trump claimed victory. With a Republican sweep across Congress, this outcome is seen by the crypto community as the most favorable result for digital assets. Trump’s vocal support for crypto, along with his criticism of the SEC’s restrictive stance, has fueled expectations for a regulatory landscape that encourages innovation and growth. The market’s swift reaction, even before the race was called, underscores crypto’s role as a 24/7 barometer of major events.  Source: TradingView  Historic Gains and Regulatory Shifts  As election results rolled in, bitcoin soared on expectations of regulatory clarity and a more supportive environment under a Trump administration. Trump, who has been vocal about fostering innovation and critical of S.E.C. Chair Gary Gensler’s handling of crypto regulation, is anticipated to bring long-awaited clarity to digital asset policy.  This surge reflects growing institutional confidence. With a valuation nearing $2.5 trillion - boosted by bitcoin and ether ETFs this year — crypto is rapidly becoming a core institutional allocation. Its deep liquidity and around-the-clock trading uniquely position crypto as an immediate gauge of global sentiment, exemplified on election night.  Polymarket’s Predictive Power  Blockchain-based prediction markets like Polymarket introduced a new level of accuracy to election forecasting, often outpacing traditional polls. Polymarket’s odds consistently leaned in favor of Trump, offering an early and sharper gauge of public sentiment. By election night, as Trump led in electoral votes, Polymarket’s odds of his victory reached 90% — even before he crossed the critical 200-vote threshold on his way to the required 270.  With over $3.2 billion wagered on the election outcome, Polymarket played a pivotal role in high-stakes prediction. Its user-backed odds proved exceptionally reliable, underscoring the potential of decentralized prediction markets as powerful, and perhaps even superior, tools in event forecasting.  Source: Protos  Source: Polymarket  As is evident from the Polymarket chart above, President Trump’s victory was priced in, hours before it was official.  Crypto as a Real-Time Market Indicator  This election isn’t the first time crypto markets have responded sharply to political developments. After a failed assassination attempt on Trump on July 13, bitcoin rallied over 12% that weekend — while traditional markets remained closed. This price surge reflected market confidence in Trump’s resilience, strengthening his candidacy among investors and voters alike.  Bitcoin’s reactions during pivotal moments illustrate crypto’s unique role as a real-time indicator. Unlike traditional assets, crypto trades continuously capture and reflect global shifts instantly. The election night rally exemplifies how crypto acts as a rapid-response gauge for unfolding events.  A New Era for DeFi  With regulatory reform anticipated, the convergence of TradFi and DeFi is now underway. Bitcoin, often referred to as “digital gold,” has historically held its place as a non-income-producing store of value, similar to physical gold. However, because of its digital nature, bitcoin has broken free from the limitations of a traditional store of value. Advanced strategies like staking, wrapping, and innovative twists on digital options vaults have transformed Bitcoin from a passive, buy-and-hold asset into one capable of generating yield.  These yield-enhancing strategies bring a new dimension to bitcoin, offering income streams and greater return potential—an evolution unimaginable with traditional gold. This maturation of yield-generating mechanisms marks a significant shift, encouraging new capital inflows and fueling further innovation in digital assets for both institutional and retail investors.  - Jason Leibowitz, head of private wealth, Hashnote  Ask an Expert  Q. What do you make of the heated U.S. presidential election season, looking at it from a crypto veteran’s perspective?  It took crypto almost a decade and a half to feature in serious political and, more importantly, policy-level conversations. All that ""Wild West,"" ""magic internet money"" stuff is in the past.  Many politicians who leveled baseless allegations against crypto are now some of its strongest proponents and allies.  Donald Trump, for instance, has come a long way from not being a “fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” to advising folks at Bitcoin Nashville to “never sell” their bitcoin.  The Democrats and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, also signaled a more open-minded stance on crypto, moving away from the Biden administration’s combative regulatory approach towards the industry.  At the same time, Fairshake PAC, Coinbureau and other Web3 lobbying organizations have become politically influential and extraordinarily well-funded with time and are now claiming to speak for an estimated 50-90 million U.S.-based cryptocurrency holders.  All this is great for short-term adoption, and with consumer interest and trust in digital assets continuing to grow, we expect candidates and, eventually, regulators to move the U.S. towards a gradually more crypto-friendly path post-November.  Q. Are US politicians generally pro or anti-crypto? How do you see local regulations evolving?  Beyond the parties, U.S. politicians range from enthusiasm to loathing regarding crypto, with recent national policy set mainly by two of the industry's most outspoken critics. Looking to the present, with the cryptocurrency industry now so politically organized, both parties are becoming more pro-crypto to woo voters ahead of the November election.  We should continue to bet on political self-interest even after election day, as the threat of regulatory competition between countries like Singapore, China, or the Bahamas attracts possibly billion-dollar Web3 companies from American markets.  As pioneers in this space, we champion many of cryptocurrency’s core goals — decentralization, personal autonomy, privacy, freedom of association - that are at their core the same values enshrined in our Constitution.  Q. What’s next for industry stakeholders in this regulatory environment? How should they prepare?  Politically, things are pretty loud, so it’s important to discern the signal from the noise.  For example, the SEC’s approvals of BTC and ETH ETFs have as much political significance as promises in either party’s manifesto. The same can be said of court decisions in favor of and against cryptocurrency companies vs. U.S. regulators — like in the case of Ripple, Kraken and now Uniswap and Consensys.  Institutional participation has grown due to both added confidence in the fundamental crypto assets and new financial tools to access these assets.  At the same time, new consolidations in the Web3 space are making the largest companies in crypto the single providers for tools covering institutional and retail clients alike. As these domestic buyer groups become fully served, it’ll become important for major U.S. Web3 and fintech companies to look beyond their local market.  Web3 companies and contributors are best positioned to take advantage of the borderless and bankless nature of cryptocurrencies, making expansion into rapidly growing digital asset markets like Vietnam, Colombia, or Kenya a major opportunity.  - Roshan Dharia, CEO, Paxful  Keep Reading  Blackrock IBIT bitcoin ETF surpassed $30 billion in AUM, making it the fastest-growing ETF in history.

42415567,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJzkW,1730994301,"The Fed Is Set to Cut Rates, Boosting the Outlook for Crypto","The federal funds rate is headed even lower.  Yesterday saw a huge shift for the investing landscape. Donald Trump was elected president of the United States for a second time. Wall Street responded to the news with a broad-based rally in risk assets. The major indexes, like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, and crypto currencies rocketed higher as a result.  One of the reasons for the gains was a lack of investment exposure for momentum-based hedge funds. Due to close race and the uncertainty surrounding the election outcome, short-term oriented institutional investors reduced their risk exposure. That way, they wouldn’t hurt performance so late in the year.  But there are some more significant factors that drove yesterday’s rally. When Trump last occupied the Oval Office, he championed less government intervention and red tape. That means his administration will be more inclined to let the free-market decide how business gets done, rather than overbearing government regulators. Now, that doesn’t mean anything goes, but it does mean less oversight and investigations for the technology industry.  In addition, Trump is a proponent of a weaker dollar. He made this opinion well known in his first four years. He feels that will help drive demand for U.S.-made goods and juice the domestic economy. And he knows an easy way to get there: cheaper borrowing costs. Because, lower rates mean dollars will become more plentiful, driving down the value.  As a result, this next time around, like the last, he’s likely to follow a similar tack. He’ll ramp up pressure on the Fed to drop the federal funds rate and boost economic output. The change should boost demand for and the price of dollar-based risk assets like crypto currencies.  How can I be so certain? Let me explain.  In 1996, I got my first “real job” out of college. I got hired by a small brokerage firm in Richmond, VA, called Wheat First Butcher Singer. I took whatever opening I could find, to get my foot in the door. I saw this as my opportunity to start a long and successful career.  From the first day, I was determined to learn everything I could. I would pay attention to the habits of others that I saw as paths to success as well as those that ended in failure. I wanted to understand both, so I knew which practices to emulate and the pitfalls to avoid. And over the years since, I’ve incorporated those observations into all facets of my career.  You see, since 1996, I’ve experienced some of the best and worst stock market and economic environments possible. From the dot-com bubble to the financial crisis, to the COVID rebound. I’ve experienced a lot. But each time, I made notes to myself of what caused them and what helped pull us out. Because I knew similar events and environments would happen again, and I wanted to use my knowledge and experience to help people navigate them safely.  As a result, I’ve found one habit that continues to provide success time and again. By following the “bread-crumb trail” of data, I can get a sense of what’s happening economically. By knowing that, I can tell if our central bank is destined to adjust policy higher or lower. That’s important because when rates are falling, it usually means individuals and businesses have easier access to funds. That leads to more spending and economic growth.  The bread crumb trail I’m talking about refers to the fairy tale “Hansel and Gretel” by the Brothers Grimm. In the story, the two children’s step-mother has their father walk them deep into the woods to abandon them. The two leave a trail of small breadcrumbs, so they can find their way back out, once the adults are gone.  In finance, it’s not much different. To find out what’s going on economically, we must look at a number of different indicators. By studying these smaller pieces, and then considering them together, we can navigate our way down the complete economic path.  Based on recent indicators, domestic output continues to stabilize. That’s the outcome the Fed has been seeking since it started raising rates in 2022. The change should lead to another rate cut when policymakers meet today, and even more moving forward.  So, let’s look at a few to show you what I’m talking about.  First, let’s take a look at the employment picture. On Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) released payroll numbers for October. That data showed that only 12,000 jobs were added during the month. At the same time, gains reported for the prior two months were reduced lower. And while that isn’t an ideal outcome, we must look at the bigger picture trend.  In the above chart, I looked at the average monthly gains for the three years leading up to the pandemic and the four years since. I left out 2020 due to the erratic swings up and down. But, by focusing on the average gains pre- and post-pandemic, we can get a sense of what typical hiring activity looks like.  As you can see in the above chart, due to all of the pandemic-driven stimulus, hiring data was distorted, But now as most of that money is gone, things are back to normal. So far this year, we’ve averaged about 170,000 job gains per month. That’s just below the 177,000 average experienced from 2017 through 2019.  Now let’s look at inflation growth.  The above chart shows us the change in the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ personal consumption expenditures (“PCE”) index over the last five years. The Fed prefers this gauge to the consumer price index (“CPI”) from the BLS because it measures not only the money consumers pay for but also those on their behalf, like medical benefits. By looking at that, policymakers get a better sense of the entire picture.  As you can see, from 2020 through 2023, stimulus money had an outsized effect on prices. People flush with money spent it, causing price growth to explode higher. But, as those pandemic savings have been spent, households are becoming more price-conscious. And, as we look to the right side of the chart, we can see PCE has receded back to pre-pandemic levels.  Lastly, let’s observe one last economic indicator: economic output. Last week, the BEA reported GDP rose 2.8% in the third quarter. That’s a pretty solid number. Yet, when we combine it with the 1.4% and 3% increases in the first and second quarters, we get an average pace of growth around 2.4% for the year. So, we want to frame that number compared to the longer-term picture.  You’ll notice the above chart looks similar to the last two. There’s a huge swing higher after COVID. But then as we move further out, the picture appears to be returning to normal levels of activity. In fact, the 2.4% average rate of growth so far this year is just above the 2.3% typical rate of growth since the financial crisis.  This all brings me back to central-bank policy. Based on the most recent PCE numbers, the real rate of interest (effective federal funds rate minus PCE) sits at 2.8%. In other words, our central bank can cut interest rates by another 280 basis points before borrowing costs stop weighing on inflation growth.  In March 2022, the Fed started raising interest rates due to the economic distortions it saw. We looked at the same aberrations above in labor, inflation, and economic output. However, now, all those measures have returned back to normal. Yet, monetary policy has not. So, like I said at the start, don’t be surprised when policymakers cut rates later this week and even more moving forward. And as this happens, it should support more stability in economic growth and underpin a steady rally in crypto investments like bitcoin and ether.

The New York-based company signed a non-binding term sheet with an unidentified U.S.-based hyperscaler firm that could convert all its 800 megawatt (MW) power capacity to high-performance computing (HPC), it said in its third-quarter earnings statement. Hyperscaler firms are large-scale data centers that specialize in providing large amounts of computing power.  The rational behind AI firms coming to bitcoin mining is simple: Miners have operation-ready power capacity that is faster to deploy than building a data center from scratch. It's a win-win for both parties as miners get to diversify their revenue from a highly competitive sector and AI firms get to ramp up their operations fast to feed the ever-growing demand.  Galaxy's Helios mining facility in West Texas has 800MW of approved power capacity, 200MW of which is currently in operation. It also has 1.7 gigawatts (GW) of capacity under study for potential permit at the site, according to the statement.  The move, which is subject to due diligence and approvals, comes as Bitcoin's fourth halving event lowered the mining rewards by half, making the industry more competitive and squeezing profit margins for miners.  The HPC trend started after one of the largest miners, Core Scientific (CORZ), signed a mammoth deal with cloud-computing firm CoreWeave. That saw its stock price surge, leading investor pressure on rivals to follow suit.

Galaxy said mining revenue fell by 23% from the previous quarter, even as total hashrate, or mining power, increased by 11% due to the halving, higher mining difficulty and seasonal operation curtailments. Despite Galaxy's mining woes, the firm narrowed its third-quarter net loss and its operating revenue grew more than 30% from previous quarter, according to the statement. The shares jumped more than 7% in Toronto on Thursday, while bitcoin and broader market index, CoinDesk 20, were positive for the day.

Ethereum has seen a significant uptick today, surging 8% to $2,800. This marks its highest level in three months, following a relatively quiet period in the market. The recent price movement has sparked optimism among analysts, who believe that Ethereum's rally may be far from over.Ethereum Growth PotentialKey market indicators point to the potential for continued upward momentum. Ali Martinez, a market analyst, has emphasized Ethereum’s 180-day MVRV Momentum, which measures the cryptocurrency’s price relative to its Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV) ratio.Historical data suggests that when the 180-day MVRV Momentum crosses its moving average (MA), Ethereum typically enters a period of strong performance. Despite Ethereum’s price increase from $2,400 to $2,800, this critical crossover has not yet occurred, signaling the possibility of further gains.https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1854476926863229323Analysts Point to Recovery SignalsOther analysts like Benjamin Cowen have drawn attention to the ETH/BTC trading pair. Cowen suggests that if Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin breaches its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), it could indicate that Ethereum has reached a relative low against Bitcoin, and from that point forward, more upside could follow.In another analysis, market observer Michael van de Poppe referred to Ethereum’s recent surge as a significant rebound. According to van de Poppe, Ethereum could maintain its upward trajectory by establishing a higher low in its price pattern, a common signal of continued bullish momentum. He also noted a surge in activity within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector as a further bullish narrative for Ethereum.Meanwhile, in a recent panel discussion, Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, described Ethereum as being oversold and predicted that a resurgence of speculative interest could drive ETH’s value higher.Short Squeeze and Speculative Interest Adding to the bullish outlook, the pseudonymous trader Byzantine General suggested that Ethereum could be poised for a significant short squeeze. Such events often trigger rapid price increases, potentially setting the stage for what he referred to as a “monster rally.”Similarly, analyst Miles Deutscher observed that Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin over the past 24 hours, which has further bolstered market confidence.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/07/ethereum-rebounds-to-2800-top-analyst-says-eth-bull-run-still-in-early-stages-critical-crossover-pending/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ethereum-rebounds-to-2800-top-analyst-says-eth-bull-run-still-in-early-stages-critical-crossover-pending,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Dogecoin's bullish momentum has lost steam in the past 24 hours. The largest meme coin by market cap has corrected 4.52% in the past day and 10.2% from its weekly high of $0.2121, which it attained on Wednesday.Before today's price correction, Dogecoin had outperformed most assets in its caliber, fueled by its romance with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The X owner's profound involvement in Donald Trump's reelection sparked an almost 80% increase in the dog-themed meme coin in the past 30 days.Amidst the latest price correction, analyst MadWhale believes Dogecoin's next upward push would target two major monthly resistances. The market analyst also gave a short-term price expectation for the meme coin.MadWhale Insists Monthly Resistance is Next Dogecoin's TargetIn a November 7 TradingView analysis , the market commentator identified that Dogecoin has maintained a trendline in its price uptick in the 12-hour timeframe. This trendline acts as daily support for the token before its next bullish uptrend.MadWhale asserted that he expects Dogecoin to retest the daily support zone around $0.17 before continuing its uptrend. After retesting the area, the market commentator noted that DOGE will target the two major monthly resistances at $0.23 and $0.34.The market analyst's commentary shows that the supply zones at $0.23 and $0.34 act as a multi-year resistance for Dogecoin, as it last traded around the region during the last bull cycle in 2021. Notably, a surge from DOGE's current market price to the resistance zones will entail a 23% and 82% growth, respectively. Dogecoin Analysis Meanwhile, MadWhale argued that Dogecoin's ability to test the monthly resistance at $0.34 would confirm the meme coin is ready for a rally to new highs. Notably, the analyst did not give a timeline for the asset to retest the multi-year supply zone.Other Dogecoin Price PredictionsMadWhale's 82% projection follows similar bullish price predictions from other notable analysts. For instance, market veteran Peter Brandt predicted that Dogecoin is primed for a surge past its present all-time high to unprecedented values. This came after the expert noted that DOGE has confirmed its breakout from a multi-month descending channel.Meanwhile, seasoned market analyst Ali Martinez expects a more ambitious parabolic expansion in Dogecoin's price. He first called a surge to $10 for the meme coin before recently predicting that it might explode over 11,486% to $23.In the meantime, DOGE exchanges hands for $0.1866, with its market cap down 3.94% in the past 24 hours to a $27.66 billion.",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/07/analyst-says-dogecoin-next-target-is-an-82-uptick-to-monthly-resistance-at-0-34/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-dogecoin-next-target-is-an-82-uptick-to-monthly-resistance-at-0-34,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
42415556,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJzb5,1730992562,Former FTX CTO Gary Wang Asks Court for No Jail Time,"I,Gary Wang, the former chief technology officer at FTX and a one-time member of former CEO and convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried’s inner circle, has requested that he serve no prison time for his role in the crypto exchange’s 2022 implosion.  Wang will be the fourth FTX employee to be sentenced. He pleaded guilty to four criminal counts — wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud — in December 2022.  Though the charges carry a maximum combined sentence of 50 years in prison, the sentences meted out to Wang’s former colleagues are a likely better indicator for how Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) will sentence Wang on Nov. 20. Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March, after pleading ""not guilty"" to seven fraud and conspiracy charges and being convicted. Ryan Salame, the former CEO of FTX Digital Markets, pled guilty to two charges but did not cooperate with prosecutors and received a 7.5 year sentence. Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, was sentenced to 2 years in prison after pleading guilty to the same charges as Bankman-Fried. And last month, Nishad Singh, the former director of engineering, was spared jail time entirely after pleading guilty to six charges and cooperating with prosecutors.  In their sentencing memo submitted to the court on Wednesday, Wang’s lawyers said that the factors cited in Judge Kaplan’s decision to sentence Singh to time served are “similarly applicable” to Wang.  “Like Singh, [Wang’s] involvement in the offense was ‘much more limited than’ Bankman-Fried and Ellison,” Wang’s lawyers wrote. “Like Singh, [Wang] learned of the scale and scope of Alameda’s theft ‘relatively late in the day’ and was subject to Bankman-Freid’s ‘charismatic, demanding’ and ‘deceitful’ influence….and like Singh, [Wang’s] cooperation was ‘remarkable.’  But Wang’s lawyers went a step further in their comparison – Wang, they argued, was even less involved in Bankman-Fried’s schemes – and reaped fewer financial rewards – than Singh, who went through with the purchase of a $3.7 million ten-acre estate after learning of FTX’s financial problems in October 2022.  “Unlike Singh, [Wang] did not engage in money laundering or participate in the straw donor scheme. Unlike Singh, [Wang] did not generate false revenue, code a fake insurance fund, try to persuade Bankman-Fried to fraudulently conceal his loans, or otherwise participate in affirmatively deceptive conduct. And, unlike Singh, [Wang] did not receive cash bonuses or spend FTX proceeds on real estate or other extravagant goods,” Wang’s lawyers wrote. “All of these factors combine to make him meaningfully less culpable than Singh.”  Wang’s role at FTX, they said, was to write code – including the now-infamous “backdoor” that allowed Alameda to withdraw customer funds from FTX.  “At Bankman-Fried’s direction, Gary wrote code that gave Alameda Research special privileges on the FTX platform, including the ability to have a negative balance, a $65 billion line of credit, and an exemption from the platform’s auto-liquidation feature,” they wrote. “Crucially, as the Government has acknowledged and the evidence at trial showed, when Gary wrote that code, he had no idea Bankman-Fried would exploit the features to steal customer funds.”  In their memo, Wang’s lawyers told the court that their client never sought compensation beyond his $200,000 annual salary. When he was given an unsolicited $1 million loan from Sam Bankman-Fried, he loaned $200,000 to his then-fiancee Cheryl Chen to buy a house in St. Kitts. The remaining $800,000, they said, was still in his FTX account at the time of its collapse.  Wang, his lawyers said, was uninterested in the “fame or the trappings of wealth” that his colleagues and former friends enjoyed during FTX’s run. The suit he wore to testify at Bankman-Fried’s trial, they said, was the same one he wore in high school orchestra.  Following the collapse of FTX, his lawyers said, Wang has lived with his mother and gotten a full-time job at a 3D imaging company as a software engineer. In January 2023, he and Chen married, and are expecting their first child later this month.

Its ether stash has grown by $1 million after a 16% rise over the past few days.  The token sale is still live although sales have slowed with just $364,000 being recorded since the start of November.  World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance (DeFi) project backed by the family of the former president and now president-elect Donald Trump, has made $1 million in unrealized gains following a muted token sale last month.  The company slashed its fundraising goal to $30 million from $300 million on Oct. 31 due to lack of demand from investors. It has sold 1.02 billion WLFI tokens so far, around half of the new goal.  But it's not all doom and gloom for World Liberty Financial as ether {{ETH}} has risen by more than 16% since 01:00 UTC on Wednesday, turning the paltry $15.3 million it has raised, into $16.25 million. Etherscan shows that the token sale wallet has not liquidated any tokens and that it currently holds 4,234 ETH and $4.2 million worth of stablecoins.  Ether is currently trading at $2,818, its highest level since August, after a market-wide rally that came as a result of Donald Trump's win in the U.S. presidential election.  However, one of the key issues for World Liberty Financial is that the WLFI token is ""non-transferrable"" which means that investors can't liquidate or trade it with other assets for profit. This could change in the future in the event of a governance vote, although no timelines have been set.  Token sales have slowed of late with just $364,000 worth of WLFI being sold since Nov. 1.

42415552,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJzcL,1730992178,UK Lords Echo Support for Digital Assets Property Bill,"Members of the House of Lords expressed support for the Law Commission's digital assets property bill.  The bill will help address crypto legal disputes.  Lords also urged for more clarity for crypto from the new Labour government.  Members of the U.K.'s upper house of Parliament put forward support for the country's digital assets property bill at its second reading on Wednesday.  The Lords Grand committee largely believed that the bill would add more clarity in terms of how crypto is treated by the legal system and could mark another step of progress for the country, which has been paving the way for crypto use in the country.  The U.K. introduced the bill in September. It was drafted by the Law Commission, an independent statutory body. The bill adds a new category of ""thing"" to the categories that fall under property to help aid crypto legal disputes.  ""It supports our efforts to ensure that our jurisdiction remains at the forefront globally, providing a flexible legal framework that can react to the dynamic nature of digital assets and other emerging technologies,"" Lord Frederick Ponsonby of Shulbrede said during the debate.  Not only will the bill assist judges in criminal proceedings where their crypto has been stolen due to a fraud or hack but the bill will also help in the division of matrimonial property, Ponsonby said.  ""The bill is short in nature, but could be extraordinarily significant in impact,"" Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond said.  John Thomas also known as Baron Thomas of Cwmgiedd agreed that the Law Commission's bill was a ""critical change"" and called for it to be internationally competitive, something Ponsonby argued was the case.  Regulation  The U.K. put forward legislation to treat crypto as a regulated activity last year and was consulting on more rules. Its plans for the sector like creating a new authorization regime for crypto companies were left in limbo once Labour got into government and took over from the crypto friendly Conservatives.  Lord Ed Vaizey also urged the new government to evaluate the effectiveness of the promotions rules and clarify what its approach to crypto would be.  Ponsonby then said in response to Vaizey's concerns the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority are working on appropriate financial regulation of crypto assets.  Economic Secretary Tulip Siddiq said in October the government has been reviewing the previous government's plans for crypto and ""will set out details of its policy programme for crypto assets soon.""

CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, highlights that the proposed act could position Bitcoin (BTC) as a U.S. strategic reserve asset, similar to gold. Should it pass, this development could place up to 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply in U.S. national reserves, establishing greater legitimacy for the asset.The Bitcoin Act, formally titled the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness Through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, was introduced earlier this year by U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis.https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1854208373740458432The legislation aims to reduce the national debt by accumulating 1 million BTC over five years. This signals an aggressive approach to integrating Bitcoin into the nation’s financial framework. Trump, who voiced support for a Bitcoin reserve during his campaign, could actively pursue this plan now that he is president.Bitcoin Act to Drive BTC to Unprecedented HeightCoinShares’ report suggests that implementing the Bitcoin Act would likely spark substantial interest from both institutions and government agencies, potentially driving Bitcoin’s value to new heights. In the past few days, the news of Trump's victory in the elections alone has driven Bitcoin to a peak of $76,400. Institutions are already accumulating Bitcoin through various means, including ETFs, which now hold over 1 million tokens. Others, like MicroStrategy, have been on a buying spree for four years and continue to sustain the trend. With the proposed Bitcoin Act anticipated to pass, the crypto market could be welcoming a major narrative for an extensive upside in the coming years, as further buying pressure from the U.S. government could help keep Bitcoin’s price up.Also, Trump’s administration will likely usher in a new era for crypto regulation, given his prior criticisms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its chairman Gary Gensler. CoinShares anticipates that new SEC leadership could prioritize a more favorable regulatory stance for crypto.

42415561,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJzgk,1730991002,"Ether, Touted as Internet Bond, May Top $3K on Fed Rate Cut, Outperform Bitcoin: Omkar Godbole","The Fed rate cut will narrow the ether-Fed yield differential in favor of ETH.  Ether could outperform bitcoin following an interest-rate reduction.  The Ethereum blockchain's native token, ether {{ETH}}, a yield-bearing coin that has fallen out of investor favor, could surge Thursday if the Federal Reserve delivers an interest-rate reduction, as expected.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has risen 23% this year, a meager gain compared with the 77% surge in bitcoin {{BTC}}, the largest.  At $2,800, the ether price is well below its 2021 peak of $4,868. Bitcoin, meantime, is trading around $74,000, close to the record high hit on Wednesday as Donald Trump neared U.S. election victory.  One reason for the underperformance is the U.S.'s elevated interest rates, which have dented ether’s appeal as an internet bond, offering a fixed-income-like yield in exchange for staking the token. The annualized staking yield has consistently held below 4% for the past two years, much less than the 5% benchmark U.S. interest rate.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to cut the borrowing cost by 25 basis points to 4.5%, having delivered an outsized rate reduction of 50 basis points in September.  In other words, the ether-Fed yield differential is set to narrow in favor of ether, potentially galvanizing demand for the cryptocurrency. The victory of pro-crypto candidate Trump in the presidential election has already set the stage for a rebound in ETH and DeFi coins.  Ether is currently looking to scale the trendline characterizing the downtrend from May. The rate cut may confirm the breakout, opening doors for a rally above $3,000.  Note that as per the Fed funds futures, interest rate traders have already priced in the rate cut, meaning the so-called easing may not lead to a significant positive reaction in macro assets like BTC.  Traders, however, should watch out for signs of Fed angst over Trump’s supposedly inflationary policies as that would mean slower rate cuts or even a pause in the months ahead.

Saylor made this known today, emphasizing that MicroStrategy is a Bitcoin treasury company whose operations are backed by the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. He attached a chart to his X post showcasing how the company operates at this position. MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin Treasury Company MicroStrategy Operations Per the chart, MicroStrategy features Bitcoin reserves and BTC treasury operations. The chart highlighted some features of Bitcoin, suggesting that the asset is a financial instrument for capital preservation and productivity. Additionally, MicroStrategy claimed that the premier asset provides a hedge against inflation and entropy. Considering Bitcoin’s enormous potential, MicroStrategy embarked on an initiative to establish a treasury reserve for the asset class. According to the chart, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury operations include purchasing BTC using funds it raised through its issuance of securities. The business intelligence company also adjusts its leverage to optimize its Bitcoin purchases and fund dividends via the issuance of securities. Furthermore, the chart confirmed that MicroStrategy holds 252,220 BTC worth $18 billion in its reserve. Meanwhile, the chart highlighted the firm’s Bitcoin-related securities, including MicroStrategy options, convert, equity, and spot BTC ETFs. It ranked these assets on their volatility or leverage levels, ranging from 0.25x to 10x. Bitcoin Rally Pushes MicroStrategy Stock Above $260 MicroStrategy boasts a heavy exposure to Bitcoin, so its stock typically trails the crypto asset. MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has soared 38.54% over the past month. At press time, it trades for $257.81, with a market cap of $52.24 billion. Yesterday, MSTR soared to $260.82 from its previous day low of $226.59. MSTR’s surge coincided with Bitcoin's, which hit an all-time high of $76,460 yesterday. Given MicroStrategy’s exposure to Bitcoin, MSTR's performance closely mirrors BTC’s price action, making this rally unsurprising. Despite MicroStrategy’s heavy exposure to Bitcoin, the company plans to raise more funds to acquire BTC. As reported earlier, MicroStrategy is looking to raise $42 billion through fixed-income securities and equity sales over the next three years. Upon raising the fund, the company would acquire more BTC, increasing its holdings.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/07/michael-saylor-reveals-microstrategys-bitcoin-treasury-operations/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=michael-saylor-reveals-microstrategys-bitcoin-treasury-operations,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Known for innovations like early Lightning Network support, advanced trading tools, and a secure, reliable institutional grade platform, Bitfinex has stayed at the forefront of the digital asset space while building a strong community of crypto enthusiasts and institutions. 12 years on, Bitfinex reinforces its dedication to promoting and espousing Bitcoin’s principles of privacy, freedom, and financial inclusion. Happy To Be Here After All These Years We’re celebrating our 12th anniversary on November 6th, 2024! Bitfinex marks over a decade as a pioneering force as a digital asset exchange and a long-standing member of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Established as one of the first Bitcoin exchanges, Bitfinex has consistently navigated the peaks and valleys of an evolving cryptocurrency market through both bullish and bearish environments while supporting a community of enthusiasts, investors, and innovators dedicated to Bitcoin’s core principles of financial freedom, privacy, and security. Bitfinex’s journey reflects the resilience of our mission: empowering people to interact and transact freely on a global scale. With initiatives like early support for the Lightning Network ,, running some of the largest and most liquid nodes on Lightning , and investing in peer-to-peer solutions, such as Keet , Bitfinex has consistently focused on expanding access to the benefits of decentralised finance while staying committed to Bitcoin as the foundational technology. This dedication aligns with Bitfinex’s broader mission of building secure, reliable, and accessible platforms that democratise digital finance, and give our users the best tool kit for achieving financial freedom. 12 years in our industry can seem like a lifetime. Looking back, we can see the world was a very different place, commonplace tools used by nearly every crypto trader these days, like Telegram, didn’t even exist. Web3 was not even an idea yet, and the first Proof of Stake blockchain, Peercoin , had just made its way onto the scene. ASIC miners for Bitcoin mining had not even been created yet. It was truly the early days, when crypto still seemed like the wild west. Reflecting on key milestones, Bitfinex has remained at the forefront of technology by continuously advancing security measures, developing unique trading tools, and fostering Bitcoin’s adoption across diverse markets. From offering advanced margin trading and liquidity services to launching a robust staking program, Bitfinex has cultivated an exchange designed to meet the evolving needs of both retail and institutional users, solidifying our position as a leader in digital asset markets. As Bitfinex looks ahead, the focus remains on nurturing Bitcoin’s potential as a technology for freedom and inclusion, supporting developers and innovators who share in the vision of a decentralised, open financial future. Resiliently Navigating the Rough Seas of a Chaotic and Constantly Evolving Market Since its founding in 2012, Bitfinex has navigated a constantly evolving digital asset landscape, building a legacy of resilience and adaptability in one of the most turbulent financial markets that humanity has ever seen. Launched as one of the first exchanges focused on Bitcoin, Bitfinex has continuously set itself apart by providing advanced trading features, liquidity, and innovative technologies, helping early Bitcoin adopters and institutions participate in the nascent cryptocurrency market. Over time, Bitfinex expanded its offerings to include hundreds of trading pairs, pioneering features like margin trading, lending, and, later, staking services, each feature catered to an ever-growing audience of crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors. This adaptability laid a strong foundation for the platform, empowering users and advancing the ecosystem. However, Bitfinex’s journey has been punctuated by challenges that tested its fortitude. The company faced early obstacles with regulatory pressures, swiftly evolving compliance requirements, and unprecedented market volatility that few could have anticipated. Even in the face of our biggest challenges, Bitfinex took decisive action to secure the platform, strengthen protections, and restore customer confidence. After a serious hack, Bitfinex introduced one of the most innovative recovery models seen in the entire industry, compensating customers through its unique BFX which it was eventually able to redeem in full. Now with the perpetrators of the hack discovered after a long period of investigations, it has reinforced our reputation as a resilient platform that has built enduring trust with its community. Throughout these events, Bitfinex has also remained committed to innovation, expanding its platform capabilities while upholding Bitcoin’s core principles of freedom and financial inclusion. Bitfinex was one of the first major exchanges to adopt the Lightning Network, supporting faster Bitcoin transactions and contributing to the broader adoption of Bitcoin for P2P payments. Our dedication to maintaining a robust infrastructure for institutional-grade liquidity, security, and performance has made us a trusted venue, especially during periods of high volatility when other platforms struggled to maintain stability. With each new service, from crypto loans to advanced charting and trade execution tools, we continuously pushed boundaries, adapting to the changing needs of the crypto market. Bitfinex’s twelve-year journey exemplifies resilience in a world of rapid technological and financial transformation. It has remained true to its mission of empowering customers globally, integrating new technologies, and prioritising security, transparency, and user control. As we celebrate this milestone, Bitfinex reflects not only on its past but also on a future where it continues to set standards in the digital asset space, standing as a testament to endurance, adaptability, and unwavering dedication to our customers and the principles of Bitcoin. What Can We Look Forward to From Here? As Bitfinex looks to the future, we remain steadfast in our commitment to empowering financial freedom and pushing the boundaries of what digital finance can achieve. Our work in El Salvador, the world’s first Bitcoin country, exemplifies this dedication to building a decentralised, inclusive financial system. In supporting El Salvador’s Bitcoin initiatives, from educational programs to infrastructure, Bitfinex is helping to drive Bitcoin adoption on a national scale, laying the groundwork for other nations and communities around the world to follow. By assisting in the development of a thriving Bitcoin economy, we envision a world where individuals can freely engage with a financial system that truly prioritises transparency, security, and access. Bitfinex Securities further reinforces our commitment to transforming finance by pioneering tokenised securities and real-world assets. Through our efforts in this realm, Bitfinex is making it easier for individuals and institutions to access investments traditionally limited to the few, bringing unprecedented liquidity and global access to the securities market. Tokenising real-world assets and financial products on the blockchain allows for secure, efficient transactions that eliminate traditional intermediaries and lower barriers to entry, democratising finance on a global scale. Our aim is to lead the way in making asset ownership accessible and empowering users to engage in markets that have been historically restrictive, paving the way for a more open and flexible financial ecosystem. Our work remains deeply anchored in Bitcoin as the foundational layer of this transformation. At Bitfinex, we believe that Bitcoin’s decentralised and censorship-resistant qualities provide an unparalleled base for a new kind of financial system, one that operates outside the constraints of legacy financial institutions. Things like our P2P trading platform ensure that our users can access tools to empower the unbanked and underserved with direct access to financial markets, enabling them to participate in the global economy without relying on traditional banking institutions. We continue to support the development and scaling of Bitcoin infrastructure, including contributions to the Lightning Network and RGB, which is critical to enabling fast, low-cost transactions globally. Our dedication to Bitcoin ensures that we are part of a movement toward a financial system that promotes individual sovereignty, privacy, and financial freedom, one block at a time. Looking ahead, Bitfinex is more committed than ever to innovating in ways that serve our users and push the industry forward. By combining our support for Bitcoin, our groundbreaking work in tokenized assets, and our partnerships in pioneering jurisdictions like El Salvador, Bitfinex is charting a future that aligns with our core values of accessibility and financial inclusion. We will continue to lead with technology, advocacy, and service, staying true to the principles of decentralisation and financial autonomy that Bitcoin introduced. As the world’s economic landscape continues to shift, Bitfinex remains a trusted partner in building an inclusive, decentralised financial system that benefits all.

Trump’s pro-crypto stance has ignited excitement among analysts and investors who anticipate favorable policies for digital assets in his administration. With Bitcoin now sitting at all-time highs, many speculate this could begin a new rally phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sets $3,400 Target Once ETH Breaks Key Resistance – Details Key data from CryptoQuant indicates that Bitcoin has reached a price equilibrium, suggesting there are no strong market forces pulling the price lower. This positive equilibrium reinforces the bullish outlook and hints at a stable foundation for further growth. Analysts believe Bitcoin may be set for new highs with fewer obstacles in the coming weeks. As investor confidence builds, some view this phase as a critical moment for Bitcoin to solidify its position in a pro-crypto policy environment. The combination of strong technical support and positive sentiment from Trump’s victory has set the stage for what many hope will be a significant upward trend, potentially driving the broader crypto market higher. Bitcoin Enters A Bullish Phase Bitcoin has officially entered a bullish phase after breaking past its previous all-time highs, reaching $76,500. This level has become a new area of focus as many analysts identify it as a potential resistance zone. According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, the market is currently balanced between a “Bubble” and a “Crash” phase. Adler’s analysis, which includes key on-chain data, suggests that Bitcoin’s market structure is at an equilibrium, meaning there are no significant fundamental reasons to anticipate a drop. Instead, this setup provides a stable foundation for possibly continuing Bitcoin’s upward trend. With the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision set to be announced today, the next few weeks promise to be pivotal. A stable or favorable decision from the Fed could reinforce the optimism in the market, drawing in new demand and reinforcing Bitcoin’s position above $76,000. Many investors and analysts expect heightened activity from institutional players, particularly given Bitcoin’s resilience around this milestone level. The market’s balance at this juncture is crucial. As long as Bitcoin maintains its current structure, it has the potential to continue its upward trajectory without substantial risk of retracement. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Shares Correlation With S&P500 – Last Dip Before It Hits $10,000? With fresh demand entering the market and the macroeconomic backdrop shaping up favorably, Bitcoin may soon aim for even higher levels. For now, all eyes remain on the $76,500 mark and how the market will respond in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s announcement. This period of consolidation could be the catalyst for the next leg up, solidifying Bitcoin’s bullish outlook. BTC Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $75,000, holding steady above its previous all-time high of approximately $73,800. This level has become a critical support zone as BTC continues in a well-defined 4-hour uptrend. The trend began after a strong bounce from the 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $66,800, indicating renewed bullish momentum. Bulls need to keep the price above the $73,000 mark to sustain this momentum, a key psychological threshold. This level boosts market confidence and provides a potential springboard for Bitcoin to reach higher targets soon. A confirmed hold above $73,000 could signal further upside, inviting additional buying pressure and potentially setting up BTC for new highs. Related Reading: Solana ‘Must Break Descending Resistance’ To Regain Bullish Momentum – Analyst However, if BTC fails to hold this level, it could slip toward a lower demand area of around $70,500. Despite this possibility, current price action shows no significant signs of a downturn. The steady uptrend and firm support levels suggest that Bitcoin’s bullish outlook remains intact, with little indication of an imminent drop. As long as BTC maintains its structure, the path toward continued gains remains clear, reinforcing confidence in the ongoing rally.

Brandt highlighted that while both assets are on the cusp of potential upward breakouts (BOs) to catch up with Bitcoin (BTC) in its latest rally, he perceives Solana as the more promising investment due to its patterns and recent price behavior.Ethereum Battles Overhead Resistance In the weekly Ethereum chart, Brandt reveals that the leading altcoin is currently grappling with a major overhead resistance zone. ETH was trading at $2,818 at the time of the analysis, showing a 14.63% weekly gain. However, the chart reveals that Ethereum encounters selling pressure as it moves towards higher levels. This shows substantial supply in the current range as old whales reawaken .Notably, Ethereum is attempting to break through the overhead resistance near $3,000. This level is a crucial mark, as it aligns with previous high points where sellers emerged, creating a supply zone. Ethereum 1W Chart | Peter Brandt Interestingly, at the reporting time, Ethereum's price remains above the 8-week Simple Moving Average (SMA), which is currently around $2,587. The current position suggests upside momentum. However, ETH still faces multiple resistance zones on the path to new highs.While Ethereum does show promise, the overhead supply at these levels could limit its immediate upside potential. The struggle to clear resistance may cause a slower progression for ETH compared to assets making new highs. Meanwhile, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel recently suggested Ethereum was oversold .For the altcoin to sustain its upward momentum, it needs a convincing breakout above the $3,000 mark with strong volume support. At press time, Ethereum has spiked 3.40% and currently trades for $2,816, a three-month peak.Solana Eyeing New HighsIn contrast to Ethereum, Solana’s chart shows a much more bullish structure. At the time of analysis, Solana was trading at $187.38 with a weekly gain of 15.34% after overcoming the $180 resistance .The chart highlights a prevalent consolidation channel, which has continued to dictate Solana’s price since March 11. Data confirms that SOL is making higher lows while testing the upper resistance near $200 multiple times, recently overtaking BNB in market cap . The latest attempt occurred during the recent Bitcoin uptrend, with SOL spiking to $191 today. This pattern suggests a consolidation period that has now resolved in favor of buyers, indicating a likely extension of the uptrend. Solana 1W Chart Peter Brandt Unlike Ethereum, Solana has cleared critical resistance zones and is in the process of establishing new highs. Breaking into new territory reduces the presence of overhead supply, meaning fewer resistance levels to impede SOL’s upward movement.Notably, at a current price of $186.15, Solana is trading well above its 8-week SMA, currently at $161.36. Staying above this average shows strong bullish momentum, and any pullbacks are likely to find support at this level, strengthening the uptrend.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/07/brandt-expects-ethereum-and-solana-to-make-upside-push-but-identifies-why-sol-is-more-bullish/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=brandt-expects-ethereum-and-solana-to-make-upside-push-but-identifies-why-sol-is-more-bullish,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,238.35 +1.98%  Bitcoin (BTC): $75,007.25 +0.43%  Ether (ETH): $2,809.39 +6.34%  S&P 500: 5,929.04 +2.53%  Gold: $2,665.75 -0.07%  Nikkei 225: 39,381.41 -0.25%  Top Stories  Bitcoin traded around $75,000 during the European morning, about 2% lower than the all-time high of nearly $76,500 set Wednesday. Following Donald Trump's election victory, attention will turn to the next round of interest-rate cuts by the Fed, with analysts forecasting a 25 basis-point reduction later Thursday. While lower borrowing costs are generally seen as a bullish signal for risk assets such as crypto, this one might prove to be a non-event. The CME's FedWatch tool shows traders are assigning a nearly 100% chance of the Fed trimming the benchmark rate to 4.5%-4.7%, so the reduction is already priced in.  BTC's rally to an all-time high on Wednesday coincided with massive inflows into ETFs, which added a net $621.9 million, snapping a three-day streak of outflows. What was noteworthy was the strong inflows came despite market leader BlackRock's IBIT seeing net outflows of $69 million. Trading volume in the ETF was at a record level, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. ""IBIT just had its biggest volume day ever with $4.1b traded,"" Balchunas wrote. ""It was also up 10%, its second-best day since launching, some of this will convert into inflows"". IBIT's outflows were offset by over $300 million of inflows for Fidelity's FBTC and over $100 million apiece for ARK 21Shares' ARKB, Bitwise's BITB and Grayscale's BTC.  Ether is over 7% higher in the last 24 hours, outperforming the broader digital asset market, which has risen by 2.7%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. ETH crossed $2,800 for the first time since early August, breaking out of the $2,300-$2,600 range that has persisted even while other coins were rallying. President-elect Trump's victory may be stirring hopes of a ""DeFi Renaissance"" and with it a breakout in the price of ether. “DeFi Renaissance thesis is progressing as expected with Trump deregulation and crypto friendly policy and rule-making from Republican admin and Senate,” wrote Arthur Cheong, co-founder at DeFiance Capital, in an X post.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows short and long-term risk reversals (25rr) measuring the spread between pricing for call and put options.  Risk reversals are positive, signaling a bias for calls or a bullish outlook.  Short-duration risk reversals now exhibit a relatively stronger call bias, a sign of bullish euphoria that usually presages price corrections.

This shift reflects growing confidence among investors as optimism takes hold in the cryptocurrency market. For many investors, this renewed positive outlook serves as a strong foundation for more gains in the Bitcoin price. According to a crypto analyst, Bitcoin is ripe for a final ascent to the $300,000 price level. Interestingly, this outlook is not just based on the current bullish sentiment, but the analyst is going off of technical analysis of the current Bitcoin price action. Final Ascent For Bitcoin Price Crypto analyst Gert van Lagen took to social media platform X to share an intriguing outlook concerning Bitcoin and its price action this year in light of the recent US presidential elections and its effect of its price. Speaking of an intriguing outlook for the Bitcoin price, analyst van Lagen highlighted that Bitcoin is still on track to reach $250,000 this year. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Ignites 3,674% On Election Day, Will SHIB Move With Dogecoin Price To New ATH? His outlook came through a funny poem and a play of words on the Bitcoin price action from August, which he titled “#Bitcoin – The Final Ascent.” The analyst also shared a BTC price chart with technical analysis. Central to van Lagen’s analysis is a detailed look at the cup and handle pattern that has been developing in Bitcoin’s price chart since the 2022 bear market. According to his analysis, the ‘cup’ portion of this pattern began forming in early 2022 and eventually concluded with Bitcoin’s surge past its previous 2021 all-time high in March 2024. The subsequent consolidation phase, which lasted until October, represents the ‘handle’ segment of the pattern. With recent inflows driving Bitcoin to fresh all-time highs, the price has now broken out from the neck of long-standing cup and handle formation, marking the beginning of what van Lagen dubs ‘the final ascent.’ What’s Next For Bitcoin? The cup and handle pattern is often seen as a bullish continuation signal. Breakouts from this pattern often indicate that the asset is about to experience a massive upward movement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? In the case of the Bitcoin price and its breakout from the cup and handle pattern, Gert van Lagen highlighted a surge to the $300,000 price level. Notably, this outlook is also based on the prediction of a recession in the next six months. “A warning sign we can’t abide. For history shows in months but six, Recession strikes—the clock now ticks,” he said. In terms of a projected timeline, van Lagen expects the Bitcoin price to reach $250,000 and subsequently $300,000 latest by February 25. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $74,845. A surge towards $250,000 and $300,000 will represent 235% and 300% increase, respectively, from the current price level.

The broader crypto market experienced a major relief rally this week, propelling the prices of various assets to greater heights. Bitcoin led the market rally with a double-digit gain that took its price above $76,000 for the first time, marking a new all-time peak.Pundit Criticizes XRP PerformanceFollowing Bitcoin’s remarkable growth, an XRP critic compared XRP’s price action to BTC over the past year. The critic noted that while Bitcoin has doubled in one year, surging 117% to $75,970, XRP’s value has plummeted by nearly 25% in the same timeframe. He expressed skepticism about claims that XRP has a greater price return potential, suggesting that the asset’s performance does not support this theory. https://twitter.com/ScamDetective5/status/1854289711772340657Reason Behind XRP Plunge Reacting, Attorney Morgan indicated that Scam Detective seems obsessed with XRP. He acknowledged XRP’s poor performance, confirming that the token ranks as the worst-performing coin among the top 10 cryptocurrencies over the past year.https://twitter.com/Belisarius2020/status/1854301352748589281 Notably, the lawyer asserted that XRP’s underperformance stems from the legal tussle between the U.S. SEC and Ripple. He mentioned that XRP has been entangled in the lawsuit that has lingered for four years since December 2020, negatively affecting its price. According to Morgan, some entities still believe XRP is affiliated with Ripple, which is currently in the middle of the SEC war against crypto. For instance, in an article last month, Forbes referred to XRP as ""Ripple."" He suggested that this sentiment has continued to have a bearish impact on XRP’s price. XRP Is Still Relevant Despite XRP’s underperformance, Morgan said the coin has continued to rank among the top 10 biggest cryptos by market cap. At press time, XRP ranks as the seventh-biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $31.49 billion. It briefly lost this position to Dogecoin yesterday, but immediately reclaimed it. XRP’s daily volume is up 0.12% to $1.94 billion. This indicates that it still attracts significant interest among crypto enthusiasts. Currently, XRP is trading at $0.5537 per token, reflecting a 24-hour surge of 3.97%. SEC v. Ripple Current StatusMeanwhile, the lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple is currently in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The court ordered the SEC to file its appellate brief by January 15, 2025, with Ripple expected to file its opposition several weeks later. Afterward, Ripple will file its cross-appeal brief challenging the ruling regarding its institutional sales of XRP, which were deemed securities. While the case is set to begin in January officially, XRP community members are anticipating that a new SEC administration, set up by President Donald Trump, might settle with Ripple. However, if the parties do not settle, the lawsuit might linger until 2026, affecting XRP’s performance along the way.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/07/top-lawyer-explains-why-xrp-is-worst-performing-coin-in-top-10/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-lawyer-explains-why-xrp-is-worst-performing-coin-in-top-10,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35856364,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651992,1730980841,FOMC Preview: What The Crypto Market Can Expect From The Fed,"As the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets today, the crypto market’s focus is on the Federal Reserve’s forthcoming announcements. Scheduled for 2:00 PM ET are both the Fed Interest Rate Decision and the FOMC Statement, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference following at 2:30 PM ET. These events are poised to have significant implications for cryptocurrencies and broader financial markets. What The Crypto Market Can Expect Market participants overwhelmingly anticipate a rate cut. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, 97.5% expect the Federal Reserve to implement a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut. This expectation aligns with recent economic indicators and reflects a consensus that the Fed will continue its cautious monetary easing. “The Federal Reserve is expected to cut the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points at the November 7 meeting. This aligns with market expectations and follows a weaker-than-expected nonfarm payroll report,” Althea Spinozzi, Head of Fixed Income Strategy at Saxo Bank, notes. Related Reading: ‘Crypto Has Already Won’, Regardless Of Trump Or Harris Win: Bitwise CIO The Fed is likely to maintain a measured approach, emphasizing gradual rate cuts over abrupt policy shifts. Chair Powell is expected to underscore a data-dependent and restrained policy stance, focusing on the nuanced dynamics of the current economic landscape. Spinozzi adds, “The Fed is likely to continue its measured approach, emphasizing gradual rate cuts rather than drastic policy shifts. Chair Jerome Powell is expected to highlight a data-dependent and restrained policy stance.” While headline inflation appears to be easing, core components suggest persistent pressures. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.4% year-over-year in September, the lowest since February 2021. However, critical sectors like shelter and services continue to see elevated prices. Shelter prices are up 4.9% year-over-year, and services excluding energy rose by 4.7%. “The core PCE inflation rate—a key Fed measure—has stabilized at an annualized 2.3% over both three- and six-month averages but continues to run above the Fed’s 2% target,” Spinozzi highlights. Persistent inflation in these sectors could exert upward pressure on overall inflation, complicating the Fed’s efforts to achieve its target. The labor market remains robust despite recent disruptions from hurricanes and strikes. The unemployment rate stands firm at 4.1%, and temporary layoffs have declined in October. Wage growth is showing signs of cooling; the Employment Cost Index (ECI) for Q3 surprised to the downside at 0.8% quarter-over-quarter, the softest since Q2 2021. Year-over-year, the ECI remains elevated at 3.9%, significantly above the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) average of 2.16%. Weekly jobless claims are also well below the post-GFC average, indicating sustained labor market strength. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run Overall, the US economy has exhibited unexpected robustness. Third-quarter GDP grew by 2.8% annualized, and personal consumption rose by 3.7%, the strongest quarter since early 2023. However, concerns about the sustainability of this growth persist. Real disposable income has softened, and household savings are declining, potentially limiting future consumer spending. Adding to the complexity is the US presidential election. The victory by Donald Trump could significantly influence fiscal policies, thereby impacting the Fed’s longer-term rate path. “The Federal Reserve will be mindful of how its actions and commentary could influence financial markets that may already be experiencing quite volatile conditions,” James Knightley, Chief International Economist at ING, remarks. For crypto traders, Jerome Powell’s commentary during the FOMC press conference on anticipated inflationary effects stemming from the Trump election is the key focus. Experts expect that the Trump presidency could lead to policies that underpin inflation, such as tax cuts and increased fiscal spending, potentially forcing the Fed to keep rates elevated. Despite the political backdrop, the Fed is expected to proceed with the rate cut. ING analysts suggest, “Even after September’s 50bp rate cut, monetary policy is in restrictive territory, and the Fed has scope to keep cutting rates back to a more neutral level to give the economy a little more breathing space to continue growing strongly.” The current target range for the Fed funds rate is 4.75% to 5%, well above the estimated “neutral” level of 3% to 3.5%. The consensus is that the Fed has room to normalize its policy, especially with the labor market cooling. The crypto market will be closely monitoring not just the rate decision—which appears largely priced in—but also the Fed’s commentary on inflation, economic growth, and the potential impacts of the presidential election. Any indications from Chair Powell regarding future policy shifts could have significant implications for the Bitcoin and crypto markets. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $75,080.

Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a 7.9% price increase over the past 24 hours. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $2,823 after a minor retracement from earlier gains.This recent uptick follows a year of underperformance relative to Bitcoin (BTC), with the ETH/BTC pair consistently reaching multi-year lows. However, recent market movements and analysis suggest a possible shift in Ethereum’s market dynamics.Weighing In on Ethereum’s PositionIndustry analysts have offered varying views on Ethereum’s future. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, believes Ethereum is currently oversold. He also pointed to the likelihood of renewed speculative interest in the asset during a discussion hosted by The Tie, a digital asset research and data platform, on November 7.https://twitter.com/vaneck_us/status/1854314157375361252The event, which included key players from Grayscale, BlockTower Capital, and FalconX Network, explored how the U.S. elections might impact both macroeconomic conditions and digital asset markets.Meanwhile, VanEck’s Ethereum ETF (ETHV) has struggled to maintain momentum. While the ETF saw a modest $3.9 million inflow on October 21, it has since failed to attract significant new capital. Nonetheless, other analysts remain bullish on Ethereum’s prospects.Further Industry Optimism about EthereumThe pseudonymous trader Byzantine General recently suggested that a significant short squeeze could be a game-changing event for Ethereum. In his words, ETH could be getting set for ""a monster rally.""Also, in a post on X today, analyst Miles Deutscher highlighted that Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin over the last 24 hours.Similarly, prominent analyst Benjamin Cowen pointed to the ETH/BTC trading pair as a key indicator. Cowen believes that if the pair breaks above its Simple Moving Average (SMA), it could signal that Ethereum has already reached its lowest point against Bitcoin, further reinforcing bullish sentiment.Critics Highlight Ethereum’s Governance IssuesCritics like Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, argue Ethereum's bullish potential is limited due to structural issues. He believes Ethereum is ""cooked,"" citing the overemphasis on Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions—driven by venture capital—that prioritize profit over decentralization.Bons argues this has stunted development on Ethereum’s Layer 1 (L1) and created risks around censorship and centralization, which undermine user trust.He also points out that L2s offer higher financial incentives for developers, potentially discouraging L1 scaling efforts. According to Bons, this dynamic mirrors challenges in Bitcoin's governance, highlighting broader issues in Ethereum’s ecosystem that may require reform.https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1850927134241697869",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/07/vaneck-head-researcher-says-ethereum-is-oversold-predicts-speculative-interest-will-return-to-propel-eth/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=vaneck-head-researcher-says-ethereum-is-oversold-predicts-speculative-interest-will-return-to-propel-eth,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The lawsuit was brought against the exchange in November 2023.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the Northern District Court of California to dismiss three of the defenses made by Kraken to allegations the crypto exchange has acted unlawfully.  In a motion filed Nov. 5, the regulator dismissed Kraken's claims relating to a lack of clarity around securities laws and how they apply to virtual assets, as well as assertions the exchange was not given fair notice that its conduct was considered to be in violation of securities law.  It is also asking the court to reject Kraken's ""major questions doctrine"" defense. The doctrine is a legal principle established by the Supreme Court that holds that agencies should not expand their regulatory powers without clear authorization from Congress.  The SEC sued Kraken in November 2023 for operating a platform as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer and clearing agency. The SEC said it believes that since at least September 2018, Kraken had made hundreds of millions of dollars unlawfully by facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities. Kraken filed for the case to be dismissed, a motion that was rejected in August.  ""When denying Kraken's motion to dismiss, this Court rejected Kraken's assertion that the major questions doctrine foreclosed this action and also determined that the definition of 'investment contract' under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is well-settled law,"" the SEC's motion said.  Kraken has ""now propounded numerous discovery requests seeking voluminous sets of documents and sprawling admissions related to these legally unsupportable defenses,"" according to the filing.

Crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky suggests that Mark Uyeda , an SEC commissioner known for his critical stance on current SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s policies, stands a strong chance of taking the position. Uyeda, appointed as an SEC commissioner in June 2022, has been vocal in opposing the enforcement-heavy approach Gensler has taken toward crypto. In October, Uyeda referred to Gensler’s policies as a “disaster for the whole industry.” His stance has earned him support among crypto advocates who seek a more open and collaborative regulatory framework. This backing, combined with his experience, makes him a significant candidate in the eyes of the crypto community and policy analysts. Meanwhile, some speculated that SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce , known in the community as ""Crypto Mom"" for her support of industry innovation, might also be a candidate. Appointed by Trump in 2018, Peirce has consistently challenged the SEC’s restrictive approach toward cryptocurrency, pushing for open communication and policies that promote innovation rather than stifling it. However, Chervinsky believes her chances of leading the SEC are “very low” and doubts she would be interested in the role. According to Chervinsky, being SEC Chair is “a pretty hard, thankless, miserable job,” and Peirce may prefer to move on to other opportunities. Many believe Trump’s administration will prioritize reducing regulatory pressure on the crypto industry. Chervinsky expects Trump to focus on ending what he calls Biden's “regulation by enforcement” strategy, which has resulted in numerous enforcement actions against major crypto companies. There’s a possibility that Trump may look for new candidates entirely to take on this agenda, seeking leaders who can bring fresh perspectives in support of the sector. The future of SEC leadership remains uncertain, and it’s clear that whoever is chosen will play a critical role in shaping the relationship between the U.S. government and the cryptocurrency industry. Ending aggressive enforcement and fostering a balanced regulatory environment may be at the top of Trump’s agenda for the SEC, marking a potential shift in U.S. crypto policy .",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/mark-uyeda-leads-race-for-sec-chair-as-trump-eyes-crypto-friendly-policies,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/35854933.jpeg

Polymarket bettors are giving an 86% chance of January 6 protestors getting a pardon, and a 78% chance of Ulbricht getting one.  Trump has publicly argued that Jan. 6 protesters were patriots ensnared by a ""two systems of justice"" approach he claims targets his supporters unfairly, just as he believes he is facing politically motivated charges.  He has framed the events of Jan. 6 as a ""day of love,"" asserting that his supporters were merely responding to a ""rigged"" election.  On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to commute Ross Ulbricht's sentence to time served (which is different from a pardon) and to pardon Jan. 6 defendants if re-elected, framing these actions as part of his opposition to government overreach and support for personal freedoms.  As CoinDesk reported at the time, Trump’s pledge at the Libertarian National Convention to free Ross Ulbricht, sentenced to life for creating the Silk Road marketplace, received strong support from the audience in attendance.  Although Trump didn't provide a specific reason as to why he thinks Ulbricht should be freed, many view Ulbricht’s double-life sentence without parole as excessive for a non-violent offense related to creating Silk Road, which demonstrated Bitcoin’s potential as a decentralized, censorship-resistant system.  Ulbricht's mother is leading a campaign to free him and argues that his sentence could be considered cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment, especially in comparison to what she calls some of more lenient sentences given to other Silk Road associates.  It should be noted that the Polymarket contract is for a pardon, but Trump has not promised to do that, unlike with the Jan. 6 protestors. While Ulbricht would be free with both a pardon and a commute the inconsistency in the language would likely lead to a UMA dispute -- which happens when contract language is not carefully written -- should Trump follow through with this.  Aside from these two groups, bettors are giving a 14% chance that he pardons himself, and a 6% chance he pardons Sam Bankman-Fried.",NEUTRAL,UMA,BTC | UMA,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/07/donald-trump-more-likely-to-pardon-jan-6-protestors-than-silk-road-founder-polymarket,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4efc802d8bd40a921640132bb221d258a03cd0c1-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Can SOL reach $281 amid growing DeFi demand and bullish price momentum? Having overtaken Binance Coin in total market cap, Solana is now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. With a market cap of $88.72 billion, SOL has risen by 1.80% in the past 24 hours.Currently, SOL is trading at $188, with momentum building to break through the $200 barrier. Will this rally push Solana to a new all-time high? Let’s explore.Solana Eyes $200 BreakoutIn the daily chart, Solana has increased by 21.42% in the last eight days from a low of $155. This rally has produced three consecutive bullish candles and pushed SOL past the 78.60% Fibonacci level at $179.60.Given the post-retest reversal following an inverted head-and-shoulders breakout, the Solana rally appears poised to continue. The broader market recovery could further fuel bullish sentiment and drive the price trend higher. Solana Price chart With increasing bullish momentum, both the MACD and signal lines have crossed positively. Additionally, the 100-day and 200-day simple moving averages are on the verge of a positive crossover.Fibonacci levels suggest that the uptrend may target the $201.69 level or the 100% Fibonacci level. If the rally continues, a breakout could drive Solana to the 1.272 or 1.618 Fibonacci extension levels, which are priced at $233 and $281, respectively.Therefore, with a price target of $281, Solana has a strong chance of setting a new all-time high.Solana TVL and On-Chain Data Hints Bull RunThe rising demand in DeFi has boosted Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) to $6.667 billion. With this recent surge, the Solana network is on track to surpass its 52-week trading volume high of $7.248 billion, recorded on October 27. Solana TVL Additionally, non-vote transactions on the Solana network hit 1.29 billion last month—the highest monthly total this year, just shy of the 1.37 billion transactions recorded in July.The number of active addresses on Solana is also growing exponentially.

Is There More Upside Ahead For BNB?,"In the past 24 hours, the price of Binance Coin (BNB) increased by 5%, which is indicative of a consistent upward motion. BNB, which just broke the vaunted $600 barrier, is attracting the market’s focus due to indications of bullish momentum. Related Reading: Solana Rockets Past BNB To Claim Coveted 4th Spot In Crypto Ranks However, the data at CoinCheckup suggests that BNB is trading about 20% below its expected price for the next month. This undervaluation might thus be a sign of potential for near-term profits if this trend does not change anytime soon. Binance Coin: Mixed Sentiment & Cautious Optimism BNB’s technical figures indicate a cautious optimism regarding market sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is consistently around 50, indicating a balanced sentiment that is not subject to significant pressure from either purchasers or sellers. This neutrality in itself says that the market is not overheating and, by extension, BNB could surge either way without a clear, outstanding trend. Another very important indicator to monitor is the Chaikin Oscillator, and it’s currently at -35K. Thus, there’s virtually no buying accumulation. Meanwhile, in the absence of a change in market sentiment that may attract more buyers into the fray, the lack of capital inflow might be the thing that keeps BNB from further rallies. The trading volume of BNB rises by 31% within 24 hours, therefore the market activity and interest are rising. Investor interest is observable via the figure for volume-to-market capitalization ratio, which is at 2.46% currently, and based on this increase, but what is being tested is whether interest supports the upward move of prices. Short-Term Pressures And Trading Volatility The liquidation map of BNB demonstrates concentration zones that may jeopardize price stability in the immediate term. The potential for price volatility exists if BNB surpasses $590; short positions are highly concentrated at the $583 level. This can push these short positions, and subsequently, act like a domino effect that might push prices up higher. Long liquidations are triggered when the price falls below $570. This means if the BNB price drops, sells can be accelerated as the positions near their end. These levels are the critical points a short-term trader should be watching. Depending on the behavior of the market, the price fluctuations around these levels can either have risks or present opportunities. Related Reading: Grab Ethereum Now? Expert Says Next Stop Could Be $10,000 After ‘Final Drop’ Long-Term Forecast With projections indicating a potential rise of 60% over the next three months and a subsequent increase of 30% over six months, BNB’s outlook remains optimistic (although it is important to remain cautious). Furthermore, the anticipated growth rate of 53% suggests that the 12-month forecast is robust, which is promising for investors. The recent token burn activity of BNB—leading to the definite elimination of 1.77 million tokens (which are estimated to be worth about $1 billion)—has emerged as the main reason for this positive sentiment. This supply reduction is crucial for price stability and BNB growth for long-term investors. Each burn increases the value of the remaining tokens, but the volatile market makes it uncertain how these dynamics will play out.

BlackRock's IBIT exchange-traded fund saw its biggest volume traded since its introduction.  U.S. spot-listed bitcoin ETFs saw over $620 million of net inflows.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} posted its fourth-best day of the year on Wednesday following the U.S. presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who voiced support for the crypto industry during his campaign.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value climbed more than 9% to hit a record $76,481, CoinDesk Indices data show. It hit 9.7% at the end of February, during a rally that took it to the previous high in March, gained 10% after dropping from that high and added 12% after the Aug. 5 yen carry trade unwind.  While Wednesday's swing may concern investors who think the gain is unsustainable, earlier research indicated BTC could rise 11% on a Trump victory.  Bitcoin ETF inflows  The rally coincided with massive inflows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which added a net $621.9 million, according to Farside data. The flow, one of the highest figures since the products' introduction in January, snapped a three-day streak of outflows. Total net inflows have now reached $24.2 billion.  Among notable performances, Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) registered $108.8 million, its second-biggest day since the start of trading. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw a $100.9 million inflow, also one of its biggest net inflow days.  BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), in contrast, posted a second-straight day of net outflows, losing a total of $113.3 million over the period. Trading volume in the ETF was at a record level, according to Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.  ""IBIT just had its biggest volume day ever with $4.1b traded,"" Balchunas wrote. ""That's more volume than stocks like Berkshire, Netflix, or Visa saw today. It was also up 10%, its second-best day since launching, some of this will convert into inflows"".  Overall, ""the group of bitcoin ETFs did $6b, their best day since the crazy early days. Most of the ETFs did 2x their average. It was just an all-around banger day for an infant category that never ceases to amaze,"" he wrote.  To provide some historical context, ETF trade volume reached a $9.9 billion peak during the March bull run, according to data from checkonchain. Total trade volume on Nov. 6 reached approximately $76 billion, comprising futures volume of $62 billion, spot volume of $8 billion and ETF trade volume of $6 billion, so ETF trade volume is still a small percentage of the total.  Ether {{ETH}} is lagging behind bitcoin's 2024 performance. Net inflows into ether U.S. spot ETFs totaled $52.3 million, the most since Sept. 27, according to Farside data.

Bitcoin soared to unprecedented levels on Wednesday, fueled by former President Donald Trump’s electoral victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. Specifically, the firstborn crypto hit an all-time above $76,000 yesterday.This surge triggered widespread liquidations among over-leveraged short traders, totaling over $500 million . Notably, the price later steadied at $74,812 after hitting another all-time high of $76,493.Amid ongoing price action with brief pullbacks , analyst Ali Martinez has emphasized that Bitcoin's price trajectory remains on course. Martinez previously forecasted that if Bitcoin stayed above $65,000, it could ascend to $72,000, briefly retreat to $69,000, and ultimately rally toward $78,000. Remarkably, his analysis played out as anticipated, as Bitcoin retraced below $67,000 before rebounding to a new high above $76,000.His latest projections suggest Bitcoin may soon hit $78,000, pull back to $71,500, and then surge to $85,000. At its current value, Bitcoin would need to gain 4.26%—or $3,188—to reach the $78,000 target.https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1854257141214810306Analysts Foresee 40% UpsideMeanwhile, CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju highlighted a potential 40% upside . Ju noted that Bitcoin’s market typically follows cyclical patterns, where losses during bear markets often transfer wealth from new to seasoned investors. He underscored that the current cycle aligns with an easing phase, signaling reduced market stress.Ju also highlighted that the explosive gains observed during Bitcoin’s 368% rally from $16,000 are unlikely to reoccur. He suggested a more conservative outlook for this cycle, advising holders to consider gradual profit-taking.Indicators Point to Potential PullbackAmid these bullish projections for Bitcoin, momentum indicators reflect a potential cooling off for Bitcoin following its recent highs. The price has broken through the upper Bollinger Band, signaling overbought conditions. Red candlestick formations have also emerged, suggesting increased selling pressure and potential profit-taking. BTCUSDT 1-day Chart The Relative Strength Index (RSI) further supports these signs. The RSI, previously in the overbought zone above 70, has now retreated to 67.34.

Could this rally lead to a new all-time high? PEPE is ready to steal the spotlight with the meme coin segment surging under the Dogecoin leadership. As it prepares for a breakout rally, the trend reversal in PEPE price reveals a massive upside. Will PEPE's bullish trend surge with the broader market recovery to surpass the all-time high of $0.00001722? Let’s find out the chances of PEPE creating a new ATH. PEPE Eyes Channel BreakoutIn the daily chart, the PEPE meme coin is teasing a bullish breakout rally of a falling channel pattern. The meme coin formed the channel after registering an all-time high of $0.00001722 on May 27, 2024.During the subsequent pullback, PEPE saw a 65% decline, bottoming out at $0.000005856. However, the price bottoming out at such low levels delayed the breakout of the falling channel's support trendline. PEPE price chart With the broader market now showing signs of recovery, PEPE is once again challenging the overhead resistance trendline. The meme coin has surged by 32.58% from its 7-day low of $0.000007717 to its current market price of $0.00001023.This recent price move has allowed PEPE to reclaim a psychological milestone, removing a zero from its trading price. However, it still faces resistance at both the overhead trendline and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level.Technical Indicators Signal a Potential Buying OpportunityWith the MACD and signal lines giving a positive crossover, the overall chances of a breakout rally for PEPE have significantly increased. As the buying pressure increases, along with the breakout chances, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages are preparing for a golden crossover. The 50-day and 200-day EMAs continue to have bullish trends, which means the short-term and long-term price trends remain bullish. However, in the last 100 days, the simple moving average has maintained a declining trend, reflecting a medium-term bearishness. However, the breakout rally is expected to refresh the trend sentiment if the broader market recovers. Will PEPE Reach New All-time High?Looking at the Fibonacci retracement levels, PEPE has the potential to extend its gains past the 50% retracement level at $0.00001072. The next significant level of resistance comes at the 78.6% Fibonacci level, which corresponds to a price of $0.00001370, marking a 35% upside from its current price.A further extension of the rally could bring PEPE closer to challenging its all-time high near $0.00001722. In an extended bullish scenario, price targets above the ATH are set at $0.00002145 and $0.00002952, representing potential upside of nearly 190%.On the downside, key support levels for PEPE are located at $0.0000090 and $0.0000075, which could act as crucial levels to watch in case of a market pullback.",POSITIVE,PEPE,DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/07/can-a-channel-breakout-propel-pepe-past-0-000017-to-a-new-all-time-high/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=can-a-channel-breakout-propel-pepe-past-0-000017-to-a-new-all-time-high,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This marks an important step for Kinexys in the realm of digital cross-border payments, positioning the platform as a significant player in global blockchain-based financial services. Announced by Kinexys CEO Umar Farooq at the Singapore Fintech Festival, the rebranded platform will unify all of JPMorgan’s blockchain operations under the Kinexys name, covering information, money, and asset management. Initially focused on USD and EUR transactions, Kinexys plans to support additional currencies in the future, enabling near-instant FX settlements that could minimize risks and speed up trades. Since its inception, Kinexys (formerly Onyx) has handled over $1.5 trillion in transactions, averaging $2 billion daily. The platform’s impressive growth reflects its role in facilitating seamless global transactions around the clock, including outside standard banking hours. In a press release, Kinexys announced upcoming features such as on-chain privacy, identity verification, and composability, enhancing the platform’s functionality for secure, flexible digital payments.

This move is designed to make gas fees more affordable for human users , funded by fees collected from non-human participants, including trading bots and institutional firms. The announcement comes after World’s rebranding, with a new blockchain called World Chain, which emphasizes its shift from a token-focused project to a broader ecosystem. World’s advisor, Liam Horne, explained that fees from bots, arbitragers, and institutional clients—categorized as ""non-human""—will be allocated to subsidize gas fees for private users, aligning with the project’s mission to validate human identity and curb digital impersonation through AI and deepfakes. However, World’s WLD token has continued its downward price trend, with the subsidy announcement failing to halt the token’s decline. Although WLD saw a slight price increase in the past day, this appears unrelated to the new gas plan. While the concept of “free gas for humans” is innovative, some analysts are skeptical, viewing it as a potential gimmick. Ethereum ( ETH ), for example, has successfully focused on lowering transaction fees through technical upgrades, which may provide stronger long-term results. Critics suggest that charging higher fees to institutional users could deter them from using World Chain, possibly undermining the plan’s effectiveness. Despite the catchy slogan, “taking from bots to give to humans,” there are concerns about the impact on institutional adoption. If institutional clients end up carrying the fee burden, they might find fewer incentives to participate in World’s ecosystem, potentially limiting the plan’s success in the long run.",NEUTRAL,ETH | WLD,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | WLD,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/world-s-new-gas-fee-plan:-higher-fees-for-bots-relief-for-users,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/35852000.jpeg

As the founder of Key Square Capital Management and a key economic adviser to Trump, Bessent’s positive stance on cryptocurrency is drawing significant attention in financial circles. Bessent’s enthusiasm for crypto aligns with the values of freedom and capitalism—core principles of the Republican Party. Amid his potential appointment, he has openly supported Trump’s proactive approach toward embracing digital currencies, viewing the crypto industry as a symbol of innovation and a burgeoning sector the U.S. should lead. According to Bessent , cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a platform for a new generation of investors, especially those disillusioned with traditional financial markets after the 2008 financial crisis. He sees crypto as a means to revitalize market culture, particularly among younger Americans and those previously disengaged from traditional stock markets. Bessent has criticized the Democratic Party’s cautious stance on crypto, suggesting that their approach is influenced by controversies like those associated with Sam Bankman-Fried and his contributions to the party. He believes Democratic skepticism towards crypto is a reaction to isolated incidents rather than a reflection of the sector’s potential. Looking ahead, Bessent’s perspective on integrating crypto into the U.S. economic framework is viewed as an innovative approach with potential global impact. He proposes a gradual implementation of tariffs to mitigate inflationary pressures, combined with deregulatory measures to enhance economic efficiency. If confirmed as Treasury Secretary, Bessent could drive substantial changes in U.S. financial regulations, particularly regarding digital currencies. His “layered” tariff strategy and support for a strong U.S. dollar reveal a nuanced plan that blends traditional economic principles with modern fiscal innovations. Additionally, his proposal for a “shadow” chair at the Federal Reserve hints at a potential transformation within the central bank, focusing more on guidance than direct policy enforcement. As debates over digital currencies continue in Washington , Bessent’s role in a Trump administration could signal a more crypto-friendly government stance. His views suggest a significant pivot toward integrating crypto into mainstream economic strategies, potentially boosting the U.S.'s standing in the global digital economy. Investors and market observers are closely following these developments, anticipating potential shifts in fiscal policy that could impact both traditional and digital markets.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/pro-crypto-advocate-scott-bessent-poised-to-lead-u-s-treasury-in-trump-administration,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/35851639.jpeg

Analysts are now projecting that Bitcoin could reach new heights of $100,000 before the presidential inauguration, which is just over two months away. Trump’s Election Signals Shift Toward Pro-Crypto Policies With Trump’s administration firmly established, CNBC reports that Bitcoin has already reached an all-time high of $75,500, signaling a potential shift towards a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment starting in 2025. The combination of Republican control of both the Senate and the White House is expected to bolster support for Trump’s pro-crypto initiatives, leading to further price discovery for the market’s biggest digital asset. Related Reading: Uniswap Surges Toward $8.74 – Can UNI Push Through To New Heights? Trump has made several key promises that could significantly impact the cryptocurrency landscape. One of the most notable is the establishment of a national Bitcoin stockpile, positioning the US as the “crypto capital of the world.” He has also committed to ensuring that all future Bitcoin mined in the country contributes to this national reserve. Moreover, Trump has vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the current chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), who has faced criticism for his aggressive regulatory approach under the Biden administration. Gensler’s tenure has seen numerous lawsuits targeting major players in the crypto space, including Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple Labs, resulting in nearly half a billion dollars in legal fees for those companies. Trump’s proposed crypto policy is designed to stimulate growth and adoption within the United States, with Bitcoin positioned as a central element in his strategy to tackle the national debt, which currently stands at $36 trillion. His administration’s plans have been echoed by pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis, who introduced legislation to designate Bitcoin as a national reserve asset. This initiative was discussed during her remarks at the 2024 National Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, where Trump also made a notable appearance, further solidifying his commitment to the sector. Bitcoin On Track For $100,000 Given these developments, CNBC notes that “multiple analysts” are forecasting Bitcoin could reach the $100,000 mark before Trump’s inauguration, especially if he follows through with his promise to create a national Bitcoin stockpile. The US government already possesses over $15 billion in Bitcoin from asset seizures over the years, providing a solid foundation for this initiative. In addition to Bitcoin’s rally, stocks of US-based firms such as Coinbase and Robinhood have seen significant gains in recent days. Coinbase (COIN) shares surged by 25.73%, while Robinhood (HOOD) jumped nearly 18%, reflecting the industry’s renewed confidence in a more favorable regulatory environment under Trump. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Jumps 10%+: Is More Upside Ahead? Research from Cooper Research aligns with these optimistic projections, particularly regarding the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. The firm previously estimated that ETFs could manage nearly 1 million Bitcoins by the time of the election, and currently hold approximately 986,000 BTC. Their analysis suggests that if trends continue, Bitcoin could indeed reach $100,000 by January 20, when Trump is set to be inaugurated, especially if ETFs increase their holdings to around 1.1 million BTC. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $74,750, having retreated from its current record high of $75,500 set during Wednesday’s trading session.

Armstrong has gone as far as saying that XRP will ""pump hard"" once Gensler gets the sack.Amid these speculations, analysts like JayDee are advising market participants to monitor XRP closely , consider investing in the asset, and take profits at the peak of the potential market frenzy.However, some critics argue that there is little to no correlation between Gensler’s removal and a significant price surge for XRP. As of now, XRP is trading at $0.5549, up 5% in the last 24 hours amid the post-election market optimism that is driving broader crypto price gains.Stronger Bullish Case for DogecoinMeanwhile, Dogecoin has performed even better than XRP in recent weeks, seeing a price increase of over 80%. It recently crossed $0.2100 before testing the $0.1900 level again. On one occasion, Dogecoin briefly overtook XRP to become the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, XRP has since reclaimed its position as DOGE saw a correction from its overheated rally.Dogecoin's 114X Rally PotentialMeanwhile, JayDee highlighted Dogecoin's potential to see further major price surge, particularly with Donald Trump’s election victory. This is due to Elon Musk's intentions to serve in Trump's administration, specifically under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Given Musk’s longstanding support of Dogecoin, many crypto analysts believe that the creation of a “DOGE” department within a pro-crypto Trump administration could serve as a strong bullish catalyst for the cryptocurrency.In a separate analysis, crypto expert Ali Martinez suggested that Dogecoin could surge as high as 11,486% , potentially reaching $23 during this market cycle, especially given Musk's influence, reminiscent of the meme coin's spike in 2021. Legendary analyst Peter Brandt has echoed a similar sentiment, believing in Dogecoin’s substantial upside potential.",POSITIVE,DOGE | XRP,DOGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/07/why-xrp-and-dogecoin-could-surge-massively-expert-highlights-potential-triggers/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-xrp-and-dogecoin-could-surge-massively-expert-highlights-potential-triggers,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Election-related tokens, including those linked to Trump, saw a decline in value, shaking investor confidence in PolitiFi assets. In this volatile environment, ConstitutionDAO’s PEOPLE token has shown relative stability, attracting cautious investors as other PolitiFi tokens struggle. Leading up to the election, PolitiFi tokens experienced a surge, fueled by speculation on the results. But with Trump’s victory, these election-focused assets sharply dropped, spotlighting the instability of politically driven tokens. Investors who bet on election outcomes were disappointed, as even Trump-themed tokens like TRUMP, MAGA , and TREMP saw considerable losses. This decline suggests a fading interest in speculative PolitiFi tokens, with traders pivoting away from election-linked assets. Kamala Harris-themed tokens were particularly affected, reflecting disappointment among investors who were hoping for a different outcome. In contrast, ConstitutionDAO's PEOPLE token stands out as a rare survivor amid the market’s decline. Unlike other PolitiFi tokens, PEOPLE isn’t tied to specific candidates, making it less affected by political shifts. Although it briefly dipped, PEOPLE has mostly maintained its value, hinting at its potential as a more stable choice for investors seeking refuge from the volatility of PolitiFi assets. Analysts suggest that PEOPLE’s stability may attract those looking for a less politically sensitive token in the crypto space. As the PolitiFi market faces these post-election challenges, PEOPLE could emerge as a safer option for cautious investors. Its relative stability highlights the risks of politically reactive assets and suggests that tokens less directly tied to election outcomes may perform better in unpredictable markets.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | PEOPLE,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-win-sparks-politifi-token-crash-people-stays-strong,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/35850900.jpeg

CoinShares said the bill, if adopted, would give bitcoin a similar reserve status as gold.  The passage of such legislation would lead to significant governmental and institutional interest in bitcoin, the asset manager said.  Donald Trump's administration is likely to provide a more positive environment for cryptocurrencies, and one of the most anticipated developments is the possible adoption of the Bitcoin Act, asset manager CoinShares said in a research blog Wednesday.  ""This proposal would establish bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, with the U.S. government acquiring up to 5% of bitcoin's total supply,"" wrote James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.  That would give bitcoin {{BTC}}, the original cryptocurrency, a similar role to gold. With a recognized position within the national reserve, it would also gain greater legitimacy, the report said.  U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) introduced legislation earlier this year calling for the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve to reduce the country's national debt by buying 1 million BTC over five years. The bill, entitled Boosting Innovation, Technology and Competitiveness Through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, was introduced to the Senate in July.  President-elect Trump promised to establish a bitcoin reserve in the run-up to the election, and Lummis reiterated the plan on X following his victory.  ""If implemented, the Bitcoin Act could drive considerable institutional and governmental interest in bitcoin, potentially accelerating its growth and pushing its value to new heights,"" Butterfill wrote.  CoinShares noted that Trump has been a critic of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Gary Gensler, its chairman, particularly in regard to the agency's approach to crypto. His administration is expected to appoint new SEC leaders, which could lead to a period of more crypto-friendly regulation.  Broker Canacccord said that ""changes in the SEC posture, along with the passage of a crypto-industry regulatory framework,"" could lead to much wider adoption of digital assets by the mainstream financial services industry.  The broker noted that while the president can't fire an SEC commissioner, a reshuffle is possible, and one more crypto-friendly replacement would be Hester Peirce, it said in a research report on Wednesday.  If these changes were to happen at the SEC, it would benefit the whole industry, and in particular Coinbase (COIN) and Galaxy Digital (GLXY), Canacccord said.

The broader market has gained significant momentum as Bitcoin (BTC) rises above the $75,000 mark, briefly touching the $76,000 level. Binance Coin has been a standout among the top performers.With BNB testing the $600 zone and the possibility of a breakout, the cryptocurrency is preparing for a massive bull run. Will this surge push Binance Coin to a new all-time high, surpassing the $724 mark?Can Binance Coin Surpass its Multi-Month Resistance?On the daily chart, BNB's price action shows a swift recovery from a recent 7-day low of $543. Despite briefly dipping below the $550 psychological level and the 100-day simple moving average, the broader market's recovery has propelled Binance Coin's price upward.BNB has experienced a 9.4% jump from its 7-day low to the current market price of $594. With a 24-hour high of $611, buyers attempt to finally overcome the $600 resistance level. Binance Coin Price chart The struggle to secure a strong 24-hour close above $600 remains significant. This level has historically acted as a formidable resistance, causing several bearish reversals and coinciding with the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level.The intraday rejection at higher prices suggests the possibility of a bearish reversal, but the broader market recovery hints at the potential for an uptrend continuation. Hence, the price action traders are suggested to wait for is a strong closing before finding a bullish entry. Supporting the bullish possibility, the MACD and signal lines are on the verge of giving a positive crossover. Meanwhile, the simple moving averages 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day maintain a sideways trend following the golden crossover. Will BNB Coin Price Cross $724?BNB’s price action has formed a consistent higher-low pattern in recent intraday movements, which increases the likelihood of a bullish breakout. According to Fibonacci retracement levels, a breakout above the 61.80% level could propel Binance Coin to challenge the 78.60% level at $655, ultimately aiming for the 100% level at $724.

Experts suggest that his administration might bring in pro-business policies, which could boost Bitcoin ( BTC ), DeFi, and ETFs in the American market. Trump’s pro-crypto approach could integrate digital assets with traditional finance, fostering innovation and global acceptance of crypto. Some analysts envision a Trump-led administration embracing Bitcoin on a national scale. For example, crypto analyst Alpha_Pls proposed that Bitcoin could even be treated as a strategic reserve asset, signaling the US’s support for the crypto sector. This move could encourage other nations to see Bitcoin as a legitimate asset, positioning the US as a crypto-forward country. Trump’s return might also mean smoother regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi). Crypto commentator Pahueg speculated that DeFi would receive friendlier regulatory treatment , potentially opening doors for network-based dividends and fee switches. There’s even speculation that Trump’s policies could lead to an Ethereum staking ETF , attracting more investment into Ethereum products and paving the way for a Solana ETF by 2025 or 2026. Alpha_Pls and others also see potential in banks offering crypto services more freely under Trump’s administration. They predict fewer regulatory restrictions on banks, which could allow them to launch their own stablecoins. This development could open doors for US citizens to engage with crypto-based financial products more easily, without the red tape that has previously hampered the sector’s growth. Internationally, Trump’s policies might influence the global crypto landscape. Binance Research noted that his pro-business stance might increase market volatility, with Bitcoin and altcoins potentially hitting new highs if Trump explicitly supports crypto. His past involvement in the NFT space adds to the notion that his administration might take a more pragmatic approach to digital assets, differentiating it from previous administrations. Some even joke that Dogecoin ( DOGE ) could become the “official mascot” of the US, given Elon Musk’s influence among Trump supporters and the tech world. While humorous, it suggests a potential cultural shift in the mainstream perception of crypto under Trump’s influence. Crypto markets have already reacted, with Bitcoin hitting new highs as speculation rises about a Republican-led Washington. Trump’s tax policies and pro-business agenda could draw both traditional and crypto investors, though inflation risks remain. The Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision is another factor to watch, as it may impact Bitcoin sentiment in the near term. As Trump’s administration gears up, crypto investors are bracing for potential regulatory and market shifts. Many experts are cautiously optimistic, viewing this as a chance for the US to take the lead in crypto policy.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | ETH | MARKET,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-s-win:-a-new-era-for-crypto-,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/35850180.jpeg

Bullish momentum further engulfed the crypto market as Whale Alert pointed to a positive move by leading stablecoin issuer Tether. The company just minted $2 billion on the Ethereum network, a few days after minting $1 billion on the Tron blockchain.However, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino clarified sentiments around the latest development, noting it is different from its normal USDT deployment activities. Ardoino referenced a tweet from Tether’s official handle explaining what the stablecoin issuer aims to achieve with the Wednesday USDT mint on the Ethereum network.Tether Redeploys USDT to EthereumPer Tether’s tweet, the firm partnered with a top-tier crypto exchange to conduct a USDT chain swap. This on-chain activity involves the exchange transferring surplus USDT on a network to Tether’s Treasury wallet, and the issuer, in turn, mints the received amount on a new blockchain.The chain swap activity will not increase Tether’s total USDT supply, as the received tokens are burned. Meanwhile, the reallocation would offset the amount of the stablecoin in circulation on each of the involved blockchains. Tether noted that it intends to shift its surplus USDT stash on some chains to the Ethereum network, where it is in high demand. The firm partnered with an exchange to move 1B USDT from Tron, 600 million USDT from Avalanche, 300 million USDT from the Near Protocol, 75 million USDT from CELO, and 60 million USDT from the EOS Network.Meanwhile, the Tron network remains the chain holding the largest amount of USDT in circulation despite the 1 billion USDT reallocation. Tether’s transparency page shows the chain has $61.2 billion USDT in circulation, while the Ethereum network holds $56.2 billion.Tether Injects $1.85B USDT Into ExchangesFollowing the chain swap, Tether injected 1.85 billion USDT on the Ethereum network. Data shows that the leading issuer moved 1.7 billion USDT to Binance, $101.7 million to Coinbase, 20 million USDT to OKX, and $17.86 million to Kraken.Notably, the surging interest and trading activities on exchanges may have prompted the fund injection. USDT’s trading volume stands at $129 billion, more than 100% of its $121 billion circulating supply, indicating growing usage of the stablecoin.Meanwhile, the asset’s expanding importance in the crypto sector saw it record an impressive $2.5 billion in profits for Q3 2024.

Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Has Risen Alongside The Latest Rally In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has discussed about the MVRV Ratio of Bitcoin. The “MVRV Ratio” is an on-chain metric that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and realized cap. The market cap here is just the total valuation of BTC’s circulating supply at the current spot price. The other metric, the realized cap, is also a capitalization model for the asset, but it doesn’t work so simply. Related Reading: Ethereum Volatility Soon? Derivatives Exchanges Receive 82,000 ETH In Deposits Unlike the market cap, this model doesn’t put the same price on every coin in circulation; rather, it assumes that the last price at which a token was transacted represents its ‘true’ value. The previous transaction of any coin is likely to represent the last point it switched hands, so the realized cap essentially takes the sum of the cost basis of all tokens in circulation. One way to look at this model is as a measure of the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. The market cap, in contrast, signifies the value that these holders are carrying in the present. When the MVRV Ratio is greater than 1, it means that the market cap is above the realized cap right now. Such a trend suggests the investors as a whole are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, the indicator being below this mark implies the average holder is currently underwater as they are holding their coins at a value below the price they bought them for. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio had surged to significant levels back when BTC had broken the November 2021 all-time high (ATH) in the first quarter of the year. An increase in the metric has also followed in the new ATH break, but the metric is clearly not near the same high as earlier in the year yet. Historically, the cryptocurrency has made tops whenever the indicator has risen to high levels. As the quant has marked in the chart, however, how high is a ‘high’ MVRV level has been declining over the last few cycles. If the trendline drawn by the analyst holds, then the current cycle should see a top around when the MVRV Ratio would hit a value of around 3. At present, the metric is at 2, so there may still be a while to go before Bitcoin becomes overheated. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rockets Up 12%, But This FOMO Signal Could End Rally As for why the asset tends to get overheated when the MVRV Ratio shoots up, the reason is that investors become increasingly likely to take part in profit-taking the larger their gains get. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $74,100, up almost 8% over the last 24 hours.

35861336,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100725,1730968668,Here are Top 7 Crypto Promises from US President-Elect Donald Trump,"Following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we have highlighted his top seven pro-crypto promises made during his campaign. The crypto community is buzzing with excitement following Donald Trump's emergence as president-elect of the United States. Trump emerged victorious in the presidential election after securing an outstanding 295 electoral college votes. US Presidential Election His emergence as president-elect of the 2024 U.S. election has already given the crypto market a breath of fresh life. This is reflected in Bitcoin’s surge to an all-time high, which came immediately after it became evident that Trump was winning the polls. Top 7 Donald Trump 2024 Pro-Crypto Promises The positive reaction witnessed in the crypto market over the past few days demonstrates investors’ excitement about Trump’s victory. Unlike Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump made several pro-crypto promises that, if implemented, could transform the United States into a global crypto leader. Prominent crypto expert Altcoin Daily highlighted Trump’s promises for the industry. He made these promises at different campaign locations, including the 2024 Bitcoin Conference . Sack Gary Gensler At the Bitcoin Conference, Trump excited the crowd after he promised to sack SEC Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office. Over the past four years, Gensler earned a reputation for himself in the global crypto space due to his adverse regulatory approach, which prioritizes enforcement actions over clear rulemaking. Gensler’s potential removal and the appointment of a pro-crypto SEC administration could mark the beginning of positive developments in the U.S. crypto sector. National Bitcoin Stockpile The president-elect also promised to establish a national reserve of Bitcoin (BTC) under his administration. This initiative would see the U.S. government hold Bitcoin as part of its reserve assets. During an interview with FOX, he suggested that the United States government could leverage its Bitcoin reserve to pay off the country’s $35 trillion federal debt. US as the Crypto Capital of the World Trump promised to introduce favorable regulations that would transform the United States into the crypto capital of the world. With friendly regulatory policies, the United States could position itself as a top destination for crypto businesses, attracting developers worldwide to the country. Dominating Bitcoin Mining In June, the president-elect revealed plans to ensure that Bitcoin’s remaining supply will be mined in the United States and nowhere else. He suggested that this move would help the United States to be energy dominant. Fair and Clear Regulatory Changes The United States crypto industry has endured stringent regulation under the current administration. All efforts to get regulatory clarity from the U.S. SEC have ended in futility. Interestingly, this challenge might soon end under Trump’s administration, as he promised to support clear and fair regulations. In particular, he noted plans to establish a crypto advisory council in his first 100 days in office. This group will focus on advising him on crypto-related matters, including proposing policies that could drive the industry’s growth. Right to Self-Custody Most industry participants advocate for holding their crypto tokens themselves, giving them full control over their assets. In July, Trump recognized this importance and promised to defend the right to self-custody. His promise aligns with a similar move made by Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC), who introduced the ‘Keep Your Coin Act’ last year. This bill opposes the move to restrict U.S. residents from initiating transactions directly from self-hosted wallets. If Trump implements his right to self-custody campaign promise, Americans will continue to retain full access to their crypto without relying on third-party platforms. No CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) Trump is not a fan of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which he considers a threat to financial privacy. As a result, he declared plans to prevent the United States from having its own CBDC under his administration. For context, CBDCs are similar to stablecoins, as they are both pegged to an asset like the U.S. dollar. The difference between them is that while the government issues CBDCs, private companies issue stablecoins. Since the government is responsible for CBDC issuance, Trump believes its development could be utilized to evade people’s financial privacy.Given Trump’s remarkable promises for crypto, investors are anticipating their impact on the market once implemented. Notably, Trump’s administration will officially commence on January 20, 2025, marking his inauguration day.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/07/here-are-top-7-crypto-promises-from-us-president-elect-donald-trump/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-top-7-crypto-promises-from-us-president-elect-donald-trump,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42390081,9Afj03q8yj9PaLwKaZouHH,1730968054,Bitcoin Soars as Gold Dips: The Stellar 12% Surge in BTC/XAU Signals a Market Shift,"BTC/Gold registers its biggest single-day rise since February 2022.  Renewed uptrend points to bitcoin outperformance ahead and potential rotation of money out of the yellow metal.  A week ago, CoinDesk reported that bitcoin’s price rally is expected to gain momentum as gold loses its bullish edge, prompting a rotation of capital from the yellow metal into the leading cryptocurrency by market value.  The pivotal moment appears to be here, bolstering the case for a continued BTC price to $80,000 and higher by the year-end, according to the latest developments in the ratio between bitcoin’s per-piece dollar price and gold’s per-ounce price.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, jumped nearly 10% to record highs above $76,000 Wednesday, as the pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile, gold fell 3% to $2,658. As such, the BTC/gold (BTC/XAU) ratio surged 12% Wednesday, registering BTC’s biggest single-day outperformance relative to gold since Feb. 28, 2022, according to charting platform TradingView.  More importantly, Wednesday’s surge confirmed an end of an eight-month-long downtrend, identified by a trendline connecting highs in March and June.  The breakout suggests a renewed outperformance of bitcoin relative to gold, fueled in part by investors reallocating their funds from the yellow metal to BTC.  “Analyzing the BTC to gold ratio, we can see that the downtrend [indicative of gold’s outperformance since March] is starting to reverse. Globally, investors will increasingly focus on hedging against currency debasement and capitalizing on the Trump market play, both of which favor BTC,” Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter said.  BTC also stands to benefit from the expected regulatory clarity for the digital asset industry and increased institutional adoption under Trump’s presidency. There is speculation that the Trump administration could build a strategic bitcoin reserve.  Meanwhile, gold’s fate will likely be decided by the expectations of elevated interest rates under the Trump presidency, which could dent its appeal.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/07/this-metric-points-to-rotation-from-gold-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0c22a057db4cc64983ae40bd3e8b719927612dd-1246x580.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, PoliFi tokens also act as a ticket for a themed-community, which has longer staying power than speculating on numbers going up.  The crypto market seems to be losing interest in Political Finance (PoliFi) memecoins a day after Donald Trump was re-elected president of the United States.  MAGA, the Trump-themed PoliFi token that is credited with creating the genre is down nearly 49% on-day, and nearly 50% during the last week. Its Kamala Harris-themed counterpart, Kamala Horris, trading as KAMA, is down 75% during the same time period.  Now the question is, like prediction markets – Polymarket's betting volume consisted of 75% election-related markets, according to Dune – are PoliFi tokens ready for their next act.  In theory, PoliFi tokens are supposed to rise whenever there is a positive event involving the candidate they are tied to.  Shortly after the MAGA token's launch in February, Mechanism Capital's Andrew Kang said in an interview that a Trump-themed PoliFi token leverages Trump's media presence in the attention economy, ""and Trump is probably one of the best attention monopolizers in the world.""  At the time, Kang also hedged his optimism for the token post-election by saying there might be a “sell the news” effect.  ""However, I anticipate a period of consolidation following his election victory, similar to how dogecoin behaved after it became associated with Elon Musk,"" he said at the time.  The MAGA token has also struggled to hit higher levels of liquidity because it was blocked from major retail centralized exchanges (CEX).  While the token trades on a number of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and some lesser-known exchanges like Gate.io, MEXC, and BingX, it was blocked from being listed on Kraken, ByBit, and OKX.  Kraken, for its part, lists the satirical TREMP, as well as BODEN.  It could also be that traders are shifting into {{BTC}} after the election, as bitcoin blew past its all-time high, with some bullish market observers calling for $100k by the end of the year. Potentially challenging that thesis, however, is that memecoins are up by 12% on-day, according to CoinGecko data, and one would expect them to drop as well if traders were broadly shifting into BTC.  Of course, number-go-up isn't the only use case for PoliFi tokens.

42390080,9Afj03q8yj9PaLwKaZouEm,1730961392,Ether Surges 10% as Trump Victory Brings Back DeFi Bullishness,"Ether saw a 10% increase in the last 24 hours, reaching over $2,800, while other cryptocurrencies experienced profit-taking.  This surge is linked to optimism around DeFi following Trump's presidential win, where expectations of pro-crypto policies and deregulation are boosting investor confidence.  Trump’s potential policies might ease regulatory burdens, allowing DeFi projects more freedom and possibly recognizing tokens as commodities, which could enhance the sector's growth and innovation.  Ether {{ETH}} crossed $2,800 for the first time since early August, breaking out of rangebound trading that saw prices stuck between $2,300 and $2,600 levels despite a breakout in bitcoin {{BTC}}. A ratio tracking the performance of the two majors slid to April 2021 levels on Tuesday — indicative of a fallout in investor demand for ETH.  But President-elect Donald Trump’s victory is bringing back hopes of a decentralized finance (DeFi) bull market, at least among some investors, and with it demand for ETH.  “DeFi Renaissance thesis is progressing as expected with Trump deregulation and crypto friendly policy and rule-making from Republican admin and Senate,” wrote Arthur Cheong, co-founder at DeFiance Capital, in an X post. “Elon gonna help usher in the golden age of innovation and capitalism.”  In early October, Cheong published a viral thesis on why DeFi applications could see a bump in user base and token demand after a disappointing few years — pointing to growing activity metrics and an increase in new money flowing into DeFi projects.  “In fact, some foundational DeFi projects, like Aave, have even surpassed their 2022 peak in several metrics. Aave’s quarterly revenue has surpassed that of 4Q21 — considered the height of the last bull market,” Cheong said. “This signals that DeFi is maturing and entering a new phase of productivity, poised for long-term scalability.”  The bullish sentiment comes from Trump's promise to make the U.S. a leading hub for cryptocurrency during his campaigns, which might translate into more favorable regulations for DeFi.  The campaign indicated a move toward reducing the regulatory burden on crypto, potentially making it easier for DeFi platforms to operate within the U.S. This could involve clearer guidelines for token offerings, possibly recognizing certain tokens as commodities rather than securities under SEC oversight.  “Imagine the next 4 years being the complete opposite of the last few years when it comes to what DeFi projects are ""allowed"" to do,” said Ethereum educator @sassal0x in an X post. “Fee switches, fee switches everywhere!”  Some even point out the Trump family’s backing of World Liberty Financial as a key reason for the market sentiment.  Traders are already reacting favorably to Trump's presidency. Mindshare - a tracker of social media sentiment on X - for DeFi is leading among other trending sectors such as AI and memecoins in the past 24 hours, per Kaito data.

Fibonacci Extensions Hint At Massive Upside With Musk-Trump Influence,"Elon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin (DOGE), could be on the verge of a massive parabolic rally following the recent victory of Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump. Could Trump’s Victory Catapult Dogecoin To $23? Earlier today, Trump was elected the 47th US president with a convincing win over Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Following Trump’s victory, Bitcoin (BTC) surged past its all-time high (ATH) of $73,737, reaching unprecedented levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Sets Sights on $0.150: Will The Rally Take Off? While BTC is trading at new highs, the ripple effect of a Trump victory is expected to impact other digital currencies, especially Musk’s preferred Dogecoin. According to crypto technical analyst Ali Martinez’s analysis, DOGE is nearing a breakthrough at the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement level, potentially leading to a rally up to the 1.618 or even the 2.272 Fibonacci extension levels. For the uninitiated, Fibonacci extensions are used in technical analysis to project possible future price targets by identifying key support and resistance levels. Historically, DOGE has frequently aligned with Fibonacci extension levels during bull runs. According to Martinez, if DOGE follows a similar trajectory in the next bull run, it could surge to anywhere between $4 and $23. The chart below illustrates that the next significant Fibonacci extension level for DOGE is 1.00, placing its price just above $0.739, beyond its current ATH of $0.7316, set in May 2021. Currently, DOGE is trading at $0.202, having risen an impressive 18% in the past 24 hours, largely fueled by Trump’s victory. If DOGE reaches the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, its price could jump to $3.94 – more than five times its current ATH. Under extremely bullish conditions, DOGE could even hit the 2.272 Fibonacci extension level, pushing its price to $23.25 – nearly a 100x increase from its present value. The Potential Impact Of Elon Musk In Trump’s Cabinet While Musk’s potential role in Trump’s cabinet remains unclear, the world’s richest man will likely hold significant influence during Trump’s term as president. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rockets Up 12%, But This FOMO Signal Could End Rally Musk has frequently voiced his support for DOGE on social media platform X, often triggering short-term price surges driven by retail investor interest. With Musk’s possible influence in the new administration, it wouldn’t be surprising to see policy decisions that could indirectly benefit cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. Data shows that DOGE whales may anticipate a significant price surge, as recent transactions indicate the accumulation of more than 2.1 billion tokens over the past week. That said, DOGE investors should exercise caution as the token has already experienced a substantial run-up recently and may be flashing overbought signals. At press time, BTC is trading at $74,249, up 8% in the last 24 hours.

42415568,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOK3X9,1730957148,Bitcoin Fed Preview: Powell's Take on 'Trump Tariffs' Could Shake Markets as 25bp Rate Cut is a Foregone Conclusion,"Thursday's expected 25 basis point Fed rate cut is likely to be a non-event.  Powell's response to questions on President-elect Donald Trump's inflationary policy stance will likely move markets.  For bitcoin {{BTC}} traders, Thursday's Federal Reserve (Fed) rate decision will primarily focus on the central bank's commentary, especially concerning the anticipated inflationary effects of President-elect Donald Trump's promised policies, rather than the decision itself, which seems to be priced in.  Background  In September, the Fed delivered an outsized 50 basis points (bps) rate cut, kicking off the so-called liquidity easing cycle in a positive development for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The Fed funds futures show expectations for a quarter-point rate cut on Thursday and a similar move in December, followed by a pause in January and multiple cuts through 2025.  The current target range of 4.75% to 5% for the Fed funds rate (benchmark borrowing cost) is well above the ""neutral"" level, estimated between 3%-3.5%. The consensus, therefore, is that the Fed has plenty of room to normalize the overly tight monetary policy with rate cuts, more so since the labor market cooled significantly in October.  The neutral level is the one where interest rates are neither restrictive nor expansionary.  Thursday's rate cut priced in  The CME's FedWatch tool shows traders assigning a nearly 100% chance of the Fed reducing the benchmark interest rate range to the 4.5%-4.7% range Thursday.  In other words, the 25 bps rate cut is already priced in and, by itself, could be a non-event.  Comments on Trump's tariffs plan  The cooling of inflation in the U.S. this year has redirected the Fed's focus on supporting the labor market by normalizing what has been an overtly restrictive monetary policy. However, Republican candidate Donald Trump's victory in Tuesday's presidential election might disrupt these plans and the market would love to hear what the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell thinks of it.  Trump has already secured the Senate, and potential control of the House will boost his ability to enact his poll promises – tax cuts and loose fiscal policy while implementing high import tariffs on major trading partners like China and Mexico. The economic plan will likely underpin inflation, potentially forcing the Fed to keep rates elevated.  During the post-rate decision press conference, Powell is likely to get questions about the election and possible inflation resurgence under Trump.  Bitcoin and other risk assets may see downside volatility if Powell expresses concerns about Trump's proposed policies, forcing markets to reassess expectations for rate cuts in the coming months. The BTC rally will likely continue if Powell avoids commenting on the matter, reiterating the data-dependent stance.  BTC jumped to record highs above $75,000 Wednesday in hopes of friendlier regulatory policies under Trump presidency.  Fed to err on the side of caution  After misjudging the coronavirus-induced supply-push inflation as transitory in 2021, there is a strong possibility of the Fed slowing down its normalization in anticipation of large tariff increases.  ""We think policymakers could err on the side of the caution by pausing the cutting cycle if large tariff increases are announced, Bank of America's global research team said in a note to clients Tuesday.  ""All else equal, we think further fiscal expansion means a higher terminal fed funds rate,"" the research team added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/07/bitcoin-fed-preview-powells-take-on-trump-tariffs-eyed-amid-anticipated-25bps-fed-rate-cut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/facd364c41742d1a8df3c193d7c94b945ecc0985-1920x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This surge in price has raised hopes that Ethereum may be gearing up for a fresh bull run.

Derivatives Exchanges Receive 82,000 ETH In Deposits Rising Futures Metrics: A Double-Edged Sword According to CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC, key metrics such as the Ethereum futures market’s open interest and funding rates indicate heightened participation and a generally positive market sentiment. The open interest reflects the total number of outstanding futures contracts, while funding rates provide insight into the cost of holding a long or short position. Shayan pointed out that these indicators have steadily risen in recent weeks, suggesting a renewed interest in Ethereum trading. This increase in participation aligns with the broader price movements and highlights a growing enthusiasm among futures traders betting on Ethereum’s continued upward momentum. However, while increased participation and positive funding rates often indicate a strong market, they also come with inherent risks. Shayan emphasized that although neither metric has reached levels that would be considered dangerously high, there remains a potential for heightened volatility. Overly high optimism in the futures market could lead to an imbalance, making Ethereum vulnerable to sudden and severe price swings. The CryptoQuant analyst explained that a sudden spike in open interest and funding rates might trigger what is known as a “long liquidation cascade.” This occurs when leveraged traders are forced to sell their positions due to adverse price movements, which can lead to a sharp decline in market value. Such liquidations can quickly erode investor confidence and drive prices lower. Regardless, the analyst suggested that the current open interest levels and funding rates suggest there is still room for growth. Navigating Potential Ethereum Volatility Given the current market conditions, Shayan offered prudent advice to Ethereum market participants. He recommended that investors closely monitor open interest and funding rates as key market sentiment indicators. According to the analyst, by keeping a watchful eye on these metrics, investors can better manage their risk exposure and be prepared for any sudden changes in the market.

As a result, most of the market saw a green daily close, with Solana (SOL) recording a 15.8% surge in the last 24 hours and regaining a key support level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Gearing Up For Massive Bullish Wave Following 8% Daily Surge, 110% Rally Ahead? Solana Dethrones BNB As 4th Largest Crypto The result of the US elections gave the crypto market the long-awaited boost many investors and market watchers expected. In the early hours of Wednesday, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization surged about 8.6% toward its new ATH of $75,358. This surge, fueled by the victory of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump and a mostly crypto-friendly Congress over US Vice President Kamala Harris, ignited a bullish rally across the market. Solana followed BTC’s lead and jumped over 15% to turn the $180 level into support. Moreover, the cryptocurrency reached its highest price since July, nearing the $190 resistance level. SOL’s daily activity skyrocketed in the last 24 hours, rising 210% to a $10.7 billion daily trading volume. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency saw a 14.66% increase in market capitalization, surging to an $88.1 billion market cap. As a result, Solana flipped Binance Coin (BNB)’s $85 billion market cap, dethroning BNB as the fourth largest cryptocurrency by this metric. This performance fueled investors’ bullish sentiment on the cryptocurrency, with some market watchers predicting a bullish wave towards Q1’s highs. Is SOL Getting Ready For $400? Solana was deemed one of the strongest cryptocurrencies during Q3’s market retraces, holding above its breakout levels while most altcoins struggled. Following last night’s performance, crypto Trader Koz called SOL’s chart “one of the absolute best-looking charts out there.” The cryptocurrency’s surge above the $180 mark represents a breakout from an 8-month consolidation range that started after Solana hit its yearly high of $202. Similarly, World of Charts considers SOL as ‘looking more bullish than before.” The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency finally broke above the upper line of a bullish flag pattern after nearly breaking above it in late October. World of Charts suggested that after the successful breakout, a massive bullish wave is around the corner. To the analyst, this wave could ultimately send Solana’s price toward a new ATH of $400. Moreover, crypto analyst Jelle highlighted the breakout, stating that SOL is ready to retest the yearly highs. Related Reading: PolitiFi Memecoins Soar: Trump-Themed Tokens Rally 30% Ahead Of US Elections A reclaim of the $200 mark, not seen since March, could propel the cryptocurrency above its ATH of $260 in the coming weeks. However, it is key that Solana holds the $180 mark to continue its bullish ascend, as a rejection from this zone could see SOL’s price pullback to the $160 support. SOL trades at $186.9, a 4.12% and 27.56% increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

42390084,9Afj03q8yj9PaLwKaZouOm,1730949536,What Next for Bitcoin After Trump Win? Traders Look to Fed Rate Cuts as BTC Sets New Highs at $76K,"Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $76,000 following Donald Trump's election victory, reflecting a bullish market sentiment.  The market anticipates a 0.25% Federal Reserve rate cut, which typically supports risk assets like Bitcoin by increasing liquidity and weakening the dollar.  Traders are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next moves, particularly any signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments. There's a mixed outlook with concerns about potential hawkish policies dampening market enthusiasm.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} surged to a new all-time high of $76,000 late Wednesday following Republican Donald Trump’s win at the U.S. elections, ushering in a widely expected bullish era for the crypto sector.  BTC added 6.6% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, extending 30-day gains to over 21% and more than doubling in value over the past year. Strength in BTC saw everything from dog-themed tokens to those of decentralized exchanges zooming more than 10% — mirroring a stock and bond market rally that’s quickly being described as the “Trump trade.”  “BTC has now navigated three election cycles since its inception in 2009, each followed by rallies to new highs, with prices never dipping back to pre-election levels,” QCP Capital traders said in a Telegram broadcast late Tuesday. “The dollar surged 1.2% to reach July highs of 105, with yields also climbing as markets anticipate stronger economic growth and increased fiscal spending.”  “We expect this bullish momentum to hold strong as we head into 2025,” QCP added.  But now that Trump has been elected to office, what’s next for the markets in the short term? Traders are quickly turning their eyes to the next round of Federal Reserve rate cuts scheduled for later Thursday. A pivot to lower borrowing costs has historically buoyed bullish sentiment among traders as cheap access to money spurts growth in riskier sectors.  Analysts expect a 0.25% rate cut this week, which has historically benefited assets like BTC by diluting the dollar's value and pushing investors towards alternative investments. There’s a 97% chance for a 25 bps cut on Polymarket, with 1% for 50 bps and even lower for higher.  “A 25bps rate cut is widely anticipated, with the market pricing in a 96.8% probability of such a move (according to FedWatch),” shared Min Jung, research analyst at Presto Research, in a note to CoinDesk. “However, the rates market has been signaling uncertainty, evidenced by the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbing to 4.48%, its highest level over four months.”  “This increase reflects expectations that a Trump election win could lead to higher deficits and inflation. Therefore, attention will be focused on Powell’s press conference for insights, particularly since November does not include a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) update,” Min added.  Some consider hedging bets if Fed chair Jerome Powell’s speech gives bearish signals.  “A hawkish tilt on Thursday's FOMC would be an unwelcome development for the market, but an insistence on staying on the current dovish path would also risk a potential yield tantrum as bond buyers go on a buyer's strike into year-end,” Augustine Fan, dead of Insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  “Furthermore, with China likely to respond with a more aggressive easing policy in light of the tariff-heavy policies from Trump, there appears to be no end to bond supply and we fear that the move higher in USD FX and yields could be a significant risk-dampener at some point,” Fan added.  As such, there’s also attention on another stimulus package out of China, which tended to influence bitcoin prices despite cryptocurrency trading being illegal in the country. China's potential easing policies in response to US tariffs could introduce volatility, particularly affecting the dollar's strength and yield movements.  Meanwhile, some traders don’t foresee additional rate cuts in the Trump administration.  “Despite expectations for a decrease in rate cut probabilities due to Trump’s ""friendlier"" proposed policies, the market is still pricing in 1.8 cuts this year and 3 more cuts next year,” QCP said in its Wednesday note.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/07/what-next-for-bitcoin-after-trump-win-traders-look-to-fed-rate-cuts-for-bullish-btc-move,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e140eba85e1266a050930a7ef5582d2306bc854-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite this rally, ETH still trades below a crucial resistance level, keeping the price in check since early August. This resistance, a critical barrier, must be cleared for Ethereum to regain its bullish momentum fully. Analysts are watching closely, with top crypto expert Inmortal sharing a recent technical analysis that suggests Ethereum could be gearing up for a significant breakout. Related Reading: Solana ‘Must Break Descending Resistance’ To Regain Bullish Momentum – Analyst According to Inmortal’s analysis, ETH appears to be building strength, and a push above this resistance could unlock the potential for a sustained rally. The market’s response to Trump’s win, particularly as he is seen as a pro-crypto candidate, has boosted sentiment, and many now anticipate increased volatility and upside for Ethereum. Investors are now eyeing ETH’s next moves, with any break above the current resistance likely to signal the beginning of a stronger upward trend. As Ethereum inches closer to this key level, market participants are preparing for what could be a defining moment in ETH’s performance this cycle. Ethereum Pushing Key Supply Ethereum is pushing to break a critical resistance at $2,750, a level that has kept ETH under pressure since early August. This resistance has been a strong barrier; breaking above it is essential for confirming a sustained rally. Top crypto analyst and investor Immortal recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, where he outlined a $3,400 price target for ETH if it successfully clears this key resistance. In his analysis, Inmortal emphasized that Ethereum, often dubbed the “most hated coin” in the current market, is worth paying close attention to despite its recent underperformance. Many investors have expressed frustration with ETH’s lagging momentum compared to other assets, making a breakout above $2,750 a potential game-changer for sentiment and price action. The coming days will be pivotal as the market digests the impact of Donald Trump’s election victory and prepares for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Thursday. Trump’s win has already created bullish momentum across the crypto market, and Ethereum’s breakout could capitalize on this shift in sentiment. However, volatility may remain high, and any unexpected news from the Fed could impact ETH’s trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Shares Correlation With S&P500 – Last Dip Before It Hits $10,000? If ETH can hold above $2,750 and continue pushing higher, the $3,400 target outlined by Inmortal could come within reach, marking a strong recovery phase for Ethereum. For now, the crypto community will be watching closely, as this breakout level can potentially define Ethereum’s performance in the months ahead. ETH Technical Analysis Ethereum is trading at $2,620 after a solid 12% surge from recent lows at $2,355. This price movement has given bulls hope that a rally may be on the horizon. However, ETH must break above the key $2,750 resistance level for the bullish momentum to continue and reclaim price action. This level coincides with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), a crucial indicator of long-term strength. A breakout above this level and a successful retest would signal a market sentiment shift, confirming that ETH is on track to regain bullish control. The 200-day EMA is often viewed as a significant support level once the price holds above it. If Ethereum manages to close above this level and maintain the price, it could spark further upside movement. On the other hand, if Ethereum fails to break above $2,750 and struggles to hold, it would signal a failed breakout.

35823062,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=651855,1730937681,"This Crypto Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Rise To $75,000, Here’s The Full Prediction","The Bitcoin price has hit a new All-Time High (ATH), marking a historical milestone in the crypto market. With a remarkable rally surpassing $75,000, Bitcoin is experiencing considerable momentum, driven primarily by market sentiment surrounding the US elections. A crypto analyst who had accurately predicted Bitcoin’s rise to $75,000 has now set a new price target for the pioneer cryptocurrency, anticipating further bullish movement. Analyst Set $170,000 Price ATH For The Bitcoin Price TradingShot, a crypto analyst on TradingView, has released a brief Bitcoin analysis report, referencing historical trends to predict a new all-time high of $170,000 for Bitcoin. Sharing a price chart depicting Bitcoin’s price movements from 2022 to the present, the analyst disclosed that on August 5, Bitcoin was testing the 1-week Moving Average (MA50), a level that has never been reached since March 12, 2003. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? In previous market cycles, this crucial level was the absolute supporting trendline that signaled a potential bull market. TradingShot revealed that after almost 20 years, the Bitcoin price was finally able to hold this key trendline not once but twice, leading to its last-week rally that saw its price testing the $73,800 mark. The analyst also highlighted that this price surge was an incredibly bullish move, indicating a strong market for Bitcoin. Moreover, the $73,800 Bitcoin price increase occurred just two days before the US Presidential elections, a period historically known to trigger explosive rallies for Bitcoin. Market expert Crypto Rover on X (formerly Twitter) notes that Bitcoin has experienced a total average price pump of 1,563% following the previous US elections. In 2016, Bitcoin rallied 2,714%, exceeding $15,000 after the US Presidential elections. Similarly, in 2020, the cryptocurrency soared over 400%, surpassing $40,000 after the elections. Now, Bitcoin is clearly on a significant uptrend after the just-concluded US presidential elections on November 4. Given the timing of these rallies, TradingShot has suggested that a similar pattern may be repeating, implying that Bitcoin could be entering a period of explosive growth. Based on chart analysis and Fibonacci levels, the analyst has projected a new target of $170,000 for Bitcoin, representing approximately 1.618 Fibonacci extensions from its current ATH. With the Bitcoin price currently trading at $73,715, having given up some gains, a surge to $170,000 would represent a 130,55% increase. BTC Finally Hits Anticipated Price Discovery With Bitcoin finally reaching a new ATH after months of speculation and anticipation, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has disclosed that this surge signals the cryptocurrency’s entry into its price discovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Record Largest Accumulation Week Since January With 2.10 Billion Tokens Bought A Bitcoin price discovery refers to how the market determines the current value or price based on supply and demand dynamics. Despite the new achievement, Martinez has revealed that investors are attempting to short Bitcoin by liquidating their holdings and cashing out profits. As a result, the analyst predicts that if Bitcoin goes back to the $75,550 price high, $210 million could be liquidated from the market.
