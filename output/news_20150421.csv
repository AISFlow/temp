42426347,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMc7h,1429647503,Bitcoin Exchange DWV Launches in Remote Western Australia,"A new bitcoin exchange has launched in Perth, the largest city and capital of Western Australia, a rural state with roughly one inhabitant per square kilometer.  Called Digital World Ventures (DWV), the bitcoin-only exchange will aim to target consumers across the country who want trade between the Australian dollar (AUD) and bitcoin by leveraging exchange software provider AlphaPoint.  DWV director James Clarke and co-founder Ian Davies suggested that despite his company's location, he believes it has much offer a market he characterized as lacking a strong approach to customer service or technology.  Davies told CoinDesk:  ""We've got a lot of people coming into the exchange space that either have a heavy technical focus or we've got the finance guys coming in and running exchanges. Because we've experienced both sides, we're able to bring that together.""  Davies previously worked as a support technician for IBM and boasts experience running service desks, while Clarke was formerly a systems analyst for Barclays Bank.  Trading fees will start at 0.70% on BTC trades of $AUD500 or less, a figure that decreases to as low as 0.08% on trades of $AUD200,000 or more. The exchange will also charge goods and services tax (GST) on transaction fees paid by buyers and sellers.  Exchange consolidation  Clarke and Davies also addressed the ongoing consolidation in the bitcoin exchange and marketplace space, which has seen former market leaders such as Buttercoin, Cavirtex and Vault of Satoshi close in recent months. DWV said its business account with Westpac Bank and the liquidity provided by AlphaPoint's global exchange network would help mitigate this risk.  ""We're all about stability and building brand awareness,"" Clarke said. ""That starts with finding that banking partner. We don't have concerns like in Canada where banks are freezing their accounts.""  Clarke suggested that in the face of what he acknowledged could be a continuing trend, DWV would further seek to reach out to connect with the local community.  ""We want to make everyone aware we are who we are, we're not intending to go anywhere. Hopefully that generates comfort that we're not going to be another Mt Gox, we're here for the longer term, we have a financial viable model and a fantastic technology model,"" he continued.  Looking forward, the exchange will seek to establish a physical presence in Perth, enabling cash trading and creating another level of comfort with users, though this is an idea that has not yet reached development stage.  ""We want people to feel comfortable about who they're dealing with,"" Davies added.  Bootstrapped business  Clarke and Davies reported to launching the exchange using a mix of self-financing and peer-to-peer lending enabled by BitLendingClub, though they suggested that this will help them move forward toward profitability quickly.  An active user of the platform, Davies secured a 15 BTC loan from the community on 14th March, an extension he said would be needed to provide added liquidity to the exchange while promoting its brand to the public. Davies has a 100% positive rating on the service, having actively used the platform to trade on LocalBitcoins.  Davies' profile on the website suggests DWV sought a loan of 40 BTC in February to help launch the exchange.  At the time, Davies' wrote that he expected the exchange to break even on its investments within the first three months of operation.

42426346,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMc5h,1429646423,DigitalTangible Rebrands as Serica in Push Beyond Precious Metals,"Crypto 2.0 startup DigitalTangible has announced it will rebrand as Serica (Greek for silk), a move that marks an expansion of the digital asset trading service beyond precious metals.  Launched in September 2014, DigitalTangible has long used Counterparty to allow users to trade between bitcoin and cryptographic tokens representing physical precious metals holdings. As Serica, the company aims to expand this model, allowing anyone with the rights to an asset to create digital tokens that can then be traded on a global market.    Serica CEO Taariq Lewis suggested that the move was a strategic one, led by customers who saw the potential of the service to evolve its formerly niche offering. Whereas DigitalTangible targeted bitcoin traders who sought to use gold's relative price stability as a safety net, Serica uses digital asset trading to allow owners of physical property to trade it in digital form.    Lewis told CoinDesk:  ""We have customers that want to invest in US-based assets. By having customers come to us and say we have asset rights to sell, Serica will custody those rights and that means that our other customers can now participate in these investments. All assets are on the table.""  Serica will, in turn, assist customers with physical assets as they look to create digital tokens for their rights, tie them to the blockchain and monetize them via its marketplace.  So far, Lewis estimates that Serica has listings for more than 50 types of assets, a figure that includes items as diverse as stock certificates, Overstock shares and farmland in Argentina.  Growing a market  While Serica has found a novel way to use bitcoin's open ledger and Counterparty's token creation abilities to enable asset trading, the company also faces a steep challenge in building a marketplace of traders who want exposure to such assets.  Though he acknowledged the technology is still in the early adopter phase, Lewis believes Serica can succeed as a solution in specialized areas. Today, he believes the opportunity lies with asset owners who have had difficulty gaining access to a diverse pool of investors due to supply and demand issues as well as geographic restrictions.  ""I have customers in Asia that want to invest in US real estate, and customers in the US that want to invest in agriculture in Latin America, so being able to do that on the [bitcoin] blockchain, that's magical,"" Lewis said. ""That's stuff we've never seen before so we're in a race to make sure the rights are in place so we can do that.""  On the demand side, he said Serica will seek to market to individual investors, individual retirement account (IRA) investors and private wealth managers looking to maximize returns from high-risk, high-reward markets.  Word of mouth  The business is faced with the difficulty of getting the word out about a service that could now appeal to a wide range of asset holders.  Whereas DigitalTangible relied on partners in the gold business and traditional web marketing strategies to target the precious metals vertical, Lewis acknowledged that the challenge of reaching markets would now be far greater given the specificity of the targets.  In the face of trying to reach niche global audiences, word of mouth, he suggested, would be the company's best marketing asset.  Lewis concluded:  ""This is still really early, this is highly innovative. It's a challenge, its not going to be easy. It's going to take some work.""

42378154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ML3d,1429641916,Retailer Marc Jacobs Names Bitcoin Website in Trademark Lawsuit,"Retail store operator Marc Jacobs has named a website called BitcoinFashion.net in a lawsuit aimed at preventing the unauthorized use of its trademarks.  Filed on 14th April in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the complaint states that 66 named websites, including BitcoinFashion.net, are responsible for the illicit use of Marc Jacobs trademarks as well as the sale of counterfeit goods bearing the company's name.  Marc Jacobs is accusing the named defendants of trademark counterfeiting and infringement, false designation of origin, claim for relief for cybersquatting and unfair competition.  The company has asked the court to force the defendants to cease the use of its trademark and unauthorized sale of counterfeit goods. Marc Jacobs is seeking $2m “per each counterfeit trademark used and product sold"".  Marc Jacobs argued in court documents that it is the frequent target of trademark infringement, claiming that its brand suffers as a result of these actions.  The filing states:  “If defendants’ counterfeiting and infringing, cybersquatting, unfairly competitive activities and their illegal marketplace enterprise, are not preliminarily and permanently enjoined by this court, Marc Jacobs and the consuming public will continue to be harmed.  BitcoinFashion.net appears to only have a tenuous connection to bitcoin. The site does not accept bitcoin as payment, nor do any of its products seem to have any relationship with the digital currency.  A post on Bitcoin Talk promises the acceptance of cryptocurrencies, while suggesting a connection between the website and the dark web marketplace Agora. The website also accepts Payeer, which processes bitcoin payments.  Messages sent to the website’s publicly available email address were not returned by press time. Representatives of the Marc Jacobs brand did not offer further comment at press time.

42378155,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ML69,1429638249,Argentina's Largest Local Social Network Taringa Adds Bitcoin,"Argentinean social network platform Taringa will tip its content creators in bitcoin after partnering with wallet and custodial service provider Xapo.  The free social network, which boasts 75 million monthly users, enables people from all over the world to create and share information on its platform.  A loosely translated statement by Hernán Botbol, Taringa's co-founder, read:  ""By partnering with Xapo, we have found an excellent revenue share model to incentivise our content creators. Bitcoin's penetration in South America is incipient, almost a rarity, so we believe our users will perceive the bitcoin payouts very positively, thus encouraging people to join the programme whilst stimulating mainstream adoption of bitcoin.""  Botbol noted that Xapo's strategic position in the South American market was a decisive factor in the forging of the partnership between both parties.  ""We chose Xapo because it is one of the safest bitcoin wallets out there and because their strategy is placed on the Hispanic market. The company is led by a group of Latin American entrepreneurs and that means that they really understand our market and the needs of the millions of users in the region,"" he said.  Wences Casares, founder and director of Xapo, commented on the potential of the South American market, noting that Argentina's unbanked population could benefit from bitcoin.  He said:  ""The partnership will provide a unique opportunity for many people to try out how bitcoin works and to gage the digital currency's reception in the region. South America is an interesting market because of its increasing Internet penetration and its community of early adopters of technology who still do not have access to bitcoin.""  The announcement follows the launch of Xapo Institutions, a series of products aimed at capturing additional customers including businesses, bitcoin exchanges, hedge funds and institutional investors.  How it works  The new bitcoin tipping programme, 'Taringa Creadores', will combine an ad-revenue sharing model similar to YouTube's with the social network's unique ranking system in order to incentivise the sharing of popular content.  Initially, the service is invite-only and will prompt the platform's top content creators to register for the programme.  The size of the bitcoin tips, which will de deposited into the users' Xapo wallets, will depend on the amount of views, points and advertising revenue generated by each post.

42378158,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ML8f,1429635032,Tennessee Governor to Consider Bitcoin Campaign Donation Bill,"A bill to allow political donations denominated in bitcoin has passed in the Tennessee legislature.  Tennessee House Bill 701  was approved with a 61-28 vote on 20th April in the House of Representatives, according to a report by the Chattanooga Times Free Press. The Senate version of the bill, SB 674, was passed in late March.  The law, when proposed in February, was intended to enshrine in state law a decision made last year by the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) allowing bitcoin donations. That law set an annual cap of $100 and reporting requirements for those who make such donations.  At the time, SB 674 author Senator Steven Dickerson told CoinDesk that the bill was needed to ensure that Tennessee politicians can receive bitcoin donations.  Since the FEC decision, a number of state and national level politicians, most notably Kentucky Senator and Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, have begun courting donations in the digital currency.  The law now goes to Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam's desk for approval.

42378150,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7MKzr,1429614167,US Police Officer Charged with Receiving Stolen Bitcoin Miners,"A New Jersey police officer has been arrested and charged with receiving stolen property after allegedly selling stolen bitcoin mining equipment.  According to Somerset County Prosecutor Geoffrey D Soriano, Vincent Saggese, 32, of Metuchen, NJ, met with a Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office undercover detective twice and negotiated the sale of stolen KNC Miner Neptune devices.  Saggese, who worked for the Plainfield Police Department for 10 years, was also charged with professional misconduct after allegedly accepting $250 from the undercover detective and agreeing to obtain the address and a photograph of a license plate's owner.  The defendant was arrested in Somerville on 17th April and the license plate number given to him by the undercover officer was found written on a slip of paper in his pocket.  Detectives then seized the currency used by the undercover detective to purchase the bitcoin mining equipment as well as the $250 for the license plate information.  Saggese has been charged with Official Misconduct 2nd degree and Receiving Stolen Property 3rd degree.  Bad cops  This isn't the first time police officials have been charged with crimes relating to stolen bitcoins or bitcoin mining equipment.  Last month two federal agents who took part in the US government's efforts to take down online black market Silk Road were charged with fraud for allegedly misusing bitcoin funds.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges US Secret Service special agent Shaun Bridges ""diverted"" more than $800,000 in bitcoin to his personal accounts without authorization.  Also, the DOJ alleges Drug Enforcement Administration agent Carl Mark Force IV ""solicited and received"" digital currency as part of the investigation into Silk Road, using ""fake online personas"" to ""steal from the government and targets of the investigation"".  Both Bridges and Force were charged with money laundering and wire fraud. Force has also been charged with the theft of government property.
