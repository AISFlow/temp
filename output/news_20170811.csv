According to the company's latest announcement, Bitfinex will also be making other changes to its service, no longer accepting verification requests for U.S. individuals effective immediately. Further, in the next 90 days, it will gradually discontinue all services to U.S. customers.  The exchange explained that the decision follows a recent investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on how tokens issued by way of an initial coin offering (ICO) may be considered securities.  ""We anticipate the regulatory landscape to become even more challenging in the future,"" the statement reads.  Specifically, Bitfinex expects a tightened regulation will apply to all ERC-20 tokens issued via the ethereum blockchain, citing two tokens (EOS and SAN) as offerings that will no longer be available for U.S. customers to purchase.  The company stated that it will suspending the trading of the two coins beginning 12:00 p.m. UTC on August 16.  The decision is a notable one as it is the first sign that major cryptocurrency exchanges may take action to avoid repercussions of the SEC's recent guidance, which hinted trading services would need certain registrations to sell blockchain-based securities.  According to Coinmarketcap data, Bitfinex now ranks the third largest exchange by trading volume, with $331 million in activity over the last 24 hours. EOS and SAN account for $5.7 million and $1.9 million in 24-hour trading, respectively.

While a clear outline for the initiative is still absent, in its latest announcement, the central bank said the legal implications of cryptocurrencies will be discussed at the next Financial Stability Board of Ukraine meeting at the end of August.  The decision comes at a time when Ukraine is seeing increased bitcoin activity, from payments to mining to blockchain development, but also when regulatory uncertainty has led its law enforcement to take steps to reprimand bitcoin users.  Just days ago, Ukrainian police arrested several suspects who allegedly set up 200 computers to mine bitcoins at an abandoned swimming pool within a state institute in Kiev.  According to local media Kyiv Post, the court document accused the suspects of illegally taking advantage of state property, and producing a currency, which is currently a function only the National Bank is legally allowed to do. Further, the law also states that no other currency besides the Ukrainian Hryvnia can be treated as legal payment in Ukraine.  Citing the different approaches taken by other countries in defining cryptocurrencies, the banking authority will now begin its discussion with the Ministry of Finance, State Fiscal Service, the State Financial Monitoring Service, Securities and Stock Market State Commission and the National Commission for the State Regulation of Financial Services Markets.

42379770,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KbAF,1502480746,Tezos to Launch $50 Million Venture Fund to Boost Blockchain Growth,"The Tezos Foundation, the non-profit that oversees the development of the governance-boosting blockchain protocol, tezos, has announced the launch of a $50 million venture fund.  Eager to foster its own blockchain ecosystem, money from the fund will be given to startups and developers building on the tezos platform, with capital being drawn from its record-setting $232 million initial coin offering (ICO) earlier this year, as well as undisclosed venture partners and its own holdings.  Designed to enable protocol changes through sophisticated voting, tezos touts governance as core to its offering. Upon its launch, the blockchain is promising to support smart contracts, and use a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm through which users would mine new blocks based on how many coins they hold.  Also addressed in the statements was the recent bitcoin hard fork.  Tezos said while it is currently holding additional Bitcoin Cash tokens, created from the bitcoin it raised in the sale, it plans to gradually sell these assets.  As reported previously, the project netted 65,627 BTC and 361,122 ETH by the time its ICO completed on July 13. Tezos is now the second-highest earning ICO, following a more than $250 million fundraise by the blockchain project filecoin yesterday.  With the update, the project is also proving its continuing communication to users, as it disclosed on July 18 its strategy to diversify its financial portfolio, and its plan to convert its crypto assets to some traditional tools such as cash, bond, stock and precious metal.  The first conversion was completed on July 17, when the non-profit turned 1,587 ETH into 250,000 Swiss francs ($260,000). According to the latest update, Tezos has been keeping such trading ""at a pace of roughly CHF 500,000 per day.""  As such, the statements shed light on the evolving complexities with ICO funding, given the many different assets involved.

42379750,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kasd,1502472910,Russia's Central Depository Plans to Build Its Own Cryptocurrency Wallet,"Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD), the central depository for Moscow Exchange, the largest exchange group in Russia, is developing a blockchain platform to provide deposit and settlement services for digital assets and cryptocurrencies.      Built in partnership with Waves Platform, the public blockchain project designed for the launch of distributed applications had previously said in a blog post that it had struck a deal to become the NSD's technological partner, at the time, noting that it had has already started developing a prototype.      In an announcement today, the NSD confirmed that the first prototype will be presented during the first half of next year.      The platform would enable the NSD to issue a cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency wallet available for banks, pension funds and retail investors, one which would also enable the exchange of those assets for fiat currencies.      Eddie Astanin, chairman of the executive board at NSD, said:      ""Our goal is to create a secure and user-friendly accounting infrastructure for digital assets. We consider the platform would not only provide technological and legal protection of all parties involved, but also extend variety of post-trade services for investors, custodians and new institutions emerging in this sector of economy.""              However, while the blockchain startup touts that the project is technologically achievable, the company's founder and CEO Sasha Ivanov admitted the regulatory uncertainty – namely, the whether of whether the NSD would be legally allowed to deal with digital assets – poses a major challenge for the project deployment to market.      ""Project implementation depends not only on technical development but on the development of a legislative framework that mitigates the risks of crypto asset ownership and ensures that the service is user-friendly,"" the statement reads.      As reported by CoinDesk, while a legal framework that would capture bitcoin in Russia is being discussed by the country's various central and financial authorities, no concrete regulatory proposals have been put forward so far.      Over the past a few years, Russia has taken a U-turn on its attitude towards cryptocurrency, moving from a possible ban to robust discussion and the exploration of use cases that could be adopted by government agencies.      For example, just days ago, the Russian Ministry of Health announced its work with the country's state-owned banks Vnesheconombank to develop a blockchain platform to exchange patient data.

The disclosure came from Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission and European Commissioner for the Euro and Social Dialogue, in response to a question from MEP Antanas Guoga on the state of the commission's work with blockchain and cryptocurrencies last month.    After touching on the push to gather more information from exchange and wallet services, Dombrovskis pointed to new plans to fund blockchain pilot projects.  As CoinDesk reported in April, the European Commission is spending hundreds of thousands of euros to put together an ""observatory"" through which it can test possible public-sector applications of the tech.  One of those, according to Dombrovskis, is a project centered around collecting and sharing information from public companies within the EU with the aim of boosting transparency. What's more, the commissioner indicated that the wider pilot effort is being backed by €850,000 (just over $1 million) in funds.  He wrote in his response:  ""[T]he commission is currently working on developing a [distributed ledger technology]-based European Financial Transparency Gateway (connecting and making available data listed companies must report to national databases) and a European Blockchain Observatory/Forum.""  Dombrovskis also revealed that the commission is planning to launch a ""Blockchains for Social Good"" contest – a competition that would be held in conjunction with the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation initiative.

Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang struck a bullish tone about the prospects for selling to would-be miners, telling VentureBeat:  ""Cryptocurrency and blockchain are here to stay. Over time, it will become quite large. It is very clear that new currencies will come to market. It’s clear the GPU is fantastic at cryptography. The GPU is really quite well positioned.""  The firm's CFO, Colette Kress, echoed the remarks in statements, citing rising values in the global cryptocurrency market as a primary driver for GPU sales.  ""Our PC OEM revenue includes GPUs designed for mainstream desktops, notebooks, and cryptocurrency mining,"" she said. ""The recent rise in crypto coin prices resulted in increased demand in OEM GPU sales.""  Huang's comments stand in contrast to those from rival GPU maker AMD, however. Last month, CEO Lisa Su indicated that the company doesn't see a long-term future for sales in the mining market. That aside, she indicated that her company would ""continue to watch the developments"" in the space.  Recent months have seen growing demand for GPUs from cryptocurrency miners, who use the cards to add new transaction blocks to a blockchain and receive newly minted coins as reward. GPUs are used to mine cryptocurrencies like ethereum and litecoin that use the ""scrypt"" hashing algorithm. Bitcoin, by contrast, is chiefly mined today using dedicated hardware called ASICs.

The uptick  coincides with a palpable improvement in public sentiment about the world's first cryptographic asset, with bitcoin recently receiving positive mentions from leading asset managers and gaining increasing exposure in western media.  At press time, bitcoin was trading at $3,550, a figure that has appreciated nearly 50% over the last month of trading. Data from the CoinDesk BPI indicates the price of bitcoin was just $2,423 on June 12.  Yet, the strongest growth has been seen in the last week, following a fork of the bitcoin blockchain that resulted in the creation of a new cryptocurrency, bitcoin cash.  Perhaps most notably, bitcoin is up nearly 25% on the week since the split, rising from $2,871 seven days prior, while bitcoin cash, the new blockchain, has climbed just 17%, rising to $340 from $290 one week ago.  The interplay between the two currencies will no doubt be one to watch, as it could change attitudes toward blockchain forks and provide an illustration of how cryptocurrency markets will respond to technical changes in the future.

An investment hub for industry startups that has helped investors back firms like Bitwage and Unocoin, BnkToTheFuture is moving to allow investors to buy so-called Simple Agreements for Future Tokens, or SAFTs, a legal framework for token issuance developed by startup Protocol Labs.  Modeled after Y Combinator's Simple Agreements for Future Equity, or SAFEs, via which investors can fund startups and receive equity at a later time, SAFTs similarly let investors pay to receive tokens in the future.  Notably, Protocol Labs utilized the framework for its Filecoin ICO yesterday, which was hindered by technology issues yet raised as much as $200 million in just an hour.  Through BnkToTheFuture, investors would buy SAFTs, as well as equity from startups planning to launch a token sale at a later date. Next month, it will let investors buy pre-sale SAFTs, though without the option to purchase equity.  CEO Simon Dixon told CoinDesk that the launch came following calls from the site's user base, as well as the recent rise in activity around ICOs.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Our investors were demanding [that we] provide more liquidity in their investments and established companies wanted a way to access some of the new liquidity that is entering the market. It was all market driven as the ICO market booked.""  Data from CoinDesk’s ICO Tracker shows that more than $1.7 billion has been raised through the funding model to date, by which startups and project teams can raise funds through the sale of cryptographic tokens.  Regulators, though, are starting to pay closer attention to the market. Singapore’s central bank issued an investor warning on ICOs earlier this week, following statements from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that some tokens would be considered securities.  Further, the SEC yesterday moved to halt the trading of shares in a Nevada-based company following statements it made about a forthcoming ICO.

The new benchmark was set at 8:00 UTC and comes just four days after the crypto asset class set a previous record above $116 billion.  At press time, the price increase appears to be driven by a new influx of capital into bitcoin, the markets oldest and perhaps best understood asset. Over the last seven days, the value of one bitcoin is up more than 20%, rising to over $3,500 from $2,854 last Friday.  During that time, the total value of its coin supply also rose, climbing in value to $57 billion from $47 billion a week ago.  Strong gains have also been seen in the top-10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.  Neo (formerly Antshares), a well-publicized project out of China saw its market capitalization pass $1 billion for the first time.

Elsewhere, IOTA also rose to $1.7 billion, up from $1.1 billion, while ether, the native cryptocurrency on the ethereum blockchain, increased its total market cap to $28 billion, up from $21 billion a week ago.  But that's not to say all cryptocurrencies have seen such big movements during the period.

42379765,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kb7j,1502449203,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Gets to Work at 90-Member 'Town Hall' Meeting,"The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is on the verge of kicking off a new phase of its development.  After launching earlier this year, and quickly growing to include more than 150 members from around the world, the alliance is about to initiate a flurry of activity from its diverse group of members aimed at breaking new ground on enterprise blockchain solutions  Since revealing its first working groups and a technical steering committee in July, the chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) says the consortium has been ironing out the details of its governance model, gathering even more new members and working to identify objectives.  This behind-the-scenes work took a step forward in a second ""town hall"" meeting that was open to all members, last month.  Details of the meeting revealed to CoinDesk yesterday by EEA chairman of the board, Julio Faura show the heads of each working group drawing up plans for coordinating their working efforts behind a series of ""certified"" standards.  Faura said:  ""Most of these working groups are launching as we speak. We've been basically, this past month, getting our act together as it comes to governance and the technical steering committee.""  Behind the scenes  In total, 94 participants attended the meeting, including representatives from the Token Working Group, chaired by Alex Batlin of BNY Mellon; the Banking Working Group, chaired by Amber Baldet of JPMorgan; and the Healthcare Working Group, chaired by Merck's Fabian Wahl.  According to a copy of the agenda provided to CoinDesk, addresses were given by Faura and membership committee chair Jeremy Millar, before the chair and vice chair of each working group was invited to speak.  While the meeting was closed to reporters, Faura described the discussion as focusing on how the group will now seek to create standards to ensure the many separate projects involved can interoperate.  Given the consortium's focus on interoperability, each member is free to build with whatever implementation they choose. Platforms currently being used by members include Monax, Parity and Quorum, said Faura, who is also head of blockchain research and development at Banco Santander.  He continued:  ""These working groups are not technical in nature. They may explore technical implications, of course, but they are not building different flavors of ethereum. What they're doing is they're discussing the use of ethereum in their respective situations.""  Demographic diversity  Also revealed at the meeting was a breakdown of the non-profit's more than 150 members by region.  As a result of such diversity, not just across industries but across languages and borders, Faura said another priority topic is the creation of a governance model that describes how members relate to the groups as well as how the groups relate to each other and to the overall organization.  Currently, the rule-making process is being accomplished using traditional methods, but a level of distributed interoperability is also required. To that end, Faura said the group is considering using blockchain technologies to cast votes in a more reliable way.  Eventually, the objective is to create a feedback loop that strengthens the technological developments made by members. But that too is something that hasn't yet been formalized, and is instead relying on a more organic transmission of lessons learned.  ""Over time, we may end up having some operational things, for example, an operations working group may start putting together a testnet for others to work on,"" Faura said, concluding:  ""Later on, we may go into things more serious, but these are just discussions at this point.""

42379745,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Kaq7,1502445607,Bank of America Has Filed for Over 20 Blockchain Patents Already,"Bank of America is emerging as one of the most active banks when it comes to filing patents over claimed innovations in blockchain and cryptocurrency.  Three new submissions, initially filed with the U.S. Public Patent and Trademark Office early last year, add to a total of 20 blockchain and cryptocurrency-related patent applications filed by the bank since 2014.  Of those, nine were submitted in 2016, four were filed in 2015 and 10 as far back as 2014.  While there were variances in the language used within the filings, the three new applications all focus on a hybrid blockchain system, made of either a tiered blockchain network or a combination of both public and private blockchains.  In each, a blockchain network is designed to function as a distributed database for the flow of certain actions, with an overarching system providing a center that can control the security and data access for different subordinate layers.  Notably, the idea that blockchain technology can be used to permission and control data access is not a new one for the company, having been previously explored in Bank of America's 2015 filings.  Despite the number of patent submissions, though, it's worth noting that they do overlap to a certain extent.  As CoinDesk reported earlier this month, in February of last year, Bank of America filed three patents based on using distributed ledgers to validate the veracity of information and those who handle it. Two further applications, filed the same month, were based on a peer-to-peer payment system running on the blockchain.  But given the delay in how filings are made public, it remains to be seen whether Bank of America is still actively filing to protect its blockchain work.  Still, it has one of the longest histories of any major bank in doing so. As far back as 2014, a group of inventors from the bank filed 10 patent applications aimed at protecting a generic cryptocurrency.  The batch was submitted in June, 2014, covering nearly the whole cryptocurrency exchange and payment process, including real-time conversion, transaction validation, risk detection and online and offline storage.

42379753,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Katt,1502442028,Nasdaq Seeks to Patent Blockchain-based Data Matching System,"The global exchange operator Nasdaq Inc. is seeking to patent a blockchain-based data matching system.  Filed  in February by its market technology division, the application was released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on August 10, with the full submission detailing how the exchange is looking to protect a distributed system that stores and shares transactional data.  Invented by Johan Toll and Fredrik Sjöblom, both of whom work for the post-trade market technology based in Stockholm, Sweden, the patent application details their process for using a blockchain to pair transaction requests, specifically, data of trades and clearing positions, according to a spokesperson from Nasdaq. The data matching would then be timestamped and stored in the ledger, in a similar way that bitcoin transactions are kept on its underlying blockchain.  But while interesting on its own, the filing comes only several days after Nasdaq Inc was revealed to have made a similar filing - only this time the application was submitted by the company's market technology unit, which accounts for 12 percent of its net revenue in the second quarter of 2017.  As reported by CoinDesk, Nasdaq Inc is also seeking to patent a distributed platform that enables a user to submit a time-sensitive document to a blockchain, whereby each modification would be recorded and updated on a distributed ledger.  Stepping back, the filings are also taking place during what has been a boom in blockchain patent applications, with CoinDesk data revealing that the rate of submissions has nearly doubled already in 2017.  Correction: This article has been updated to clarify specifics of the patent and to correct information regarding the entity that filed the application.

42379752,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KarN,1502419511,SEC Suspends OTC-Traded Emerging Markets Investor Over ICO Concerns,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has suspended the trading of shares in an OTC-traded technology company over questions about the accuracy of a planned initial coin offering (ICO).  Issued August 9, the order was made against a firm called CIAO Group (now rebranded as NuMelo Technology), which trades on markets operated by OTC Markets Group. NuMelo first announced plans for an ICO on July 6, at the time indicating a desire to bring a ""digital financial products marketplace"" based on blockchain tech to the African market.  The company's website reveals details about its aspirations, with a blog post from May noting that the firm recently saw a management change, and that it was looking to embrace a new business strategy.  In subsequent press releases, the firm blurs the lines between its ideas, evoking the power of blockchain, promising a ""$530 billion target market collaboration"" and making bold claims about the ability of the technology to revitalize economic access in developing markets.  A June 15 press releasehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/ciao-group-announces-blockchain-frontier-120000091.html reads:  ""African public stocks from multiple African countries traded in a single cryptocurrency on US trading platforms cleared through DTCC accepted blockchain transactions could monumentally increase the liquidity of investments in African public companies, and give the average individual US investor new access to the extraordinary growth opportunities only found within frontier markets.""  Ultimately, however, it may be statements like these that influenced the SEC's decision, as the agency cited questions about the ""accuracy of assertions"" made by the company ""with respect to business plans"" and its plans for an ICO as key reasons for the move.  The suspension began today at 11:59 p.m. EST, and is scheduled to last until August 23.  Notably, the announcement follows an uptick in SEC supervision of the cryptocurrency markets, particularly as it relates to the nascent ICO sector.  In June, the SEC took action against a Florida firm over similar concerns, suspending its trading on over-the-counter (OTC) markets, a move that was followed by its landmark ruling that a cryptographic token issued by a project called The DAO met its definition of a security.
