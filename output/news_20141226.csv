42377922,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DChn,1419631856,The 7 Biggest Crypto Scandals of 2014,"Even though 2015 is right around the corner, some might say that bitcoin was still in its 'Wild West' days throughout the course of this year.  While it's easy to appreciate all of bitcoin's best qualities – it's cheap, fast and reliable, to name a few – it's harder to ignore that bitcoin has also been associated with less desirable parts of life – like crime and scandal.  As the digital currency's use cases are still being discovered each day and regulators from around the world strategize how best to approach the disruptive technology, it's inevitable that something will go wrong as bitcoin goes through growing pains.  Unfortunately, there's bound to be bad actors in any industry and in any country, and when these bad actors are operating in a sector with considerable legal ambiguities like the bitcoin space, things can go awry pretty quickly.  Whether it was bankruptcy, allegations of fraud or clashes with the government, companies and individuals in the bitcoin industry faced a fair share of scandal in 2014.  As we approach the new year, let's all hope the community can learn from some of these people's mistakes, but first let's reflect on the seven biggest crypto scandals of 2014:  1. Mt Gox goes bankrupt  As far as scandal goes, 2014 started out with a bang for bitcoin. In hindsight, the writing was on the wall in the months leading up to the collapse of Mt Gox, once the biggest bitcoin exchange on the market.  Throughout January and February users reported having trouble making withdrawals from their Mt Gox accounts, and it wasn't long before the Japanese exchange's CEO Mark Karpeles began receiving scrutiny for what many perceived to be poor management. The exchange filed for bankruptcy in April after admitting it had lost more than 700,000 of its users' bitcoins, and it's safe to say the impacts of Mt Gox's collapse can still be felt in the industry today.  2. Ross Ulbricht's ongoing trial  One of the biggest stories in bitcoin last year was the FBI's seizure of online black marketplace Silk Road in October 2013. In the aftermath of the site's seizure, Ross Ulbricht was identified by law enforcement as Silk Road's operator.  As a result of the FBI's investigation, Ulbricht was arrested and charged with a number of crimes including money laundering and distributing controlled substances. Ulbricht was indicted in February of this year and faces a life sentence in prison, pending a trial that was recently delayed to next month. Though he's been in prison all year, Ulbricht has continued to make his mark on the bitcoin industry; the US government sold 50,000 of his personal bitcoins in a public auction earlier this month.  3. Neo & Bee collapses amid allegations of fraud  While the Mt Gox fiasco caused tensions to rise in February, Cyprus-based Neo & Bee seemingly came out of nowhere with a promise to be the first 'bank-like' portal to buy and sell bitcoin.  Not long after its launch, things started to go awry. The company suspended trading of shares by the end of March, and less than two weeks later the Cyprian government issued an arrest warrant for Neo & Bee's CEO Danny Brewster. Further statements from Neo & Bee employees corroborated many people's skepticism and allegations of fraud, and it appears that Brewster may still be on the run.  4. Charlie Shrem's public arrest and two-year prison sentencing  In a strangely high-profile arrest in January, Shrem was taken by law enforcement at a New York City airport as he returned home from a business trip. He was later indicted on federal money laundering charges for supplying bitcoins to Silk Road users and was placed on 24-hour house arrest until late May.  Shrem later forfeited nearly $1m to the government and reportedly hoped to 'walk free' as part of a plea bargain. Just this week Shrem went to court for his sentencing, where he was sentenced to two years after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.  5. Moolah shuts down as its CEO is suspected of fraud  A failed relaunch of altcoin exchange MintPal in October may very well have been the impetus for one of this year's biggest crypto scandals.  In the weeks following MintPal's relaunch, Moolah – its owner – came under fire for allegations of fraud and theft. MintPal employees went as far as threatening legal action against Moolah CEO Alex Green (pictured above) in attempt to recover lost funds that were estimated to be as much as 4,000 BTC. Moolah has since announced its plans for bankruptcy.  6. The Bitcoin Foundation faces extensive leadership changes  The Bitcoin Foundation is one of the most high-profile organizations in the industry, and with its (previous) mission to be the unified voice to advocate for bitcoin, it's also one of the most scrutinized.  After former board members Mark Karpeles and Charlie Shrem resigned from their roles at the Foundation (as a result of their aforementioned scandals), public voting began in an effort to elect new board members. The election itself was marred by controversy, and leadership changes continued throughout the year, marked most recently by executive director Jon Matonis' resignation at the end of October. A recent pivot and new executive director may finally be what the Foundation needs to move forward steadily.  7. Chinese government tries to censor media coverage of bitcoin  The Chinese government's ambiguous stance on digital currencies was made a bit more clear this year, when media outlets in China were ordered by government authorities not to cover the Beijing-based Global Bitcoin Summit in May.  The censorship orders were not restricted just to coverage of the conference, though. The government instructed the country's media outlets that ""all reporting on bitcoins must henceforth accord with the specifications of financial regulatory agencies"". The government's imposing arm must have struck a chord with at least some entrepreneurs: five Chinese bitcoin exchange CEOs pulled out of their scheduled appearances at the Global Bitcoin Summit prior to its 10th May kickoff.

42377910,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCQB,1419592597,6 Charts That Show Massive Bitcoin ATM Growth in 2014,"Last October, the first bitcoin ATM was installed in the Waves Coffeehouse in Vancouver. It marked the start of a battle among manufacturers to control one of the few tangible interfaces with the bitcoin markets.  Now, just over 13 months later, the number of machines, manufacturers and locations has exploded. Millions of dollars worth of machinery has already been sold, with no shortage of new ATM makers joining the competition.  The six charts below explore the growth of the bitcoin ATM based on data from CoinDesk's Map and the excellent Coin ATM Radar, which both track deployments of machines globally.  (Note that we have used figures for the number of 'live' machines for all charts except the first and last, which count all machines installed over time. The difference between the number of 'live' machines and the total number of installations is 20 units.)  We start off with an interactive map of bitcoin ATM installations around the world. This illustrates the proliferation of the cryptocurrency machines in the 13 months or so since they've been introduced.  Use the slider to visualise the world's bitcoin ATM installations over time.  The top two countries for bitcoin ATMs, by a wide margin, are the US and Canada. Third place goes further south, with 16 units in Australia. Europe rounds out the top five, with the UK and the Netherlands taking fourth and fifth places respectively (13 bitcoin ATMs vs 12).  The top Asian country is Singapore, in seventh place with 10 machines. Mainland China and Hong Kong are tied two spots down with seven machines each.  Compare these numbers to our mid-year review, where Canada led the charts and Singapore came in fifth (you can download the data for a full list by country).  The distribution of bitcoin ATMs by continent shows the growth of the machines in North America. Our mid-year review indicated that the region's countries had 40% of the pie. This has now grown by eight points, even as the total number of ATMs has more than doubled.  Europe also grew its share of machines, but by only one point, taking its slice to 31%. The big loser was Asia, which had 19% of the pie in July, but has now lost six points. Oceania also slid slightly, losing two points at the end of the year, compared to its portion of the global ATM pie in our mid-year review.  Retailers have overtaken eateries as the most popular location to install a bitcoin ATM, globally. Our mid-year review showed that coffee shops and restaurants were ATM operators' top choice when they selected a place to install their machines.  By 2014's end, however, it's clear that retail outlets that don't serve food or drink have become the place for operators to set up shop. Restaurants, bars, pubs and cafes are still in the top three, of course, while a significant number of machines are also installed in hackerspaces worldwide – a testament to the tech community's love for digital currencies.  In the beginning, there were two dominant ATM makers: the lightweight, table-top unit produced by Lamassu and the free-standing, two-way machine introduced by Robocoin. Now, the market has proliferated with ATM producers, and the machines might more accurately be referred to as 'brands', as each producer seeks to differentiate itself in the market.  A CoinDesk feature in September examined the changing competitive dynamics among these producers as well-funded new entrants joined the fray. The latest data shows Lamassu with nearly a third of the market – still a strong dominant position – but it has lost seven points since our mid-year review.  Lamassu's old rival Robocoin has declined, losing three points of market share between July and December.  New players are snatching slices of the pie from incumbents. BitAccess has 14% of the market while Skyhook has an astonishing 18%, an increase of 11 points since our mid-year review. Skyhook's low-cost, open-source models are clearly an attractive proposition to operators seeking to minimise their outlay.  Examining ATM growth over time reveals several trends. While Lamassu has maintained its early lead, this appears to be tapering off slightly. Its chief rival now is Skyhook, which has claimed second place and appears to be poised for further growth.  Robocoin, meanwhile, has suffered from months of stagnant growth; its case has not been helped by angry operators who resent its attempts to force new software on them and customers who publicly complain of delayed or faulty machines.  BitAccess  , which graduated from the prestigious Y Combinator programme in Silicon Valley, appears to have developed a steady growth model, as it continues to climb up the charts. This month, the company is poised to overtake Robocoin for third place.  The battle for bitcoin's physical interface, the ATM, appears to be far from over. But what is clear for now is that these machines – call them ATMs, call them digital currency vending machines, call them 'bank branches' or remittance centres – are becoming more commonplace around the world.  That can only be a positive signal for the digital currency world.

42377907,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7DCL9,1419581721,Circle's Wishlist for Bitcoin Regulation in 2015,"John Beccia is general counsel and CCO for Circle, a consumer finance company that uses bitcoin technology to make money transfers and payments instant, secure, global and free.  In this article, he shares his wish list for regulators focused on digital currency.  It's the time of year when everyone is filled with holiday cheer and ambitious goals.  As we turn the calendar page, it's a moment for optimism and hope that not only will digital currency businesses grow in 2015, but there will also be sensible regulations for their activities.  The road to creating a regulatory framework for digital currency has taken several twists and turns over the past year. Despite some progress, questions and challenges remain.  Early holiday gifts have come from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), which issued proposed 'principles' for state regulation of digital currency, and Superintendent Lawsky who laid out revisions to New York's BitLicense proposal.  Along with finalizing those proposals, coming attractions for 2015 include completion of the Fourth Money Laundering Directive in the European Union (EU), a potential ban of bitcoin in Russia and a key case pending on the value-added tax (VAT) treatment of digital currency in the EU.  Regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Financial Conduct Authority, have indicated that additional regulation may be needed to protect consumers and the financial system. On top of this, law enforcement will undoubtedly continue to target illicit activity relating to digital currency.  In light of this, here is a 'wish list' for those poised to regulate digital currency in 2015.  1. A balanced view    Regulators should not lose sight of the intrinsic value of digital currency, which is its decentralized nature, lack of intermediaries and cryptographic proofs that make the system inherently trustworthy.      Regulators should not only focus on the risks, but should also take time to understand the benefits of digital currency and the practical impact of regulation. As this technology evolves, regulation should be measured and risk-based.      It should offer flexible, principles-based guidelines versus overly prescriptive rules that would place burdens on firms and eliminate the benefits of the technology. Regulations should be established in a manner that maintains a level playing field with other payment service providers. Regulators should resist the temptation to offer duplicative or unnecessary requirements.      Recent comments by Superintendent Lawsky regarding providing “flexible” regulations and creating transitional licenses for small business are steps in the right direction.    2. Regulation of biggest risks only    There are many business models in the digital currency ecosystem. Each lends itself to different degrees of risk and should be regulated accordingly.      FinCEN’s regulation of the on and off ramps between the exchange of fiat currency to bitcoin is an appropriate level of regulation based on risk.      Firms operating as exchanges in the EU should similarly be regulated under relevant directives and should be covered by applicable money laundering regulations, such as the proposed directive.    3. A framework of creative thinking  Regulation doesn’t tend to be innovative or proactive. However, with the advent of blockchain technology, this is a good time for government officials to take a wider view of regulation and how they can leverage technology to support their mission.    In particular, it would be helpful to develop open standards for digital identity that would protect user privacy while limiting bad actor access to digital currency platforms and the existing consumer finance ecosystem.      In areas where current rules do not fit with new technology, regulators should be receptive to industry ideas on ways to comply with the spirit versus the letter of the law. Many emergent risk management protocols are significantly more effective than legacy solutions.      Regulators should be receptive to industry best practices that address risks in an efficient manner.    4. Clarity for banking relationships  There are still significant barriers for digital currency firms looking to bring these services to mainstream users, including the lack of banking and audit firm relationships for digital currency businesses.    Regulatory clarity is needed to bolster these partnerships and enhance consumer adoption of digital currency.      If lawmakers determine that digital currencies do not need oversight, some clarification should be provided regarding ongoing obligations and/or the ability of traditional financial services providers to interface with digital currency firms.    5. Coordination and collaboration  In the US, a standard licensing and oversight approach is needed at the state level. Key states, such as New York and California, should be working closely with the CSBS as they finalize regulatory principles to ensure the approach is reasonable and consistent.    A diverse regulatory regime in multiple states would create unnecessary complications and barriers to entry for smaller firms. Due to the decentralized nature of digital currency, it makes sense for regulations to be developed on a global basis to the extent possible.      Regulators have been successful in the past by taking a coordinated approach on anti-money laundering regulations, such as through Financial Action Task Force recommendations.    6. Additional tax guidance  Further clarification is needed regarding the tax treatment of digital currency in the US and EU. The IRS guidelines are not appropriate for digital currency transactions and are too onerous for consumers from a reporting standpoint.  Similarly, it is important to have clear and consistent guidance across the EU as a VAT regime could significantly hamper digital currency adoption. These transactions should be exempt from VAT.  Hopefully, the EU Court of Justice will reach a similar conclusion in the pending case on this matter.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,John Beccia,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/26/circles-wishlist-for-bitcoin-regulation-in-2015,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/992bd9da6ded59f2cbc28af9e038b19900775ee7-1596x1061.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
