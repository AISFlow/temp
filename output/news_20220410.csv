The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization ignored a brief Sunday surge to settle below $42,500 level where it ended Friday amid growing economic uncertainty tied to Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and looming interest rate hikes by the U.S. central bank. The crypto had started the week trading near $47,000 after a late March jump, fueled by hopefulness about a sooner-than-later end to the Ukraine conflict.  ""While some relief came over the weekend, volumes have been low and until a major push drives the price above $48K, BTC is likely to remain under pressure and struggle to old $40K in the coming weeks,"" said Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager Bitbull in an email to CoinDesk.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $42,300 down slightly over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, followed a similar weekend pattern and was also off a fraction at about $3,200. Other major cryptos were mixed. AXS and Terra's LUNA token had recently fallen about 1.5% and 2%, respectively. But popular meme token DOGE was up about 5%. Trading was light.  Cryptos' performance lately has largely dovetailed with major equity markets, which have also fallen. The tech-focused Nasdaq closed Friday trading down over a percentage point. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were also off as investors continued to process an historic swirl of events that could send the global economy into recession.  Over the weekend, Ukraine simultaneously girded for a fresh Russian offensive on cities in the southeastern part of the country while attempting to evacuate civilians, whom Russian forces have been targeting. E.U. countries continued to discuss banning Russian oil and gas, although the continent's largest economy, Germany, has opposed the measure, saying that it would send shockwaves through its economy. The price of Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of energy pricing trends, continued hovering well over $100 per barrel, up over 40% from the start of the year.  In its April 8 weekly review of global economic trends, First Republic Bank said that ""the macroeconomic backdrop is likely to deteriorate before it improves.""  The bank noted that energy price increases stemming from the invasion, had ""affected prices in almost all sectors of the economy,"" and did not expect U.S. President Joe Biden recent decision to release oil from the U.S.'s strategic reserve ""to alleviate high energy prices.""  ""Given rising costs and geopolitical conflict, we believe inflation will rise higher in upcoming months,"" the bank wrote.  BitBull's DiPasquale said that wider concerns could weigh down cryptos well below the $40,000 threshold. ""We should see a reaction around $37K and $32K, but BTC is in need of a catalyst to sustain any bullish momentum ahead of macro concerns, such as more interest rate hikes and monetary policy changes.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,488 -0.2%  DJIA: 34,721 -0.4%  Nasdaq: 13,711 -1.3%  Gold: $1,946 0.6%  Insights  The holdings of HSBC's Metaverse Fund remain a mystery  Last week HSBC (HSBC) announced a Metaverse Fund for its private banking clients in Hong Kong and Singapore. To the outsider, this has all the makings of a FOMO narrative: accredited investors only, investors in Hong Kong and Singapore only – where more exciting investment opportunities are available – and finally the metaverse, which Citi claims will be a $13 trillion opportunity by 2030.  But what exactly is this fund? What does it hold? Does anyone know? The official response from HSBC is boilerplate and the company declined to go into specifics. “The portfolio is actively managed and focuses on investing in companies within the metaverse ecosystem, with five key segments, namely Infrastructure, Computing, Virtualization, Experience and Discovery, and Human Interface.”  The fund, which is said to be based in London, targets investors in Hong Kong and Singapore, but there doesn’t seem to be a registration with regulators yet (CoinDesk checked FCA, MAS, and SFC directories), which suggests the fund is still in development and hasn’t been officially listed. So we’re left guessing what’s inside it.  Prior metaverse funds have been a mixture of gaming and tech companies.  This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Rather, it's simply a product of what the metaverse is: gaming and tech. At its core, the metaverse is a gaming experience, so the question remains why you would need a specific fund for this.  After all, the same companies that power gaming experiences, like Unity and Unreal, which make game engines, or EA and Activision, which make the games themselves, would have a similar place and weight in a pure gaming fund.  In fact, if you compare a gaming fund to a metaverse fund they are nearly the same.  Every few years investors and the tech industry must invent new terms, and metaverse seems to be one of them. It’s simply gaming, rebranded. The dream of an interoperable gaming world bound together by non-fungible tokens (NFT) and blockchain, such as in Ready Player One, isn’t going to happen as intellectual property (IP) rights holders like Nintendo would get nervous about what might happen if their characters crossed over to different gaming worlds and beyond their control .(It could be vulgar.)  If you want to find a real metaverse, it would be an online gaming service like Xbox Live or Steam, which have been around for 20 years. Your digital identity is portable between games; online peers can see your name and scorecard. But that’s it. Each game is a separate world – nothing is transposable.  Gaming is a huge market, accelerated by stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic. This is the real $13 trillion opportunity.  The “metaverse” as it exists for the crypto industry? Not so much.  Remember, major crypto metaverse platforms like The Sandbox or Decentraland have an active user base counted in the hundreds or low thousands. The tokens affiliated with the platforms have had major year-to-date losses. Would you even want to hold them?  Given that HSBC’s fund is only open to accredited investors, one might expect its contents to be more exciting. The fund is unlikely to hold tokens directly, and if it did, such a holding would be earth-shattering. HSBC brass has previously declined to allow its wealthiest clients to get exposure to digital assets, unlike other banks.  There are a few privately held gaming companies out there, including Valve, which is behind the Steam platform, but this is a well-established firm, not a startup; it’s unlikely that HSBC would need to close off the fund to anyone but accredited investors.  So what is inside this fund? Is it just a collection of publicly listed gaming and technology companies wrapped behind the term ""metaverse"" and the allure of being restricted to accredited investors only?  Technician's take  Bitcoin Stalls Below $48K Resistance; Support at $40K-$43K  Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a tight range, albeit with occasional price swings. The cryptocurrency is approaching a support zone between $40,000 and $43,000, which could stabilize the pullback.  Resistance at $48,000 and $50,000 have capped price rallies over the past four months, which means sellers are in control. Meanwhile, there has been a significant loss of downside momentum, suggesting that buyers could remain active at lower support levels.  On the weekly chart, the relative strength index (RSI) dipped below the 50 neutral level. That reflects a slight loss of upside momentum since BTC's breakout above $40,000 on March 28.  Still, the current pullback appears to be temporary, similar to what occurred in September of last year. This time, however, speculative assets such as stocks and cryptos are entering a seasonally strong period in April and May, which could attract short-term buyers.

42420979,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAou5,1649602200,"While You Were Out Partying, I Studied Bitcoin Development","Over 20,000 people came to Miami for Bitcoin Magazine’s Bitcoin Conference 2022 this week. I was one of them.  The speaker lineup was simply too impressive to ignore. Anyone who could be perceived as being “worth it” had at least one 15-minute slot, more if you were a more impressive individual (a particular developer I happen to share a last name with appeared on three panels back-to-back-to-back on Friday).  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Some of those speakers were household names, like tennis great Serena Williams, who spoke on a panel with National Football League players Odell Beckham Jr. and Aaron Rodgers. With millions of active Bitcoin users and millions more interested in the ancillary industry of altcoins that claims its roots in Bitcoin, the mainstream attention made sense. As a result, the conference was quite busy. I even saw someone wearing a BAYC hoodie.  It didn’t really feel like a gathering of cypherpunk dissidents looking to remake the financial system from scratch – unless you looked closely enough.  Open-source oasis  There was one stage in particular where open-source developers were sent (banished?) to speak. The Open Source stage. I was honestly pretty miserable until I stumbled upon it in the middle of my first day at the conference. These speakers reminded me why I love Bitcoin and what it stands for.  Panel after panel of principled, level-headed and thoughtful developers, open-source enthusiasts and designers spoke clearly about where we’ve been, where we are now and where we are going. There was no talk of price targets, no discussion of energy markets and certainly nothing about “culture.” Just open-source software and the freedom it enables.  I know investors (and casual users, really) are keenly interested in markets and price targets, mining and infrastructure, and other information that helps them make a financial return. Attendees looking for that could have found it at the conference, but they also can readily get it elsewhere. Hardly any deep, new conversations were happening in these areas (at least, those that I listened to).  The Open Source stage was special. Jameson Lopp rhetorically asked if wallets that reused addresses without deterministic address generation were a risk for users and therefore amounted to an attack on Bitcoin. Keith Mukai cleverly compared Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade to changing Bitcoin from a train on rails to the “Google transit tab” where you could choose to use the train or you could “walk a mile, take a bus and then hop on the train to get to your destination.” Olaoluwa Osuntokun brought the house down with his keynote when he outlined the technical specifications of the Taro protocol in record speed (he speaks incredibly quickly) while holding a bag of taro chips.  Bitcoin’s fundamentals  This is where the real due diligence gets done. Frequenting these types of discussions to listen to the devs and poring through their GitHub repositories (and Bitcoin Core’s) is a Bitcoin investor’s equivalent of true, deep fundamental analysis.  Although these open-source speakers work in the open, publishing everything they do to GitHub or to mailing lists, their words aren’t usually heard widely. Instead, they are usually relegated (banished?) to odd corners of the internet. Having them all in one place brought an amount of collective mindshare and pure coding talent that was honestly intimidating. And reassuring. The i’s and t’s of Bitcoin’s future are in the hands of these coders.  This is the place you went to truly understand Bitcoin technology and what is possible in the future.  We’re told to find the signal among the noise if we want to be effective investors. Anyone considering an investment in Bitcoin, or any other derivative of free and open-source software (FOSS), would be well served paying attention to, supporting and connecting with the open-source builders who make FOSS possible.  If you make it to a Bitcoin conference, spend some time listening to discussions around open-source development. There should have been more than 200 people watching that stage.  Plus, that room will be air-conditioned and cool compared to the sweltering heat of the other 20,000 people mindlessly bumping into each other.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/04/10/while-you-were-out-partying-i-studied-bitcoin-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c527859deb311d5d752a01c65be1f2c5ebb3541b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374928,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw42yj,1649597964,Bitcoin 2022 Miami: Mining Gets Its Moment Under the Sun,"MIAMI — For the mining industry, Bitcoin 2022 was a moment to take center stage after spending previous conferences more in the shadows. The sector took over almost half the exhibition space at the show, and there were plenty of lively discussions on mining with packed audiences.  Throughout the week, new mining rigs were unveiled, long lines of visitors were seen at the booths of mining services firms and some of the larger mining companies said they had their people sniffing around for deals.  In addition, Wall Street investment firms and financial institutions such as B. Riley, HC Wainwright and BNY Mellon (BK) hosted events to schmooze with miners, and the week’s mining parties were buzzing with attendees from pools to venture capitalists. There were even some deals that were announced during the week, including Applied Blockchains's filing for a mining initial public offering (IPO) and Core Scientific's (CORZ) $75 million debt transaction.

It's been great,” he said.  Compass Mining’s booth was abuzz with conference goers, with Gibbs having to pause our interview several times to greet them – a common occurrence at many mining-related company booths this year.  And there were plenty of them, including the top three mining rig makers, at least four providers of immersion cooling, three to four energy services providers marketing their environmentally friendly solutions and three miners serving retail clients. There were also several other new mining rig manufacturers on the floor.  Read more: The Meaning of Miami's Castrated Bitcoin Bull  “Competition is going to make everything better for the consumers when it comes to mining services,” noted Compass’ Gibbs.  ‘A real deal center’  Interestingly, the actual mining companies were noticeably absent from the exhibition floor, with theexception of Nevada-based miner CleanSpark (CLSK), which had a booth by the main entrance.  They may have been too busy meeting with their Wall Street friends to raise capital, as there were a plethora of cocktail parties and private dinners bringing together the two sides throughout the week.  Meanwhile, larger miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE) had its team scouring the convention to look for deals, given that so many participants in the mining sector were present, Hive Executive Chairman Frank Holmes told CoinDesk at the conference. “We've had many deals come to us,” Holmes said. “This is a real deal center.”  “This is a complete ecosystem; they are all here,” Holmes added.

Both MicroBT and Canaan unveiled more powerful and efficient new rigs at the conference.  Meanwhile, Bitmain showed off not only its mining rigs but also giant mobile Antbox containers that can hold up to 180 machines, sparing miners from having to create their own costly infrastructure. The company also displayed the latest version of these containers that allows for immersion cooling.

However, Gibbs said he is “slightly apprehensive” about all the new entrants. “I think we have some people here that are promoting products which are not proven so it could pose a risk for people who are interested in buying them,” Gibbs observed.

However, now UPI services are ""temporarily unavailable"" on the app.  At the launch, Surojit Chatterjee, Coinbase's chief product officer, had explained how using UPI would be the first step for India's citizens wishing to buy crypto on its platform. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong had said, ""India has shown a great willingness with UPI.""

The platform is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, and falls under the purview of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).  On Thursday, hours after Coinbase's trading launch in India, NPCI tweeted it is ""not aware of any crypto exchange"" using UPI. At the time, Coinbase responded with a statement that said it was actively experimenting with a number of payment methods., one of which was UPI and that it was""committed to working with NPCI and other relevant authorities to ensure we are aligned with local expectations and industry norms.""  Regarding today's development, Coinbase said it has no comment.  The news of Coinbase's UPI services becoming temporarily unavailable was first reported by the Economic Times.

The bill established the requirement for KYC on users sending more than $10,000 BTC or other cryptocurrencies. As the nature of Bitcoin prevents any kind of information from being collected, this raised concerns amongst users. &apos;There were some concerns about whether BTC and crypto exchange would partake in sanctions enforced on Russia.

DeFi&apos;s Total Value Locked (TVL) has skyrocketed from nothing in 2018 to over $200 billion in 2022. Ethereum alone has over 4 million users, with an 8x surge in 2021 alone. The excitement around DeFi is palpable. Young investors are inspired by their peers&apos; historic success, while others wonder what this means for the future of finance. DeFi has been largely successful. However, its inability to include some of traditional finance&apos;s more appealing features has kept it from completely breaking into the public. Take fixed interest rates, for example, which are almost non-existent in DeFi. Retail borrowers and lenders actively search for fixed interest rates to build wealth steadily over time. To avoid this, DeFi&apos;s floating interest rates create a riskier environment that, while lucrative, is unsuitable for the average investor. In addition, there are concerns about collateralization, liquidity, and security. Even though these assets have a lot of upside potential, moving them around and converting them to various products may be difficult. Furthermore, investors may encounter many roadblocks. Scams, hacking, and digital theft remain major roadblocks for DeFi. NFTs: The Unusual Solution!

It is primarily a process by which a validator is solely responsible for validating digital assets locked up in a decentralized crypto network. As a result of this move, the network&apos;s integrity, consistency, and security are enhanced. As an added incentive for helping to secure the network, validators are rewarded with the exclusive coin that is newly mined.

At the same time, it maintains decentralization and security. Algorand has been able to create an economy that boasts low transaction fees.

Moreover, allowing a consensus to be reached without the involvement of a central authority.
