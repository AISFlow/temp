42397827,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJbi,1407189319,Dogecoin to Allow Litecoin Merge Mining in Network Security Bid,"The dogecoin development team has announced that it will soon enable auxiliary proof-of-work (AuxPoW), allowing merge-mining with litecoin that will address concerns over the altcoin’s future.  AuxPoW enables the dogecoin block chain to receive work from other scrypt-based networks. Dogecoin miners will still be able to generate blocks and receive DOGE, but now, litecoin miners will contribute hashing power to the dogecoin network.  The move, announced on the dogecoin subreddit, follows a months-long period of community debate focusing on the question of long-term viability in the dogecoin network. Litecoin creator Charlie Lee suggested the idea of merge mining in April, eliciting mixed reactions from both sides of the conversation.  According to the dogecoin development team, the AuxPoW integration will require a hard fork of the dogecoin block chain. No specific integration date has been given, but the development team said that testing will begin soon.  As explained in the original announcement:  ""Our topmost priority has always been to provide a stable platform for the currency and its services and of course its users. We hope that with AuxPoW we can achieve that in a better way than what it currently is like. Our hashrate has been on a decline and we hope that we can gain more of it with the acceptance of proof of work from other chains.""  As expected, community members voiced both enthusiasm and concern for the AuxPoW plan. Yet, advocates for the strategy, including Lee, say that the move will ensure the stability and security of the dogecoin network.  Plan to save dogecoin  AuxPoW is not new – several coins already enable work from other mining networks, with namecoin being the most prominent example. This long-standing reputation as a workable proofing system – and the strength of the litecoin network – has gained the idea support in recent weeks.  In a recent community post on /r/dogecoin, Dogetipbot creator Josh Mohland shared his perspective on the concept, saying that AuxPoW would help solve a key problem with dogecoin: the fact that it was never intended to function as a full-fledged transaction network.  Mohland explained:  ""Dogecoin was built to die quickly – none of us expected it to grow into the absurd entity it is today. With that said, there's absolutely an easy way to save the coin from its certain death (and by death I mean 51% attacked for the lulz), and that's AuxPoW.""  He went on to call AuxPoW “a simple change” worth the trouble, owing to the fact that the risk of a 51% attack far outweighs perceived costs.  Other community members expressed concern over the idea, saying that the move enables large litecoin pools to crowd out smaller dogecoin miners. Questions were also raised as to whether or not AuxPoW would actually help prevent a 51% attack.  Dogecoin in 'dire situation', says Lee  Litecoin creator Lee hailed the announcement, telling CoinDesk that the development team made the right decision during a “dire situation”.  Lee argued that the move comes at the right time given the long-term threat to the dogecoin network – and, as some have pointed out, its falling price. He added that the move provides increased security for dogecoin without any repercussions, removing a source of concern for the network and enabling broader development in the community.  Lee told CoinDesk:  “[The community] can focus on what dogecoin does best (tipping, donations, wow) instead of worrying about defensive mining and network security.”  Image via Doge Assets",POSITIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | DOGE | LTC | MINING | FORKS,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/04/dogecoin-to-allow-litecoin-merge-mining-in-network-security-bid,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3e22c6fffac9895c1b3f74e92db8d44f5e57421-1382x954.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397836,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJkZ,1407188403,BTC.com Domain Sold to GAWMiners for Record $1 Million,"UPDATE (6th August 12:20 BST): This piece has been updated following the official announcement of the sale by Domain Guardians. The final sale price was $1m rather than $1.1m as originally stated by GAWMiners CEO Josh Garza.      The domain name BTC.com has been sold to bitcoin mining equipment specialist GAWMiners.  It had been on the market for less than a month before GAWMiners chief executive Josh Garza secured the $1m deal.  GAWMiners  is a relatively large mining hardware vendor. The Connecticut-based firm sells a wide range of SHA-256 and scrypt ASICs, including hardware from Bitmain, Gridseed, Innosilicon, Rock Miner, SilveFish as well as its own GAWMiners brand machinery.  It remains unclear what Garza hopes to do with the newly acquired domain. At press time, the site features a placeholder stating that something ""amazing"" is coming soon.  Domain name interest continues  The sale of BTC.com is yet another entry into the string of recent domain name acquisitions. Indeed, today’s news yet again illustrates the many opportunities for brokers and investors that bitcoin has brought to the domain name industry.  Niko Younts announced in February that he had sold BitcoinWallet.com to an Austin-based entrepreneur, Alex Charfen, for $250,000. Younts had initially purchased the domain name for $11,000. He also indicated that another domain name in his ownership, BitcoinWallets.com was on the market for a similar asking price, $200,000.  Yet not every effort has been successful in the space as of late.  Last month, former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles announced the auction of Bitcoins.com, as part of an effort to provide relief to those that lost money in the now defunct bitcoin exchange. A Seattle court moved to block the sale and the auction was subsequently canceled.  Reaching consumers  Beyond the investment opportunity, bitcoin-related domains offer buyers the chance to catch consumer interest with easy-to-use URLs.  In April, Blockchain.info signed a 5-year deal to manage Bitcoin.com, which had previously been used by Coinbase to attract customers.  Blockchain said it would use the domain to reach out to mainstream consumers unfamiliar with bitcoin, and made good on its promise in June, when it officially relaunched it. The company now uses the site as a learning platform for people new to bitcoin and digital currency.

42397845,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJqT,1407182724,Xapo Responds to Backlash Over Bitcoin Debit Card Fees,"UPDATE (5th August 00:15 BST): This piece has been updated with statements issued in a new Xapo blog post.      California-based bitcoin wallet provider Xapo is facing community backlash following the release of its latest product, the Xapo Debit Card.  Xapo started shipping the cards on 30th July, roughly one month after its original estimated launch date. Yet the news has largely been overshadowed by the company's recently published fees and limits schedule.  The schedule eventually found its way to reddit, evoking a strong response from customers who were upset to find the product would be more expensive than they originally believed.  Xapo has now formally responded to the situation via a company blog post, stating that the fee schedule is the product of its partnership with the third-party issuer of the cards. This partner, Xapo says, requires a monthly service fee, card replacement fee and currency conversion fee, among other additional charges.  The post reads:  ""The Fees & Limits Schedule we posted is from the existing third-party program under which we are currently able to have the cards issued.""  Further, Xapo said that it did not intend to deviate from its original announcement, and that it will, in some cases, reimburse customers for fees incurred, adding:  ""We do not intend to charge monthly fees or fees for everyday spending. If our users are charged a monthly service fee, Xapo will reimburse that amount in bitcoins. So, if you use the Xapo Debit Card and are charged a monthly service fee by our third-party provider, we will directly reimburse your Xapo Wallet.""  Xapo concluded the blog post by providing information on how customers could opt out of the card offering, and stating that it is working to bring the cards to India and the US, areas where the product is not currently available.  Bitcoiner uproar over hefty fees  When it announced the card, Xapo promised a $15 one-time shipping and handling fee, but the company did not reveal any information on other associated costs.  The fee schedule, however, revealed the following card charges:  A monthly service fee of $4.95, or £3.95/€3.95 for European customers  An international ATM transaction surcharge  Declined transactions costs of $1, or £1/€1  Domestic ATM transaction costs of $3.50 per transaction, or £2.50/€2.50 in Europe.  The company did not release a fee schedule prior to launch. However, it suggested costs would be limited to a one-time charge of $15. On its FAQ page, the company said that the initial fee covers the cost of issuing and shipping the card.  ""Merchants will pay all fees just as they do for debit and credit cards but there won't be a fee for the customer,"" Xapo stated.  Unfortunately, the ambiguous wording of Xapo's statements led many customers to conclude there would be no additional fees for using the card, an opinion evidenced by the strongly negative response to the company's update.  Xapo has since stated that it did not factor ATM fees into its original statements, as it did not believe it would offer such a service, stating:  ""When we announced the card, we indicated that the card would not work at ATMs, so we didn’t address ATM fees. We have worked hard to make this functionality available for the Xapo Debit Card, but there are charges associated with ATM usage, similar to ATM fees currently associated with your bank-issued debit card.""  Failure to communicate  A potential driver of the strong consumer backlash was that the release of additional pricing information came after many users had already signed up to receive the card.  The result was that a number of separate reddit conversations arose to address the topic, with individual posts highlighting the card's specific pricing policies and availability eventually giving way to more general posts criticizing the company's overall marketing of the product.  Further, message board comments ran the gamut from overwhelmingly negative to sympathetic, with a small number of users noting that Xapo's final product was likely influenced by poor US regulation and the difficulties inherent in the company's bid to acquire a traditional financial partner to support the offering.  Ongoing issues  Xapo's Debit Card has been a source of strain for the company since its initial announcement.  At the time of the launch  , Xapo had indicated to news sources including TechCrunch and CoinDesk that MasterCard's payment network would supply the rails for the debit card transactions.  MasterCard quickly moved to separate itself from the offering, telling CoinDesk:  ""MasterCard does not have a relationship with Xapo. There is no card program currently available.""  However, Xapo told CoinDesk that it had secured a partner for the card offering as of early July, and that the delays in the shipment were purely product-based.  A spokesperson for Xapo said on 3rd July:  ""We took a bit of extra time with early testing to make sure the experience is as smooth as possible for our customers.""

42397833,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEJhc,1407177306,Visa Exec: Our Network Could Support Bitcoin Payments,"Global payments giant Visa earned the ire of the bitcoin community earlier this year when CEO Charlie Scharf stated that he didn't see bitcoin and its technology as posing a significant threat to its operations.  Now, however, new comments from the CEO suggest that the company may be re-evaluating bitcoin.  In a new interview with The Australian Financial Review (AFR), Scharf confirmed that while the company is not currently responding to developments in the bitcoin space, it could be well positioned to do so in the future, should circumstances require.  Scharf told the AFR:  “Visa is not a currency, it’s a network. We can process real or virtual currencies to the extent that it makes sense. So, [facilitating bitcoin payments] is possible but we are not thinking about it today.”  Scharf further explained that Visa has no interest in creating a Visa-branded digital currency, as has been suggested of some of its competitors who have sought to secure digital currency-related patent filings.  The interview follows the late July launch of Visa Digital Solutions, a company initiative that seeks to support new payment methods and encourage technology that protects consumers and innovation.  Emphasis on innovation  Notably, the comments come at a time when Visa is trying to increasingly align its brand with the ongoing revolution in digital and mobile payments.  Visa recently opened Visa Labs, a San Francisco-based office meant to inspire next-generation ideas for the company, and unveiled its version of an online credit card, Visa Checkout, designed to increase the speed and ease of e-commerce for web consumers.  Visa senior vice president of digital solutions Sam Shrauger likened Visa's strategy shift to those that seek to embrace the new changes being brought on by technology, telling AFR:  ""We are now seeing connected thermostats and cars and everything – our view is that a lot of those things will become points of transaction.""  Shrauger formerly served as vice president of global product and design for online payments powerhouse PayPal, serving the company from 2004 to 2012.  PayPal background  Shrauger's involvement in Visa's digital payments push suggests that there are at least some members of Visa that may be considering the possibilities posed by bitcoin and its related technologies, which in turn may be having a broader influence at the company.  PayPal has steadily increased its visible support for digital currency of late, with corporate strategist Roman Leal joining Blockchain's Peter Smith for a panel talk at The North American Bitcoin Conference on 20th July.  PayPal also notably held an 'Introduction to Bitcoin' event in San Jose, California on 31st July.  Correction: A previous version of this article attributed Scarf's quotes to Shrauger.

42397805,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHYn,1407171813,Kyrgyzstan: Bitcoin Payments Violate State Law,"The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, the central bank of Kyrgyzstan, has issued new statements confirming the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies as a form of payment is currently illegal under national law.  Issued this July, the notice states that the only legal tender in Kyrgyzstan is the national currency, the som (KGS), and that as such, any use of bitcoin for payment violates this policy. At press time, 1 KGS was worth $0.019.  The document reads:  ""Under the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic, the sole legal tender on the territory of our country is the national currency of Kyrgyzstan som. The use of 'virtual currency', bitcoins, in particular, as a means of payment in the Kyrgyz Republic will be a violation of the law of our state.""  The central bank also moved to warn consumers about the potential risks associated with digital currency, confirming that no laws currently protect consumers who decide to purchase such assets.  ""Virtual currency is regulated by no central government agency in the world, [...] and the lack of any [centralized institution] makes public or private regulation of system almost impossible,"" the document reads.  Research from the US Law Library of Congress and digital currency community resource BitLegal suggests this marks the first time the country's central bank has addressed digital currency use directly.  Risky investment  Echoing concerns raised by central banks internationally, the release characterized bitcoin as a risky asset that lacks sufficient security.  For example, the document noted that it is impossible for consumers to cancel transactions made in bitcoin once payment is transmitted, making the users susceptible to theft and scams.  The statements also took aim at bitcoin's price volatility, stating:  ""The cost of 'virtual currency' is not tied to any currency or other asset, and, in fact, the formation of its cost is influenced by demand and supply for it, that creates high risks of exchange rate volatility and loss of value.""  Legal risks  Although other countries have issued similar warnings, the Kyrgyz Republic's release may be notable in the tone it takes toward bitcoin use.  Building off its criticisms of bitcoin as an unstable payment tool, the government recommended that citizens ""do not participate in the purchase, sale or exchange for other currencies or assets"".  Doing so, the bank suggests, could also open digital currency users to legal liability, as the document states users ""assume all the possible negative consequences of the possible violation of the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic"".  Data shows that the official Bitcoin-Qt wallet has only been downloaded around 1,000 times in the central Asian nation with a population just shy of 6 million, suggesting local digital currency use is not widespread.

42397803,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHXo,1407168080,Ross Ulbricht's Silk Road Defence Invokes Fourth Amendment,"Ross Ulbricht's defence team has filed a new pre-trial motion calling on the court to dismiss charges in the Silk Road case on the grounds of Fourth Amendment privacy protections.  Ulbricht's lawyers argue the charges should be dismissed due to the nature of the FBI's investigation. In particular, they allege the FBI acted without a valid search warrant when it discovered Silk Road servers in Iceland, and thereby violated Ulbricht's Fourth Amendment rights.  The fourth amendment to the US Constitution is a part of the Bill of Rights and prohibits 'unreasonable' searches and seizures. It requires investigators to carry out searches with a judicially sanctioned warrant, supported by probable cause.  Ulbricht has indicted on various charges including conspiracy to distribute narcotics, operating a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and money laundering.  Evidence battle begins  The latest 90-page memorandum filed by Ulbricht's lawyers argues that all material seized and searched in such a way has been ""contaminated at its source"" rendering it inadmissible in court under the 'fruit of the poisonous tree' doctrine. This metaphor effectively means that, if evidence is obtained illegally (tainted), anything gained from that evidence is also tainted and therefore inadmissible in court.  ""Thus, the Fourth Amendment and relevant statutes require suppression of the fruits of the searches and seizures, and any evidence or other information derived therefrom,"" the motion states.  The document specifically names 14 different searches of Ulbricht's computers and online accounts, and claims that investigators carried out several surveillance operations either without warrants or with inappropriate warrants ""issued on information establishing less than probable cause"". These actions included asking Comcast for information on Ulbricht's IP address.  The defence argues that investigators used so-called 'general warrants' that allowed them to use all personal data they could obtain, rather than more specific information. In addition, the motion points out that it is still unclear how investigators managed to locate Silk Road servers in Iceland.  'Unlawful searches and seizures'  Ulbricht's defence went on to list a total of 14 search warrants that were issued following the discovery of Silk Road's servers in Iceland.  The motion states:  ""A vast trove of material and information, including ESI, should be suppressed because the government obtained it as a result of unlawful searches and seizures – either directly because the specific warrant or order authorizing the search and/or seizure was unlawful, or because the search and seizure constituted the 'fruit of the poisonous tree' of a previously conducted invalid search and/or seizure – that violated the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, as well as certain applicable statutes.""  The document goes on to cite numerous precedents to its fundamental argument, and further demands discovery of the means by which the US government located the Silk Road servers.  The court should compel the government to disclose all information relevant to the efforts to locate the servers, the defence argues.  Dropping murder references  In addition to Fourth Amendment arguments and dry precedents, the motion also makes a request to drop prejudicial statements related to the defendant's alleged murder-for-hire solicitation. The defence seeks to dismiss any reference to these allegations as irrelevant, arguing that such language violates Ulbricht's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.  ""Accordingly, since there is no concrete link between the murder-for-hire allegations and the unrelated drug trafficking and other charges in this case, it is clear that all references to 'murder-for-hire' are irrelevant to the charges, and their inclusion in the Indictment is highly prejudicial to Mr. Ulbricht,"" the motion states.  Ulbricht still faces one murder-for-hire charges filed in Maryland, but since he was not charged in the New York case and has not been convicted yet, the defence argues all murder-for-hire references should be struck from the indictment.  So far, Ulbricht's lawyers and backers have tried using several different arguments to dismiss some or all of the charges, including citing IRS guidance that labeled bitcoin property in an attempt to have the case's money laundering charges dismissed.  More broadly, FreeRoss.org, the non-profit that seeks to raise money and awareness for Ulbricht's case has attempted to make the case that larger Internet freedoms will be affected by an Ulbricht conviction.

42397821,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHnY,1407166242,GHash Mining Pool Generates $250 Million in Bitcoin in One Year,"Since opening its doors on 3rd August of last year, major bitcoin mining pool operator GHash.io has generated nearly $250m in bitcoin, according to a new infographic released by the company.  The pool has produced 413,752.01889456 BTC since it first began hashing in 2013, an amount worth $248,251,211.33 according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index.  This fact was just one of the noteworthy statistics provided by the infographic, as the full release contains both hard mining data as well as a brief timeline of the company’s history.  The publication comes at a time when the company has faced scrutiny for its outsized share of the bitcoin network hashrate – a number which has come perilously close to 50% in recent months. As a result, GHash has embarked on a campaign of transparency and advocacy to assuage community concerns it could or would carry out a 51% attack against the network.  Overall, the data demonstrates GHash's long-standing position as one of the largest mining pools in the space.  Blocks galore  The most notable information in the release pertains to the number of blocks GHash has processed since the pool first opened. Of course, given its long operating history, it’s not surprising that GHash has received its fair share of hashes.  According to the infographic, GHash has received almost 383 sextillion hashes - or 382,760,564,258,698,078,191,616 hashes, to be exact.  Miners themselves have submitted nearly 90 trillion shares, or exactly 89,118,388,541,671 shares, since mining began.  With this massive amount of hashing power, GHash has solved quite a few blocks as well. Since launch, the pool has solved 156,039 blocks, enabling the confirmation of 6,105,849 transactions.  Steady rise in users  Despite criticism about its size and grassroots-level calls for miners to shift away their hashing power, GHash has seen a steady rise in the number of workers mining in its pool.  The number of users rose steadily in the first few months, according to the infographic, reaching 44,000 by November. It reached 132,000 by March after a rapid climb following the now-infamous price increase at the end of 2013, and as of July, GHash had 220,000 registered users.  As one might expect, GHash users contribute a significant amount of hashing power, with most of that number deriving from hardware. GHash miners using their own equipment contribute roughly 41 PH/s, with an additional 5 to 6 PH/s coming from the pool’s cloud hosting service.  Unsurprisingly, the site has utilized a tremendous amount of electricity during operation. Since launch, miners on GHash have consumed 159,519,788 kilowatt hours worth of power.

42397812,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHfg,1407160197,France Inches Closer to Bitcoin Regulation,"The French Senate has released a new report focusing on the type of regulation the government should apply on bitcoin transactions.  Titled ‘Regulation in the face of innovation: public authorities and the development of virtual currencies’, the report follows a meeting of the committee of finance on 23rd July and is based on communication between committee president Philippe Marini and Senate member Francois Marc.  It was inspired by a joint meeting held by the Senate, Treasury, customs, the Banque de France, TracFin (which deals with money laundering issues) and bitcoin specialists in January this year.  As well as looking on the type of regulation France should adopt, the report discusses the regulations used in other countries around the world, and the possible uses of digital currency in the future.  Though clearly stating that bitcoin is – for now – nothing more than a type of virtual bartering tool, the document calls cryptocurrencies a “long-term trend raising important legal and economic matters, that can no longer be disregarded by public authorities”.  It also remains optimistic about the number of opportunities bitcoin may offer. Without ignoring the risks related to its “volatility, its anonymity and its lack of legal guarantee”, it underlines the possible uses of the currency as a “payment system and […] a decentralised validation protocol”.  A measured approach  As mentioned in Minister of Finance Michel Sapin's speech last month, the report shows that France isn't keen on imposing overly strict regulations on bitcoin, instead choosing to remain “halfway between the strictest regulations [from] China, Japan or Russia or the lightest regulations adopted by countries such as the United States, Canada or Israel”.  Acknowledging the relative futility of establishing different national policies, given the nature of the subject, the report proposes a regulatory framework to be established on a European, or hopefully international level.  The report may please French bitcoin enthusiasts willing to see the cryptocurrency gain some popularity, such as co-founder of Bitcoin France and Maison du Bitcoin, Thomas France.  He told CoinDesk that, though the bitcoin scene was only starting to shake up in the country, legal frameworks being put in place by the government would reassure entrepreneurs and companies, and hopefully encourage them to start getting involved.  This isn't the first time the French government has issued regulation on bitcoin. In July, it published a report calling for VAT taxation and greater transparency on all transactions involving digital currencies. There would be a threshold on the margin tax of €5,000, which would leave more room for people to experiment with the currency. The document said:  “We believe that France should let people try, invest and develop business with bitcoin before we tax it.”  Luxembourg Palace image: Dafinka / Shutterstock.com",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Marie Le Conte,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/04/france-inches-closer-to-bitcoin-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63caa1bcf8ec95916c58436253ca01396a9a61c4-1280x857.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397819,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHkb,1407155578,HashPlex Launches Hydropowered Miner Hosting Facility,"The developmental pace of bitcoin mining, both in terms of its scale and complexity, has been as fast and revolutionary as the rise of the price of the digital currency itself. From hobby computers built in basements to vast warehouses of ASICs, the mining industry has seen tremendous change in a relatively short period of time.  How bitcoin mining will evolve in the years ahead remains to be seen, but one thread in the broader fabric of the industry currently is the growth of businesses that provide power and hosting services for owners of existing hardware.  One such company is HashPlex, the owner and operator of a brand-new data center located in Seattle, Washington, which opened its doors to customers on 28th July and offers one year or longer contracts for miners seeking more affordable power resources.  A first for mining  HashPlex’s facility is the first purpose-built data center for digital currency mining – including both bitcoin and altcoins based on other hashing algorithms – incorporating a customer-facing approach that includes a cloud-based user interface. Additionally, it is also the first company that enables miners with existing hardware to house their equipment in a dedicated, third-party facility.  The launch comes just a month or so after the company received $400,000 in seed capital from a notable group of investors that included Bitcoin Opportunity Corp founder and entrepreneur Barry Silbert and Facebook senior engineer Jason Prado.  Founder and CEO Bernie Rihn told CoinDesk in an interview that every aspect of the data center was approached from the unique perspective of cryptocurrency mining, saying:  “Everything from the dirt, to the steel through the the roof, [to] the electrical systems – it's all designed. We have our own custom power management system as well.”  Notably, the company utilizes renewable energy sources to provide power, making the 1 megawatt (MW) facility a greener alternative to traditional electricity sources.  Remote management  While offering hardware management and power facilitation for miners, HashPlex enables its customers to direct their hashing power and monitor its performance remotely through the cloud user interface.  As shown in a demo provided by HashPlex, the interface is a visual improvement over the command-line style mining that many hobby-scale owners are accustomed to.  According to Rihn, the goal is to provide the user with as much as information as possible, including hashrates, core temperatures and overall history. Users can also choose reboot thresholds to optimize performance and set back-up pools in case their first selection goes down or becomes unaccessible.  Rihn added that the reboot feature helps avoid a common problem in industrial-scale mining operations: having to manually shutdown and restart hardware.  Green approach to mining  HashPlex's new centre benefits from the availability of hydropower, which the facility utilizes for 80% of its power output. The site does rely on some net carbon-producing electrical sources, but the firm says that, in the future, that percentage of renewable energy sources it uses will increase.  Beyond the environmental impact, tapping renewable sources like hydropower gives a company like HashPlex an efficiency advantage. Rihn told CoinDesk that as a result, the HashPlex facility is at least five to 10 times as efficient as a traditionally designed data center.  Rihn commented that this is the natural progression of the industry, as renewable sources are seeing as a viable – and necessary – source of energy for mining operations. He contested the notion that the environmental costs of bitcoin mining are a long-term issue, saying:  “Anybody who says that bitcoin mining is a carbon footprint nightmare is mistaken, in that a lot of bitcoin mining in the future will done where the power is very cheap.”    Disclaimer: This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of any of the companies mentioned.

42397822,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHmZ,1407149216,New Bitcoin Exchange Quoine Offers Pro Tools for Asian Traders,"A new trading exchange has set its sights on the wealthy markets of Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, and wants to usher in a new era of professionalism for serious bitcoin traders across Asia.  Quoine  is being built by a management team of former and current forex traders who have all worked at some of the biggest names in banking, in the world's premier financial centers.  With a philosophy that all financial dealings should be treated ""like hygiene"" in order to function properly, the team is focusing on security and compliance, with an interface designed to be both professional trader- and amateur-friendly.  The need for a local exchange  Mario Gomez-Lozada, Quoine's CEO and founder, told CoinDesk he was taken aback at the volumes and number of users the exchange had accumulated, despite its beta status:  ""I was pleasantly surprised at the level of interest [in Japan] from what I've seen. More than I thought, actually. We just launched a couple of weeks ago and we have some volume now. It was quite active yesterday and today, there are guys making markets in Japan, a few people coming in buying a lot of bitcoin.""  He further said statistics showed that about 90% of current users were in Japan, indicating the country's eagerness to trade bitcoin and hunger for a proper exchange.  Tokyo is still a major global financial center, with all the world's major financial institutions maintaining a large presence in the city and a population of traders from all over the world.  Previously, Mt. Gox had been the only major exchange that accepted local bank transfers from Japan and approved identification documents in Japanese language without the need for official translations.  ""Japan is a huge market and there's a gap thanks to Mt. Gox. There is a huge opportunity to grow the ecosystem.""  Exchange features and future additions  Since January, Gomez-Lozada has been working with a development team based in Vietnam to build Quoine's interface and trading backend. Half that time has been spent testing and trying out new features, he said.  Still in beta, the exchange is available in both English and Japanese languages. Additionally, the developers are also working to include Indonesian, in preparation for a launch in that country in the near future.  Quoine is also more focused on trading features than other digital currency exchanges. For now, it supports a range of fiat currencies, including USD, JPY, SGD, and HKD, along with bitcoin.  The aim is to eventually support all fiat currencies using a background conversion system designed by Gomez-Lozada himself.  The site also offers market, limit and range orders, with live market data and candlestick charts, and is now testing a margin trading system that will eventually boost volumes and allow users to make significantly larger trades.  Wallets, payments and smartphones  As is standard with other exchanges, wallet and payment systems are built in. The company is currently talking to partners in Japan about ways to leverage these services to potentially provide local merchant services to compete with local startups like Bitcheck.  Quoine's clean, two-tone web interface is designed primarily for use on mobile devices and browsers, with a desktop version also coming soon. Gomez-Lozada said the mobile priority was a conscious decision, as most forex traders in Asia preferred to use smartphones.  ""This kind of thing you have to be watching all the time, you can't be sitting in front of a computer. When I was a forex trader I never used a desktop.""  Once the margin trading system is functioning smoothly, the exchange plans to hold an official launch.  Security tradeoff  Quoine says it takes up to 24 hours to withdraw funds, including bitcoins, from user accounts. This is due to coins being stored in cold wallets, which Gomez-Lozada said is a tradeoff to allow users to feel more secure.  Checks and balances are run on a daily basis and performed manually to make sure everything matches up, using a process similar to that of banks.  ""As a user, I'd prefer an exchange to be like that,"" Gomez-Lozada added.  In the bitcoin closet  Quoine's management team all come from a forex trading and fintech background, with key members still working at major companies until the time comes when they can 'out' themselves as bitcoiners.  Gomez-Lozada said he hopes his own experience working in finance and trading, along with experience working in Asia, give him the qualifications he needed to run Quoine.  Originally from El Salvador, he emigrated to the US as a teenager where he obtained a Masters in Computer Science before moving to Tokyo.  For about 15 years, he worked at companies like Merrill Lynch and Bank of America in Tokyo and Credit Suisse in Japan and Singapore, holding the CIO position at both companies and managing FICC (fixed income currencies & commodities) technology.  After dabbling in Internet startups, he decided to return to his trading and technology roots and build a ""proper exchange"" to trade bitcoin, something he and his colleagues were fascinated by.  ""We don't think there's that many exchanges right now being run by people who came from finance,"" he continued.  He also has plenty of experience dealing with regulators and risk control in Japan, and understands what companies need to do in order to stay compliant.  Gomez-Lozada has largely bootstrapped the project from his own savings, but also accepted additional funding from a Japanese angel investor who is a big believer in bitcoin and wanted to join the project.  How will it perform?  CoinDesk was able to road-test the beta exchange and can report that there were no problems getting verified with Japanese language-only documents, funding the account with a local Japanese bank transfer, and buying bitcoin at reasonable market rates.  Withdrawing bitcoins was also seamless, actually taking far less than the cited 24 hours to complete.  Quoine will face immediate competition in its quest to ""fill the Mt. Gox void"". BitFlyer, an exchange founded by former Goldman Sachs derivatives trader Yuzo Kano, is currently chasing Japanese business with its Japanese language-only site.  BitOcean Japan  , the local arm of Chinese startup and ATM producer BitOcean, is also gearing up to launch a multi-language exchange based in Tokyo this month, through its partnership with Atlas ATS.
