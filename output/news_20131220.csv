42425210,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvTxh,1387577259,Polish Finance Official: Bitcoin is Not Illegal,"With the legal status of bitcoin still under debate in Poland, a recent announcement by an official from the country’s Ministry of Finance sheds more light on the complex issue.  A growing number of local businesses are embracing the use of bitcoin, but national authorities remain cautious about regulating the use of digital currencies in the Polish economy.  On 18th December, a seminar on the legality of bitcoin was held at the Warsaw School of Economics (Szkoła Główna Handlowa). Based in the Polish capital Warsaw, SGH is one of the country’s leading business universities.  Speaking at the seminar, Szymon Woźniak, an official from the Polish Ministry of Finance, said that the ministry does not consider bitcoin to be illegal, although it does not consider it to be a legal currency either.  Woźniak explained:  ""What is not forbidden is permitted. However, we certainly cannot consider bitcoin to be a legal currency.”  The ministry is carefully observing the development of bitcoin, according to the ministry official. The ministry is also monitoring how other European Union member states are regulating the status of bitcoin, Woźniak said, adding:  ""We are not blocking the way for the development of bitcoin. However, we expect its users to declare whether they want the state to protect and regulate, or to remain uninvolved.""  According to the official, under Polish law, profits generated by digital currency transactions are subject to taxation, and those who do not declare them to the country’s revenue service could face sanctions.  Despite the legal uncertainties, some local observers believe that the Polish bitcoin market has significant growth potential and point to the increasing popularity of bitcoin mining in Poland.  Krzysztof Piech, Ph.D., an economist and lecturer at SGH, said at the seminar that Poland is in the avantgarde of the worldwide digital currency movement.  Poland-based bitcoin miners rank tenth among all countries in terms of their output, according to data obtained by Piech:  ""We have a human resources potential and innovative financial institutions. Regulations are the lacking element which could help both sides [cooperate] for the benefit of the economy”.    Other speakers at the event included Lech Wilczyński, co-founder of local startup InPay. The company is currently developing a pilot program in a number of Polish cities which is set to boost the use of bitcoin among the country’s retail outlets.      To achieve this, InPay will provide local retailers with payment terminals and educate them on the legal and tax-related aspects of implementing digital currency payments at their businesses.    The question of bitcoin’s legal status was previously addressed in a policy document signed by the country’s Deputy Minister of Finance, Wojciech Kowalczyk and released in July 2013, as earlier reported.  The document stated that, under Polish law, bitcoin and other digital currencies cannot be considered as legal currencies, as they are not universally treated as such by Poles.  As a result, all transactions made in bitcoins are to be considered as a result of two parties agreeing contractually to use the digital currency in settling their dealings, according to the policy document.  The finance ministry also said that the question of the legal status of digital currencies was debated not only in Poland, but also in a number of EU member states, and ""all eventual actions related to digital currencies should be taken at international level, in particular at the European Union level.”  Despite the lack of official recognition of bitcoin by national authorities, Poles trade digital currencies on local platforms.  According to data obtained from Bitcoincharts, local bitcoin exchange Bitcurex.pl had, on 20th December, a 30-day volume of some 37,156.5 BTC and 92.68m PLN ($30.59m).

42397329,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZpd,1387566920,Blockchain.info: the World's Most Popular Bitcoin Website and Wallet,"CoinDesk spoke to Nicolas and Ben of Blockchain.info about it being the #1 bitcoin site, how it will remain so into the future, why its users trust it so much and how online wallets need to be easy to use as well as secure.  The Blockchain.info team has been busy. The site grew by over 50% last month, with over 118 million page views and over 3 million unique visitors in November 2013. The number of registered bitcoin wallets jumped from 500,000 at the start of the month to 800,000 at the end and is now on its way to 1 million. These 'My Wallet' users engage in about 24,000 transactions daily, sending about 150,000 BTC in total.  That's quite a change from January 2013, when the site boasted ""over 110,000 users."" Even in August, daily transactions were around 100,000 BTC (worth $12m at the time). Due to the way Blockchain's encryption works, it is impossible to know the total number of bitcoins stored there.  Services  Blockchain.info has grown to be not only the #1 most visited bitcoin-related site, but arguably also the most compelling and most-often quoted. If the block chain itself is bitcoin's raw narrative told in some incomprehensible language, then Blockchain.info is its interpreter.  The clean, bare-bones design appeals to statistics geeks and bitcoin newcomers alike, with a simple search box to recover information on transaction IDs, bitcoin addresses, or IP addresses. There's a page of various developer APIs providing access to every kind of useful data on the bitcoin economy with a simple message: ""Services provided by Blockchain.info are free of charge. Please do not abuse them.""  The My Wallet service has grown to such proportions that it will soon be spun off to a separate property, Blockchain.com. The team plans to offer a raft of new payment services to wallet users upon logging in, such as the ability to acquire bitcoins from popular exchanges or spending them for gift cards with Gyft. They also hope to add options like bill-paying and other shopping opportunities.  The basic block chain explorer ""Always has been, always will be a free service"" to support research, media and institutional investors.  Looking to the future  Blockchain.info did all this despite its team being (for the moment) also quite bare-bones. In fact, until the spring of 2013 Blockchain was just one person: software developer Ben Reeves. But then bitcoin started heading to the moon and Blockchain had to grow to handle all its users, of both the data and the bitcoin wallet service.  There are currently five people on the Blockchain team, spread around the world: two in Yorkshire, UK; two in New Hampshire, USA; and one in Japan. Even then, it's rare to catch every member in their home country at a given time and the five-strong team is no longer enough.  ""We're growing and hiring a world class team to help manage our development, infrastructure, and user base. A careers page will be going up on the site any day now,"" said Nicolas Cary, Blockchain's second employee.  The team agrees mass adoption and mobile access are both essential to bitcoin's success. Blockchain is currently the only native mobile wallet app available on all major platforms. Cary said:    ""We will absolutely be investing in mobile... We want everyone everywhere to be able to access this; it'll be a huge benefit to bitcoin everywhere.      ""We're ready to bring on the next generation of users. This is going to be disruptive tech for remittances, etc. I want the doors to be open to people experimenting, We will spend all our resources and every waking moment making (Blockchain) the most advanced and usable option.""    The company also pays and transacts entirely in bitcoin.  ""We are a 100% fiat-less company; maybe the first in the world. We have ZERO endpoints into the 'real-world' economy, and the few remaining services we pay for personally we're converting one at a time,"" Cary said.  Online wallet security  As a wallet service that exists online, Blockchain is extremely conscious of security issues and the bad press online wallets have received due to lax security, bad code, or corrupt operators.  Cary points to an article recently published on a major technology news blog that warned people away from all online services, with a hint of irritation:  ""I thought it was an irresponsible article. It makes me mad to see stories about online wallets being a bad idea. Cold storage is great, but if you want to use bitcoin every day then you need some sort of portable storage that's easy to access.""  He's also annoyed that Blockchain tends to get referenced somewhere in any story about an online wallet being compromised, though this probably comes with the territory of being the most well-known.  Blockchain suffered probably its only significant breach in August 2013 when 50 BTC was stolen from some addresses within wallets. The issue was caused by insecurities either in JavaScript's random number generator or the Android OS itself. Blockchain refunded all lost funds to users.  Customers also lost funds due to insecure passwords, not using two-factor authentication, or simply by misplacing their access credentials. Earlier in the spring, Ben Reeves realized he couldn't handle the sheer number of support tickets by himself, so decided to expand the team, and started building the legal framework to turn his hobby into a serious company.  ""We have a responsibility to defend the technology [of online wallets],"" said Cary.  Blockchain's wallet service is set up in a way that users shouldn't need to be concerned about security infrastructure on the server side. All the important encryption related to the security of users' bitcoins happens on the client side, in the browser or on a mobile device.  It stores an encrypted backup of user wallets on Blockchain's servers so they may be accessed from various places and devices, but do not store user passwords anywhere. The relevant JavaScript code is downloaded from Blockchain's servers every time a user logs in.  Cary said that although client side encryption was important and provided a strong buffer against any server side security issues, the company also takes its server security very seriously. Blockchain is hosted on a dedicated privately owned hardware and is protected by hardware based intrusion protection and packet inspection. Wallets are encrypted with a master key and backed up to Amazon S3 with each update.  Cary said:  ""Maybe 'web-assisted' wallet is a better description than 'web-based' wallet. Unlike traditional web wallets Blockchain users retain exclusive control of their coins and private keys, and if used correctly should require very little trust in our service.""  Blockchain also has ""several monitoring systems in place both internally and externally"" to ensure code is being served as expected, and the developers are confident that a security breach such as a modified server occurred, it would be caught quickly.  Such a risk did not exist for users of the Blockchain apps for Android and iOS, the Mac app or the browser extensions, and Cary recommended these as the most secure ways to log in.  Sticking to principles  Blockchain's live transaction stream is hypnotic, and watching a whole economy's every interaction stream live provides an understanding of bitcoin's elegance and power. Behind those numbers and confirmations there's shopping, trading, gambling wins and losses, grievous user mistakes and crime.  And it all flows in full, undiscriminating public view like no other economy before it.  Most transactions are in the region of 0.1 BTC, 0.01 BTC. Then there's 4.99 BTC and suddenly, a 100.4 BTC transaction appears. They both slip out of view amongst the rest. Blockchain.info's interface for riding the stream is as elegant as bitcoin's block chain itself, and its fascination with simple transaction data was one of the primary motivations for setting up the site in the first place.  The purpose and politics of bitcoin are as important to the current Blockchain team as the integrity of their code. Ben Reeves himself comes from a computer science background, not finance, and the team tries to ""live and breathe the business"" in their borderless, perpetually moving lifestyles.  ""At this time we have no desire to be an exchange whatsoever,"" said Cary, adding:    ""It's not our job to source coins to anybody. And we're not trying to monetize the crap out of all this. We're just a team of people who intrinsically support bitcoin.""      ""The real stories are happening on the core protocol and the investments being made there. It's the less glamorous side but it's the important one.""    ""When we joined together and discussed how we all came to bitcoin, what our core values were. We said we're going to build something that makes a better world through better money.""  ""Success for us is the adoption of bitcoin. Does it have pecuniary rewards for us? Of course. But we're not interested in swimming in a pool of bitcoins like Scrooge McDuck. We're interested in the disruption, the community, that's what makes it fun,"" he concluded.

42422929,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymfh,1387563325,Mobile Vikings: the First Cellular Network to Accept Bitcoin,"Belgian mobile carrier Mobile Vikings has started accepting bitcoin payments – claiming it is the first telecom operator to do so.  The company's service is available in Belgium and the Netherlands. Payments can be used to top up credit or to buy new SIM cards and gift vouchers.  A press release from the operator reads:  “With this new method of payment, Mobile Vikings anticipates the demand of its early adopters, who were not only the first to join Mobile Vikings, but were often the first to purchase bitcoins, and now want to cash these virtual coins.”  Mobile Vikings have decided to employ the BitPay platform, which has already gained plenty of traction among merchants in the bitcoin economy.  BitPay also helps to eliminate any ambiguities by converting bitcoin using the real time exchange rate. It executes the conversion at the moment of payment, which means exchange rate fluctuations aren’t very relevant.  “Just as email and Skype have changed the world of mail delivery and telephony, Bitcoin is a payment system that is simply revolutionary for the monetary world. Everyone is talking about it, but few people know it, let alone use it,” said Hans Similon, Chief Viking Evangelist (Yes, that is his real title).  He added: “As innovation is part of the DNA of Mobile Vikings, we are the first telecom company to introduce a payment option with bitcoins worldwide.""  ""It’s the only way, for ourselves and our members, to really get to know this innovative electronic payment option. The proof of the pudding is in the eating!”  Mobile Vikings told CoinDesk that subscribers have enquired about bitcoin, as many of them were early adopters of the digital currency and already have a bitcoin stash.  “We try to listen to our community as much as possible, so that's why we decided to implement it. Mobile Vikings is also known for being innovative and a bit rebellious, so in our eyes there is a perfect match,” said Mobile Vikings' chief marketing officer Dorien Aerts.  At the beginning of 2013, Mobile Vikings had more than 160,000 subscribers in Belgium, with next to no marketing, apart from a few interesting guerrilla tactics. The company has a going presence in the Netherlands and Poland, too.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/20/mobile-vikings-the-first-cellular-network-to-accept-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1371d5c30d233a900f5267b769966a96e5a58ad8-1000x612.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422956,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yv3h,1387560632,"Tulips, Pigs and Eternal Graffiti: Bitcoin’s Colourful Week","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 20th December 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  No flowers, by request  “Bitnot. Bitnot. Bitnot ...” The normally affable John Law could be heard angrily muttering this strange word under his breath for much of the week, as what should have been an agreeable round of festive engagements turned into a stream of “Ah, Law! Told you that bitcoin thingy was just tulipomania! Never did trust it.”  This is all courtesy of our friend the Chinese state, of course, which has cut off BTC China’s ability to exchange bitcoin for yuan, largely shutting down the cybercurrency’s largest market and prompting a rapid halving in its dollar value.  John Law’s chortling friends - alongside quite a lot of the media - have taken that as a signal that bitcoin is following the tulip mania speculative bubble model, referring to the famous events in Holland in the mid 17th century. Hence the invention, in self-defence, of the word 'bitnot': Bitcoin is not a tulip.  Which isn't to say that recent events are not tulip-scented: people have certainly been buying bitcoin in unreasonable expectation of rapid profits, because unreasonable profits have been available. Doubtless some still smart from this week’s Chinese takeaway. But bitcoin as a whole ain’t no flower, baby.  The tulip madness - in any case, a more complex set of events than those in popular understanding - saw large swathes of the population buy and sell contracts for future delivery of bulbs.  The bulbs themselves didn’t matter: they could have been anything for which fashionable taste had ascribed an arbitrary value. But bitcoin is a fundamental invention that actually does something new; moreover, a lot of its usefulness is pretty much decoupled from whatever speculative value it has at any one time.  If you’re using bitcoin to buy and sell stuff, as opposed to heap up value, then it doesn’t matter enormously whether one bitcoin is worth ten dollars or ten thousand. The person you’re buying your stuff from will give you a price in bitcoin that’s the dollar equivalent at the time of sale, so the amount of bitcoin you send will be worth that much.  As long as you and the vendor can exchange bitcoin for dollars efficiently on-demand, and as long as the price of bitcoin isn’t fluctuating wildly over the course of the transaction, everything works without drama. Things aren’t there yet, but that’s usually unrelated to systematic issues with bitcoin.  In other words, bitcoin isn’t the tulip - it’s the tulip and the system of contracts and the money flowing through the system. While bitcoin can create the illusion of far more value than exists - and remove it, cruelly, when the fantasy topples into instability due to some outside factor - it’s not alone in that, nor is that anything more than one aspect of a much bigger picture. Which will endure.  Meanwhile, John Law is imposing a new rule for party-goers: anyone mentioning the wretched flower without backing it up immediately with an intimate knowledge of the structural failings of the Windhandel contractual environment owes him a bottle of decent claret. To be delivered on the spot. Claret futures will not be entertained.  First rule of fright club  Banks and governments alike seem to be in the same club. When it comes to official policy on bitcoin, the first rule is don’t talk about official policy on bitcoin.  This was demonstrated twice last week, first in the way that the Chinese state banking system without any public announcement put the kibosh on bitcoin exchanges, and then in the way Barclay’s seemed to be hopping from one foot to the other on bitcoin transactions.  Can a company not trading in bitcoin, but working for one that is, use a Barclay’s account? Yes, providing you don’t talk about it. Can a Barclay’s retail customer send money to a Bitcoin exchange? No, but nobody’s talking about it.  While John Law is entertained by the parallels between capitalist banking and authoritarian state socialism - he is reminded, as so often, of the Animal Farm's ending, where pigs and humans became indistinguishable - he does recognise FUD when he sees it.  FUD is an old IBM acronym for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt; it’s a potent weapon for paralysing the competition without having to do anything so uncouth as actually producing competitive products or services.  The way it works is simple. You find the people who may be about to go to your competitors, and make them believe that they’re about to make a really bad decision. This can be by badmouthing the competition: ""Their stuff doesn’t work, and you’ll be in so much trouble if you go with it."" Or by talking yourself up: ""Wait and see what we’ve got coming, you’ll look really stupid if you don’t.""  Or you can make vague, threatening predictions: the whole market is moving away from what you’re looking at, you’ll end up out on a limb. But the key is not to come out with any specifics: the woolier and more ambiguous your ‘information’ is, the better it sucks all the logic and evidence out of the decision making process.  Done skillfully enough, this can not only paralyse an entire market for long enough to kill competition, it can also excuse a large organisation from actually having to make any decisions, thus covering up internal conflicts and systematic lack of clue - sometimes for decades.  John Law would not like you to think that the banking system and the Chinese state are necessarily driven by internal power struggles and pervasive executive incompetence. They might be. You just can’t tell.  But the real problem with FUD is that markets don’t like stasis. IBM got tripped up after decades of controlling the mainframe computer market, because small, nimble, smart companies just created their own new market in minicomputers and used new technology to change the rules. Microsoft ruled computing in the 90s: new technology from the Internet changed the rules and lanced the FUD boil.  It might seem unlikely that anything as mighty as the interlocking global machinery of state regulation and the banking sector can be bypassed with new technology: cybercurrency must play their game or get out.  Yet while they’re reacting with FUD and not even saying what the rules of the game are, history predicts that the rest of us will get tired of waiting and jump ship sooner or later.  Eternal Graffiti  While the rest of the world is lollygagging about trying to work out whether bitcoin is a flower or a threat to global finance, Bitcoin is quietly ironing out its bugs and dealing with problems. Along the way, it’s showing some interesting behaviour that nobody would have predicted.  Most of this is in the areas of privacy, anonymity and criminality. Bitcoin is built on the idea that nobody needs to know who you are or why you’re doing something: what you’re doing, however, is entirely open. But can you link all of that together?  Sometimes, if you go to Mt. Gox to buy some bitcoin, and then go straight to Silk Road to buy some drugs, then it’s safe to infer why you made the Mt. Gox transaction – and, because Mt. Gox will know who you are, there’s now a route for the state to put its size 13s through your front door.  That may be your just desserts. but the same techniques may mean your colleagues can find out how much you get paid (if you’re silly enough to get paid in bitcoin: it still astonishes John Law that people seem to think this a good idea).  Meanwhile, straightforward theft and extortion involving bitcoin remains incredibly difficult to trace back to source.  All this reflects the eternal tension between law and freedom. Should you be banned from doing things because they might cause damage, or be allowed to do them provided you accept the consequences of the damage done?  One way will inevitably stop people from doing things that should be done, out of a surfeit of caution; the other will allow damage to happen that could have been stopped, out of a surfeit of carelessness.  In real life, across history and society, there is no one right answer: a working mix of liberty and control, privacy and publicity, is constantly tried and tinkered with. So it is with bitcoin; this week saw some detailed musings from developer Mike Hearn on keeping your salary private, and more on chasing criminals across the block chain from researcher Sarah Meiklejohn.  John Law has always learned more about the true potentials and pitfalls of cryptocurrency by reading up on what goes on in the engine room than hanging around with the Winklevii or axe-grinding doomsayers. If nothing else, you come away with some delicious little details.  Meiklejohn had a lovely one: because it’s been possible to identify the wallet the FBI is keeping the confiscated Silk Road bitcoin in, people have been able to send it tiny donations - with globally visible notes attached.  These range from spam to trenchant observations via jokes in dubious taste - but because they’re now part of the global block chain and that is designed to be an everlasting record of all transactions, these snide little snippets will last as long as bitcoin itself.  As writing itself evolved from accountancy, there is a delicious resonance here between the very latest, fantastically complex technology and the very first, disarmingly simple business of clay tablets and styluses from 3,000 BCE Mesopotamia.  Whether bitcoin will still be here in 5,000 years, John Law will not speculate – but if it is, so will people’s opinions of the FBI.  Progress.  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude.

42397315,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZbr,1387557007,London Man Attempts to Trademark Bitcoin,"A man from London is attempting to trademark the word “Bitcoin” in the United Kingdom.  In an application made to the UK’s patent office on 5th November, Marvin Dennis of Leyton, East London, is seeking to trademark the term used by Satoshi Nakamoto to describe his cryptocurrency.  Published by the Trade Marks Journal on 4th December, the application for the trademark is due to be granted on 6th February 2014 if unopposed. The trademark regards the use of the term with relation to “chocolates and confectionary”, so wouldn’t have a direct impact on bitcoin’s use in the areas of computing or finance.  This is not the first time someone has tried to trademark bitcoin. In 2011, an American lawyer sought to claim the trademark the word in the US and France.  France, like the United Kingdom, adheres to a principle of first-mover, which means that the first to claim gains ownership of the trademark, as opposed to a principle of first-use, which means that you may have trademark protection by virtue of having used that unique word or symbol, even if you didn’t explicitly register it.  After a massive backlash, Michael Pascazi dropped his US application but then renewed his efforts in France. Mt. Gox mounted a challenge to that claim, successfully defeating his trademark application by claiming it for themselves, saying in a press releasehttps://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20111014.html:  “The Pascazis' stated intention is to profit from these trademarks, which would hamper bitcoin enthusiasts, businesses and the community as a whole on a global basis in the free use and promotion of bitcoin. [Mt.Gox] will oppose this and any other ""greed based"" trademark application, in order to prevent self-serving attempts to profit from bitcoin through spurious legal suits, and keep the term 'bitcoin' free for all.”  It’s unclear whether Marvin Dennis owns any sort of chocolate or confectionary business. No business is listed in the trademark application, as would be the case if a business were applying for the trademark.  Additionally, there is almost no web trail for Mr Dennis. A series of web domains registered to his name and address are inactive, ending on GoDaddy.com pages.  CoinDesk has been unable to find any social media accounts that can be definitively linked to him and he doesn’t appear to be linked with any businesses. An attempt was made to reach Mr Dennis at an email address linked with his domains.  Under UK law, trademark applications must be made to the Patent Office at a cost of £170 if the application is made online.  In this case, Mr Dennis appears to have hired the Trade Marks Bureau to act as representatives for the trademark application. They did not respond to a request for comment.  Once reviewed, applications are advertised in the Trade Marks Journal for two months to allow for objections to be made. Objections are not a legal process, but merely submitting evidence that should be considered before granting a trademark. People can also take legal action to oppose a trade mark application.

42397316,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZdp,1387549852,Telegram Offers $200k in Bitcoin for Cracking its Encrypted Messages,"If you are not an early adopter but you are still hoping to cash in on bitcoin, there is a way to win $200,000 worth of the currency.  However, you will need to be the 21st century equivalent of Alan Turing to pull it off.  Telegram, a super secure messaging service developed by two Russian entrepreneurs, is offering a $200,000 prize in bitcoin to anyone who manages to beat its encryption protocol. This is basically their way of saying that it is practically impossible to crack.  To prove their point, Telegram developers Pavel and Nikolai Durov have started sending private messages containing an email address. Anyone who cracks the code and manages to read the address can claim his or hers prize by sending an email to the address. The company's website states:  ""Telegram backer, Pavel Durov, will give $200,000 in BTC to the first person to break Telegram' encrypted protocol. Starting today, each day Paul (+79112317383) will be sending a message containing a secret email address to Nick (+79218944725). In order to prove that Telegram crypto was indeed deciphered and claim your prize, send an email to the secret email address from Paul’s message.""  To make sure that spammers don’t claim the prize, the message must contain the entire text of the intercepted message, the applicant’s address and a detailed explanation of the attack.  White hat controversy  Offering prizes to white hat hackers who participate in penetration testing is nothing new, but offering such a prize in bitcoin is a first.  However, some in the white hat community dislike the idea. A lively discussion erupted on Hacker News, featuring many critical comments from ethical hackers, like josephlord, who saw the Telegram crypto contest as a publicity stunt devised by people with a ""blindness and an arrogance that could prove fatal"".  Some argued that it could be possible to read the message without actually breaking the protocol.  Of course, a substantial prize is up for grabs, so if these claims are true, those making them should have no trouble picking up an easy $200,000.  Flawed review or possible PR coup?  Telegram announced the competition after some questions were raised about its security. The developers were quick to deny such claims, namely an analysis by security expert Geoffroy Coupriehttp://unhandledexpression.com/2013/12/17/telegram-stand-back-we-know-maths/.  Both Pavel and Nikolai Durov insist Couprie’s review was inaccurate and fundamentally flawed. The brothers then decided to put their money where their mouth is and offer the $200,000 prize.  If Couprie or one of his supporters wins it, they will be vindicated. If not, the Durov’s will score a PR coup.  Just in case the lucky winner, if there ever is one, decides not to claim the prize in bitcoins, Pavel Durov says he will be willing to pay in dollars.  On a side note, the Russian Federal Guard Service (FSO) which is the Russian equivalent of the US Secret Service, has apparently reverted to typewriters for some applications.

42397318,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZcq,1387542331,Australian Bank Publishes Report 'Bitcoin to replace AUD?',"The National Australia Bank (NAB), one of Australia’s ‘Big Four’ banking groups, published a three-page research paper on 19th December titled “Bitcoin to replace AUD?” (Australian dollars).  Despite the provocative title, the paper does not suggest replacing the national currency with bitcoin, nor say it could happen in the near future. Rather, it is an explanation of bitcoin and a comparison of the nature of digital currencies with existing sovereign currencies, and how they fit into the current international financial system.  Bitcoin could well become a widely accepted medium of exchange, the paper said, but it would take many more years to achieve mainstream acceptance.  Major banks around the world have stayed mostly quiet on bitcoin, or presented reports full of references to money laundering and warnings about bitcoin that would seem to apply equally to all national currencies: they can be stolen, or used to purchase illegal goods.  The tone of NAB’s report, however, appears neutral and genuinely curious about bitcoin, presenting a mostly well-explained guide for FX traders more used to the ways other currencies function. It could be an indication of the way large financial players speak of bitcoin amongst themselves, rather than to the general public.  What is a currency?  The paper reminded readers currency has taken many forms over the years, and that Australia’s first currency was rum.  “As such, bitcoins can indeed be a currency, as could anything labeled as such. As long as you believe it is.”  Unlike recent government pronouncements, the NAB report suggests bitcoin does in fact meet most of the classical stipulations of a currency: it is durable (thanks to its basis in easily-duplicatable digital data), portable (people can access it from a variety of devices and locations), scarce (thanks to the overall limit and adjustable mining difficulty), fungible and divisible. It faced some problems with recognizability and acceptance, it said, with only a handful of physical businesses taking bitcoin as payment in Australia.  The explanation of cryptocurrencies was also refreshing, especially to those tired of hearing the accusation that bitcoin is ‘not backed by anything’:  “These are de-centralized digital (or electronic) mediums of exchange. They are not backed by physical assets but rather peer security.”  Exchanges vs. merchants  The paper reviewed the bitcoin situation in other countries, explaining the exchange business and noting that (as of the time of its release) 47% of all bitcoin trades were in Chinese yuan (CNY), with US dollars representing 45%. Other world currencies accounted for only the remaining 8% of bitcoin trades.  Arguments against bitcoin in the report were mainly economic: There are significant costs behind its creation, and the overall 21 million BTC limit could prove deflationary. It also mentioned “a large red flag saying 'buyer beware' at current levels of price and use,” with simple demand and supply being the only ways to determine bitcoin’s fair value.  “The fact that there are multiple exchanges but only 1723 registered businesses worldwide advertised as using bitcoin (no doubt there are more in reality), suggests there may be something in the idea that there is currently more people buying bitcoin in anticipation of an increase in bitcoin value, rather than buying bitcoin in order to use them as a payment method. That strongly suggests a bubble in the present value of bitcoin.”  International view  The report gave a rundown of authorities’ positions on bitcoin worldwide, including Thailand’s implicit ban and the recent changes in China, but also noting that Germany regards bitcoin as capital gains – taxable ‘private money’ and Switzerland might be about to declare bitcoin a foreign currency.  It also briefly referred to bitcoin’s ‘connection’ to illegal activity, in the context that this image was a barrier to building widespread trust, which would take a long time.  NAB is generally considered to be the most bitcoin-friendly of that country’s large banks. One other, the Commonwealth Bank, has actively blocked transactions and closed bitcoin-related accounts, while others have not yet made their positions clear.  Tristan Winters, a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation's chapter the Bitcoin Association of Australia, welcomed the report.  “It’s great to see that Australia’s legacy banking system will be joining us in the 21st Century. The Association is pleased by the NAB’s well reasoned and objective analysis. That’s what we're looking for from the whole sector.”    National Australia Bank - Bitcoin to replace AUD?",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/20/australian-bank-publishes-report-bitcoin-to-replace-aud,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26fa262a80a7fe7c9c99e96b70ac448affc41345-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397314,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZas,1387539909,"'Seals With Clubs' Bitcoin Poker Site Hacked, 42,000 Passwords Stolen","Bitcoin poker site Seals with Clubs has confirmed that its database was compromised, although it failed to mention that it lost 42,020 hashed passwords in the process. The hashes were posted to a forum some 24 hours earlier and needless to say they attracted plenty of people bent on cracking them.  For some reason Seals with Clubs used SHA1 hash functions, which are for all intents and purposes obsolete. Even the latest SHA3 hash is not suitable for passwords and it appears that the site was relying on cryptographic salting to make them more secure, making sure that different hashes would be used even if two users chose the exact same password.  In any case, it did not take long for people to start figuring out some passwords, such as “bitcoin1000000”, “sealswithclubs”, “88seals88” and “pokerseals”. The revealed passwords quickly led security experts to join the dots and conclude that the passwords came from Seals with Clubs users.  On Wednesday, a user posted the database of hashes to a password recovery forum operated by commercial password cracking service InsidePro. The user offered $20 in bitcoins for every set of a thousand unique hashes. It took just nine minutes for the first reply and the first set of 1,000 hashes. Within a day, about two thirds of the list was cracked, reports Ars Technica.  By Thursday, Seals with Clubs was in damage control mode, officially admitting the breach and announcing that it has issued a mandatory password reset. A post on its site read:    The datacenter that we employed up to November permitted unauthorized access to a database server and our database containing user credentials was likely compromised. Passwords were salted and hashed per user, but to be safe every user MUST change their password when they next log in.      Please do so at your earliest opportunity. If your Seals password was used for any other purpose you should reset those passwords too as a precaution.    The site pointed out that it would implement additional security measures, including two-factor authentication and login from a limited number of IP addresses.  This, however, will not address another problem. Since Seals with Clubs is a bitcoin-only service, every account holder is a bitcoin user and there is good chance that at least some of them reused the same password on other bitcoin sites. In other words, some users might be using the exact same password on their exchange accounts or online wallets.  As for Seals with Clubs, it is a relatively small site compared to major Texas Hold’em sites out there. The small team of poker players behind the site chose to remain anonymous and the site was apparently launched after they were sacked. We hope playing poker during office hours had nothing to do with it.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/20/seals-with-clubs-bitcoin-poker-site-hacked-42000-passwords-stolen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8f82587e90d953ec06ca3117dfd075f9d13bd49-1000x560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397324,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZki,1387536317,Online Thief Steals Amazon Account to Mine Litecoins in the Cloud,"Why bother installing CPU-mining malware on thousands of machines, when you can just break into someone’s Amazon cloud computing account and create a well-managed datacentre instead?  This week, a software developer discovered someone had done just that, and made off with a pile of litecoins on his dime.  Melbourne-based programmer Luke Chadwick got a nasty shock after receiving an email from Amazon. The firm told him that his Amazon Key (a security credential used to log on to Amazon Web services) had been found on one of his Github repositories.  Github repositories  Github is an online version control system used for collaborative software development. It works using a central repository holding the source code for a software project.  The source code reaches the site when the author 'pushes' the directory containing it to Github, replicating the entire thing by creating a repository there.  When the author chooses to make that repository public, other software developers can 'fork' it, producing a copy of the repository for their own use, which is then 'cloned', or copied down to their local computers.  [post-quote]  Once they have made their own contributions to the project, either by changing or adding new source code, they can synchronize their code with the forked repository, and then ask the original author to 'pull' their contributions back into the original repository.  Unfortunately, some software developers unwittingly store digital 'keys' used to access online services in those directories.  As long as the Github repository is private, no one else can see them. But as soon as they make it public, the directory becomes searchable, and others can form the repository, accessing the keys.  This has happened on Github before with a type of digital certificate called SSH (Secure Shell), which can grant attackers access to a software developer’s own computer. And it also happened to Chadwick. He said:  “The problem was the same (embedded in GitHub repositories), but this is different to the SSH keys, which could only be used to connect to an existing instance.”  “These keys were for the Amazon's API and could be used to create new machines.” That’s what the attacker did.  1,427 instance hours  After getting word of the key being found in his repository, Chadwick logged in and found a bill for $3,420. The unauthorized user had created 20 Amazon virtual machines. All in all, they had used up 1,427 ‘instance hours’, meaning that they were probably at it for just under three days.  Chadwick wanted to save the virtual machine instances for forensic purposes, but couldn't afford to leave them running while playing for Amazon support, so he killed them.  However, just before he did, he attached the storage volume from one to his own virtual machine instance. He found that the unauthorized user had been mining litecoins with the stolen CPU cycles.  In terms of computing performance, the attacker had made effective use of the stolen account, creating a virtual machine in the 'compute-optimized' class. The cc2.8xlarge instance that they chose has a 64-bit processor with 32 virtual CPUs, and 88 'EC2 Compute Units’.  CPU-friendly scrypt  Litecoin uses a proof of work mechanism called scrypt, which is designed to be CPU-friendly and resistant to GPUs and ASICs. This makes a high-performance EC2 instance perfect for the job, because raw CPU power is what it's good at.  Others who have set up legitimate scrypt mining instances on EC2 (albeit mining YaCoin not litecoin – and in a different type of scrypt) claim to have seen 750 Khashes/sechttp://www.yacoin.org/yac-illustrated-step-by-step-guide-to-starting-your-own-aws-yac-server-farm/ in performance per instance. The attacker’s 20 machines would therefore have been mining at around 15 Mhashes/sec when running together.  Analysing the volume that he mounted on his own virtual machine, Chadwick found that the attacker had used the litecoin mining pool pool-x.eu for the coins. At 1.156GH/sec, this pool represents around 1.1% of the entire litecoin hash rate, suggesting that while mining, the attacker could have accounted for around 1% of the pool’s overall hash rate.  Out the pool  The pool’s administrator, mailing from a vacation in Thailand, preferred not to give his name, but goes by the handle 'g2x3k'. He apologized for not picking up on Chadwick’s email. He thinks CPU cycle theft happens a lot in the litecoin mining space.  “Usually I close accounts on request,” he said, adding that he has banned IP addresses on request before. “Even if I shut them out they can still setup [a] pool or solo mine with those resources.  “I have a list of Amazon IPs already banned, since it was used at the beginning of litecoin to mine more then I thought was a fair share,” he continued.  Let’s hope for the attacker’s sake that they sold early (or for the sake of justice, that they didn’t). Chadwick found out about the instances and shut them down on Monday 16th December, which was the same day that the price of litecoin started crashing.  If the cloud thief wasn’t selling their coins as they went, then they could have lost a healthy profit.  Chadwick doesn’t believe that it would be very easy to track down the attacker. “While I'm sure that Amazon has some records (as does the pool), I would expect the person to be using Tor,” he said.  In the meantime, Amazon has stepped up and refunded Chadwick his money.

42397328,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZmg,1387533049,Canadian Man Builds World’s First Wooden Bitcoin Wallet,"There are a number of bitcoin wallets on the market, but none made out of wood – until now.  Based in Ottawa, Canada, Charley Lazaro is a man with a penchant for woodworking. “I came up with the idea of a wood wallet while playing with my laser engraver machine,” he told CoinDesk.  “I founded the startup The Woody Co here in Ottawa a few months ago, so I am already involved in crafting wood products and using laser etching machines and technology.”  Lazaro is leveraging his laser tools to build personalized wallets for bitcoin enthusiasts. He said: “I realized it would be a great idea to create one of the world's first wood bitcoin wallet, for receive only transactions.”  It’s the QR codes made by the laser etchings that make the wallets receive-only. However, it's the wallets' personal touches that Lazaro believes will entice bitcoin fans.  “I hand craft lovely pieces of wood, hand-selected and hand-sanded. After that, I laser etch the user's public wallet key, name/alias, optional company name and QR code.”  There are a number of unique and interesting bitcoin wallets already on the market. There’s the brain wallet, which allows a user to retain his or her private key in their brain alone. Then there is startup Kryptokit, which provides wallet functionality in the form of a Chrome browser plug-in.  Another interesting concept to pop up recently was the nio Card, a contactless wallet that allows its users to send and receive bitcoin using near field communications (NFC).  Even though Lazaro had known about bitcoin for years, the figurative lightbulb in his head switched on early this year.  “I’ve been following bitcoin since it first started in 2009, but I didn’t realize its potential until it hit about $13 a coin, roughly 11 months ago,” he said. “I've heard economists like Max Keiser talk about it a lot, and that made me stay interested.”  Keiser has been a proponent of bitcoin for some time – recently partnering with Simon Dixon to build the crowfunding platform BankToTheFuture.  With more wooden designs in the pipeline, Lazaro claims this product is just the beginning.  “I am currently designing over five other forms of this wood wallet concept, and will release it to the bitcoin community and world in the next few days.”  Lazaro thinks that his product is unique enough to be considered desirable by bitcoin's supporters. “I believe the low price point, unique design and 'Made in Canada' craftsmanship is enough for people to accept this great product,” he said.  The Woody Co's bitcoin wallet tags are available here. They are priced at $9.99 with shipping to North America included.

42397322,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZik,1387525797,Overstock.com to Become First Major US Retailer to Accept Bitcoin,"Major online retailer Overstock.com plans to accept bitcoin as payment from the second half of 2014, according to various reports.  Website newsBTC first broke the news, with reports in MarketWatch and FT.com later confirming with Overstock.com’s CEO, Patrick Byrne. The company had hinted at accepting bitcoin in a New York Times interview in October, but Byrne said he was waiting for more legal clarification before going ahead. It now seems to be moving towards a more definite schedule.  With over a billion dollars in annual revenue, Overstock.com (increasingly branded as O.co) would be by far the largest retailer to accept bitcoin as a general payment method for all products thus far. It would also serve as an important test case for bitcoin at large scale, with other large retailers (and probably the authorities) looking on in interest.  No word was given on what, if any, bitcoin payment processing company Overstock.com would use and it could decide to create its own. Byrne indicated the plan was a kind of trial for bitcoin, that his company wasn’t going to spend a fortune implementing it and would monitor its use to judge whether to continue accepting it in future.  He also said he would be looking for a system to hedge against bitcoin’s price volatility, promising to convert it straight into dollars otherwise. He was “not in the least” deterred by this week’s downturn, he said.  Underlying principles  Byrne is known for his libertarian views and has been open to bitcoin for a while. In newsBTC’s audio interview he describes himself as “an Austrian economist by background… I endorse bitcoin for many of the reasons I would endorse the gold standard.”  “I believe in money that is not fiat currency, that a government mandarin can’t just create by fiat with the stroke of a pen. Gold has that property and so does bitcoin.”  He said the US Federal Reserve’s “watering down” of currency would eventually see bitcoin gain acceptance. “Bitcoin is good money,” he added. He also told FT.com he didn’t own any bitcoins of his own just yet.  Business support for bitcoin  [post-quote]  While many small and independent retailers have accepted bitcoin for a few years and more have joined in throughout its 2013 days of glory, to date no major retailer with an international profile has chosen to accept bitcoin, as governments dithered over its legality.  Some large companies, like Baidu in China and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, have accepted bitcoin for a particular (and usually quite exclusive) product. While the news was accepted gladly by the bitcoin world, it remained mostly promotional in nature and the community still waits with anticipation for a ‘big name’ supporter.  Overstock.com began its life after the 2000 dotcom bubble collapse, selling office supplies from failed companies. It has grown since then to sell new products and all manner of housewares, travel goods, and accessories. Several of its products are handmade especially for the company by workers in developing nations.  The US’ National Retail Federation ranked Overstock.com second in the country for best customer service in 2010, and a survey that same year also named it one of the top 10 places to work in America.  The company has also been vocal in calling for a more open door immigration policy for skilled workers in the US, saying it was difficult to find the developers it needed to expand the business.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/20/overstockcom-to-become-first-major-us-retailer-to-accept-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8274c69930d66d4e91421018a5ea179057391a64-2114x1566.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
