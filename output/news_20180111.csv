During a meeting on cybersecurity and infrastructure matters, National Security and Defense Council chief Oleksandr Turchynov remarked that a lack of regulation around the tech constitutes a threat to Ukraine’s economy and security, according to a statement released by the government on Jan. 11.  Those risks have resulted in the working group's creation, which will be composed of officials from bodies including the National Bank of Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance, the National Securities and Stock Market Commission and the National Police, among others. The group will determine which agencies will have jurisdiction over the domestic crypto market and create a system for collecting income taxes traced to cryptocurrency trades.  The government statement goes on to read:  ""Moreover, the authorities were assigned to develop a mechanism for ensuring access of law enforcement bodies to the data of cryptocurrency exchanges with the obligation of the given subjects to store information about all transactions within the period established by law for financial institutions and disclosure of customer information on a motivated request.""  Notably, the statement indicates that the National Bank – Ukraine's central bank – may move to create its own cryptocurrency.  ""The National Bank of Ukraine is considering the relevance of establishing its own cryptocurrency,"" it stated.  A bill already in front of the Ukraine legislature would bring cryptocurrency exchanges under the central bank's oversight, as previously reported.  The proposed legislation contained provisions focused on the taxation and oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges and even included a provision regarding domestic mining operations. However, the legislation has not yet been passed into law, and there is no timeline set for its passage.

Public records  show that the bill – sponsored by state Senator Warren Petersen and co-sponsored by three other lawmakers – was submitted for consideration on Jan. 9. It has since been referred to the Arizona Senate Rules Committee for further deliberation.  According to the text, the measure would allow for the use of ""a payment gateway, such as bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, using peer-to-peer systems"" in order to pay ""tax and any interest and penalties"" owed to the state government.  The bill goes on to state:  ""The Department [of Revenue] shall convert cryptocurrency payments to United States dollars at the prevailing rate within twenty-four hours after receipt and shall credit the taxpayer's account with the converted dollar amount.""  Whether the measure gains traction in the Arizona legislature remains to be seen. A similar effort was undertaken in New Hampshire in 2016, but concerns expressed by some state lawmakers – primarily around bitcoin's volatile price – ultimately led to the bill being scuttled.  On the other hand, Arizona lawmakers have moved to approve bills related to the tech in the past.

42380224,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MXh9,1515690004,White Paper Published for Blockchain Privacy Tech Zk-starks,"The highly anticipated white paper for privacy technology zk-starks has been released.  Touted as a more secure version of zk-snarks, the privacy technology used by zcash, zk-starks remove the need for a ""trusted setup."" The publication of the zk-starks white paper will likely cause a stir in the development community.  The paper is co-authored by Eli-Ben Sasson, a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, who has been researching zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for the better part of 15 years. ZK proofs allow information to be verified without revealing anything about the information. Zk-starks offer an alternative to existing ZK cryptography that has long been criticized for its potential security weaknesses and its weight, which makes systems that use the tech slow and expensive.  The white paper states:  ""No ZK system realized thus far in code (including that used by cryptocurrencies like zcash) has achieved both transparency and exponential verification speedup, simultaneously, for general computations.""  Also in the paper, a proof-of-concept is detailed, in which police prove that the DNA of a presidential candidate is not contained within their offender database without revealing any information about the database or the DNA.  Zk-starks have been heralded by a number of cryptocurrency development teams, including the privacy-oriented project monero. Even ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has been researching the tech.  As previously detailed by CoinDesk, blockchain developers seem to be aiming their attention at a couple issues this year – one being privacy and the other scalability. As privacy technology is reaching new milestones, with other ZK systems such as Bulletproofs attracting widespread enthusiasm, the focus is on making these systems lighter so as not to weigh down blockchains looking to scale.

The report adds that the fund – which could be launched this month – is being claimed as the first of its kind in Japan.

The corporate analyst company – which launched a bitcoin exchange in August 2016 and has invested in other exchanges such as TechBureau – issued a three-year test bond in August last year, worth 200 bitcoins at the time.

42380237,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MXuz,1515672900,Bitcoin Price Stays Heavy Amid Korean Regulatory Reports,"Despite the two-way action on the price of bitcoin over the last 24 hours, the bears still appear to have the upper hand.  CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) fell to $13,455 yesterday before rising back above $14,900. At that point, it appeared bitcoin (BTC) had found a bottom, but the ascent was cut short at $14,942 and prices fell further to $12,845 at 04:29 UTC – very likely on fears South Korea may soon announce an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading at exchanges.  With South Korea one of the biggest markets for cryptocurrencies, such a ban by the nation would definitely weaken the demand side pressure. As a result, markets reacted negatively to the news.  However, the initial knee-jerk drop in prices came to a halt seemingly due to later reports clarifying that South Korea may not be able to implement the new legislation anytime soon.  Reuters  stated: ""Legislation for an outright ban of virtual coin trading will require a majority vote of the total 297 members of the National Assembly, a process that could take months or even years.""  At time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $13,7290 – down 4.08 percent from the intraday high of $13,845 (08:59 UTC). As per data source OnChainFX, bitcoin has depreciated by 4.4 percent in the last 24 hours.  The technical charts also favor further downside to prices.  Bitcoin Chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  Yesterday's bullish hammer-like candle meant the sell-off from $17,174 (Jan. 6 high) has ended at $13,550 (yesterday's low). Also, prices closed (as per UTC) yesterday above the rising trendline (inside the rising wedge).  However, the bulls failed to capitalize on yesterday's positive price action, and the minor rally stalled at $14,970 before falling to an 11-day low of $12,800 today.  The price action only adds credence to the bearish continuation pattern and a bearish 5-day and 10-day moving average crossover.  The relative strength index (RSI) has entered bearish territory (below 50.00).  View  BTC is more likely to cut through the support at $12,500 (Dec. 30 low) and may extend losses as low as $10,400–$10,000 over the 72 hours.  Today's high/low ($14,970 and $12,800) engulfs the previous day's price action. So, today's candle looks like a bearish outside day, indicating the continuation of the sell-off.  Bullish scenario: A close (as per UTC) today above $14,970 could save the day for bitcoin bulls. That said, only a move above $17,174 (Jan. 6 high) would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

42380230,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MXrD,1515661228,Crypto Cat and Mouse: 2018 Will Be the Year of Policy Subterfuge,"Pavel Matveev is the CEO of Wirex, a bitcoin wallet and payment card provider.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      The new year will usher in regulatory arbitrage amongst companies that want to develop innovative solutions, as well as from states seeking to maximize tax receipts from cryptocurrency-related businesses.  While this may sound like a bold statement given what we saw in 2017, I believe the controversy brought by state approaches to cryptocurrency regulation this year far will exceed that of last year. In the regulatory world of financial services, the divergence of attitudes between state regulators is striking, ranging from the official recognition of bitcoin as a payment form in Japan to a shadow ban in China.  At the same time, a number of countries have decided to keep their powder dry whilst they explore how the industry unfolds prior to spelling out their thinking on the technologies.  Looking ahead, I believe it's worth keeping in mind the diversity of approaches.  UK: Positioning for maximum market share  The UK has decided to play a clever game so far.  It appears to want to keep its reputation as an easy place to do business in tact whilst it seeks to understand the best way to move forward. This may be in part due to the spectre of a full blown banking meltdown if banks fall too far behind in the constructive destruction that accompanies the natural order of innovation.  Traditional banks have seen the writing on the wall, too. Take, for example, the ill-informed vitriol emanating from the likes of JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon who calls bitcoin a scam whilst also being a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and forming a partnership with Zcash.  Not all bankers are cut from the same cloth, however. There is no better marketeer for the campaign to bring change within the banking sector than former Barclays CEO, Anthony Jenkins. He revealed his view during a CNBC interview that banks stand to experience their very own ""Kodak moment"" should they refuse to keep up with the progress that fintech represents.  To what extent bankers listen to Jenkins’ warning that “...we can imagine total transformation of the banking system, using blockchain for example, in a world where banks don't really exist anymore,"" remains to be seen. Jenkins was seen a classy operator in the UK banking sector and his views will have informed the UK government's positioning on the matter.  In the UK, an official announcement was made by the regulator to ""warn investors of risks"" associated with bitcoin, whilst simultaneously veering sharply away from any rules to inhibit commerce. Such an approach suggests savvy thinking from a government that understands the need for high-growth companies to take up the slack in a post-Brexit environment.  According to recent data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the UK financial sector represents around 7 percent of GDP but accounts for 10 percent of tax revenues and 14 percent of exports. Any draconian crack down on cryptocurrencies could be taken as a red flag by global investors responsible for the UK’s soaring FDI, which grew to $253.7 billion (197 billion pounds) in 2016, up from £33 billion the previous year, according to OECD data.  China: Hiding away from financial freedoms  China, on the other hand, has gone for the ""head in sand"" option, placing a covert ban on exchanges and massively shooting itself in the foot. China's citizens make up some of the most technologically able people in the world. Everyday Chinese people demonstrate on a daily basis how globalization and peoples’ need to control over their own financial futures act as a cosmopolitan impulse shared by the whole of humanity.  Whilst the country’s political class comes to terms with unstoppable changes, its citizens find ingenious ways to circumvent prohibitions and the state loses its chance to share in the spoils of progress.  China can bury its head in the sand for now but the tremendous losses it is stacking up in terms of opportunity costs will come home to roost in a relatively short period of time.  There is a good deal of complexity in how most other states communicate their intentions towards cryptocurrencies.  And, this reinforces a zero-sum game model as far as the cryptocurrency focussed businesses are concerned. Just as traditional banks move headquarters to jurisdictions with favorable regulatory regimes, so too will cryptocurrency related companies move to light touch or ‘wait and see’ countries.  Germany: A precise approach to cryptocurrencies  Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, for example, views cryptocurrencies as financial instruments. However, their use as cash or deposits does not require authorisation from the regulator.  Importantly, it has ruled that service providers may take payments in cryptocurrencies without being seen as carrying out banking or financial services. Where transactions “are similar enough” to broking services, then regulations may apply.  One example of this is when a mining pool, for example, makes a distribution of proceeds or provides services that the German regulator believes constitute a market. Authorisation may be applied in such cases.  Singapore: A case-by-case study  In Singapore, the FCA, like the UK’s FCA, sent a warning note out to consumers about what is saw as potential risks relating to both ICOs and cryptocurrencies. The regulator said that some but not all ICOs will fall outside its scope for regulation, meaning it wants to look at individual cases and think how it should respond.  This isn’t a terrible strategy for cryptocurrency companies because it means there is room for creative thinking about how to navigate specific countries’ needs.  The Singaporean FCA points to factors that might mean regulations would apply. Such cases may include those where there is a good deal of similarity between the ICO and an IPO, or if the ICO looked very much like a shares placement as conducted by private companies. And, if the ICO appears to be similar to one of its regulated activities, then it’s rules would come into effect.  Policy divergences bring opportunity  Yet, all the approaches aside, blockchain technologies will most certainly continue to prosper in an environment where there is no one coordinated global policy to undermine its progress. Indeed, tremendous opportunities lie ahead for entrepreneurs willing to arbitrage out of countries which restrict development to more favorable regulatory environments.  And, politicians will be keenly aware that an overzealous regime will undermine their efforts to encourage investment while doing little to provide citizens with a competitive market.  Divergence on regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies may appear to some as simply a matter of differing stages of policy development by national regulators. Such a view entirely misses the enormous efforts currently being undertaken by most Western European states at least to vigorously market their high growth industries around the world.  At the beginning of 2017, Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen appointed an Ambassador to the global technology industry as part of the nation’s “techplomacy” initiative. In the UK, the Department of International Trade’s Venture Capital Unit helped UK companies raise over £750 million in international venture capital over the last three years and is highly visible at global FInTech events around the world.  Indeed, in December of 2017, the FCA issued feedback on its discussion paper on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which it introduced earlier in the year. Cleverly, the paper was positioned as ""not being about bitcoin"" but rather about DLT’s in the general sense.  Any advances made in the field of DLT policy development cannot simply dismiss cryptocurrencies as something external to the debate. The political ‘optics’ at this stage, however, demands such a separation.  2018 will deepen the divide between countries’ different approaches as they simultaneously manoeuvre to capitalise in the long term on these high growth companies.  Reticence by certain countries to make the most of cryptocurrencies so far may yet bring the sound of screeching hand-brakes as policy U-turns ring out of government departments.

42380225,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MXiP,1515654014,"Florida Bill Would Legally Recognize Blockchain Signatures, Smart Contracts","A lawmaker in Florida has introduced a bill that, if passed, would create a legal foundation for blockchain data and smart contracts in the U.S. state.  House Bill 1357  introduces multiple stipulations that blockchain ledgers and smart contracts be treated as legally-binding methods of data storage – provided that such measures do not break any pre-existing laws or regulations.  Notably, the bill states that a ""record or contract that is secured through blockchain technology is in an electronic form and is an electronic record,"" and confirms that a signature recorded through a blockchain also qualifies as a valid electronic signature.  As a result of these qualifications, the bill outlines that, if a person uses a blockchain to secure interstate or foreign commercial ventures, it would not impact ownership rights. In other words, if someone used a blockchain ledger to store information, the bill would legally recognize that person's rights to that information.  Similarly, the bill states:  ""A contract may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because: 1. An electronic record was used in the formation of the contract [and] 2. The contract contains a smart contract term.""  If signed into law, the bill would make Florida the latest state to recognize blockchain records and smart contracts. Last year, Arizona passed a similar measure, with identical notes on confirming blockchain records as electronic records, as well as giving smart contracts legal force.  A slightly different bill  in Vermont, when passed in 2016, allowed for the use of blockchain-based data as evidence in court.

42400836,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcL8Wq,1515646856,Atomic Action: Will 2018 Be the Year of the Cross-Blockchain Swap?,"What if there were no exchanges to hack?  As a new generation of crypto users begin to invest in the technology, developers are growing concerned about its infrastructure. They've seen this happen before – new users enter the space attracted by big gains, then suddenly, a catastrophic failure, usually at the very exchanges designed to hold and custody those funds.  But out of adversity, inspiration is taking hold, with high-profile coders turning their focus to atomic swaps, a concept that claims to allow for the direct, peer-to-peer transfer of cryptocurrencies across different blockchains. In the place of the vulnerable exchanges we use today, the idea behind atomic swaps is that these large repositories of customer money could be rendered obsolete by code.  And seasoned blockchain developers like Alex Bosworth believe this is all too necessary, especially given that users today need to effectively give up custody of their assets if they choose to hold funds on exchanges.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Putting users in control of their own private keys has the best aggregate track record for security despite individual cases of loss. Funds under centralized control on exchanges have led to the most massive security failures we've seen.""  Andrew Gazdecki, CEO and co-founder of Altcoin.io, which recently launched a beta wallet for atomic swapping between crypto tokens, describes the problem in similar terms, arguing that users should be empowered to hold their own private keys (the alphanumeric strings that allow users to unlock, access and spend their funds) without relying on others.  ""There are literally billions of dollars being held within these digital honeypots, and it's nearly impossible to find the perpetrators,"" he said.  Early examples of atomic swaps technology emerged in various stages in 2017, and while there's disagreement as to the timeline they'll be available to the public, some believe 2018 will be their year.  As Jameson Lopp, a BitGo software engineer, recently tweeted:  ""Nearly instant atomic swaps ... are coming sooner than everyone thinks. Definitely not a year away, but mere months.""  Atomic swaps already?  In some ways, atomic swaps are already here – depending on the kind of atomic swap you're looking to make.  For instance, last year saw swaps between different blockchains built on similar code – the cryptocurrencies decred, litecoin and bitcoin – executed. Meanwhile, atomic swaps between cryptocurrency tokens on the same blockchain became more commonplace, with decentralized exchanges such as 0x and, as mentioned above, Altcoin.io, adding instant trades between tokens on ethereum compatible protocols.  Cryptocurrencies running on blockchains with much different codebases, though, must rely on purpose-built tools to facilitate these kinds of transfers today.  Toward this goal, a tool for exchanging zcash for bitcoin called ZBXCAT was developed last year. Described by co-developer Jay Graber as the ""walkie-talkie of payments,"" the tool will soon be accompanied by a simplified web interface.  Indeed, atomic swaps ""could always be done manually,"" Graber said. However, because this requires a degree of technical skill, before atomic swaps see mainstream use, easier to use platforms will need to be developed.  At the same time, Lightning Labs, a company devoted to promoting bitcoin's Lightning Network, recently conducted its first off-chain atomic swap on its test blockchain. Completed in November, the transaction saw litecoin and bitcoin swapped on an off-chain payment channel.  Off-chain hurdles  Off-chain atomic swaps of this type are highly anticipated since trading would be automatic, not reliant on the processing times of different blockchains, but the technology needed to implement off-chain atomic swaps – things like the Lightning Network and Raiden Network on ethereum – are still under development.  Which is why some, like Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, are less optimistic about cross-blockchain atomic swaps.  Stark recently discounted the hype, writing on a development channel, ""Anyone telling people that Lightning swaps will be ready in months doesn't know what they're talking about.""  And in interview with CoinDesk, Stark said:  ""There's still a good amount of infrastructure to build.""  One website, swapready.net, provides a breakdown of how close each cryptocurrency is to supporting cross-chain atomic swap capabilities – and to date, there's very few that can interoperate.  Mirroring Stark's sentiments, Philippe Castonguay, developer relations manager at 0x, which offers on-chain atomic swaps of tokens on ethereum, told CoinDesk that developers looking to create atomic swaps between vastly different protocols are faced with ""a lot of challenges.""  The infrastructure needed to interface between bitcoin and ethereum, for example, is still in development, and ""to make it even worse, these cross-chain platforms also need to solve some of the main problems other blockchains are trying to solve, such as scalability,"" Castonguay said.  Still optimistic  Yet, even with a lot a work still to do, many remain assured advances are close.  Bosworth, whose work has focused mostly on developing applications for bitcoin's Lightning Network, for one, made his excitement about a new era public, tweeting: ""The atomic age is coming, what cannot be swapped will be left behind.""  And Castonguay, whose work focuses on ethereum, also remains encouraged by the development happening within that ecosystem. Even if swaps between blockchains with different code bases prove cumbersome, he believes the blockchain could yield other solutions given the expansive capabilities of its code.  ""Eventually the ethereum blockchain will be able to communicate with other blockchains,"" he said. ""Once this happens, all the different coins from different blockchains will be representable on the ethereum blockchain.""  For example, if bitcoin and ethereum blockchains can communicate with each other in a trustless way, then users could have an ERC-20 bitcoin on the ethereum blockchain, pegged one to one with bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain, he posited.  Such short-term solutions, he thinks, could help advance the atomic swaps concept overhaul.  Castonguay concluded:  ""I do believe it is possible that some blockchains might be able to interact with one another this year, but I think 2019 through 2021 would be a safer bet.""

""Local police also have been investigating our company since last year, they think what we do is gambling,"" a Coinone employee told Reuters. The employee said that the exchange was cooperating with the investigation.  In an email to CoinDesk, a representative of Bithumb confirmed that they had met with Korean tax authorities.  ""It is true that the National Tax Service visited Bithumb. However, we weren't raided by the police,"" the rep said.  Separately, South Korean news service SBS has reported that the South Korean Justice Department is planning legislation that would pave the way for exchanges in the country to be shut down entirely.  ""The Ministry of Justice will set up its own bill, which sees the virtual money brokerage itself as illegal and completely closes the exchange, and plans to start full-fledged ministry discussions this week,"" the service reported, according to a translation.  According to a subsequent report from Reuters, the Justice Ministry said that a bill was forthcoming.  ""There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges,"" Park Sang-ki was quoted as saying.  The news represents a significant expansion in the growing scrutiny applied to the crypto-exchange space by South Korean regulators. Earlier this week, the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit and the Financial Supervisory Service announced that they were inspecting six unnamed banks for compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations.  The government had already declared in December that it would move to apply more scrutiny amid growing trade volume at the exchanges, including moves to curb anonymous trading.
