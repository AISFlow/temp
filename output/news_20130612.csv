42376550,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsST,1371059974,Soon-to-wed couple to live on bitcoins for 90 days,"Austin Craig and his soon-to-be wife Beccy Bingham have decided to live off of bitcoins for a full 90 days – that means not touching cash or credit for any form of payment whatsoever.  The couple, based out of Provo, Utah, posted a Kickstarter campaign about their mission on June 10. At the time of this writing, they've earned almost $4,500 in pledges toward their goal of $70,000, which must be reached by July 11 for the campaign to be considered a success. Austin and Beccy are also accepting bitcoin donations on their website – lifeonbitcoin.comhttp://lifeonbitcoin.com/ – which has so far raised over 51 BTC (approximately $5,691 at current value).  “Yesterday was a media firestorm,” said Austin over Skype. “It's been really crazy.”  All of the proceeds that Austin and Beccy raise from Kickstarter and their BTC donations will go toward funding a full-length documentary film about their project. That includes the costs of hiring a full-time camera crew to follow them around, pre- and post-production costs, marketing and distribution.  Austin says the idea of living off of bitcoins came from a friend of his.  “He got super into Bitcoin and was just consuming everything he could find out about it,"" he says. ""The question arose, 'What if you try do do all of your transactions on it?' ”  Austin says he was a better candidate for the experiment than his friend because, unlike his friend, Austin doesn't have a wife, kids, mortgage and small business to take care of. Basically, Austin doesn't have a whole lot to lose.  Although he is getting married soon, and the experiment will begin immediately after he and Beccy return from their honeymoon, Austin says his fiance didn't need much convincing.  “Even though she's not terribly familiar with with Bitcoin, she just said, 'Let's do it,' ” he recalls.  Beccy's boss didn't need much convincing either. She's a design/marketing professional at a local technology center, and ran the idea by her employers.  “They loved the idea and said they would do everything they could to even pay her salary in bitcoin,” Austin says.  The couple has decided to start the experiment off cold, without taking any advance contingency measures. Whatever they currently have in their cupboards, whatever gas is left in the car's tank ... that is what they will start with.  That could make life interesting from the start, especially considering that the only place in Austin's town that currently accepts bitcoins is a sandwich shop.  “If we don't want to get sick of sandwiches after the first week, we're going to have to talk to a lot of different merchants and tell them about Bitcoin – persuade them that they can do this, here are the benefits, and that we can make this painless,” Austin says.  He's even ready to offer businesses a premium -- 150 percent of the normal price -- if that's what it takes to get them on board with accepting BTC as payment. The hope is that, by the end of the experiment, bitcoins will have become a mainstream and accepted currency in Provo ... providing a bit of a boost to the currency as a whole.  The couple says that, if they receive enough donations, they'll take the documentary on the road to see if they can travel to a few other locations using only bitcoins.

42376515,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqUR,1371050348,Yumcoin offers bitcoin venue to content creators,"A new bitcoin-dedicated site called Yumcoin is offering content creators the chance to sell their wares in exchange for the digital currency.  The service, launched last week, allows creators to sell their digital goods online, in exchange for bitcoins. Software, music, videos, ebooks and plugins are listed among the products that can be sold on the site.  Users sign up for free accounts, and the service allows them to upload digital products to sell at a maximum price of 10 bitcoins. The files are stored on an Amazon’s cloud service. Sellers can then enter a product description, and choose an image to describe the product. Yumcoin gives them a product URL, which they can then share on Facebook or Twitter. Opening the URL gives the user 20 minutes to scan the QR code containing the payment bitcoin address and buy the product.  The site takes 1 percent of the sale price, plus .0025 bitcoins (around 25 cents at the current value) as a commission on every sale. Users provide just an email address and password when registering for the site, and they are able to nominate a bitcoin wallet whenever they want to withdraw their balance from Yumcoin. The site publishes a policy listing content not permitted for upload, including the usual suspects: obscene material, counterfeit items or digital content that you do not own, along with personal information.  Yumcoin's site is sparse -- with no ""featured product"" directory -- presumably because of its recent launch. At present, it appears to be offering a minimum viable product, Eric Ries-style, although more seems to be in the works.  “There's lots of new features we're working on (ie. catalogs, storefronts, and analytics),” the company stated in an email to CoinDesk.  For now, however, the main innovation seems to be the production of dynamic bitcoin addresses tailored for each product, which are shareable and scannable.  Book publishing service Cointagion offers a variation on dynamically generated bitcoin address QR codes for digital product sales. That service uses information about a user’s browsing session to dynamically generate its QR codes. Scanning and paying enables the customer to download the digital product on offer. There’s a white paper on that herehttp://www.cointagion.com/CointagionWhitepaper.pdf.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/12/yumcoin-offers-bitcoin-venue-to-content-creators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c72911e751e7e6458f7371e966b6dc9d7f7f0af-632x386.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376519,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqZT,1371036561,Bridgewalker: the fast Bitcoin wallet for Android,"Bridgewalker  is an app that can “bridge” between dollars and Bitcoins. It is a Bitcoin wallet for Android. Jan Vornberger, who previously worked on Instawallet, developed Bridgewalker to make the Bitcoin payment process a fast mobile experience.  Editor's note: At the time of writing, while you can install Bridgewalker on your Android device for free, it is only at a beta state and it is not possible to create an account. The beta version is restricted to a ""guest mode"", which assigns you a bitcoin wallet (accompanied by QR code) and allows you to scan QR codes to send payments.  ""Everything is push-based"", says Vornberger. ""Meaning that as soon as a transaction hits the server, it is processed and status updates are pushed to the client. You can best see the result of that with transactions between Bridgewalker users, which appear on the other user's device within fractions of a second.""  Closed source and server-based, the app is exchange-rate adjusted, meaning that at any given time, your bitcoins will adjust to the amount of US dollars available. This can be useful since most things that people pay for are denominated in fiat currencies. Bitcoin is simply the underlying system for moving money around quickly and cheaply. The idea of ""transact in BTC, hold in USD"" may in fact be the way for all of us to enjoy faster, lower-cost transactions.  Bridgewalker does have fees of its own because the app has to keep holdings of Bitcoin in order to match deposits. The amount is 0.75 % on each deposit and withdrawal. “I need to open BTC short positions on an exchange equivalent to the amounts being deposited”, says Vornberger. “I currently use Mt. Gox, where my trading fees are 0.6 %. Add in market spread, and I end up at around 1.5 % for a round trip.”  The goal is to lower the fees to something that is ultimately cheaper than using credit cards. “All this talk about paying with Bitcoins being the cheaper alternative is really a little bit disingenuous at this point, in my opinion. Of course, the actual Bitcoin transaction itself is very cheap”, says Vornberger.  Bridgewalker’s long-term plan is to have as low a fee structure as possible, on par with the competition from the financial industry’s standards. Vornberger says he wants to be “competitive with credit cards”; offering people an alternative that could cost people less in the long run.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/12/bridgewalker-the-fast-bitcoin-wallet-for-android,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f74eb0887be969daf4c82e4ec1a55b06c5cff741-1000x558.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376510,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqQf,1371027494,Bitcoiners Down Under: Crypto-currency in Australia,"To prepare for a bitcoin meetup in Sydney, Jason Williams has been scrounging to find a bar that will accept the cryptocurrency. No such luck, though. Nonetheless, he's looking forward to connecting face to face with his fellow Aussie Bitcoin enthusiasts over beers on June 19. Ahead of the event, the gathering has even caught the eyes of investors who are keen on funding the next big Bitcoin startup.  China  has been stealing the limelight on the international Bitcoin scene for its recent spike in downloads of the original Satoshi client. However, Bitcoin has had a small but consistent stronghold in Australia for a few years now. The Land Down Under ranked number eight globally in downloads in May, the same rank as last year at that time.  As an early adopter, Max Kaye had viewed Bitcoin as an ""unstoppable technology"" akin to BitTorrent and Tor. The Sydney resident first transacted in bitcoins in December 2010, convinced of the cryptocurrency's security after reading about it in Slashdot.  ""Immediately it occurred to me that it was something to get involved with and learn about, because if it took off it would be so very significant,"" he said. And take off it did. Since Kaye first discovered Bitcoin, the currency's value had grown by leaps and bounds, ballooning from 21 cents (US) to more than $100 today.  Williams jumped aboard the Bitcoin train this year, after reading about Silk Road and doing more research.  ""It was amazing to me that such a marketplace could thrive dealing with illicit goods,"" said Williams, who managed the anti-money laundering systems as a developer for The Westpac Group, Australia's first bank. ""Bitcoin was a risk ... People took those risks, and a marketplace flourished. After reading the press, seeing a thriving marketplace and understanding the technology, it was the tipping point for me.""  While the Australian Bitcoin community is best described as emerging, people like Kaye and Williams have been turning to reddit to organize.  ""There are lots of passionate people here, but we seem to lack the je ne sais quoi that you find in the valley,"" Williams said, referring to Silicon Valley. ""It's exciting times to be at the front of something that will change the world. I want the community to get organized and be at the forefront of development and adoption.""  After attending the Bitcoin2013 conference in San Jose last month, Kaye began thinking about starting an Australian chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation ... ""which would really help to provide the foundations, no pun intended, for a strong Aussie bitcoin community.""  Slowly but surely, retailers in Australia are also getting on board. Digideals, Australia's first e-commerce site to accept the virtual currency, conveyed its confidence by calling bitcoin ""the currency of the future.""  CuffLinked  , a Melbourne company that makes cufflinks, began accepting bitcoins in May.  ""We're fascinated by bitcoins, and at the same time opening us up to a new market we wouldn't have otherwise had seemed like a no-brainer,"" said owner Niki Glavich.  ""I think when it comes to buying and selling bitcoins, Australia is a little behind the curve,"" Glavich added, attributing this to the steep fees charged for buying and selling bitcoins in the country.  Though the community is developing, there is a bit of gray area surrounding bitcoin in accordance with the country's Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act. Passed in 2006, the act defines e-currency as an internet-based, electronic means of exchange that is backed either directly or indirectly by precious metal, bullion or ""a thing of a kind prescribed by the AML/CTF Rules.""  According to that, bitcoin, which isn't backed by anything, isn't classified as an e-currency.  Mat Holroyd, founder of BitPiggy, an Australian bitcoin exchange registered in Hong Kong, doesn't see this as a major issue. He writes in his personal blog, ""The irony is this property of bitcoin means it is not classed as an e-currency by Australian law, and thus this argued weakness of bitcoin leads to bitcoin not being burdened by AML/CTF reporting requirements -- which is great for the Australian bitcoin community.""  Kaye, likewise, doesn't think the law will have an impact on bitcoin's growth in the region. ""Most Bitcoiners don't really care for modern monetary policy,"" he said. However, it does have him thinking about developing a cryptocoin pegged to the Australian dollar.  ""It's curious that bitcoin is not counted as e-currency, yet by changing some variables and setting up a legal institution, the same product (the blockchain) now facilitates transactions of money,"" Kaye said. ""I think this really shows how backwards monetary policy is.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Alice Truong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/12/bitcoiners-down-under-crypto-currency-in-australia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11aaca002bfbeceaf488a622879bc6ac6717e922-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376513,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqTB,1371021890,"Xbox axes virtual currency 'Points' in favor of credit, gift cards","Microsoft will reportedly be moving away from its virtual ""Points""currency for Xbox, in favor of local currency and gift cards.  According to reports by The Verge and Engadget, Microsoft will be spiking Points, which has been used in the Xbox Live and Zune marketplaces. The currency had received backlash from users who were forced to buy Points in increments, which often resulted in leftover Points after purchasing games. Back in October, Microsoft began phasing out its Points payment system in its newest operating system, and users were given the option to pay for digital content with Points or credit cards.  There are still conflicting details about what will replace Points on Xbox Live. Endgadget has an image of promotional material that shows a circular icon with the British pound symbol inside. Beneath it are the words: To Your Local Currency.  The Verge, however, quotes sources familiar with the Xbox's plans who say Points will be replaced with a gift card system similar to Apple's iTunes vouchers. Credit card transactions will also be supported. While Microsoft currently offers gift cards, they can only be used in its retail stores. The new gift card system is said to also work in the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store.
