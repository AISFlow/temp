42429968,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2m9h,1543528643,"SEC Fines Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled for ICO Promotions","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has settled charges with professional boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and music producer Khaled Khaled – better known as DJ Khaled – for not disclosing that they were paid to promote initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Announced Thursday, the regulator said that Mayweather received $100,000 from Centra Tech, as well as another $200,000 from Stox and Hubii Network.  Khaled was paid $50,000 to promote Centra Tech, according to the agency.  The co-founders of Centra Tech were indicted by a grand jury earlier this year on charges of fraud and conspiracy.  In a statement Thursday, SEC Enforcement Division co-director Stephanie Avakian said that ""with no disclosure about the payments, Mayweather and Khaled's ICO promotions may have appeared to be unbiased, rather than paid endorsements.""  Neither celebrity admitted to or denied the charges in their settlements. Mayweather will pay $300,000 in disgorgement, $300,000 in penalties and $14,775 in prejudgment interest. Khaled will pay $50,000 in disgorgement, $100,000 in penalties and $2,725 in prejudgment interest.  Further, the two are banned from promoting ""any securities, digital or otherwise,"" for the next few years; Mayweather has agreed to a three-year ban, while Khaled's ban will last for a period of two years.  The SEC added that Mayweather will continue to cooperate with its investigation, which is ongoing.

42429977,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mPh,1543523432,US Judge Denies SEC Push for Injunction Against Crypto Startup,"A federal judge has denied a preliminary injunction filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which sought to freeze assets belonging to crypto startup Blockvest based on alleged violations of securities laws.  In a ruling dated Nov. 27, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel ruled that the SEC has not proven that Blockvest – or its founder Reginald Buddy Ringgold – violated federal securities laws, and therefore denied the asset freeze request, among other actions (a temporary restraining order already froze the company's assets briefly).  Stephen Palley, an attorney with Anderson Kill, told CoinDesk that, unless there is another order or agreement which may not yet be public, the denial means Blockvest and Ringgold's assets should no longer be frozen.  The SEC first brought charges against Blockvest and Ringgold in mid-October, when it accused the two of falsely claiming that the regulator had approved of its token sale, among other issues.  In its case, the SEC alleged that 32 individuals who interacted with BLV tokens in a pre-sale were effectively sold securities, which Blockvest denies. Instead, the company claims, these 32 individuals helped Blockvest test aspects of its platform.  These 32 testers did transfer bitcoin and ethereum onto the Blockvest exchange, but no tokens were released to them, according to the ruling.  The judge did not make a ruling on whether the BLV tokens were securities, writing that there was insufficient evidence one way or another.  He wrote:  ""At this stage, without full discovery and disputed issues of material facts, the Court cannot make a determination whether the BLV token offered to the 32 test investors was a 'security.' Thus, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the BLV tokens purchased by the 32 test investors were 'securities' as defined under the securities laws.""  Deeper questions  Palley explained that ""there are questions of fact,"" based on the judge's ruling.  ""I think what the key takeaway ... is, one, just because something looks dodgy doesn't mean that it's securities fraud or that a securities case can be made, [and] number two, the case isn't over yet, the judge said 'look there's a fact dispute, we have to go to trial,'"" he said.  Further, the judge noted that Blockvest and Ringgold suspended the company's upcoming token sale after retaining counsel, and that ""Plaintiff has not presented any misrepresentations by Defendants since they have retained counsel,"" though ""there is evidence"" to support the claim that Ringgold did make some ""misrepresentations ... prior to having retained counsel.""  ""Therefore, Plaintiff has not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood that the wrong will be repeated,"" he later wrote.  The SEC has ""kind of won in that sense,"" Palley noted, as the company did not raise any funds using tokens.  When reached for comment, Ringgold said ""we are happy to be out from under the temporary restraining order,"" and said the platform is ""dedicated to complying with all laws and regulations that might govern"" the industry.  Ringgold added:  ""The litigation was fueled by a number of our own mistakes. We admitted those mistakes in our papers filed with Judge Curiel. Having said that, none of the misstatements were made with the intention that anyone rely on the alleged statements for investment. We did not raise capital based on the mistaken representations alleged. We did not sell securities to anyone who relied on such mistaken statements. There was never any intent to defraud investors.""

42429984,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mdh,1543518010,Sirin Labs' $999 Blockchain Phone Will Start Shipping in December,"Finney, the blockchain phone announced at the apex of the 2018 token craze, is expected to start shipping in late December.  Unveiling its final design for the first time at an event today in Barcelona, Sirin Labs, the phone's maker, promises to advance the user experience of decentralized apps (or dapps) with its new hardware.  The company claims to have raised over $157 million with an initial coin offering (ICO) announced early this year to fund the device's development. Still, with so few dapps yet launched it remains to be seen if there's an appetite for an improved user experience of the decentralized web.  Sirin wouldn't commit to a precise date, but Nimrod May, the company's chief marketing officer, said the firm projects that shipping will start sometime between Dec. 15 and 25. Sirin has partnered with one of the top electronics manufacturers in the world, Foxconn, to produce the devices.  The $999 phone can be pre-ordered now for holders of the sirin (SRN) token. More payment channels will go live soon, and May explained the company will always exchange whatever form of payment buyers use to sirin as it closes each sale.  There's no relationship between SRN and the price of the phone, so those who purchased them in the token sale are at the mercy of the spot price. The token has bounced between $0.06 and $0.18 over the last three months, though trending up and occasionally spiking since last October, according to data site CoinCap.  More players have entered the market since the Finney was first proposed. In particular, long-time handset maker HTC has promised a device designed with crypto in mind. Upstart Pundi X has also entered the fray.  Sirin's May declined to give CoinDesk a pre-order figure, but he did give a projection for sales: ""I'm pretty confident that we'll pass the 100,000 in the first year.""  Security chops  As a phone designed to carry around cryptocurrency, Finney makes strong claims about its security.  May emphasized the team's depth of experience in cybersecurity and its application of artificial intelligence to intrusion detection. The phone is also built with a modification of the Android mobile operating system, called SirinOS, which is designed with blockchain functionality in mind.  That said, the security feature that will undoubtedly get the most attention will be its cold storage wallet. As May described it to CoinDesk, this wallet is effectively a second device in the same housing as the phone.  He said it has a separate processor and users will interact with the wallet on a second LCD screen. Seed phrases will only be inserted through that screen. This can be seen in a design video released by the company.  In order to get people to use new apps in the company's ""dCenter"" or decentralized app store, Sirin will make it easy for app makers to send Finney users free tokens.  ""We incentivize the user by incentivizing with airdrops,"" May said.  User experience  Sirin Labs has said from the start that Finney aims to make crypto easier to use.  For example, if users want to use different apps, they shouldn't have to think about paying in the right form of crypto. Finney has been built to convert between different tokens as needed. At launch, it will only convert BTC, ETH and SRN.  When CoinDesk first reported on Finney, the firm's plan had been to use the Bancor network to run its swapping. May says swapping will now run on Sirin's own software.  One of the tokens running in the dapp store will be the sirin token. ""The sirin token is designed as a utility token from the beginning,"" May said.  Its only utility, for now, is phone pre-orders. Later, it is meant to run Finney-specific features, such as allowing phone users to sell each other bandwidth on the go. A forthcoming software development kit will allow engineers to brainstorm and advance their own peer-to-peer use cases.  Much as with Bancor, the original plan had been to power these services with the Iota protocol, as previously reported, but Sirin Labs no longer plans to do so. SRN runs on the ethereum blockchain, for now.

The platform announced Thursday that customers can transfer zcash into its professional trading platform, though as with previous additions, users can not yet purchase the token until the exchange has established enough liquidity. Deposits will be accepted for at least 12 hours after the announcement at 18:00 UTC.  When trading is enabled, only Coinbase Pro users in most of the U.S., UK, European Union, Canada, Singapore and Australia will be able to access the coin. New York residents and other jurisdictions may receive access at a later date.  The exchange did not announce when coinbase.com or mobile app users would be able to begin trading the cryptocurrency.  Due to the nature of the privacy coin, full support is not yet being added. As the post explains, zcash offers both transparent and shielded transaction types, which show different amounts of information about a transaction. In particular, shielded addresses are anonymized, while transparent transactions are traceable, like bitcoin.  The post goes on to say:  ""Initially, we will support deposits from both transparent and shielded addresses, but only support withdrawals to transparent addresses. In the future, we’ll explore support for withdrawals to shielded addresses in locations where it complies with local laws.""  Market response  Upon official word of the listing from Coinbase Pro, the price of zcash began a significant uptick at 18:00 UTC. Just five minutes later the cryptocurrency had jumped 15 percent to reach a 9-day high of $99.13, according to data from the Binance exchange.  At the time of writing, ZEC has cooled off and is now trading at $93. The coin has accumulated $155 million in 24-hour trading volume across exchanges, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42429978,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mVh,1543512938,Iranian Bitcoin Users Are Already Being Affected By New US Sanctions,"On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that two bitcoin addresses tied to Iran residents Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan were being added to its Specially Designated Nationals sanctions list, a first for the office.  Hours later, Telegram channels across Iran began to light up with chatter about privacy and the security of bitcoin wallets.  Iranian sources have told CoinDesk that some of them are no longer able to access the cryptocurrency swap platform ShapeShift, even when using virtual private networks (VPNs). As such, the sanctions appear to be already impacting Iranians who want to make lawful use of cryptocurrencies.  That’s why cryptocurrency miner Javad Sedighi in Isfahan, Iran, described the news to CoinDesk as “alarming,” because the stigma harms bitcoin users in the country.  Sedighi has been using bitcoin for two years, mining and sending remittances to family abroad. Like many Iranians who rely on cryptocurrency to support their families, the political news made him worried about the security and privacy features in some bitcoin wallets.  Some of the favored wallets among Iranians are Electrom, Atomic, Exodus, Samourai Wallet and Wasabi Wallet, especially its CoinJoin feature that sends many transactions in batches all at once to make it harder to track specific wallets. According to several Iranian developers, interest in the privacy coin zcash is also far more common these days.  An anonymous developer in Tehran, who has traded ethereum for bitcoin on global exchanges then sent the bitcoin to his own wallet, concurred that security and privacy are the two primary attributes he looks for in a wallet.  “Cutting a whole country off from global business is cruel,” the developer said, also affirming that laws should curtail criminal activity. However, most mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase will reject transactions connected to forbidden coins even several steps removed. As such, the criminal actions of a few may have ripple effects across Iran’s burgeoning community of retail buyers and users.  One anonymous source in Tehran with personal knowledge of the sanctioned wallet-holders told CoinDesk they might have sold some of their ransomware-tied bitcoin to unsuspecting street traders, which are increasingly popular in Iran given their limited access to international exchanges.  That’s why cryptocurrency trader and developer Sin Saad in Tehran is now pondering how the sanctions might impact his livelihood. He told CoinDesk:  “How can I know these bitcoin are sanctioned? By constantly checking the Treasury, Federal Reserve, or OFAC website?”  For less tech-savvy bitcoin users who might struggle with tracking blockchain data for specific coins, these listings present a significant risk. Meanwhile, Telegram wasn’t the only platform buzzing with talk of sanctions on Wednesday.  Attorney Steve Middlebrook tweeted that anyone who received bitcoin from those sanctioned addresses should “hold the coins and notify the feds.” Stephen Palley, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill, tweeted his support for this legal perspective.  On the other hand, Attorney Nelson Rosario, who specializes in blockchain technology at Marshall, Gerstein & Borun LLP, tweeted an open question regarding how users could “clean” bitcoin from a sanctioned bitcoin wallet address. Could cooperating with U.S. authorities really help innocent bystanders avoid blacklists?  In the meantime, the Iranian mining industry is booming with fresh crops of untainted bitcoin.  Persian bulls  Thanks to Iran’s subsidized electricity offerings that make cryptocurrency mining relatively affordable, mining operations continue to grow despite global price dips.  “I’m trying to expand the mining industry and [bitcoin’s] use case for business in Iran,” Sedighi, the miner based in Isfahan, said, adding that he wants to help build a world with fewer sanctions and censorship. “Bitcoin users in Iran are mostly young people who are interested in technology.”  Much like Sedighi, Tehran-based developer Saad said that political complications only boost their dedication to promoting mainstream adoption. Saad said:  “We, as developers and traders, will find our route to make our dream a reality.”  He added that promoting healthy networks of private bitcoin wallets, beyond corporate exchanges, is important because governments can only enact sanctions against individual people and banks that interact or indirectly receive bitcoin from an identified wallet.  Governments cannot freeze privately held and operated bitcoin wallets themselves. So, the more that people store and transact with bitcoin by themselves, the less that lawful users need to fear discrimination.  “When cryptos become so common and globally accepted, these measures don’t work,"" said Saad.  As such, choosing a bitcoin wallet with strong privacy features is important for those who, in some ways, are literally becoming their own banks.  The anonymous developer in Tehran told CoinDesk that, despite the political tensions, bitcoin’s unique value proposition is inspiring more local engineers to learn about blockchain and start experimenting with uses of the tech.  “Public adoption would be the best thing I can wish for,” he added.

42429967,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mBh,1543508106,Bitcoin Mining Giant Holds Flash Sale to Celebrate Price 'Bottom',"Bitcoin mining firm Canaan Creative has revealed it is temporarily cutting prices across all of its crypto mining devices.  As part of its ""flash sale"" starting today, all of the company's miners – from the Avalon 921 (20 terahashes per second) to the Avalon 851 (14.5 TH/s) – are all available at $200 each.  A representative of the company, Steven Mosher, told CoinDesk that the sale currently had no set end-date and that it had sufficient inventory for all miners except the Avalon 911, which is sold out.  Mosher further explained that Canaan was ""celebrating"" the price of bitcoin leaping over 11 percent yesterday following recent losses.  With miners' profitability suffering recently amid low bitcoin prices, he said there were ""concerns people were turning off machines and smaller guys were getting out of the market, and that everyone is sitting and waiting.""  He continued:  ""I'm looking and I see [bitcoin] rebound, it's up to $4,300 and my thinking was, I'm going to celebrate. Usually if [bitcoin] goes up, we would put prices up. Well, I thought I'm going to try something different.""  After recent negativity in the industry around issues like the bitcoin cash ""hash war,"" he said: ""Now's the time to celebrate, we're at a bottom.""  ""We're agnostic when it comes to what people want to mine. We want to make sure big miners are staying committed and stay hopeful,"" Mosher added.  Canaan is one of several miner manufacturers to have moved to go public via for an initial public offering (IPO) in the last year. However, its effort to go public now looks in doubt, as its filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) has now lapsed.  As Mosher indicated, the flash sale comes amid a tough period for crypto miners.  Last week, the founder of the third-largest mining pool, F2Pool, estimated that between 600,000 and 800,000 bitcoin miners have shut down since mid-November. Mao Shixing said the estimate takes into account the total network hash rate drop and the average hash power of older mining machines that are having a hard time generating profits.  Canaan also revealed new firmware for its miners today that its says reduces power consumption to 0.085 j/Gh.

Revealed today at the Block FS conference in New York, the news came in response to a question from CoinDesk posed to Tom Jessop, head of Fidelity Digital Assets, on what other cryptocurrencies may be added to the platform, to be launched next year.  Last month, the buy-side giant announced it would be launching a separate company, Fidelity Digital Asset Services, at the time stating that it would be offering custody and trading services for bitcoin and ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain.  “I think there is demand for the next four or five in rank of market cap order. So we will be looking at that,” he said.  Jessop explained that Fidelity is taking a customer-driven approach for now and that its 13,000-plus institutional clients are interested in bitcoin and ether because they make up a large part of the current market cap.  “I think when it comes to security tokens or tokens that are likely to be deemed securities, we are waiting for that space to develop,” he explained, going on to say:  “We have had some interest but we don’t think it’s a groundswell of interest, so our focus is really on the top, call it five-seven, before we start building capabilities for the tail. But I think it will come.""  Fidelity has spent four to five years of R&D in the space and has a long view of the crypto asset class and the underlying technology’s potential, which Jessop compared to the exponential sweep of the internet.  He acknowledged that digital assets have not had a great run this year, pointing out that, a year prior, the run-up in prices saw Fidelity’s charitable crypto donations vehicle garner some $70 million in contributions.  “It was a great story and a great source of donations,” Jessop added.

42429972,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mHh,1543500040,ConsenSys Backs $2.1 Million Funding Round for Ethereum Privacy Startup,"ConsenSys Labs has led a $2.1 million seed round for AZTEC, a startup that's working to make ethereum transactions private so financial institutions can comfortably use the second-largest blockchain.  Announced Thursday, other investors in the round include Entrepreneur First, Samos Investments, Jeffrey Tarrant (Mov37) and Charlie Songhurst.  AZTEC, created by the mathematician Tom Pocock and nuclear physicist Zachary Williamson, uses zero-knowledge proofs (also known as zk-SNARKs), the cryptographic technique popularized by the zcash currency, to enhance privacy on a shared ledger. But the startup claims its protocol is ""twice as efficient as other known technologies on the network.""  The protocol is intended to be used by banks, Pocock told CoinDesk, and they will be able to utilize the tech through a partnership with CreditMint, an ethereum-based platform for corporate debt issuance and trading created by the same team as AZTEC.  ""We have been talking to more than 20 leading financial institutions, specializing in corporate private debt, amongst which are global top-10 banks,"" Pocock said, adding that the first wave of users would be announced in January 2019. In addition to enhancing privacy, AZTEC's tech will also help boost the speed of settlement in loan markets, the startup claims.  Currently, big banks tend to gravitate towards private, permissioned blockchains like the one launched on Tuesday by CLS, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as the first users. However, Pocock believes that established financial institutions would benefit from using public blockchains.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Immutability, single-source data and elimination of settlement risk are strongest on public chains — but clearly, financial institutions demand full transaction privacy.""  Until now, he said, that was not possible on ethereum's public chain, ""and therefore capital markets activity has been restricted to private blockchains.""  AZTEC's team had been in discussions with ConsenSys for several months after graduating from Entrepreneur First, the London tech accelerator, in March 2018, Pocock said.  “We were impressed with the resilience of the zero-knowledge proof technology that AZTEC created. Based on what we’re seeing, AZTEC is the closest to production and the most efficient in sense of gas cost,” Min Teo, executive director at ConsenSys Labs Investments Europe, told CoinDesk, referring to the small amount of ether that must be paid to power a transaction on the blockchain.  Joe Lubin, the founder of ConsenSys, said in a press release that his ethereum design studio ""is proud to support this breakthrough from AZTEC and CreditMint, bringing zk-SNARKs-based privacy, confidentiality and scalability to a wide variety of asset transactions on public ethereum.”  Speed and scaling  Stepping back, it remains to be seen whether a zero-knowledge proof-based system can be fast and scalable enough to suit enterprises – especially considering that even without this computationally expensive privacy enhancement, ethereum has well-known scaling challenges.  But Pocock says that AZTEC's protocol is working at a decent clip.  ""Without scaling we can put one transaction per second through the public network – this will be orders of magnitude faster with upcoming scaling to the network,"" he told CoinDesk, referring to ethereum developers' ongoing efforts to increase throughput on the blockchain. ""Even today, it is more than sufficient for CreditMint to move the private corporate debt markets onto the public blockchain. It takes milliseconds to both construct and verify AZTEC zero-knowledge proofs.""  In September, ethereum's founder Vitalik Buterin suggested that using zk-snarks (“Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge,” a variant of zero-knowledge proofs not requiring interaction between prover and verifier) can potentially help ethereum scale up to 500 transactions per second.  AZTEC is not the first effort to add privacy to the ethereum protocol by using zero-knowledge proofs: more than a year ago, JPMorgan revealed adding zk-snarks technology developed by the startup behind zcash to Quorum, the megabank's ethereum-based private blockchain.  Speaking about how that project was going, Jack Gavigan, who is responsible for product and regulatory relations at the Zcash Company, said in a video posted on the startup's blog last month that the technology is still immature, but he hopes to see it deployed in the actual environment ""within the 12 to 18 months,"" with the scalability problems effectively solved.  Another attempt was the October announcement of EY's Ops Chain Public Edition prototype, which, the consulting giant said, uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow companies to create and sell ""product and service tokens"" on the public ethereum blockchain without disclosing their transaction records publicly.  Yet another project, Adhara, also supported by ConsenSys, has been exploring zero-knowledge proof technology for an industry-grade payments mechanism of the South African Reserve Bank.  According to Pocock, AZTEC is different from previous projects because it's working on the ethereum mainnet (i.e. not a test environment or private chain) and is ""significantly more efficient in terms of gas costs.""  AZTEC plans to deploy additional features to boost the protocol's efficiency during the coming months and open-source the tech, raising additional funds in the meantime, the company says.

42429981,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mZh,1543499991,"Coinbase, DCG Join $4.5 Million Seed Round for Crypto Evaluation Startup","Flipside Crypto wants investors to think beyond market capitalization, and Coinbase apparently agrees.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the exchange’s Coinbase Ventures arm and Digital Currency Group co-led the analytics startup’s extended seed round that closed on November 21, alongside True Ventures and Castle Island Ventures. Although the size of Coinbase’s investment was not disclosed and the company declined to comment on the move, all told Flipside has raised $4.5 million.  “Coinbase has substantial interest in what data can do to help their customers be most effective at understanding and take part in this space,” Flipside Crypto CEO Dave Balter told CoinDesk. “We look forward to working with them on that.”  Boston-based Flipside tracks network activity and developer contributions to GitHub projects, among other factors, to determine how various assets are evolving and being used. Founded in 2017, the startup analyzes 1,000 crypto assets and scores them, factoring in global market caps and trading patterns as just 5 percent of each asset’s overall “fcast” score.  The firm uses multiple algorithms to map out trading patterns and says it can distinguish exchange activity from other types of transactions, like payments or moving crypto to a personal wallet. Similar to CoinDesk’s Crypto Economics Explorer, the idea is to give a more well-rounded view of crypto valuations rather than fickle trading prices.  “It starts with understanding the difference between speculation and actual usage,” Flipside board member Adam D'Augelli, a partner at True Ventures, told CoinDesk.  So far, over 100 investors have used these metrics from the startup’s closed beta while Flipside partnered with institutions like the investment bank Canaccord Genuity to create detailed evaluation reports. Plus, according to Balter, several more institutions plan to partner with the startup when the platform launches publicly in early 2019.  Balter went on to say that only the top 100 cryptocurrencies have any real traction at this point. However, he believes measuring blockchain activity and developer contributions can offer a holistic perspective of how an asset is maturing.  “Price is an ineffective tool for understanding the value of these assets,” Balter said. “What you really need to pay attention to is, are customers using this product? How is that changing? And are developers actually building?”  Early signal on XRP  This combination of analytics can help predict market signals, according to Flipside. For example, XRP’s fcast score spiked in September, partly reflecting GitHub activity, as the fintech company Ripple was quietly rolling out a new initiative making it easier for banks to use the cryptocurrency.  “As they [Ripple] begin developing for that partnership to get announced, they are doing code work. They’ve got customers testing the product. They are doing all the things that a typical business would do before making an announcement,” Balter said, adding:  “It’s highly indicative of good, healthy company behaviors. If they are focusing on the business, you will see the fcast [score] move. If they are just focused pumping the price, that fcast isn’t going to change.”  For D'Augelli, whose fund also invested in cryptocurrency projects like the Chia Network, TruStory, and ZeppelinOS, insights that must be collected in the moment or quickly evaporate or get buried in the slush could prove invaluable to cryptocurrency creators.  “If you’re a crypto project today you don’t have a way to benchmark yourself against others, to reach out to your end customers, to understand if people are engaging in the right way,” D'Augelli said. “Those same tools that are useful for investors to understand the fundamental value of projects also help projects build better customer experiences and understand how they are doing.”  Starting early next year, people who want more detailed reports and live updates from Flipside will be able to pay for subscriptions to ranging from $25–$300 a month, depending on what types of data insights they need.  The startup’s mailing list already includes roughly 1,000 prospective subscribers, including venture capitalists, retail investors, and developer teams.  As Flipside’s backer Coinbase looks to aggressively add new assets in 2019, such metrics could prove useful for the exchange unicorn as well.  Speaking to the current market conditions, Balter concluded:  “The projects that [will] win, that move through this winter of despair into growth, like Amazon from the dotcom bubble, are the ones that are actually showing that customer movement.”  Image of co-founders Dave Balter (L), Jim Myers (C) and Eric Stone (R) via Flipside Crypto",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/29/coinbase-dcg-join-45-million-seed-round-for-crypto-evaluation-startup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d02ce25cf7314e705ff27b92d2100ec7c3e1f2f-1465x790.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The BFOET market includes five North Sea crude oil fields – Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk and Troll. The company plans to expand to other markets next year.  The blockchain platform is aimed to help trading companies replace paper-based documentation with smart contracts. By automating parts of the process, the move is expected to help companies cut costs, reduce errors and make post-trade processes more efficient.  The “first line of code was only written in May this year”, VAKT Global said in a LinkedIn post on Thursday, adding that, together with its partners Deloitte and IT firm ThoughtWorks, it managed to deliver this project “on time and to budget.""  The consortium was formed a year ago this month. Shell and BP aside, other members include Norwegian energy firm Statoil, trading houses such as Gunvor, Koch Supply & Trading and Mercuria, and banks including ABN Amro, ING and Societe Generale.

42429986,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mhh,1543489255,Bitcoin Sees Biggest Single-Day Price Gain Since April,"Bitcoin (BTC) is teasing a short-term bullish reversal, having just recorded its biggest single-day gain in seven months.  Prices closed yesterday (UTC) at $4,257, a 24-hour increase of 11.43 percent and the highest daily gain since April 12, according to CoinMarketCap.  Back then, the cryptocurrency was trading above $6,900, 38 percent higher than the current price of $4,345. Interestingly, the 13 percent price gain witnessed that day had been preceded by a 45 percent drop and a minor bout of consolidation.  More importantly, the big bullish move of April 12 marked the beginning of the rally, which saw prices rise to near $10,000 by early May.  Similarly, yesterday’s 11 percent rise had been preceded by a 44 percent drop to 14-month lows below $3,400. Further, positive signs are building up on the short duration technical charts. As a result, bitcoin could be in for a short-term bullish reversal, similar to the one witnessed after April 12.  Daily chart  Yesterday, BTC created a big bullish candle, validating the bearish exhaustion signaled by the previous three long-tailed candles. With the strong move higher, the 14-day relative strength has moved back into undersold territory above 30.00, confirming a bullish divergence (higher low on RSI).  So, it's possible history is about to repeat itself with a bullish move toward $5,000.  Notably, the bullish case looks stronger than it did seven months ago. The RSI hit record lows during the recent sell-off, signaling extreme oversold conditions, as opposed to readings above 30 registered before April 12.  4-hour chart  Over on the 4-hour chart, the cryptocurrency is probing the falling channel resistance of $4,320 at press time, having confirmed a double bottom breakout with a move above $4,120 earlier today.  Notably, the bull flag breakout seen in the 15-minute chart is signaling that the falling channel hurdle could be breached in the next few hours. The breakout, if confirmed, would only bolster the already bullish technical setup.  View  BTC's 11 percent price gain has likely turned the tables in favor of the bulls.  A falling channel breakout on the 4-hour chart, if confirmed, would open the doors for a test of psychological resistance at $5,000.  The short-term bullish case would weaken if a convincing break above the 10-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $4,293, remains elusive for the next 48 hours.

Galaxy Digital recorded a net realized loss for digital assets at $38 million in Q3, a major contributor to the overall net loss.

42429980,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mRh,1543483832,FBI Arrests AriseBank CEO Over $4 Million Crypto Fraud,"The FBI has arrested the CEO of cryptocurrency platform AriseBank after he was indicted over an alleged multi-million dollar scam.  The news was announced Wednesday by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Northern District of Texas, which states that 30-year-old Jared Rice Sr. tricked hundreds of investors out of over $4 million and has now been charged with three counts of securities fraud and three counts of wire fraud.  Rice allegedly lied to prospective investors, claiming that the firm, which he called the “first decentralized banking platform,” would offer FDIC-insured bank accounts and Visa-linked debit and credit cards, in addition to crypto services based on its own AriseCoin token.  However, in reality, AriseBank wasn't authorized to conduct banking services in Texas, was not FDIC insured, and had no partnership with Visa, the Justice Department states.  Rice is also accused of lying about raising ""$600 million within just a few weeks"" through an initial coin offering (ICO). Moreover, he spent investors’ money for his own personal use on hotels, food and clothing and more.  After the firm's formation, he began promoting AriseBank and AriseCoin around June 2017 through press releases, public video interviews, social media outlets and his own websites, according to a court document unsealed Wednesday.  If convicted, Rice faces up to 120 years in federal prison, the Attorney’s Office said.  Erin Nealy Cox, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said:  “My office is committed to enforcing the rule of law in the cryptocurrency space. The Northern District of Texas will not tolerate this sort of flagrant deception – online or off.”  In January, Rice was also sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), together with his co-founder Stanley Ford, for alleged fraud and issuing unregistered securities during an ICO. The Texas Department of Banking issued AriseBank a cease-and-desist order in the same month.  An SEC complaint from February further states that Rice is on probation as a part of a plea deal stemming from a Collin County, Texas, indictment in 2015 for theft and tampering with government records. He is also under felony indictment in Dallas County, Texas, for assault, after which he allegedly destroyed evidence by stealing the victim’s phone and deleting an audio recording of the incident.

42429979,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mTh,1543467633,Botnets Are Being Repurposed for Crypto Mining Malware: Kaspersky,"A security bulletin released by Kaspersky Labs states that botnets are increasingly being used to distribute illicit crypto mining software.  In the note  , analysts for the cybersecurity firm said Wednesday that the number of unique users attacked by crypto miners grew dramatically in the first three months of 2018. Such malware is designed to secretly reallocate an infected machine's processing power to mine cryptocurrencies, with any proceeds going to the attacker.  According to Kaspersky, more users were infected in September than in January and ""the threat is still current,"" though it is unclear whether the recent collapse in the crypto markets' prices will have an impact on the infection rate.  The firm's analysts said that a noticeable drop in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks may be attributable to ""the 'reprofiling' of botnets from DDoS attacks to cryptocurrency mining.""  As the note detailed:  ""Evidence suggests that the owners of many well-known botnets have switched their attack vector toward mining. For example, the DDoS activity of the Yoyo botnet dropped dramatically, although there is no data about it being dismantled.""  A possible explanation for cybercriminals' increased interest in crypto-mining may lie in the fact that once the malware is distributed, it's difficult for victims and police to detect.  Of the various types of software identified and cataloged, most reconfigure a computer's processor usage to allocate a small amount to mining, keeping users from noticing.  The organization further looked into reasons for the prevalence of this type of malware in some regions over others, concluding that regions with a lax legislative framework on pirated and illicitly distributed software are more likely to have victims of cryptojacking.  U.S. users were the least affected by the attacks, constituting 1.33 percent of the total number detected, followed by users in Switzerland and Britain. However, countries with lax piracy laws like Kazkhstan, Vietnam and Indonesia topped the list.  ""The more freely unlicensed software is distributed, the more miners there are. This is confirmed by our statistics, which indicates that miners most often land on victim computers together with pirated software,"" the report said.
