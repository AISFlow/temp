42400147,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24PL,1499459447,Swiss City Announces Plan to Verify IDs Using Ethereum,"A Swiss city known for its cryptocurrency startup ecosystem is launching a new ethereum-based identity service.  The City of Zug announced today that, starting in September, it will offer digital identity services through a new app, connecting a person's ID with a particular crypto-address. Local citizens can register and get verified by city officials.  Zug is pursuing the effort in part due past efforts to create digital identity solutions using centralized means. Those solutions proved to be ""relatively complicated in application and are already technically considered obsolete today"", according to translated statements.  On the technology side, the app will leverage the uPort identity platform created by ethereum development community ConsenSys. Also involved on the development front is the Swiss startup ti&m and the Lucerne University of Economics.  Dolfi Müller, Zug's president, said of the project:  ""We want a single electronic identity – a kind of digital passport – for all possible applications. And we do not want this digital ID to be centralized at the city, but on the blockchain.""  Müller added that Zug plans to hold a consultative vote on electronic ballot access, expected to take place next spring.  The city has become a major hub for digital currency and blockchain startups, buoyed by a proactive government that has sought to attract more startups to Switzerland.

In a joint statement, the Polish National Bank and the Financial Supervision Commission delivered a broad warning against investing in digital currencies, citing price volatility and the risk of fraud. The regulators clarified that cryptocurrencies – it identifies bitcoin, litecoin and ether – are not considered legal tender in Poland.      While the statement itself does not outline any specific policy measures in light of the tech, it does state that financial institutions should avoid doing business with cryptocurrency exchange services ""in particular with regard to the risk of exploitation of these entities for money laundering and terrorist financing"", according to the statement.      ""The decision in this regard should be preceded by a thorough analysis of the potential consequences, including legal risk and reputation risk,"" the regulators added.      While arguing that distributed ledger tech should be distinguished from cryptocurrency applications, the regulators called for increased scrutiny before any broader adoption happens.      ""Many functional, operational and legal aspects of this technology, however, should be subject to a detailed and thorough analyzes and tests before the mass introduction of the financial market,"" the statement read.    In February  , CoinDesk reported that Poland’s financial ombudsman, Aleksandra Wiktorow, urged the country's Ministry of Finance to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges. That call followed the closure of Bitcurex, the country's oldest bitcoin exchange, which sparked an investigation by local authorities.

Sheng argued that prospective investors should be cautious of ICOs – through which cryptographic tokens are sold and distributed via a blockchain – and called for ""moderate regulation"" of the activity.  As part of that process, he argued, ""information disclosure requirements and moderate regulation for ICO projects must be introduced"", according to the journal.  That said, he also expressed support for an environment that promotes innovation technology uses, with the government making public both the risks and opportunities and involved.  Sheng said in the interview:  ""Only time and market dynamics will tell how popular blockchain technologies and ICOs will become in the future. Moderate regulation should be applied, but it should not stifle innovation.""  His comments come months after the PBoC began to play a more active role in policing the country's digital currency space, a policy shift that led to a months-long withdrawal freeze at several leading China-based exchanges. Withdrawals at those markets were reactivated in late May.  At the same time, the central bank has been investigating the launch of a digital currency of its own. Yao Qian, who works in the PBoC's technology department, recently detailed some of the concepts the bank is exploring.

Mizuho said today that the test saw participation from Marubeni Corporation, a Japanese trading conglomerate, and domestic insurer Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance Inc. During the test, information was transmitted between Japan and Australia, with ""all trade-related processes, from issuing the letter of credit to delivering trade documents, [being] completed entirely via a digital platform using blockchain"", according to Mizuho.  The bank has launched a number of blockchain-focused tests in the past year, including one that saw it utilize bitcoin's blockchain to facilitate securities transfers. Mizuho has weighed the tech for currency settlement and distributed record keeping, among other areas.  Among the benefits highlighted by the trial: faster document delivery times and increased transparency. Mizuho said that the digitization of the process cut the amount of time it takes to create and disseminate trade finance-related documentation, as well as reduce the human labor required.  That said, the bank noted that those benefits aren't as meaningful if some of the parties to trade finance transactions aren't actually using the same system.  ""It is not possible to transmit trade transaction information in digital blockchain / DLT format to parties who do not use the platform; transactions must be conducted as before,"" Mizuho said.  Mizuho suggested that the project may lead to client-facing trade finance services, though it didn't offer any clear timeline on when such a product launch might happen.  ""Building on this trade transaction project, Mizuho aims to further explore the practical business application of blockchain / DLT and to offer technologically sophisticated, client-focused services going forward,"" the bank said in a statement.

42400144,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24LP,1499432447,Who Watches Bitcoin's Watchmen? Scaling's Great Game of Egos,"Pete Rizzo is the editor for CoinDesk, where he oversees content production for CoinDesk.com and CoinDesk research products. He previously served as editor for PYMNTS.com.  In this opinion piece, Rizzo discusses developments in bitcoin's scaling debate, adding color to the cast of characters involved in the hopes of highlighting essential parts of the disagreement at play.    ""Thermodynamic miracles... events with odds against so astronomical they're effectively impossible, like oxygen spontaneously becoming gold. I long to observe such a thing.""  – Dr Manhattan, ""Watchmen""    While much has been said about bitcoin, this discussion is not without its inherent problems.  One of the least addressed is the extent to which language itself has done disservice and damage to the development of what can only be considered a human technical achievement still struggling to be understood. Indeed, a great irony that has emerged with ""bitcoin"" is that a distributed system with so many intricate components can even be referred to in singularity at all.  It shouldn't be a surprise then that the idea that bitcoin can or should change the delicate balance of its protocol rules has been the biggest victim of limited vocabulary.  Should bitcoin become a 'digital currency' or 'digital gold'? Should this choice be dictated by scientific analysis, or guided by strict interpretation of vision? Any choice of words creates biases that, owing to the system's distributed nature, are incapable of being broadly enforced.  Bitcoin as an idea is now owned by many real people, all with different backgrounds, who understand the technology in different ways, who have different wants owing to their specific positions related to the protocol and who have profited differently from these associations.  What's clear now, however, is that at least three principal groups are capable of exercising power over that system – miners, entrepreneurs and developers – all of whom have different understandings of what ""bitcoin"" is and how they believe ""bitcoin"" should be. (Users, the fourth principal group, now seem caught on the sidelines in what can only be described as a power struggle that, at this point, has become entirely a game of human egos.)  Fueling the flames of the debate is a specific proposal stands to impact the balance of power between these parties, altering its ideological and sociological balance through technology.  Organized by investor Digital Currency Group and backed by miners and entrepreneurs, Segwit2x intends to enact Segregated Witness, a network optimization originally proposed by developers, before increasing bitcoin's hard-coded block size three months later.  As a political creation, it is a compromise of long-discussed compromises. But, while the code is a collection of pre-existing ideas, its enactment stands to be quite radical, impacting the system in a way that could, at the very least, reshape bitcoin's power structure, and at most, cause bitcoin to splinter into two.  But if it's true that language has impaired development and understanding of bitcoin, so too has it failed to properly categorize how stakeholders see themselves as players on a grand stage, writing a narrative with the ability, they believe, to impart lasting change on the world.  The following attempts to use – broad generalizations – to relay my experiences and interactions with the various constituents in the hope of explaining their positions and views on the scaling debate in aggregate, and how they relate to repercussions of the Segwit2x proposal.  The entrepreneurs    ""We can do so much more. We can save this world... with the right leadership."" – Ozymandias    Perhaps the easiest group to understand are the entrepreneurs.  On the whole, they are young, Western, and libertarian. They are doers that prefer action, and (generally) believe in compromise over ideals.  Ambitious founders, natural and charismatic leaders, they are public faces. They have been the subject of magazine articles, they have thousands of social media followers. They have spent years traveling around the globe extolling the virtues of a ""payment system"" that was truly different. That was limited today, yes, but ""capable of change"".  To them, the prolonged scaling debate has shaken an unspoken core belief, that everything in bitcoin was subject to revision, able to be made better by the other doers and thinkers that would doubtless follow their example.  ""Bitcoin is open source. Ten-minute confirmation times can be changed,"" 21 CEO Balaji Srinivasan, then the stealth startup's chairman, declared in 2015.  It is likely that this argument was put forward in board rooms. To important people. Celebrities. Influencers. It was both true, and capable of not being true, though this latter complication was perhaps too easily discarded.  I don't suppose it would be a stretch to assume that many bitcoin entrepreneurs have had a limited understanding of bitcoin as a technology not in theory, but in practice. While their notions are correct, they have also existed without being challenged by the complex human system of developers and miners that would enact it.  Many seem to have considered the protocol an afterthought, assuming problems would be worked out in their favor and in the advancement of a definition of bitcoin as an open-source payment system that would create new business opportunities.  That a new philosophy would emerge that would argue that blockchains are protocols that would be unlikely to sustain a significant class of startups, wasn't foreseen, and doesn't seem to be something that is broadly acknowledged.  It's perhaps this last part that has the biggest impact on their relationship with developers, as extracting value from a system often necessities an intermediary role, one that developers now argue, from a scientific standpoint, might have meant to be eliminated.  The developers    ""Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise."" – Rorschach.    What then of the developers? The open-source group often referred to as Bitcoin Core.  They prize idealism and patience. It was once told to me that new developers are trained in hours-long question-and-answer sessions that run through the night. The knowledge must pass down, drip by drip, to those who could expand their mind and attain it.  They are also elusive, stubborn in their views and guided by paranoia (though the latter is as much of a strength as a weakness). Not a small number use pseudonyms owing to the belief that bitcoin has successfully culled back human rights from what they perceive as the violence of centralized governments. Early to the software, they turned to bitcoin as an alternative to traditional money, an idea that could reshape society if steadily shepherded.  I once asked two high-profile developers if they cared if they even lived to see bitcoin become what they envisioned. They seemed to think that this was unlikely, and didn't seem worse off for the realization.  To developers, the lack of ""progress"" on scaling is evidence bitcoin is withstanding human collusion. Any advancement that comes at the sake of practicality or a ""greater good"" is a perversion of the system, akin to using a dictator to save democracy.  It's perhaps not an understatement that their relationship with miners is challenging for similar reasons. To most bitcoin developers, miners have been chiefly an intellectual consideration. That is to say, they are considered insofar as they are necessary to the system as vital, but ultimately replaceable parts, of that system.  They believe that bitcoin derives security from computing power, but don't particularly care who provides it. Should one group seek to impose their will on the system, the laws of economics, they seem to think, will eventually bring along a more accommodating crowd.  As for the startups, there seems to be a lingering resentment between these camps – some have even gone so far as to label the prioritization of the needs of startups as an ""attack"" on the system itself.  The miners    ""I am tired of Earth. These people. I am tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives."" – Dr Manhattan    It's often understated just how amazing it is that bitcoin mining evolved the way it did, mutating quickly from a computer-based competition between individual users to an industry that supports three-to-four distinct and highly specialized business models.  If bitcoin miners have become barons with outsize influence on the network, even influence that was never intended, they sit on a throne of skulls. Miners outcompeted the world, produced chips faster at scale, filled data centers faster at scale and generally competed better in an industry so difficult that it is in a constant state of reinvention.  But miners are people. They are predominantly young, of Chinese descent and extraordinarily wealthy owing to the success of their businesses. Most have approached the scaling debate with all the enthusiasm of tag-alongs to a party who were suddenly asked to dictate the music. They were thrust into a situation they didn't quite understand (or understood very differently), one that has been exacerbated by cultural differences in governance and business etiquette.  The constant in-fighting and intellectual combat aren't things that they signed up for, or that they seem very interested in participating in. The common mood among them of late seems exasperation.  As for developers, it might be an understatement to say this is strained (some have gone so far as to call for the Core developers to be fired outright).  Whatever goodwill that once existed has now mostly eroded through public displays of animosity, and the fact that for miners, there are plenty of other ways to make money through a diversified ecosystem of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets.  The monster    ""Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.""    Left alone, arguments would likely persist without action. However, the situation is now being shaped by the perception of external threat.  Since the beginning of 2017, $90bn has been allocated to alternative cryptocurrencies, all but obliterating the narrative that bitcoin as a specific iteration of cryptocurrency could serve as the ""internet of money"". Once defended by its early lead and network effect, venture capital interest has now largely migrated to ethereum, which they believe is better facilitating this shift.  In the court of public opinion, investors have already eaten their words.  For bitcoin, this now poses a moral paradox with two visions at play. Developers seem to be arguing that the power of bitcoin lies in the ability of each and every user to validate the network's entire transaction history, and that no sacrifices should be made toward this end.  Not doing so, they reason, is a return to the system of banking today, in which intermediaries are trusted with this role and users are powerless. It is not enough that a system would be faster or more convenient, and perhaps, more decentralized. It is not enough to sacrifice today what could be achieved, however theoretically, tomorrow. The process, they reason, must be slow, as this is the nature of scientific advancement.  Entrepreneurs, however, hear the ticking of the doomsday clock (personified by their runways and business outlooks). The great cryptocurrency bubble, for them, is a necessary monster. Should it not exist, another would be created as a means of benefitting the ""greater good"" (as gauged by the health and success of their businesses in promoting bitcoin).  Miners have already made their choice which of the two visions of the network with which to align. What's guiding this choice is less clear, though most, when pressured seem to suggest that they believe it will increase the value of bitcoin.  How a 2MB block size increase can compete with 1,000x ICO gains, or why an increasingly diversified cryptocurrency ecosystem does anything but strengthen bitcoin's value proposition, don't seem to be questions any are interested in answering.  The Ozymandias choice    ""In the end? Nothing ends, Adrian. Nothing ever ends."" – Dr Manhattan    So, what to make now of this modern missile crisis?  Bitcoin scaling has so far been a game played across many continents. It is a muse for which thousands of hours have been spent in the composition of think pieces, proposals, arguments and all manner of human creations.  It has led the technology's best minds to plead and stomp and grind their fingernails into their palms, to vow to never come back to bitcoin again. But, they have always returned with new ideas, new enthusiasm and the promise of something better.  What happens then if they go their separate ways?  The union of startups and miners would appear to be tenuous. What will happen when larger blocks push down opportunities for miners to collect fees? Or when the new developers can't match the track record of Bitcoin Core? A marriage of convenience doesn't necessarily make a lasting one.  Should developers end up on their own blockchain, who will offer essential infrastructure to ensure the technology is broadly used? True to the idealism or not, many bitcoin users are customers of startups. Much of the narrative the public has consumed is influenced and informed by their success.  Doubtless hard feelings have been inflamed by both sides.  But more than anything, it would seem any split or change in power would undermine the very thing bitcoin sought to provide to the economically disenfranchised – security. In an increasingly diverse crypto asset ecosystem, more and more devoid of rationality, it's hard to see the value in sacrificing what can only be achieved through continued unity.

42400139,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24HT,1499428834,Life After Coinbase: Can Charlie Lee Keep Litecoin's Revival Alive?,"It might sound surprising, but for the creator of the world's fourth-largest cryptocurrency, the project was until recently only a part-time job.  That finally changed this June, when Charlie Lee, who created the litecoin project while working at Google in 2011, finally left his day job at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, where he had served as director of engineering since 2013. Last year, Lee had cut his hours to work more on the alternative cryptocurrency, but it was a major technological upgrade in May that finally convinced him to go full time.  That's when the cryptocurrency, long affectionately known as the ""silver to bitcoin's gold,"" made a comeback after years of decline and inactivity, activating a code upgrade called Segregated Witness (SegWit) that was originally proposed for bitcoin.  As it started to look likely that the cryptocurrency would activate the change, the public blockchain saw a burst in developer activity, a hike in price and renewed attention in the press and on social media. Some developers saw litecoin as a possible testing ground for ideas that might one day be adopted on bitcoin.  Notably, a few Lightning Network projects demoed transactions to show how a bug fix that SegWit provides can increase transaction capacity, and a long-time bitcoin developer even started contributing code to the project.  While the initial wave of buzz has now mostly died down (migrating back to bitcoin's political war over said change), developers are still quietly continuing to work on litecoin.  With this, the Litecoin Foundation was recently formed with the mission of advancing the cryptocurrency, in part by beefing up the developer team. (The Singapore-based non-profit's first full-time hire was ""Shaolinfry"" – a well-known pseudonymous developer.)  After joining as the second hire, Lee is now working to grow the team, telling CoinDesk the non-profit is in the process of enlisting ""a few"" developers for full-time positions.  Fast and cheap  In addition to its commitment to new hires, the Litecoin Foundation recently unveiled a development roadmap that includes technical changes made possible by the SegWit activation.  Surprisingly, though, this isn't necessarily Lee's primary focus. He argued that the ""most important thing"" is increasing litecoin adoption among exchanges, merchants and users.  ""I want to make sure that litecoin is traded everywhere first, then make a convincing case why companies and merchants should use litecoin when they need fast and cheap payments,"" he said.  He cited the recent decision by content micropayments startup Yours to move its platform to litecoin as a notable ""win"" that suggests further progress can be made with the altcoin's target audience.  There are still plenty of technical features in the works, though.  One of the most notable upcoming updates is that Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau is working on is a so-called ""Smart Crypto-Vault"" that will finally put the smart contract idea MAST into practice. Lee said that the open-source dev team plans to release a demo of the technology soon.  Lee's other top priorities are working with Lightning Labs on a Lightning Network implementation that's safe to use for real litecoin transactions – not just in tests. Further, he plans to integrate a privacy-focused technology known as ""confidential transactions.""  Silver and gold  Given these ambitious goals, one might wonder if Lee believes litecoin could be primed to compete with bitcoin, perhaps going so far as to specialize in market opportunities the number one cryptocurrency once sought to grab. Indeed, some onlookers view litecoin as a sandbox for experimentation, or even as some sort of a backup plan should bitcoin never adopt SegWit.  Lee, though, said he is motivated to work on the project because he sees a longer-term opportunity for the two cryptocurrencies, and perhaps others, to link together.  ""I'm a huge proponent of bitcoin getting SegWit as soon as possible. My vision for litecoin is to have it work closely with bitcoin,"" he said.  Notably, a concept called ""atomic swaps"" features heavily in his future vision. Once the Lightning Network is working on both bitcoin and litecoin, the addition would make it easy for users to trade between cryptocurrencies without going through an intermediary exchange – like Coinbase, in fact.  Lee concluded:  ""That's a game changer and that's when the game really starts!""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

Local news source Malaysian Insight reported on July 5 that the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in the country said it ""is not involved and does not have any partnerships with Ecobit"" – a blockchain project that claims to address environmental and carbon emissions issues and which closed an initial coin offering (ICO) just last month.  While the cached Google search result for the company still states that its ""Phase 1"" project is ""under the United Nations Collaborative Program,"" its landing page on EcoBit's website is now unavailable, as is the team information page.  UNDP communications analyst Ahmad Hafiz Osman told the news source that EcoBit had also used UN logos without permission in promoting its forest carbon-offset project in Malaysia's Kelantan state. The logos were allegedly taken down days before the UNDP issued a letter to EcoBit.  According to Tokenmarket.net, the board advisor of EcoBit is Tang Too Siah, who is also the CEO of Climate Protector Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian carbon credit firm.

However, Kelantan state has previously agreed to a 30-year carbon credit offset deal with Climate Protectors, under the Reduced Emission from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) program for Kelantan's forest preservation, and suspicions have emerged on social media that the state government has been illegally collecting money through the two companies.  Following the news, according to The Star Online, Kelantan head of state Ahmad Yakob denied the allegation and urged investors in the carbon trading program to lodge reports with the police.

42400136,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24EW,1499421622,Killing 'Cryptocurrency': Why It's Time to Retire the Term,"Tim Enneking is managing director at Crypto Asset Management, which oversees Crypto Asset Fund, a regulated US cryptocurrency trading fund.  In this opinion piece, Enneking argues that the term ""cryptocurrencies"" is now outdated, and that new terminology is needed to describe the innovations being imagined and built in the blockchain industry.      No, that headline is not a mistake.  It’s not the cryptocurrencies themselves that should be killed off, but rather the term (hence the quotation marks). Labeling everything going on in the crypto world (space, ecosystem, universe: pick one) ""currencies"" is dead, passé, OBE… You get the idea.  Two questions logically arise: First, why is the term dead and, second, if it's dead, what should replace it?  As to the first, that's easy. There are two problems with applying the phrase ""cryptocurrency"" to what's going on in the space traditionally known by that name. First, the ""coins"" are acting less and less like coins and more and more like something else, perhaps equities.  In fact, for my fund, we divide the cryptocurrency space into ""blue chips,"" ""large caps,"" ""mid caps,"" ""small caps,"" ""pennies,"" (""penny coins"" seemed redundant) and ""NLT"" (""no longer traded"").  (Now, before you think I am trying to tout my fund, please realize that we decided to name it ""Crypto Asset Fund"" for the same reasons as those I'm citing here. For the record, my prior fund was indeed called the ""Crypto Currency Fund"" – so we are following the same evolution as the crypto ecosystem itself.)  Related to this shift is the fact that, when bitcoin was effectively the only game in town, aficionados touted it as a ""dollar replacement"", or at least a supplement – but the target was clearly displacing, to one degree or another, fiat currencies. Now, however, with the emphasis on blockchain, ethereum contracts, Ripple bank transfers, etc, etc, cryptocurrencies are becoming more a transaction enabler than the transaction itself. Their use as currencies, per se, is clearly decreasing.  So, cryptocurrencies are rapidly migrating away from being a medium of exchange (one of – probably the most critical of – the purposes of a ""currency"") into enablers of exchanges.  ICOs, tokens, tethers, exchange lending, the (slowly) growing crypto-derivatives market: all reinforce the strong secular shift of cryptocurrencies to crypto ""assets.""  What are they?  Which leads us directly to the second question: What should we call all this stuff?  We have voted with our pens and opted for ""assets"" – a nice, all-encompassing fiat word that is sufficiently vague to cover just about everything that might happen in the crypto space.  Why does this matter? Because perception is reality. If we want to attract more investors and users to the crypto universe, then we need those investors to quickly and easily understand what the space offers. Mislabeling (or, at least, too narrowly labeling) the space doesn't help. The name also inevitably affects how those of us already in the space view it, and ourselves, as well.  Labels matter.  A real-life example: CNBC asked me to appear live on Capital Connection out of Singapore (the interview took place and was broadcast July 5) and to recommend ""three cryptocurrencies"". I declined to do so, countering with three much more varied investments in the crypto space: one lower risk (whatever that might mean), one moderate risk and one higher risk.  The first is lending (fixed income), the second is a coin (equities) and the third is an ICO (IPO or alts). The italicized terms are the fiat equivalent of these three investments, which, by no coincidence, cover the three ""legs"" of the typical fiat investment ""stool.""  So, let’s move to a much more accurate characterization of the space, ecosystem, universe, whatever (do I sense another opinion piece in the offing?) and call the sector (!) we’re working in ""crypto assets"" or even just ""crypto"", shall we?  I'd argue it makes much more sense.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

42400120,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc22UI,1499386563,CFTC Formally Registers New Cryptocurrency Swap Execution Facility,"The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has granted blockchain startup LedgerX its formal registration as a swap execution facility (SEF), making it the second company ever to be granted the ability to trade digital currency derivatives.  While a notable milestone, it's the latest in a long process for LedgerX that is still far from over. Still pending approval is the final regulatory milestone to launching what could end up being the first cryptocurrency options firm licensed by the CFTC to do business in any number of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ether.  LedgerX CEO Paul Chou told CoinDesk:  ""We are pleased to have received full registration as a SEF from the CFTC for the trading of digital currency derivatives.""  Founded in 2013, LedgerX first received a temporary approval to operate as an SEF in 2015, but this latest development makes that decision final. With today's registration, LedgerX is now required to comply with provisions set forth in the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and other regulations specific to the CFTC.  New Jersey-based Tera-Exchange was registered as an SEF last year.  As part of the New York-based startup's push to become the first derivatives clearing organization (DCO) registered to trade cryptocurrencies, the firm earlier this year raised $11.4m led by investors Miami International Holdings and Huiyin Blockchain Venture Investments.  As a result of that capital, Chou believes LedgerX is on the cusp of creating a cryptocurrency options market that could increase the number of institutional investors able to invest in the asset class and help stabilize the price of the currency by enabling a more reliable hedges.  ""We look forward to working with the CFTC on finalizing the DCO registration,"" he said.  Editor's Note: This article has been amended to show that Tera Excahnge was registered as an SEF last year.
