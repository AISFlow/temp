42379358,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Z6L,1490650313,"Bitcoin Rebounds From Two-Month Low to Top $1,000","After falling to their lowest level in more than two months this weekend, bitcoin prices breached $1,000 again today.  Overall, the digital currency rose as much as 7.5% during the session, climbing from a low of $958.77 to as much as $1,030.78, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). At the time of the report, bitcoin was trading at $1,023.95.  For bitcoin, the turnaround followed its decline to as little as $891.51 on 25th March, its lowest average price since 25th January, BPI figures show.  Notably, the figure was nearly 50% below the all-time high of more than $1,300 that the cryptocurrency reached earlier this month, then fueled by anticipation for the SEC's ruling on a proposed bitcoin ETF.  When explaining bitcoin's recent price moves, most analysts pointed to the the cryptocurrency's ongoing technical in-fighting as reason for the volatility.  Should the bitcoin network undergo a hard fork, it could potentially split into two separate blockchains (each with their own distinct tokens), prompting concerns among less tech-savvy investors.  Such an event could prove highly bearish for the price of both bitcoin tokens, analysts have warned. Investor and Civic CEO Vinny Lingham, in particular, has emphasized the sharp declines bitcoin could suffer following a hard fork.  Concerns about the growing popularity of Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative software implementation and developer group that could push the move helped bring about the plunge, according to Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged digital currency trading platform Whaleclub.  He told CoinDesk:  ""As Bitcoin Unlimited dominated social media conversation and the odds of a hard fork rose, BTC/USD price plummeted.""  Harry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, took a different approach by looking at market dynamics.  He reasons that smart money simply took advantage of this market sentiment, as traders either caught the bounce and sold or shorted the currency pair.  Still, the markets continue to be sharply volatile amid such moves, developments that could continue to stoke fears among casual bitcoin holders and users.  Such choppy waters, those surveyed suggested, could become the norm should bitcoin's scaling uncertainty continue.

In a move that follows its unveiling of an 'instant buy' option for UAE customers this February, BitOasis is now making the offering available to five additional countries: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.  Users in these countries can now buy bitcoin with credit cards in amounts up to $AED2,000 (or about $550 at press time) each week, though CEO Ola Doudin said that the startup intends to raise those limits after an initial trial period.  Doudin said that the move comes amid a growing interest in the region, adding:  ""We're trying to make it as easy and quick as possible for people to use bitcoin. We're looking forward to opening up this service to other countries as well.""  The announcement comes amid a change in services at BitOasis, a long-time brokerage service that began testing an exchange offering last year.

42379345,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Yoj,1490629307,Beijing City Regulator Calls For Blockchain Standards,"An official with Beijing's municipal government is calling for the country to adopt a ""standard"" approach to blockchain development.  According to a speech published by Sina Finance, Huo Xuewen, secretary of Beijing's Municipal Bureau of Finance (a group that sets the city's economic strategy), invoked the need for ""healthy"" progress in the blockchain industry during a fintech event last week.  In his speech, Xuewen outlined popular use cases for blockchain (including payments, credit and trading), and called for blockchain standardization as a means to make development easier. This, he says, can solve problems and stymie any potential illegal financial activities.  While Xuewen's remarks focused on the tech more broadly, he did identify risk areas including P2P loans denominated in digital currency and pyramid schemes.  The comments come months after China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, asserted itself more directly in the supervision of the domestic bitcoin exchange space. Those efforts led to a shift in policy at China's ""Big Three"" bitcoin exchanges, sparking a withdrawal freeze amid regulator-mandated updates to anti-money laundering processes.  And though Xuewen didn't address the PBoC's bitcoin activities, he did highlight its work on a digital currency system, utilizing a distributed ledger. Initial trials, which occurred last year, are said to have involved Chinese financial institutions including WeBank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

42379334,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87VoX,1490625034,European Commission Proposes Blockchain RegTech Pilot,"The executive branch of the European Union wants to create a blockchain proof-of-concept focused on regulation.  According to a draft communication from the European Commission addressed to parties including the European Parliament and the European Central Bank, the pilot would center on improving knowledge and awareness of the technology among the EU's regulatory community.  In the draft communication, dated 23rd March, the Commission said it is launching a public consultation effort on financial technology more broadly, one that is seeking input on how it can improve market efficiency and accessibility.  It's in this light, according to the draft, that the pilot is being proposed.  The Commission writes:  ""This work will also benefit from specific funding from the European Parliament for a pilot project aimed at reinforcing the capacity and technical expertise of national regulators with regard to distributed ledger technology.""  That the commission would advance pilot projects is perhaps unsurprising. In mid-February, the Commission said that it was already undertaking such trials, including one that addresses public-sector applications.  Such work coincides with examinations that have considered extending limits on cash purchases to digital currencies, as well as proposals to more tightly regulate certain business applications of the technology.

42379332,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Vfj,1490619627,A Short Guide to Bitcoin Forks,"If you have been paying attention to bitcoin at all lately, you may have noticed a lot of talk going on about 'forks'.  Not like the kind you would find on a table, on a blockchain, a fork is a technical event that occurs because diverse participants need to agree on common rules.  At its most basic, a fork is what happens when a blockchain diverges into two potential paths forward — either with regard to a network’s transaction history or a new rule in deciding what makes a transaction valid.  As a result, those who use the blockchain have to show support for one choice over the other.  Yet, there are many different types of forks, and the science of studying them is still new. So far, we know some forks resolve on their own, but others, fueled by deep rifts in a community, can cause a network to permanently split, creating two blockchain histories — and two separate currencies.  Along with that, there has also been confusion about the various types of forks, how they get activated and the risks they pose.  To clarify, we've assembled quick rundown on how different forks work.  The basics  Before we get into the classifications, it's worth noting that bitcoin forks already occur quite regularly.  A byproduct of distributed consensus, forks happen anytime two miners find a block at nearly the same time. The ambiguity is resolved when subsequent blocks are added to one, making it the longest chain, while the other block gets ""orphaned"" (or abandoned) by the network.  But forks also can be willingly introduced to the network. This occurs when developers seek to change the rules the software uses to decide whether a transaction is valid or not.  When a block contains invalid transactions, that block is ignored by the network, and the miner who found that block loses out on a block reward. As such, miners generally want to mine only valid blocks and build on the longest chain.  Following are some of the more common forks and their traits.  Hard fork  What is it? A hard fork is a software upgrade that introduces a new rule to the network that isn't compatible with the older software. You can think of a hard fork as an expansion of the rules. (A new rule that allows block size to be 2MB instead of 1MB would require a hard fork).  What happens? Nodes that continue running the old version of the software will see the new transactions as invalid. So, to switch over to the new chain and to continue to mine valid blocks, all of the nodes in the network need to upgrade to the new rules.  What can go wrong? The problem comes when some sort of political impasse arises, and a portion of the community decides to stick by the old rules no matter what. The hash rate, or network computing power, behind the old chain is irrelevant. What matters is that its data (and ruleset) is still perceived to have value, meaning miners still want to mine a chain and developers still want to support it.  The ethereum DAO hard fork was a perfect case study of how a community can split over rules. Now, we have two blockchains using a variant of the software – ethereum and ethereum classic, both of which boast a different ethos and a different currency.  Soft fork  What is it? A soft fork, by contrast, is any change that's backward compatible. Say, instead of 1MB blocks, a new rule might only allow 500K blocks.  What happens? Non-upgraded nodes will still see the new transactions as valid (500k is less than 1MB in this example). However, if non-upgraded nodes continue to mine blocks, the blocks they mine will be rejected by the upgraded nodes. This is why soft forks need a majority of hash power in the network.  What can go wrong? When a soft fork is supported by only a minority of hash power in the network, it could become the shortest chain and get orphaned by the network. Or, it can act like a hard fork, and one chain can splinter off.  Soft forks have been the most commonly used option to upgrade the bitcoin blockchain so far because it's argued they present a lower risk of splitting the network. Past examples of successful soft forks include software upgrades like BIP 66 (which dealt with signature validation) and P2SH (which altered bitcoin's address formatting).  User-activated soft fork  What is it? A user-activated soft fork (UASF) is a controversial idea that explores how a blockchain might add an upgrade that is not directly supported by those who provide the network's hashing power.  The idea with UASF is that instead of waiting for a threshold of support from mining pools, the power to activate a soft fork goes to the exchanges, wallets and businesses who are running full nodes. (In bitcoin, a full node, even if it is not a mining node, is still responsible for validating blocks.)  What happens? The majority of major exchanges would need to publicly support the change before it could be written into a new version of code. After that, the new software (which has an activation point in the future) gets installed on nodes that want to participate in the soft fork.  What can go wrong? This method requires a much longer lead time to work than a hash-power-triggered soft fork. In fact, it's believed it may take as long as a year or more to write the code and get everyone ready.  Further, if the majority of miners end up not ‘falling in line’ and activating the new rules, they could use their overwhelming hash power to split the network.  Currently this idea is theoretical and has not been implemented.

42379330,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Vkl,1490616041,"IBM vs Microsoft: Two Tech Giants, Two Blockchain Visions","Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  In a match reminiscent of the recent final of the Australian Open, in which two of the oldest top tennis players on the circuit competed for the title, two other old-timers are showing younger competitors that experience matters.  I’m talking about IBM and Microsoft, and the race to build a business-friendly blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform.  In the business world, unlike tennis, there can be more than one winner. And it may be rash to assume that the old market leaders will stay ahead of the pack, especially in a field so new. However, recent moves by the two companies to shore up their cloud offering with enterprise blockchain applications underline their market clout and privileged access to big clients.  IBM recently unveiled the first commercial application of IBM Blockchain, a suite of cloud services to help clients create and manage blockchain networks.  Meanwhile, Microsoft has been adding BaaS modules to Azure, its cloud-computing platform, since 2015, making them available to all users last year.  Both systems seem similar on the surface: modular, in the cloud, based on open-source code, with massive ecosystems. However, lift the hood and you find a significant difference.  While Microsoft’s BaaS is designed to work with a range of protocols, it has shown a preference for the ethereum blockchain, and soft-launched the service at an ethereum event in 2015.  Most of its recent partnership announcements are with startups that use ethereum as their base, and Microsoft is a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), recently set up to explore business adaptations of the public blockchain.  IBM, on the other hand, has so far largely stayed away from public blockchains. Its BaaS service is based on Hyperledger’s Fabric codebase, of which IBM wrote a large part.  The difference goes deeper, though. It’s not really about public vs private – after all, both Microsoft and IBM are developing private applications of open-source protocols.  Different strokes  The main difference is in the governance.  Ethereum is developed by the Ethereum Foundation, of which Microsoft is not a member. This is a risk factor in that the Foundation could decide to change the underlying code, without Microsoft’s input. (The EEA does not influence the ethereum codebase.)  Hyperledger's codebases are governed by a steering committee, of which IBM is a member, and an important one. (Microsoft is not a member of the Hyperledger consortium.) The committee could decide to make changes to Fabric, but not without IBM’s consent and contribution.  The level of interaction with the public of the two open-source alternatives is also different, and an added risk factor. A bug in ethereum is a public event. While there is no doubt that it would be quickly fixed, a failure could shake confidence in firms running on an ethereum-based system.  On the other hand, if Fabric were to encounter a problem, it would also be rapidly solved. But there’s a chance we would never know.  That said, the compelling arguments for development on a public blockchain include the broad developer base and the potential for interoperability. Many have argued that public blockchain adaptations will win for these reasons.  As in a tense tennis tournament, the game is gripping, with each side playing professionally. Unlike a simple match, however, the winner will not be determined any time soon, if ever.  IBM and Microsoft have coexisted as IT leaders and competitors for decades, constantly adapting to new strategies and opportunities. In a fluid field based on a new technology, agility is important. But so is size and access to the target market.  In blockchain terms, the game has just begun.

42379341,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Vw5,1490612414,Why Mizuho Believes Bitcoin Still Has a Future in Banking,"Japanese banking giant Mizuho Financial Group is nearing completion of a pilot project that utilizes the bitcoin blockchain for securities transfer.  First announced last year as a proof of concept (PoC) built with bitcoin's open asset protocol, the project is now approaching a possible launch, CoinDesk has learned.  While details remain under close protection, the head of Mizuho's Incubation Project, Ikuma Ueno, explains that the experiment to transfer securities between banks has picked up steam since the company invested in Japan's largest bitcoin exchange, bitFlyer, earlier this year.  Ueno positioned the effort to use the permissionless bitcoin blockchain within the bank's larger push to understand how all blockchains and distributed ledger systems, including Corda, Fabric and Ripple, can better serve its customers.  Ueno told CoinDesk:  ""We're not just drilling down to consortia types or private types. We have to look at the public blockchain as well. This investment is for us to engage with the public blockchain.""  Originally announced last March, the bitcoin PoC effort saw Mizuho pair with Japanese IT giant Fujitsu to build a streamlined financial system that could reduce risks related to securities price fluctuations and the solvency of counterparties. Bitcoin's open asset protocol (OAP) is designed for deploying non-currency assets on the public blockchain.  The work is notable in that it coincides with a rise in skepticism among some that only permissioned distributed ledgers can be compliant with financial regulations.  Japanese financial institutions have recently taken a lead in this push into public blockchains, with foreign exchange players expected to launch cryptocurrency products later this year.  Ueno said of the bitFlyer investment: ""Capital gains is one of the objectives. But the other is to get in touch with the public blockchain.""  Citing a non-disclosure agreement, BitFlyer CEO Yuzo Cano declined to comment further on the work.  Big on blockchain  Still, Mizuho's bitcoin project is just one of at least three 'underground' projects currently being developed by its Incubation Team.  In total, Ueno says there are now 10 projects at various stages of development using Ripple, Hyperledger's open-source Fabric platform and R3's Corda platform.  Of the blockchain projects Ueno was allowed to discuss, he said work is being done in custody, syndicated loans, trade finance, KYC and AML and cross-border payments. The most advanced of these projects appears to be Mizuho’s work with Ripple to connect its global branches: 400 of which are in Japan and about 80 of which are elsewhere around the world.  The project was initially delayed when Mizuho learned the four branches it selected for the project in Europe, Asia, the US and Europe required additional training on Ripple's tech. (Details about the test are expected in April.)  While Ueno confirmed the Ripple system is providing real-time payments, he added there have been legal and regulatory difficulties to leveraging the technology.  ""That’s something we have to overcome to implement,"" he said.  Another project using Fabric to let customers send one another cash was described more as experimental.  ""We haven't executed that to being a product yet,"" he said.  Behind the blockchain veil  In addition to blockchain, Mizuho's Incubation Project Team researches other experimental fintech applications built using AI, cloud storage and more.  From its founding in July 2015, when Ueno was the first and only team member, the group has grown to 30 employees managing more than 80 projects, according to the strategist's own count.  In the early days of his internal work, Ueno says much of the team’s time was dedicated to educating Mizuho's employees.  As the bank’s internal understanding has matured, however, the work has shifted to focus on building relationships between the technicians and the bankers in the various departments to help conceive ways blockchain could make their tasks easier.  ""This technology is like the internet,"" said Ueno. ""It can be used in any cases. That was the incentive of me getting deep in this technology.""  In addition to being a member of R3, Mizuho was one of 42 local and regional banks in Japan to join the Japan Bank Consortium co-launched by Ripple and SBI Holdings. So far, though, Mizuho has opted not to formally join either of the platform agnostic blockchain consortia aimed specifically at Japan.  Instead of working with BCCC or JBA, Ueno says Mizuho participates in more informal 'alliances' with Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo and others.  He concluded:  ""We do a lot of round-table discussions, we bring out our own projects to that table and discuss the platform, the technology, and how this can replace the current legacy system.""
