Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin’s Brooklyn-based venture studio is looking to raise $200 million from external investors, The Information reported Monday, at a valuation of $1 billion.  The Information reports that ConsenSys is pitching Chinese investors with materials claiming the company aims to earn $50 million in revenue this year, primarily from contracts with enterprise and government clients. Last December, the Brazilian National Social Development Bank confirmed to CoinDesk it was in talks with ConsenSys.  ConsenSys was previously supported by Lubin’s personal fortune and employed up to 1,200 people in 2018. When the price of ethereum plummeted after the 2017 token boom fizzled, ConsenSys laid off 13 percent of its staff. Following a late-2018 re-organization dubbed “ConsenSys 2.0,” it became clear that partnerships with traditional, external investors were a priority.  Several former staffers told CoinDesk in January 2019 that more cuts were on the horizon.  The Information now reports that ConsenSys brought in “just $21 million in revenue in 2018.” It’s unclear how that income relates to the various startups under the ConsenSys umbrella. Several projects are seeking to raise capital on their own as independent startups, multiple sources tell CoinDesk.  A ConsenSys spokesperson declined to comment.

42430402,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPnh,1555344027,'Satoshi's Treasure' Is a Global Puzzle With a $1 Million Bitcoin Prize,"A new alternate reality game called Satoshi’s Treasure has hidden the keys to $1 million worth of bitcoin across the globe, forcing players to collaborate and improvise.  “A lot of people have joked we’re doing the bitcoin version of Ready Player One,” Primitive Ventures co-founder Eric Meltzer, the game’s co-creator, told CoinDesk. “The game is going to have a leaderboard to show which teams have the most keys.”  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the keys to this bitcoin wallet were divided into 1,000 fragments, requiring a minimum of 400 key fragments to move the funds. Players can collect and unravel clues any way they want, even selling leads if they choose. Meltzer himself donated a significant portion of the bitcoin loot, with unnamed angel investors capping it off.  The game itself has no rules.  “Forget about the rules, just go goddamn play,” Meltzer said, adding that so far more than 6,000 people have signed up for the game’s mailing list for key updates.  Meltzer enlisted the help of zcash co-creator Ian Miers and 18 other contributors so that no single person knows the schedule or location of all the clues or keys. The logic puzzles are sprinkled across the internet and sometimes printed and pasted in the real world as well.  “There are some clues that are very scavenger hunt-y, and clues where it’s purely logic puzzles or math problems,” Meltzer said, adding that the end result will numerically yield a key fragment.  The first clue, released yesterday, seems to point users in the direction of the Blockstream satellite, which broadcasts data related to bitcoin.  There are plans to eventually launch an app to help players keep track of clues and updates, but it will not be required to play. The app will also be a conduit for sponsorship and partnerships with external brands.  “There is a company, basically so that we can pay people’s salaries,” Meltzer said. “Part of the meta game that I think people are going to like is trying to figure out who is behind this.”  That being said, Meltzer is just a figurehead. There is no single person, not even a member of the tropical island–based company (which island is a secret), who knows how the game will play out.  “When the winning team wins they do so by taking the bitcoin and we have nothing to do with this. We’re not giving the prize,” Meltzer said. “There are so many unknowns in this game that we kind of just want to see what happens.”  Teen gamers  One prospective player, 15-year-old German developer Malte Lauterbach, told CoinDesk games like Satoshi’s Treasure offer a teen-friendly way for his friends to learn about cryptocurrency.  “Earning bitcoin through games is a pretty cool idea,” Lauterbach said, adding his parents don’t like the idea of him getting involved with speculative trading. “It’s pretty cool having diverse teams with players all over the world.”  Lauterbach isn’t the only teen interested in Satoshi’s Treasure as a way to earn bitcoin without needing to own a bank account.  “A lot of [players] are young, it skews very young so far,” Meltzer said. ""I don’t think it will stay that way.""  Lauterbach first heard about Satoshi’s Treasure through another gaming community he’s a part of. He and two teen friends from India and the U.S. are building an educational game about cryptocurrency markets on the developer tools site Repl.it, which is offering one bitcoin as the prize for the best money-themed game submission.  Amjad Masad, CEO of the developer tools startup behind Repl.it, told CoinDesk:  “A year ago we started noticing suspicious activity on our platform, and we found that someone built a huge mining infrastructure to mine bitcoin. We looked into it and found it was this 13-year-old kid. … There’s a huge interest in crypto from young developers.”  As for Satoshi’s Treasure, Lauterbach loves the idea of collaborating with people around the world while learning more about bitcoin.  Prize money merely offers an enticing twist.  “Instead of something like World of Warcraft gold, I could use bitcoin to buy real stuff instead,” Lauterbach said.

The exchange announced Monday that it would be delisting all BSV trading pairs on April 22, just days after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) threatened to do so if Wright did not cease attacks on Twitter users who are claiming he is not Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.  In Binance's announcement, the exchange says ""we periodically review each digital asset we list to ensure that it continues to meet the high level of standard we expect,"" citing a number of factors it weighs.  These include the commitment of a team to the project, the level and quality of its development activity, its network and smart contract stability, the level of public communication, responsiveness to periodic due diligence requests, evidence of unethical or fraudulent conduct and its contribution to the crypto ecosystem.  However, it is likely that BSV is being deleted at least in part due to Wright's attacks on Twitter user hodlonaut (who started the Lightning Network ""torch"") and other individuals. Specifically, Wright placed a bounty on hodlonaut's identity after the latter claimed Wright is not Satoshi. CZ said Binance would delist BSV if Wright continued these attacks.  Wright has for the last several years claimed he is the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, but his evidence for this claim has been widely disputed.  In a series of follow-up tweets, CZ said ""Craig Wright is a fraud,"" that ""the real Satoshi can digitally sign any message to prove it,"" and that doing so would be simple.  Wright has sent legal cease-and-desist letters to other individuals claiming he is not Satoshi, including Peter McCormack, the host of the ""What Bitcoin Did"" podcast.  Binance will continue to support BSV withdrawals until July 22.  Later Monday, ShapeShift CEO and longtime crypto entrepreneur Erik Voorhees announced that his crypto-to-crypto exchange would also delist bitcoin SV, for the same reasons. ""We stand with Binance and CZ's sentiments,"" Voorhees tweeted. BSV will be removed from ShapeShift in 48 hours, he said.  Another influential exchange, San Francisco-based Kraken, indicated it is at least considering delisting BSV, asking Twitter users in a poll whether it should do so.

42402801,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcyLs,1555336846,LedgerX Reveals Bid to Beat Bakkt to Physical Bitcoin Futures Launch,"Cryptocurrency derivatives provider LedgerX plans to become the first U.S. firm to offer physically settled bitcoin futures contracts.  The company announced Monday that it has filed for a designated contract market (DCM) license, which would allow LedgerX to offer physically-settled bitcoin futures products to its customers. Unlike the cash-settled bitcoin futures offered by CME Group (and previously, Cboe), customers would receive the actual bitcoin underlying a contract after it expires, rather than the U.S. dollar equivalent.  And perhaps more notably, LedgerX can target retail investors with its new offering, said Juthica Chou, who serves as both chief risk and operating officer at LedgerX.  ""We’ll be able to service customers of any size, we won’t be restricted to [institutional clients],"" Chou told CoinDesk.  Once approved, LedgerX will offer bitcoin, bitcoin options and bitcoin futures to retail customers through a new platform, dubbed Omni.  Omni, built on LedgerX's existing infrastructure, will act as the provider for both custody and trading services. LedgerX's original platform first received regulatory approval to launch in July 2017, though the platform itself only went live later that year.  The new platform will also utilize LedgerX's existing institutional liquidity pool to ""offer retail customers a top tier experience from day one,"" Chou said.  Launching a retail platform with futures offerings has ""always been our plan,"" Chou said. The company first began offering physically-settled derivatives products in October 2017, trading $1 million in its first week.  ""Once the platform had proved stable and we got an operational cadence, we filed for a license with the CFTC,"" Chou said, adding:  ""For us this is a philosophically important move because bitcoin is available to everyone and we … really wanted to make our derivatives products available to all investors as well.""  Regulatory roadmap  The company filed for a license to offer futures contracts in November 2018, and has been engaged in a ""constructive dialogue"" with the CFTC since, Chou said. However, she could not comment on a timeline for when the CFTC might approve LedgerX's application, or on what sort of reception the firm is expecting from customers.  The CFTC has already granted LedgerX two licenses, allowing the firm to act as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF), which is the company's exchange platform, and a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO), which is the clearinghouse.  LedgerX's DCM application is therefore just an additional license on top of its existing permissions. Operationally, the company is already set up to provide futures services, according to Chou.  She continued:  ""We’re custodying [bitcoin] in the same way that we currently do, we’ve obviously been live and operational for more than a year and a half, and we have a license from the CFTC, the DCO license, that allows us to custody bitcoin.""  Since its launch, LedgerX has provided institutions with regulated physically-settled bitcoin swaps and options products, and claims some 200 different firms as customers.  While CME and Cboe both began offering cash-settled bitcoin futures in December 2017, no company has launched a physically-settled equivalent to date – though that's not for lack of trying.  Several major firms plan to launch physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts, including Bakkt, the firm built by New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange; Seed CX, the crypto exchange backed by Bain Capital Ventures; and ErisX, a startup backed by brokerage TD Ameritrade.  However, all of these firms, too, are awaiting their own regulatory approvals, giving LedgerX a shot at being the first to go live with an actual product.  ""This is a natural evolution and it stems from the fact that we’ve been operating a physically settled market for more than a year and a half so it’s been a natural [extension],"" Chou said. ""We're always excited to be the first.""

While a trial effort looking at using tokenized equity to modernize the financial markets, the share offering involved real cash and was issued on the LSEG's Turquoise equity trading platform.  20|30 sets out to tokenize equity and other securities using distributed ledger technology. The firm was notably part of the fourth cohort of the UK Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) regulatory sandbox, announced last July.  As CoinDesk reported, LSEG and the FCA previously said they were working with 20|30 and distributed ledger technology startup Nivaura toward demonstrating for the first time that equity in a U.K. company can be tokenized and issued within a fully compliant custody, clearing and settlement system. With today's news, the first stage of that plan looks to have been successfully carried out.  The project set out to explore ""tools to help companies raise capital in a more efficient and streamlined way,” said the LSEG.  After the primary issuance of an equity token based on ethereum, “the next step will be to offer secondary transfers. Then we can work our way up the ‘capital stack’ to reinvent private equity and, public markets,” Tomer Sofinzon, co-founder of 20|30, told the Financial Times at the time.  Speaking to CoinDesk about the project in July, Dr. Avtar Sehra, CEO and chief product architect at Nivaura, said: “Someone can use our technology to do all the legal documentation, tokenize these assets and execute them. LSEG has then been forward-thinking enough to help get these orders out to the existing market.”  Edit (09:45 UTC, April 17, 2019): Updated to clarify that the London Stock Exchange participation was a collaboration using a test environment.

42402819,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcyVi,1555327841,Three Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Rally Has Stalled,"View  Extremely overbought conditions and other factors seem to have stalled bitcoin's promising price rally.  Acceptance below $4,912 would validate signs of indecision on the weekly chart (doji candle) and open the doors for a deeper drop to $4,527 (200-day moving average).  A break above last week’s high of $5,347 would invalidate the weekly chart doji candle, although an immediate rally to $6,000 looks unlikely with the daily RSI still flashing overbought conditions.  Bitcoin's recent price rally has stalled and signs of indecision are evident in the market just a week after a big bullish breakout.  The leading cryptocurrency closed at $5,190 on April 7, confirming an upside break of a bearish channel – the same pattern that paved the way for a bull market in 2015.  So far, however, the follow through to that bearish-to-bullish trend change has been anything but bullish.  The cryptocurrency witnessed two-way business last week, clocking a high and low of $5,347 and $4,912 before closing almost flat at $5,162.  So, the rally looks to have stalled due to the following three factors:  Overbought conditions  Bitcoin's 14-day relative strength index (RSI), a widely followed technical indicator, jumped above 70.00 on April 2, signaling overbought conditions as the price jumped over 18 percent to highs above $5,000.  With the price climbing further to a 4.5-month high of $5,345, the RSI rose to near 90 levels, the highest since December 2017.  An extreme overbought reading is considered a sign the rally is overdone and is usually followed by a reaction – a price pullback or a consolidation, as is the case currently with bitcoin.  Prices then made numerous failed attempts to convincingly scale $5,300 in the eight days before a drop to $4,912 on April 12.  Bearish volume divergence  Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume across all cryptocurrency exchanges, as calculated by CoinMarketCap, doubled to $21 billion on April 2, validating the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the break above the key resistance of $4,236 and the rally to $5,000.  As the cryptocurrency extended gains further to a fresh 4.5-month high of $5,347 on April 8, though, trading volumes tapered off to $17 billion, reinforcing the overstretched conditions reported by the 14-day RSI.  Hence, the pullback to $4,912 (Friday's low) was not surprising. Prices have recovered by more than $200 over the weekend, but volumes are down further, to $10 billion. So, the recovery could be short-lived.  Forcing out weak hands before building breakout  The financial markets often test buyers' resolve by revisiting former resistance-turned-support before building on a major bullish breakout. And that seems to be the case here.  For instance, BTC cleared the 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle on Feb. 19. The newfound support, however, was put to test multiple times in the 10 days to March 4 before a sustained move higher.  On similar lines, prices fell back below the psychological support of $5,000 last Friday and may drop even further to the 200-day MA, currently at $4,527, as the average is widely considered a barometer of a bullish/bearish trend.  The case for BTC shaking out weak holders with a drop to the 200-day MA looks stronger if support a $4,912 is breached.  View  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, BTC created a doji candle on Sunday, which is widely considered a sign of indecisive market. Interestingly, the doji appeared following a high-volume falling channel breakout. So, it could be considered a sign of bullish exhaustion.  Acceptance below $4,912 – the low of the doji – would confirm buyer exhaustion, opening the doors for a deeper pullback to $4,527 (200-day MA).  4-hour chart  On the 4-hour chart, BTC could be creating the right shoulder of a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal pattern.  A break below the neckline support at $4,988 would create room for a drop to $4,629 (target as per the measured move method).  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $5,142 on Bitstamp, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

According to a report in Business Today on Sunday, the NPCI has said it plans to develop a “resilient, real time and highly scalable” blockchain solution using open-source technology. The organization has already issued an Expression of Interest (EoI), calling for entities to bid to develop a blockchain solution for the payments space.  The NPCI is a non-profit organization supported by India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Indian Banks’ Association. It is promoted by 10 banks, including the State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and HSBC, and has 56 banks as shareholders as of 2016.  While the status of public cryptocurrencies in India is currently a gray area, the central bank has indicated it is researching how to introduce a rupee-backed central bank digital currency into its monetary policy in a bid to reduce its hefty annual bill for minting physical cash.  The nation is also enthusiastic about blockchain technology. Last year, the National Institution for Transforming India (called NITI Aayog), a government think-tank, was working on a blockchain solution aimed to combat the country’s roaring counterfeit drugs trade.  Further, India’s Union Cabinet – an executive decision-making body composed of senior government officials and led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi – said it would allow the nation’s Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank) to conduct research on blockchain technology in partnership with banks in the BRICS economic bloc.

The two institutions said that the coin would have no monetary value and would not be made openly available, the Financial Times reported Saturday. To support the token, the IMF and the World Bank have also launched a private blockchain network.  The project is aimed to build “a strong knowledge base” around blockchain technology among staff at the organizations.  The IMF said in the report:  “The development of crypto-assets and distributed ledger technology is evolving rapidly, as is the amount of information (both neutral and vested) surrounding it. This is forcing central banks, regulators and financial institutions to recognize a growing knowledge gap between the legislators, policymakers, economists and the technology.”  Also launched as part of the token project is a Learning Coin app, allowing users to share content like blogs, research, videos and presentations. Staff at the organizations will also be able to “earn” coins for achieving certain educational milestones.  While the token has no real-world value, the developers are reportedly testing how staff can redeem it for rewards.  The news comes five months after IMF chief Christine Lagarde encouraged the exploration of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the light of decreasing demand for cash and rising preference for digital money. And, in 2017, the then-president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, said that the technology is “something everyone is excited about,” while he was more cautious about cryptocurrencies.  Last summer, the World Bank moved to use blockchain for a bond settlement that raised $81 million.

42402814,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcyEz,1555315234,ING Bank Is Bringing Bitcoin 'Bulletproofs' to Private Blockchains,"ING’s blockchain team is testing a privacy technology called ""bulletproofs,"" the latest in a series of seemingly unlikely cypherpunk experiments at the Netherlands-based global bank.  Developed and refined by hardcore cryptographers at Stanford University, University College London and startup Blockstream, bulletproofs are designed to hide the amounts being transferred in bitcoin transactions, which are normally visible to anyone. But banks have privacy concerns about blockchains too, since they don’t want to expose competitive or sensitive client data to rivals.  One early solution was zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a way of proving possession of a secret without revealing the secret itself. Over the past year or so, ING has explored ZKP variants such as range proofs (where a hidden number is proven to be within a certain range) and zero-knowledge set membership (where alphanumeric data can be validated within a specified set).  But ZKPs eat up a lot of computation and so potentially slow down a blockchain. Now, ING sees bulletproofs as a much more efficient, therefore applicable, version of these proofs.  The bank found bulletproofs turn out to be “roughly ten times faster than other range proofs, for a single range proof,” said Mariana Gomez de la Villa, global head of ING’s blockchain program.  And when aggregated together these proving schemes gain efficiency. Gomez de la Villa gave the example of a cryptocurrency exchange using range proofs to show it has enough funds to pay all its clients if they want to withdraw their money at the same time.  In this case, “bulletproofs would allow a solution that is 300 times more efficient than other alternative range proofs,” she said.  While a lot of this stuff is academic, ING is now looking to where it can apply the tech. Potential uses touch on the need to obey the Europe Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); for instance, ZK set membership can prove an individual belongs to a given EU member state without disclosing any other information about their identity.  Meanwhile, academics and cryptocurrency scientists seem encouraged, if a little bemused. Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra told CoinDesk via email:  ""When we developed bulletproofs in 2017, we did not expect such an uptake. We're very excited and proud whenever we see the technology being applied to real world problems, if a little surprised its found a use-case in traditional banking!""  Trade and trolls  ING is also looking at applying ZKPs to the testing out of trade finance blockchains, an innovation which in turn looks ahead to a world of blockchain interoperability, said Gomez de la Villa.  “We are setting up a whole [ZKP] shop to help developers find these use cases and are in contact with some of our customers to ensure they have a good understanding of how they can leverage these open source projects that we have,” she said.  To illustrate how the bank’s blockchain projects might apply ZKPs, Gomez de la Villa said imagine tracking a commodity from its origin and keeping the certificate of origin throughout the supply chain but without disclosing the supplier, price or the quality of the commodity.  Looking ahead, this could involve that commodity touching several distributed ledger networks (interoperability is something ING is thinking about now, given the bank has close ties with R3, ethereum-based oil and gas consortium Komgo, and recently IBM’s MineHub on Hyperledger Fabric).  “We need to ensure that the specific properties of the commodity worth passing along the chain in terms of semantic (meaning and interpretation of the fields) and the syntactic (format and fields) remain intact,” said Gomez de la Villa, “and at the same time being able to hide the ones that do not need to be passed on along the value chain but still are useful to record for other purposes.”  Proving the bank has reached the highest levels in this field, ING takes part in the annual ZKProof Workshop alongside the team behind cryptocurrency zcash, Blockstream and QEDIT. The bank also said it compares notes with the likes of JPMorgan, another enterprise consumer of zero-knowledge cryptography, to help make the tech a reality for clients.  Gomez de la Villa said:  “Everybody helps each other, everybody bounces stuff with each other and the important thing is not what you have learned but it's more like how do you apply those learnings.”  But not everybody likes the idea of a bank getting involved with technology seen as the reserve of privacy-driven libertarians for use on public blockchains. Gomez de la Villa said her social media has been trolled by certain people claiming the bank “just copy and pasted” the technology.  “There are people that are quite anarchist about it and they are obviously 100% pro-bitcoin and they believe that indeed they are doing all this to circumvent financial institutions,” she said.  However, Gomez de la Villa is unfazed by her trolls, concluding:  “I like it. Cause that means that it matters.”  Enigma decryption pic: Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/15/ing-bank-is-bringing-bitcoin-bulletproofs-to-private-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00b97117ec055a5d2ef4229c6b4a7ec92f0c3592-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402805,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcyRm,1555300843,The Bigger Picture Behind Bitcoin's Latest Price Rebound,"Bitcoin’s out-of-the-blue bounce over the $5,000 mark this month has prompted some predictable pontificating from price-obsessed people within and outside the cryptocurrency community.  Investors who are long-cryptocurrencies have gleefully pronounced that the Crypto Winter, which began when bitcoin’s bubble burst at the end of 2017, is now mercifully over. The most optimistic are forecasting a rerun of bitcoin’s fall 2015 bounce from its prior post-bubble collapse, which sent it not only back above its 2013 high of $1,150 but all the way to a December 2017 peak of $19,500.  At the same time, bitcoin skeptics have pointed to the seeming lack of fundamental news behind the price rise and declared it meaningless. Typical of the genre, Matt Novak at Gizmodo penned an angry screed titled ""Bitcoin Surges 15% Overnight Because Nobody Learned Their Lesson After the Last Crash.""  One of Novak’s insights: ""To be clear, bitcoin is absolutely worthless by any real measure. It’s fake money that’s about as practical to use in the real world as Monopoly bills.""  Readers won’t be surprised to hear that I disagree with Novak’s simplistic rant. But I’m also turned off by the knee-jerk cheerleading from crypto traders whenever bitcoin’s price bounces.  There's something fundamentally wrong with reducing the measure of bitcoin's worldwide importance to a price metric that’s denominated in a fiat currency that its advocates hope to replace. It pushes the debate into an inane all-or-nothing binary set of predictions: bitcoin is either going to zero or ""to the moon.""  What matters is that 10 years after an unidentified software engineer created it, this decentralized system for recording sequences of transactions continues to do its job, block after block, with no authority in charge, no user able to alter past transactions, and no person or entity able to shut it down.  The more this goes on, the more it reinforces the powerful vision behind bitcoin: a peer-to-peer, disintermediated system for exchanging value around the world. And in that context, we can also think of bitcoin the cryptocurrency – differentiated from bitcoin the system – as a unique, provably scarce digital asset that expresses the overall value in that vast potential.  Bitcoin is valuable because it exists  A point that's lost on critics like Novak is that the longer bitcoin simply survives – in the face of the $90 billion valuation that stands as a de facto bounty for hackers to try to take it down, compromise its security or corrupt it – the more its overall value is confirmed.  Bitcoin is progressively proving itself to be an unstoppable, digital system of global exchange, one that functions outside of the traditional national government-mandated system of currency and banking. That status is what gives bitcoin its value.  Of course, the global impact of the bitcoin value exchange system, and therefore its worth to humanity, will be significantly enhanced if adoption advances to a much wider scale and it is used frequently in the world’s transactions. And, yes, a great deal of development work is still needed if it is to ever reach that point.  (Some recent technological leaps such as the Lightning Network and the emergence of decentralized, non-custodial asset exchange technologies offer hope that this scaling challenge can be achieved, though nothing is guaranteed.)  However, widespread adoption in payments is not necessary for bitcoin to have value. To understand why that’s the case, it’s useful to think about gold, to which bitcoin is often compared.  The power of common belief  Similar to bitcoin, gold is a mutually agreed store of value that, for all intents and purposes, lies outside the control of nation-state governments and banks. It’s not widely used as a day-to-day currency, but it does enjoy a widespread, shared belief in its value.  Where does gold’s value come from? The answer is somewhat tautological: it comes from that same widely held belief, from a shared understanding in gold’s capacity to function as a depoliticized global system of exchange that’s free of manipulation. Sure, we tend to think of gold in terms of its material qualities: that it’s durable and that it’s shiny in a way that connotes beauty. But its lasting worth really derives from the more esoteric notion that human beings have for a long time deeply held a shared belief in its value.  That belief has turned gold into a system for protecting property, a system used through the centuries by refugees, dissidents and investors for moving and storing value and for hedging against lost spending power. That we now have a digital version of this concept, one that’s designed for the borderless, internet-shaped world of the 21st century, is a big deal.  When dealing with debates over bitcoin’s value, it’s also worth going a little way down the rabbit hole of thinking about what money actually is. Not everyone agrees on a definition, but I think it’s useful to think of money as a societally agreed system for storing and exchanging value. The system has to have certain properties for people to reach this agreement – it must fungible, durable, transferable, divisible, etc. – but it’s the agreement itself that gives it its value.  Here, too, is where many of bitcoin’s detractors get lost.  Fixating on the misplaced idea of money as a thing, they exclaim that bitcoin can’t have any value as it isn’t backed by anything. This, of course, also misses the fact that it is backed by the energy and other resources that miners spend to do the computational work needed to secure the bitcoin ledger.  But the bigger point is that bitcoin’s value, as with all forms of money, comes from the existence of a wide agreement in its potential use as a store of value and medium of exchange.  In bitcoin’s case, the agreement is arguably one that involves 35 million people, if Cambridge University’s latest survey of authenticated users is to be believed. This large level of participation is essentially why bitcoin holds a much greater value than the altcoins that are forks of its code.  So, this is why bitcoin at $5,000 is important, not because it’s a sign of that new investors are coming to push up its price again, but because it validates the core proposition of bitcoin’s resilience and promise.
