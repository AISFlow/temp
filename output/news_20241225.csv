38117855,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322722,1735169909,Dogecoin Price Rallies to $0.33 – Will the Triangle Pattern Spark a Rally?,"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price has rallied back to $0.33 after falling as low as the $0.26s last week, and is forming a triangle pattern that could soon be the catalyst for a bullish breakout. That means that a short-term pump for the Dogecoin price back to it recent highs in the $0.48 could be on the cards in the coming days. Of course, the 21 and 50DMAs in the $0.37-38 area could offer stiff resistance, given they also coincide with some recent lows. But good vibes are likely to continue into the year’s end. Why? Well, major cryptos are tentatively recovering from a Fed-induced sell-off last week on their more hawkish than expected interest rate projections . But most major cryptos remain well below their pre-hawkish Fed meeting levels, suggesting the scope for further recovery is there. And there are a lot of tailwinds to support the crypto market right now. That’s because we are on the cusp of entering a new golden age for crypto markets in the US, but also globally. The incoming Trump administration and Congress are likely to spur a significant acceleration in the adoption of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, not least admin hopes that they establish a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. JUST IN: VanEck predicts #Bitcoin will be worth $3 million and used as a global reserve asset by 2050. pic.twitter.com/TEsvd9S34L — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 28, 2024 The grounds are thus fertile for the emergence of a new meme coin/alt-coin season, of which we have already seen flashes of since Trump’s emphatic election victory. Dogecoin , the oldest and still biggest meme coin, would surely lead any future meme season. That’s even more the case given that Elon Musk’ s new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is set to be established under the Trump administration. Department of Government Efficiency pic.twitter.com/HFeHYNIkJN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 7, 2024 Musk’s new department aims to slash government fraud and waste, and will be hugely controversial and nearly constantly in the news. That all but guarantees that Dogecoin retains a leading portion of meme coin market “mind share”, guaranteeing continued market leadership. How High Will the Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Rally This Cycle? A recovery back to recent highs in the Dogecoin market is thus very likely in early 2025 as Trump returns to the White House. Bulls will be hoping for an eventual rally back to the 2021 record highs above $0.70, as well as a potential surge to $1.0 for the first time. However, might this be the end of the road for Dogecoin? Well, analysis of past Dogecoin cycles suggest the bulls need to be aiming bigger and higher, with this rally likely to far exceed where many expect. Dogecoin has been through three market cycles since its inception in 2014, and these cycles can offer clues about what could be in store for DOGE in 2025. When drawing a Fibonacci extension upwards from the prior bear market low to the prior bear market high, it can be seen that Dogecoin has always rallied well beyond the 4.236 Fibonacci level, exceeding this Fibonacci extension by over 10x during its 2021 rally. The 4.236 Fibonacci extension level from the 2022 bear market lows back to the 2021 highs suggests that Dogecoin should at least hit $3 per token this cycle. But as history has shown, Dogecoin has routinely blown well past this level. Given that context, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a $10 Dogecoin price this cycle. Of course, that would imply a multi-trillion-dollar market cap, which might be a bit much to ask. But Dogecoin could definitely 10x from current levels to reach a market cap in the $100s of billions, making it a strong candidate for best meme coin to buy now. Meme Coin Alternative With Massive Potential – Meme Index (MEMEX) For most investors, securing 10x gains is a best-case scenario. But in crypto, many degens are on the hunt for the next 100x project that will make them rich. One of the best ways to bag 100x gains is by getting into a new meme coin before it really takes off. One new meme coin that has caught the eyes of analysts at cryptonews.com is Meme Index (MEMEX) . Meme Index introduces the world’s first decentralized meme coin index, allowing investors to diversify across various meme coins through community governance. With the meme coin market cap reaching a whopping $137 billion in 2024, analysts suspect that demand for an innovative investment vehicle such as this could be very high. That’s certainly the case with Meme Index, which has already raised close to half a million dollars in MEMEX presale token sales. The project’s potential lies in its ability to offer different risk levels with indexes like Titan, Moonshot, Midcap, and Frenzy, catering to a broad investor base. Only a Chill Guy can handle the twists and turns of a Frenzy Index. pic.twitter.com/1QHv0IvF0i — Meme Index (@memecoin_index) December 17, 2024 Moreover, MEMEX holders can stake tokens for high APYs, encouraging long-term holding and potentially increasing token value. It should come as no surprise that flocks of experts have already come out to throw their support behind MEMEX . Michael Wrubel and Austin Hilton both recently hailed the project’s potential in YouTube videos to their more than 600,000 combined subscribers. Meme Index has already passed major audits from the likes of Coinsult and SOLIDProof and can be purchased with ETH, USDT or bank card.

38116758,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoin-this-must-watch-presale-is-making-splashes-in-crypto/,1735169453,Missed Bitcoin? This Must-Watch Presale is Making Splashes in Crypto,"The cryptocurrency market has been buzzing lately with fresh developments. Bitcoin, the king of cryptos, remains in the limelight as its price dances between key moving averages. But while Bitcoin continues to hold its ground, there’s another name that’s quietly stealing the show: Qubetics ($TICS) . As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is revolutionising blockchain technology with innovations that aim to address issues Bitcoin and its contemporaries have left unresolved. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto; it’s a game-changer. From bridging blockchains to simplifying decentralised processes, Qubetics is raising the bar. And with its ongoing presale raising over $7.8 million, it’s clear that people are paying attention. Let’s explore why Qubetics and Bitcoin are among the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025 , and how they stack up against each other. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Innovation Qubetics is capturing attention for all the right reasons. Its 14th presale stage has already sold over 376 million tokens to 11,800 holders, raising an impressive $7.8 million. At $0.0377 per token, there’s a growing sense of urgency to snag $TICS before its price jumps by 10% this weekend. Crypto analysts are buzzing with excitement about Qubetics’ potential. By the presale’s end, $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, offering a return on investment of 564%. And post-presale, the numbers soar—$TICS could hit $1, providing a staggering 2,555% ROI. But it doesn’t stop there. With a $15 target after its mainnet launch, the potential ROI skyrockets to an astonishing 39,729%. Investing $100,000 at the current price could mean owning 2,652,519 tokens, which could translate to $39.7 million if the $15 milestone is achieved. QubeQode IDE: Revolutionising Real-World Applications The heart of Qubetics lies in its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) , a powerful tool tailored for professionals, businesses, and individuals alike. Imagine a local artisan in São Paulo looking to sell handcrafted goods internationally. QubeQode IDE simplifies creating and launching a decentralised e-commerce platform, eliminating the need for tech expertise. Picture a logistics company in Mexico streamlining its supply chain using smart contracts designed through QubeQode. No middlemen, no delays—just seamless, automated transactions. Or think about a software developer in Argentina creating custom dApps for clients worldwide without needing to switch between multiple blockchains. By uniting blockchains and offering user-friendly tools, Qubetics ensures accessibility, efficiency, and trust. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Qubetics stands out for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and its real-world applications. Combine that with the excitement of its presale, and it’s easy to see why it’s among the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Original Crypto Titan Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of cryptocurrency, with its price currently hovering between key support and resistance levels. According to market analysts, BTC is dancing between the 21-day and 50-day simple moving averages, approximately $99,600 and $94,650, respectively. While it may not exhibit the explosive gains of younger altcoins, Bitcoin’s stability continues to make it a favourite among long-term investors. This year has seen Bitcoin reclaim its status as digital gold, with institutional interest spiking. However, regulatory headwinds and macroeconomic factors like interest rate cuts in 2025 are likely to influence its trajectory. Bitcoin’s Legacy and Use Cases Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its universality. From rural villages in Paraguay to bustling cities like Rio de Janeiro, Bitcoin is used for remittances, savings, and even everyday purchases. It’s the go-to for those who want financial freedom without the hassles of traditional banking. Bitcoin also serves as the foundation of many crypto portfolios. While it doesn’t have the bells and whistles of newer projects like Qubetics, its robustness and wide adoption make it irreplaceable. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Bitcoin’s resilience, universal appeal, and foundational role in the crypto world make it one of the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. While its growth may not be as meteoric as altcoins, it remains a safe bet for long-term value. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics and Bitcoin are standout options for those seeking the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. Bitcoin offers reliability and a proven track record, making it a cornerstone for any crypto portfolio. On the other hand, Qubetics is shaking up the blockchain landscape with its innovative QubeQode IDE and ambitious presale milestones. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio or ride the wave of an emerging star, now’s the time to act. Don’t let the opportunity pass you by—Qubetics and Bitcoin are here to reshape your financial future.

Lookonchain reports that a whale suddenly created 30 new wallets to accumulate $34.1 million worth of LINK tokens from Binance. “Suspicious LINK accumulation spotted! Over the past 5 days, 30 newly created wallets have withdrawn 1.37M LINK ($34.1M) from Binance.” Source: Lookonchain/X At time of writing, Chainlink is trading at $24.04, up 34% in the last month. Earlier this week, Chainlink released Smart Value Recapture (SVR), a solution aiming to allow DeFi solutions to recapture non-toxic Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) from the leading oracle’s price feeds. “Based on real-world testing, we believe Chainlink SVR can expect to achieve a realistic value recapture rate of approximately 40% (i.e., for every $100 that would have been leaked via liquidation MEV, $40 was recaptured). While some alternative solutions have claimed to achieve a higher efficiency rate for recapturing liquidation MEV, we have not seen conclusive real-world data to showcase this. We believe that 40% is a conservative but realistic estimate—real life performance will be needed to gather actual data.” On the same day as the announcement from Chainlink, Aave , the biggest lending platform in crypto, proposed using SVR. Specifically, the proposal was about activating a pilot program of SVR oracles on Aave v3 to recapture MEV from the platform’s liquidations to return its own ecosystem. The proposal is currently awaiting questions and feedback from the community.

The tokens are set to hit the market in three transactions of 200 million, 300 million, and 500 million XRP. The clock for the three escrows will tick on the first minutes of 2025, freeing 1 billion XRP tokens in addition to the 57.2 billion currently in circulation. The January release represents 2.63% of the total 38 billion of XRP that is still locked in Ripple’s escrow accounts. To be specific, Ripple (24) address will unlock 200 and 300 million XRP that were locked in the escrow on December 1, 2024, and January 1, 2021, respectively. Then, Ripple (25) will release 500 million XRP that were locked on January 1, 2021. These will be the last transactions from Ripple (24) and (25), although there are numerous escrows held by other Ripple-controlled addresses. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which create new tokens “on the go” as a reward for miners/validators that keep the blockchain safe, Ripple pre-mined the entire supply of 100 billion XRP at the very inception of the network. In 2017, 55 billion XRP were locked in an escrow system hardcoded to release 1 billion XRP each month to ensure gradual and controlled distribution. The scheduled unlocks help Ripple fund its operations, invest in ecosystem development, and provide liquidity for its payment solutions. While the real amount of XRP that actually enters circulation every month is often lower than 1 billion due to the company re-locking a portion of tokens into a new escrow, this nevertheless creates a significant amount of selling pressure. With Ripple currently trading above the coveted $2 mark, it remains an open question whether XRP will see a proportional demand increase to sustain current price levels. Nevertheless, the promise of the nearing altcoin season leaves room for cautious optimism. VanEck experts call the start of the altcoin season As Bitcoin struggles to stay above the psychologically important $100,000 mark, VanEck experts claim that the “altcoin season” may be already in full force. The asset manager even suggested November 27 as the start day for the rise of altcoins in this cycle. For context, the term “altcoin season” refers to the periods when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (so-called altcoins) outperform the king of crypto. The hotly anticipated altseasons historically follow after Bitcoin dominance peaks near 60%, as traders seek higher returns in alternative assets. According to VanEck analyst Matthew Sigel, the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin performance can be explained through the cyclical nature of capital flows in cryptocurrency driven by investor psychology. When new capital enters the market during Bitcoin's rise, it encourages a ”risk-on” sentiment, motivating investors to seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins. Increased appetite for risk often benefits more nascent crypto sectors, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The ”altseasons” are identified when over 60% of the top 50 altcoins by market cap, excluding the stablecoins and Bitcoin-backed assets, outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Data from Artemis’s Altcoin Season Index quoted by VanEck in a report indicates that altcoins are doing reasonably well. The index tracks how the top 50 altcoins compare to Bitcoin performance, taking on the values between 0 and 1, where 0.6 is a cutoff value that signals the start of the altcoin season. The current score of 0.64 suggests a moderate altcoin performance, a sign of a major altcoin pump still ahead. According to CoinMarketCap , the current state of the cryptocurrency market is neither altcoin season nor Bitcoin season. The platform uses a much more stringent standard for calculating the altseason index, defined as 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. With the current score of 49 sitting firmly in the middle, the altcoin rally seems like a more distant perspective than suggested by VanEck. At the same time, the index climbed as high as 82 on December 8, indicating a strong potential for a retest. Crypto analyst Ash Crypto recently made a prediction for the altcoin season to start in Q1 2025, drawing parallels between the Bitcoin performance in 2020 and 2024. In both cases, November saw strong gains in the cryptocurrency market, followed by a pullback in December. The subsequent reversal in Bitcoin dominance set the stage for the “mega altseason,” which analyst hopes to return in 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is hovering around the $99k mark. With the wave of pro-crypto policymakers brought by Trump into his administration, many experts expect Bitcoin to reach new highs in 2025. VanEck set its base price target for BTC at $180k by 2025, citing Bitcoin’s growing adoption as an institutional reserve asset, rising altcoin speculation, and powerful synergies between crypto and AI as potential catalysts in the upcoming year.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6715/ripple-set-to-unlock-1-billion-xrp-on-jan-1-as-experts-forecast-altcoin-season,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-fuks-santa-muskfsan-solana-memecoin-to-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing three altcoins crypto whales are stockpiling before the next bull run. Table of Contents XYZ ready to deliver a 9,900% knockout Ethereum Shiba Inu Conclusion As cryptocurrencies surge to new heights, crypto whales are quietly accumulating certain digital assets. Another bull run is imminent, and discovering which altcoins whales are stockpiling could reveal lucrative opportunities in the crypto market. XYZ ready to deliver a 9,900% knockout XYZ is quickly becoming an investor favorite. Among the altcoins being stockpiled in preparation for the next bull run, this first-ever all-sports meme coin is turning heads with its projected 9,900% surge and unique approach to blending meme culture with the excitement of sports. XYZ offers more than just meme coin hype — it seeks to redefine the space with its XYZVerse ecosystem, which will integrate prediction markets, sports betting, and interactive dApps. By tapping into the massive gambling and sports fanbase, XYZ is positioning itself as a major player. Currently priced at $0.001333 in its presale, XYZ is undervalued. By the Token Generation Event (TGE), its price is forecasted to climb to $0.1, delivering a 9,900% ROI for early investors. Whales recognize the opportunity to maximize gains before XYZ hits major centralized and decentralized exchanges. What sets XYZ apart in the crowded market: Whale-friendly tokenomics: With consistent token burns, strong liquidity, and revenue streams, XYZ will ensure long-term value and price stability. Massive market appeal: The blend of sports and meme culture attracts gamblers, sports enthusiasts, and crypto degens alike, creating a broad, engaged user base. Community-driven growth: Whales value projects with robust communities, and XYZ will reward active contributors with airdropped tokens while empowering them to influence the ecosystem’s direction. With whales quietly accumulating altcoins in anticipation of the next bull run, the resurgence of meme coins seems inevitable. XYZ is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this trend, leveraging its unique appeal and transformative ecosystem to dominate the market. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale for its potential gains.

With its robust ecosystem and continued upgrades, the platform aims to offer significant utility and scalability, making it a foundational asset in the cryptocurrency space. Whales are drawn to Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), which has seen exponential growth and is poised for further expansion in the coming bull cycle. Accumulating Ethereum not only provides exposure to the broader crypto market but also positions investors to benefit from the increasing adoption of smart contract platforms worldwide. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu initially captured the attention of crypto whales for its explosive price movements. However, SHIB has evolved beyond its meme origins, with recent developments, such as the Shibarium Layer-2 scaling solution adding to its utility. Whales are also attracted to SHIB’s deflationary tokenomics, with regular token burns reducing supply and increasing scarcity to potentially increase price with demand. As Shiba Inu integrates further into DeFi and explores metaverse opportunities, it solidifies its potential for high upsides in the next bull run. Conclusion While ETH and SHIB remain strong choices, crypto whales are also focusing on XYZ, a meme coin uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem in the current bull run.

38114323,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376018,1735165914,Bank of Italy Calls Bitcoin P2P Services ‘Crime-as-a-Service’ Amidst Growing Acceptance,"While major institutions worldwide are gradually embracing Bitcoin, recognizing its potential as a transformative asset and even integrating it into their corporate treasuries, the perception of the cryptocurrency remains far from universally positive. Amid this growing institutional adoption, the Bank of Italy has taken a notably critical stance. In its Economic and Financial Occasional Paper, it labeled Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) services – widely celebrated for their accessibility – as “crime-as-a-service.” Bank of Italy Raises Red Flag on Bitcoin P2P The Bank of Italy’s report from November 2024 highlighted the growing role of Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) services as tools for money laundering in jurisdictions with weak regulations. These services, described as “crime-as-a-service,” exploit regulatory loopholes, allowing illicit actors to obscure the origins of illegally obtained funds. The 131-year-old financial institution targeted unregulated P2P platforms and informal exchange networks, in particular, that evade traditional Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols and end up creating pathways for illegal activities. These methods enable criminals to bypass the scrutiny of centralized financial intermediaries by leveraging the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions. Regulatory Gaps The Bank of Italy’s report also highlighted the challenges posed by decentralized financial (DeFi) systems in combating money laundering. While centralized finance (CeFi) platforms can be regulated similarly to traditional financial institutions, their decentralized counterparts, on the other hand, operate without intermediaries, making oversight far more complex. The pseudonymity inherent in blockchain technology allows users to engage in transactions through unlinked addresses, effectively concealing their identities. This has sparked a debate between those who praise blockchain for its transparency and immutability and critics who highlight its potential for abuse. The report points to emerging solutions like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), which enable selective disclosure of information to mitigate illicit activities without compromising user privacy. However, these innovations, though promising, fall short of providing the continuous due diligence necessary to identify suspicious activities systematically, as per the Bank of Italy.

38114685,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633289,1735165820,Chillguy (CHILLGUY) price slides amid speculations the meme may be plagiarized,"Chillguy (CHILLGUY), one of the most active memes in the past few days, started sliding after evidence its main image was plagiarized. CHILLGUY slid from $0.19 to $0.17 after the news, extending its slide from mid-December. Chillguy extended its losses, sliding from $0.19 to $0.17 within minutes. The price action followed a series of social media posts showing evidence that the main image of the meme was plagiarized from a booklet distributed in Thailand. The original image was posted on Reddit, pointing to a single image of the booklet page. The lack of other images or additional information raised doubts about the authenticity of the evidence. Additionally, the versions of the pamphlet are conflicted. Some claim the published image is from Thailand and was printed eight years ago, while others point to a publication in Vietnam six years ago. Overall, the controversy is creating additional social media hype around the token, where some hype up the plagiarism, while others believe the entire story is to create more FUD around the token. Reverse image search shows this came from a Vietnamese book 6 years ago The artist who claimed to have the rights to #chillguy is a fraud Send the #OGchillguy pic.twitter.com/0aODGjVgAP — DD (@onchainbookie) December 25, 2024 Previously, Chillguy was considered the original creation of cartoonist Phillip Banks. Banks himself was touchy about using the image, even intending legal action to protect his creation. Despite this, the image was widely used on TikTok and became the avatar of a whole collection of meme tokens. Up to 30 versions of CHILLGUY or similar tickers exist, spreading on Ethereum, Solana, and Base. The main version was the one affected by the discovery of what social media considers plagiarism. Is CHILLGUY still the original? Some doubted the evidence of actual plagiarism, where claims were made that the character was taken from a Vietnamese leaflet created six years ago. Skeptics did not see additional evidence and suggested the image may be AI-generated or manipulated in some way. Phillip Banks has posted an Instagram image suggesting the suspicions are unfounded and the plagiarism is based on a faked image. Banks has not communicated through X to explicitly refute the claims and rarely pays attention to the meme community. The story was appealing enough that some of the large influencer accounts repeated the message of suspected plagiarism. Others found evidence that Banks denied all claims, while the image raised red flags of being AI-generated . Others noted that the booklet is not actually years old, and may be printed after the creation of Chillguy. In fact, when showing the reverse image search, Google indexes the age of subreddits, and not the image itself, which may be more recently printed. CHILLGUY controversy produces new meme token According to the original claims of plagiarism, the booklet called the character ‘Relax Boy’. This is just the name that the meme market needed, immediately launching RELAXBOY on Solana. The token graduated to Raydium and is already in price discovery mode. RELAXBOY was created based on the plagiarism claims, going through a boom and crash just hours after creation. | Source: DexScreener RELAXBOY is just hours old and has already gone through a 700X rally, followed by a 67% crash. The new asset still has just $232K in locked liquidity, though the token is creating a social media movement. Just hours after the token’s launch, CHILLGUY whales bought in . For traders, the actual verification of the image is less important. The spreading of images and rumors on TikTok shows the short video social app may also play a big role in the meme token market. If RELAXBOY was not enough, the market also produced Just a Chill Dog (CHILLDOG) , playing on the remixed illustration hype. The new asset is just as risky as RELAXBOY, though both tokens have seen intentions of creating social media movements and rising to a higher valuation.

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov spoke about alternatives to the US dollar for international trade during an interview on Russia-24 on Dec. 25. Siluanov highlighted that the government has authorized foreign trade transactions using DFAs and Bitcoin, adding that such methods are already in practice and set for expansion. “We Can Use Mined Bitcoin” Siluanov emphasized that adopting DFAs in foreign trade is a logical step under current circumstances, enabling the use of modern infrastructure. He described this approach as an innovation in global settlement systems, stating, “That is the future.” Russia is leveraging its experimental legal framework, effective since September 2024, to integrate DFAs — including Bitcoin — into international trade. Siluanov explained, “We can pay for the delivery of goods with digital financial assets. It is also possible to use Bitcoin, which we mined here in the Russian Federation, within the experimental regime.” Russia Legalizes Mining and Scales DFA Use The minister noted that Russia legalized Bitcoin mining earlier in 2024, paving the way for such transactions. He added, “We say that they need to be developed and expanded, and I am sure that next year, it will be a reality.” Siluanov Cautions Against Crypto Investment Amid Bitcoin Highs While advocating for DFA use in trade, Siluanov has warned against viewing cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle. In a speech on Nov. 6, he stated, “Some people see cryptocurrency as a source of quick money. I don’t recommend it as a means of investment.” His remarks underline the dual approach of promoting DFAs in trade while cautioning against speculative risks for individual investors.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/russia-advances-use-of-bitcoin-other-digital-financial-assets-in-foreign-trade/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Table of Contents XYZ: Taking the spotlight with 16,900% growth forecast XRP Cardano Conclusion A new presale token from Polygon is drawing attention from investors who once favored XRP and Cardano (ADA). Predictions for this token suggest gains as high as 16,900%, stirring excitement in the cryptocurrency market. XYZ: Taking the spotlight with 16,900% growth forecast XYZ — the first-ever all-sports meme coin — is emerging as a must-watch contender. Combining the energy of meme culture with the passion of sports fans, XYZ is blazing its trail in the crypto space with a forecasted 16,900% surge, potentially rivaling the hype around XRP and Cardano. Why XYZ is capturing investor interest: A new era in meme coins XYZ aims to bring a unique blend of sports, entertainment, and decentralized finance to the table. Its XYZVerse ecosystem will merge prediction markets, sports betting, and interactive dApps, creating a playground for millions of gamblers and crypto enthusiasts alike. Undervalued yet poised for massive growth Currently in its presale phase, XYZ is a hidden gem for early investors. By its Token Generation Event (TGE), XYZ is projected to outperform past meme coin sensations like BOME and WIF. Its roadmap also includes CEX/DEX listings, entertainment platforms, and token burns, ensuring a robust ecosystem and sustained price growth.

Intrigued investors can join the XYZ presale for the potential 16,900% opportunity. XRP XRP is a digital currency aiming to make money transfer faster. It’s built on the XRP Ledger — a decentralized system that allows for swift, low-cost, and secure transactions. XRP doesn’t require a bank account for settlements, making it accessible to people everywhere. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and efficiency compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be slower and more expensive to use. XRP’s ability to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies aligns well with the growing demand for quick and borderless transactions. As financial systems evolve, XRP’s technology positions it as a potential key player. Its focus on real-world application and partnerships in the banking sector also make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Cardano Cardano is a layer-1 blockchain that allows developers to build decentralized finance apps, create new crypto tokens, and develop games. Similar to Ethereum’s ETH, ADA can be used to store value, make payments, and earn rewards through staking on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake system, which is much more energy-efficient than the traditional proof-of-work model used by Bitcoin. Additionally, Cardano’s blockchain is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions quickly — potentially up to a million per second. In the current market, where sustainability and scalability are highly valued, ADA presents an attractive option. As Ethereum faces challenges with high fees and scaling, Cardano’s approach might give it an edge. Conclusion XRP and ADA remain strong options, but XYZ could dominate the 2024 bull run.

While financial legends like Warren Buffett turned market crashes into windfalls, today’s savvy investors are looking to the world of meme coins to achieve similar success. The crypto landscape is abuzz, with Popcat (POPCAT) struggling to claw back from a massive price drop and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) turning heads with its AI-powered promotion. But the real excitement? It’s all about BTFD Coin’s presale , which has already surged past $4.5 million in funds raised, offering a jaw-dropping 50% festive discount for early investors. This limited-time deal, featuring the bonus code “ BIG50 ,” lets buyers snag $BTFD at just $0.000064—a steal when you consider its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. With a live P2E game, staking rewards, and a thriving community, BTFD Coin is set to redefine the meme coin space. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin stands out among the top meme coin presales to buy today and explore the latest updates on Popcat and Goatseus Maximus. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Festive Bull Run is Here Imagine a world where every market dip is a golden opportunity. This philosophy is at the heart of BTFD Coin, a meme coin inspired by the “Buy The Dip” mantra. With its P2E game beta now live and staking rewards already available, BTFD Coin is poised to redefine what it means to invest in meme coins. The BTFD presale has been nothing short of spectacular. In just its 12th stage, it’s sold over 59 billion tokens to more than 6,600 holders, raising a staggering $4.5 million. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, the current price is $0.000064—a massive 837.5% return for early investors. Here’s the kicker: with the festive 50% discount, investors can grab BTFD coins at a bargain using the code “ BIG50 .” Analysts predict even greater gains when the coin lists at $0.0006 after January 5, 2025. For instance, an investment of $6,500 at the discounted price yields over 101 million BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006, that’s a potential return of over $60,000—a nearly 9x gain! This is why investors are flocking to BTFD’s presale. What sets BTFD apart is its utility-focused ecosystem. The P2E game, though in beta, is already generating buzz for its immersive gameplay. Players can join the Bulls Squad and engage in a gamified crypto experience. Though no rewards are earned during the beta, this is just the beginning of what promises to be a lucrative gaming journey. Add to this the 90% APY staking rewards introduced in Stage 3, and it’s clear that BTFD is more than just hype. Joining the presale is simple. Connect your wallet (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet) on the BTFD presale page , input the code “ BIG50 ,” and enjoy the discounted price. Don’t miss the referral programme—top referrers get 10% of the raised amount in tokens at month’s end. With a maximum supply of 173 billion tokens, BTFD is built on Ethereum’s robust blockchain, ensuring security, scalability, and accessibility for all investors. The BTFD presale isn’t just a chance to buy into a coin; it’s an invitation to join a community driven by resilience and strategic thinking. The world’s financial history—like the 1973 oil shock—has shown that buying during downturns often leads to monumental gains. BTFD embraces this ethos, giving every investor a shot at turning market chaos into personal triumph. Popcat (POPCAT): Bouncing Back from the Meme Market Dip Popcat—a coin inspired by the viral internet meme—has had a rollercoaster year. After reaching an all-time high of $2.06 in November 2024, the token faced a brutal 65% price decline over the last 30 days. This dip left many questioning its long-term viability. However, all is not lost for POPCAT. Currently priced at $0.825, Popcat has found support at the $1 mark, sparking renewed optimism among traders. Analysts note that maintaining this support could trigger a rally, with potential resistance levels offering significant upside. The coin’s developers have also been active in stabilising its community, emphasising its integration within the Solana blockchain for fast and cost-effective transactions. Popcat’s story highlights the unpredictable nature of meme coins. It serves as a reminder that while these investments carry high risk, they also offer opportunities for those who can navigate their volatility. For those who believe in Popcat’s potential, this could be an ideal time to enter the market at a discount. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): AI Meets Meme Coin Mania Goatseus Maximus has quickly become a topic of fascination in the meme coin world, thanks in large part to its association with Truth Terminal—an AI created by New Zealand developer Andy Ayrey. The AI’s promotional prowess has catapulted GOAT into the spotlight, making it a unique player in the crypto space. Despite reaching an all-time high of $1.35 in November 2024, GOAT’s price has since dropped to $0.49. This decline reflects the volatility typical of meme coins but hasn’t dampened the enthusiasm of its community. Goatseus Maximus is actively traded on major platforms like Bybit and Gate.io, with significant daily volume suggesting continued interest. The project’s innovative approach combines meme culture with cutting-edge AI. Truth Terminal’s online activities have sparked discussions about the role of artificial intelligence in shaping cryptocurrency markets. This AI-driven narrative, coupled with its meme coin identity, positions GOAT as a coin to watch in the coming months. Conclusion: Seize the Dip Before It’s Too Late Investing in meme coins can be a wild ride, but it’s one that savvy investors know can lead to incredible gains. Based on current trends, BTFD Coin’s presale stands out as the most compelling opportunity among the top meme coin presales to buy today. With its 50% festive discount, immersive P2E game, and staking rewards, BTFD is rewriting the rules of meme coin investing. Popcat’s resilience and Goatseus Maximus’ innovative use of AI add further intrigue to the market. Now is the time to act. Visit the BTFD presale page, input “ BIG50 ” for the festive discount, and secure your tokens before the presale ends. Don’t let this chance pass you by. These are the top meme coin presales to buy today—and they might just be your ticket to financial freedom.

One such standout in the world of online gambling is Starlight Princess , a slot game developed by Pragmatic Play. This celestial-themed game offers an engaging experience for players who enjoy vibrant graphics and rewarding mechanics. For those curious about diving into the adventure, the Starlight Princess demo oyna option provides a chance to explore the game’s features without financial commitment. In this review, we’ll delve into the unique features, gameplay, and rewards of Starlight Princess while highlighting why it’s a favorite among gambling enthusiasts. We’ll also touch upon how the game fits within the evolving landscape of blockchain and crypto gaming. Starlight Princess: Overview and Theme Starlight Princess is a visually stunning slot game that transports players to a mystical, sky-high kingdom ruled by an enchanting princess. The game’s anime-inspired graphics, vivid colors, and magical soundtrack set it apart from traditional slot games. With a unique cascading reels feature, every spin is filled with the potential for big wins. The Starlight Princess demo oyna feature lets players experience the game’s rich visuals and mechanics without wagering real money. This demo is an excellent way for beginners and seasoned players alike to get familiar with its rules, payout potential, and bonus features. By exploring the demo, players can strategize and decide how to approach the game when they switch to real-money mode. Gameplay Mechanics and Features Starlight Princess offers a fresh take on the traditional slot format, featuring a 6×5 reel setup and a pay-anywhere mechanic. Unlike games where symbols must align on specific paylines, Starlight Princess rewards players for landing clusters of identical symbols anywhere on the grid. Key Features of Starlight Princess: Tumble Feature : Winning symbols disappear after a spin, allowing new symbols to cascade into the grid. This increases the chance of consecutive wins from a single spin, a mechanic that adds excitement and boosts payouts. Multiplier Symbols : The game includes multiplier symbols with values ranging from 2x to 500x. These multipliers can significantly amplify winnings, especially during the Free Spins round. Free Spins Bonus Round : Landing at least four scatter symbols triggers the Free Spins feature, where players are awarded 15 spins. During this round, multipliers accumulate, offering the potential for massive payouts. Buy Free Spins Option : For players eager to jump into the action, the game allows purchasing the Free Spins feature for a set price, bypassing the need to wait for scatter symbols. Starlight Princess and Blockchain Gambling As the gambling industry increasingly incorporates blockchain technology, games like Starlight Princess align well with the expectations of tech-savvy players. Blockchain casinos provide transparency, provably fair gaming, and secure transactions through cryptocurrencies, creating a seamless and trustworthy experience. Here’s how Starlight Princess fits into the blockchain gambling ecosystem: Crypto Integration : Many platforms offering Starlight Princess accept cryptocurrencies, enabling players to enjoy the game with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets. Provably Fair Gaming : By leveraging blockchain’s transparent algorithms, casinos can ensure that outcomes in games like Starlight Princess are genuinely random and fair. Decentralized Casinos : Blockchain-powered casinos allow players to maintain greater anonymity and control over their funds, making games like Starlight Princess more accessible to a global audience. Pragmatic Play: The Creator Behind Starlight Princess Pragmatic Play is a leading provider in the online gambling industry, known for its innovative slot games that combine engaging themes with advanced mechanics. The company consistently delivers high-quality titles that cater to a wide range of players. Why Pragmatic Play Stands Out: Diverse Game Portfolio : Beyond Starlight Princess, Pragmatic Play has developed numerous slots, table games, and live casino products, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Player-Centric Design : Each game is designed to offer an intuitive and enjoyable experience, whether played on desktop or mobile devices. Fairness and Security : Pragmatic Play games are rigorously tested for fairness, making them a reliable choice for players. Why Players Love Starlight Princess Starlight Princess appeals to players for several reasons: Engaging Visuals and Theme : The anime-style design and magical atmosphere create an immersive gaming experience. Rewarding Features : The tumble mechanic and multipliers keep the gameplay dynamic and lucrative. Demo Mode : The Starlight Princess demo oyna feature provides a risk-free way to enjoy the game and learn its mechanics. Compatibility with Crypto Gambling : The game’s availability on blockchain casinos makes it a go-to choice for crypto enthusiasts. Tips for Playing Starlight Princess While luck plays a significant role in slot games, here are some tips to enhance your experience: Start with the Demo : Use the Starlight Princess demo oyna feature to familiarize yourself with the gameplay and mechanics. Set a Budget : Determine a budget for real-money play and stick to it to ensure responsible gambling. Take Advantage of Bonuses : Look for casinos offering promotions, such as free spins or deposit bonuses, to extend your gameplay. Understand the Features : Learn how multipliers and the Free Spins round work to maximize your winnings. Final Thoughts Starlight Princess is more than just a slot game—it’s a captivating adventure that combines stunning visuals, rewarding gameplay, and innovative features. Its alignment with the trends in blockchain gambling makes it a must-try for modern players seeking a transparent and engaging experience. For those curious about exploring the enchanting world of Starlight Princess, the Starlight Princess demo oyna option is an excellent starting point. It’s a chance to enjoy the game’s features and prepare for the excitement of real-money play on trusted platforms like 7Slots Casino.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/winter-pepe-pepewint-memecoin-will-skyrocket-over-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

However, as the market matures, attention is shifting toward projects with real-world utility and technological innovation. Enter Lightchain AI (LCAI) —a project that combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to address real-world challenges. Could Lightchain AI replace PEPE as the next major trend in cryptocurrency? Let’s explore the potential of this transformative platform. PEPE Memecoin Success Story PEPE, the funny coin inspired by the famous Pepe the Frog meme (made by Matt Furie back in 2005), has shocked the crypto world! Started in April 2023 as a ERC-20 token on Ethereum it reached an amazing $1 billion market cap i͏n only three weeks. What made PEPE’s fast win? Its strong ties in web culture. Pepe the Frog has been a liked meme for years pulling in a big group of fans and backers. Soon, PEPE was next to memecoin big names like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. But its growth hasn’t come without trouble. In August 2023, a bad team part took 16 trillion PEPE tokens ($15 million then) from its multi-sign wallet, leading to a 15% fall in worth. Yet, PEPE bounced back and, as of December 2024, has a huge $11 billion market cap making it the third-biggest memecoin. PEPE’s story shows the power of internet culture and hype, but its future is uncertain. With no intrinsic value or utility, its price depends on speculative trading and community support. The memecoin market is exciting but highly volatile, so investors should proceed with caution. Lightchain AI New Frontier for Blockchain and AI Lightchain AI (LCAI) is revolutionizing the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence with groundbreaking innovations designed for real-world impact. Its Memecoin Launchpad is a standout feature, enabling users to creatively engage in the meme economy while monetizing their ideas through a secure, AI-enhanced platform. The ecosystem fosters inclusivity through decentralized governance, empowering the community to propose and shape future projects. Lightchain AI’s advanced framework addresses key industry challenges like scalability and interoperability, making it a preferred solution across sectors such as healthcare, logistics, and education. With a forward-thinking roadmap, Lightchain AI prioritizes developer tools and cross-chain integrations to ensure seamless global adoption. By consistently evolving and innovating, LCAI is set to redefine how blockchain and AI merge to create smarter, decentralized applications for the future. Comparing PEPE and Lightchain AI Feature PEPE Lightchain AI (LCAI) Core Appeal Community-driven hype AI-powered blockchain innovation Utility None Real-world applications in AI and dApps Tokenomics Speculative supply dynamics Deflationary with token burning Growth Potential Hype-dependent Utility and adoption-focused Market Stability Highly volatile Balanced, with meaningful use cases While PEPE relies on market sentiment and virality, Lightchain AI offers tangible value and innovation, appealing to a broader audience. Why Lightchain AI Could Replace PEPE Sustainability and Utility Investors are increasingly seeking projects with sustainable growth and real-world applications. Lightchain AI’s focus on solving real-world problems ensures its relevance beyond speculative trading. Broader Market Appeal Unlike PEPE, which is limited to the memecoin niche, Lightchain AI targets industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics, offering solutions that appeal to enterprises and developers. Exponential Growth Potential Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, Lightchain AI offers early investors an opportunity for substantial returns. A $500 investment could yield approximately 166,667 LCAI tokens, which could turn into $50,000 if the token price reaches $0.30. Path to Becoming the Next Trend For Lightchain AI to replace PEPE as the next major trend in cryptocurrency, it must continue delivering on its promises of innovation and adoption. Its ability to merge blockchain and AI gives it a competitive edge, attracting both tech-savvy investors and enterprises seeking decentralized solutions. How Lightchain AI Can Dominate Expanding Ecosystem By fostering partnerships and developer adoption, Lightchain AI can build a robust ecosystem of AI-powered dApps. Community Engagement Like PEPE, Lightchain AI must cultivate an engaged and enthusiastic community to drive awareness and adoption. Real-World Impact Demonstrating success in industries like healthcare and supply chain management will solidify Lightchain AI’s position as a game-changer. Shift in Market Trends While PEPE has enjoyed its moment in the spotlight, its speculative nature limits its long-term appeal. Lightchain AI (LCAI) , with its focus on utility, innovation, and real-world impact, represents the next evolution in blockchain technology. For investors looking for more than just hype, Lightchain AI offers a compelling alternative with the potential to redefine how blockchain and AI interact. As the market shifts toward projects that combine technological advancement with tangible value, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to replace PEPE as the next big trend in cryptocurrency. Its potential for exponential growth, real-world applications, and community-driven development make it a project to watch closely in the coming years. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

What better way to celebrate the season than by diving into the holly-jolly madness of holiday memecoins? Pump.fun has been brimming with festive chaos as degens deck the chain with memes and mayhem, so we thought we’d take a moment to unwrap a few of the highlights. First up, the Santas. Purple is the color of the moment, and Santa is apparently taking it in stride. Santa Paws (yes, a cat) appears to be attempting to claw its way to a comeback, while Santa Is Real and Santa Isn’t Real duke it out for festive dominance. Santa wif Hat, meanwhile, is rocking an alarming variety of headgear, from classic red to…let’s just call it “experimental.” And what’s this? Could it be a brigade of naked Santa variants storming the chain, ranging from cheeky to full-on yuletide nightmare fuel ? Aw thanks, frens…you really shouldn’t have. New holidays are making their debuts too. Ever heard of Rizzmas ? Hawktuahnukkah ? Chrismahanukwanzaka ? Me neither, and yet here we are. Degens have made their wish lists loud and clear with aspirational coins like “All I Want for Xmas is (1000X)” and “AllIWANTforXmasIsAMillionBucks.” Ho ho hodl. Oh, and the snowmen…my goodness, the snowmen. They’ve outdone themselves. Frosty the Dough Man — because nothing says “the season of giving” like hoarding bags of cash — is joined by the very swol Abdominal Snowman (you read that right), an alarmingly handsome-Squidward-esque Mewing Snowman, and the ever popular extra thicc Gyatt Snowman, among many , many others . It only gets weirder. There are memecoins featuring homicidal Christmas trees, an unfortunate P. Diddy made of gingerbread, Biden and Trump (both dressed as Santa) kissing under the mistletoe, and a truly inexplicable Jesus made of shrimp (called Shresus, obviously). And then there’s the Grinch. Solana devs can’t get enough of Dr. Seuss’ iconic green grouch. Grinch Mona Lisa? Check . Super Saiyan Grinch? Why not ? Grinch Hawktuah? Sure . If it’s a meme, it’s minting.

38114260,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322718,1735162119,Solana Price Set to Explode Once It Breaks Above This Key Level,"The Solana (SOL) price is trying to continue its modest comeback on Christmas Day 2024, and was last probing for a pushback above the $200 level. It’s now up an impressive 13% from the multi-week lows it recently hit in the $175 area, but still has a long way to go before it retests its recent highs in the $260s. Solana back to $200 Me and my buddies with a combined total of $17.50 in our wallet: pic.twitter.com/sbaDr7BhMk — Kakashi (@kkashi_yt) December 25, 2024 Indeed, the bulls shouldn’t get overly excited about the rebound just yet. Chart analysis suggests the Solana price remains stuck in a downtrend and remains substantial in both its 21 and 50DMAs. A meaningful break above $220 would be required to confirm an end to the bearish trend. The Fed’s recent hawkish policy shift (towards signaling only two rate cuts in 2025) knocked confidence in risk assets last week. Will that keep the Solana price in a bearish trend? Probably not. Here’s why a recovery back towards its 2024 highs and beyond is likely in early 2025. Solana Price Set to Retest $260 Soon, Here’s Why The Fed won’t be cutting interest rates as much in 2025, which is, on margin, a negative for risk assets. But there are too many other fundamentals to be bullish on right now to get overly worried about this. Firstly, the US economy continues to perform very well. Assuming that continues, this should underpin risk assets (like US stocks) moving forward, a tailwind for crypto. But much more important for crypto is the imminent arrival of the pro-crypto Trump administration and a new pro-crypto US Congress. The US crypto industry is on the cusp of entering into a new golden age, and this should be a boon for all major crypto assets as adoption accelerates. With most major cryptos also still yet to enter the most explosive phase of their bull markets, the Solana price could soon enter lift-off. And a break above the aforementioned downtrend could be the trigger. The blockchain’s on-chain fundamentals are looking very healthy, with trading and transaction volumes and TVL in strong uptrends, per DeFi Llama . Solana’s market cap was last around $94 billion, which is under 25% of Ethereum’s . Its unlikely to overtake Ethereum this cycle, given ETH will also likely see significant expansion. But it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see the Solana price 4-5x from current levels and match Ethereum’s current market cap. With the price still down 25% from its November peaks, Solana is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now .

38112860,https://thecoinrise.com/montenegro-court-dismisses-do-kwon-extradition-appeal/,1735161346,Montenegro Court Dismisses Do Kwon’s Extradition Appeal,"Terraform co-founder Do Kwon may have to explore another legal route as Montenegro’s Constitutional Court reportedly dismissed his appeal. Korea JoongAng Daily published a report detailing the reason behind the court’s decision. First, the court is concerned about the legal inconsistencies in Kwon’s appeal. Ordinarily, these inconsistencies effectively uphold an earlier ruling favoring his extradition. The European country’s minister of justice will have to decide whether Kwon will face trial at home or in the United States. The likelihood of getting extradited to the US seems higher. Montenegro Appellate Court Extradite Do Kwon to South Korea In August, the Montenegro Appellate Court confirmed its decision to extradite the Terraform Labs co-founder to South Korea . It was believed that this ended the prolonged legal battle marked by multiple appeals and judicial reversals. It turned out that the requirements for extradition requests from South Korea and the United States were met. However, the High Court in Podgorica decided that South Korea’s request should take precedence over the U.S. This decision came amidst several complexities in Kwon’s dual extradition requests. Do Kwon in Trouble With Authorities Montenegro’s court decision will likely set a precedent for cross-border accountability in crypto. The authorities are investigating Do Kwon over allegations of fraud, market manipulation, and securities law violations. In the second quarter of 2024, one US court found Terraform Labs and Kwon liable for fraud. This was a case initiated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which charged him with misleading investors and recklessly mishandling customer funds. Consequently, the Commission requested approximately $4.7 billion in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. This was alongside a combined $520 million in civil penalties, $420 million from Terraform, and $100 million from Kwon. Terra LUNA Pulls $2 Trillion From Global Crypto Market Cap For context, Terraform Labs faced a major downtrend in 2022 after Terra LUNA/UST rushed and left the broader cryptocurrency market, with losses running to $2 trillion. Since then, Kwon has been at the center of global scrutiny. His investigation cuts across the United States and South Korea, as regulators in both regions accuse him of commuting fraud. He was initially in South Korea but was later arrested in Montenegro in March 2023, so both countries are pushing for his extradition.

Qubetics is leading innovation with its AI-enhanced development environment. VeChain sustains an incredible rally with a market cap exceeding $5 billion, and Hedera is capturing institutional attention with its first HBAR-focused ETF. These three projects offer unique opportunities for growth and adoption as blockchain technology continues to evolve. Qubetics: AI-Powered Blockchain Innovation Qubetics is redefining how decentralized applications are developed, offering a visual Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that simplifies the creation of blockchain-based solutions. The IDE incorporates drag-and-drop components, intuitive forms for configuring smart contracts , and a library of pre-written code snippets, allowing developers to create robust applications with minimal coding expertise. The integration of artificial intelligence further enhances the platform by automating smart contract generation, improving code quality with real-time suggestions, and optimising application performance. These features make Qubetics a game-changer for developers, enterprises, and individuals looking to harness blockchain’s potential. Currently, in its 14th Presale Phase, Qubetics has raised $7.8 million, sold 376 million tokens, and amassed 11,800+ holders. With $TICS tokens priced at $0.037, the project offers significant ROI potential, with a projected post-presale value of $0.25 and long-term growth targets ranging from $10 to $15. VeChain: Sustaining an Incredible Rally VeChain (VET) has been one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market, experiencing a 215% price surge over the past month, climbing from $0.02 to $0.069. This remarkable growth has added nearly $1 billion to its market capitalisation, now exceeding $5 billion. The upward trend has been fueled by a consistent increase in trading volumes and open interest in VET futures, reflecting growing speculative interest from traders worldwide. December has been particularly strong for VeChain, with no significant price declines, signalling sustained momentum. Technical indicators suggest that VeChain’s rally is far from over, making it an attractive option for those seeking exposure to a high-performing cryptocurrency with strong market dynamics. Hedera: Pioneering Institutional Blockchain Adoption Hedera (HBAR) is making headlines with Canary Capital’s filing for the first HBAR-focused ETF in the U.S., marking a significant milestone for institutional adoption. The announcement sparked a 270% increase in trading volume, demonstrating rising investor interest in Hedera’s blockchain network and native token. Hedera’s enhanced Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility has further solidified its position in decentralised finance, enabling more efficient smart contract deployments and attracting developers seeking scalable solutions. This development and the potential influx of institutional investment positions Hedera as a leading blockchain platform as the global adoption of decentralised technologies accelerates. Conclusion As January 2025 approaches, Qubetics, VeChain, and Hedera stand out as the top cryptos to join now for those looking to invest in transformative projects. Qubetics’ AI-driven platform and presale success make it a trailblazer in decentralised application development. VeChain’s sustained price rally and market strength position it as a leader in speculative growth, while Hedera’s institutional advancements and ETF-backed momentum highlight its long-term potential. For investors and blockchain enthusiasts alike, these projects represent the forefront of innovation and growth, making them essential considerations in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

In contrast, Bitcoin’s performance during this year-end trading window has been much less consistent, rising only half the time in 14 holiday seasons since its inception in 2010. While stocks stick to traditional trading calendars, Bitcoin's 24/7 market creates a slightly different year-end dynamic. According to Tyler Richey, technical analyst and associate editor at Sevens Report Research, Bitcoin’s trading volumes have been steadily decreasing since the BTC price surpassed $100,000 earlier this month. Related News: The Central Bank of South Korea issued a statement on Cryptocurrencies: A Positive Development “The decline in trading volume is a sign that bullish sentiment is waning,” Richey said in his comments. Despite this, Richey sees potential for a recovery. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin could rally toward $100,000 after recent weakness triggered by the Fed’s latest moves. “If we see a break above the congestion resistance at $100,000-$101,500 on the daily chart, a retest of the current close and intraday highs of $106,000-$108,000 would become extremely likely,” Richey said. *This is not investment advice.

38111872,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633281,1735160447,Crypto OTC trading volumes rise after US election,"According to leading cryptocurrency trading companies, the election result has been a major driver of the recent sharp rise in over-the-counter (OTC) trading volumes. The head of Kraken Institutional, Tim Ogilvie, said that while prices are up, the volume is far higher. He confirmed that Kraken’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading volumes have increased by 220% in the past year, and other cryptocurrency trading companies have experienced a comparable rise. According to Brett Reeves of BitGo, two-thirds of the exchange’s recent volumes have come in the last three months as a result of the election’s outcome. In mid-2024, the OTC market had low trading volumes, but that changed as the election approached and traders wanted to capitalize on the results. OTC traders explore other liquid cryptocurrencies Desks have noticed that traders are becoming more open to exploring assets beyond well-known ones like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This is because the rise in demand for Bitcoin (BTC) has caused OTC desk inventory levels to drop by the highest monthly volume in 2024. This year, the monthly inventory of Bitcoin OTC desks has been reduced by 26,000 BTC , and since November 20, it has also been reduced by another 40,000 BTC. Alternative coins like Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Tron (TRX), and Aave (AAVE) have become well-known assets because of their high liquidity. Institutional players seek liquid markets, which allows them to execute larger trades efficiently, according to Ogilvie. Analysts expect over-the-counter desks will continue to have high demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) while traders investigate the potential expansion in the derivatives markets. They emphasized how big institutions are increasingly using options as a hedging tool. Options linked to Bitcoin ETFs have opened the door for cross-collateralized, affordable products, bringing cryptocurrency closer to conventional financial models. Analysts anticipate that more ETFs, possibly with Solana (SOL) or XRP included, will provide market stability and encourage adoption. The growth of these financial products is anticipated to draw in new funding sources, changing the over-the-counter and overall cryptocurrency environment.

According to a report by the Yonhap News Agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the government of South Korea signed an agreement to jointly develop technologies aimed at curbing attacks on crypto platforms and infrastructure as well as tracking stolen crypto assets. US and South Korean researchers will also focus on how stolen financial assets are laundered or converted into crypto assets using illegal ransomware or other techniques. Per the Yonhap News Agency, the US picked South Korea for the collaborative effort on crypto assets as the country’s neighbor and geopolitical rival North Korea is viewed as a major perpetrator of crypto heists. In August of 2022, for instance, blockchain analysis platform Chainalysis said that North Korea was responsible for most of the crypto heists happening on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. “Much of the value stolen from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can be attributed to bad actors affiliated with North Korea, especially elite hacking units like Lazarus Group. We estimate that so far in 2022, North Korea-affiliated groups have stolen approximately $1 billion of cryptocurrency from DeFi protocols.” Earlier this year, a member of a United Nations expert panel tasked with the monitoring of sanctions on North Korea reportedly disclosed that the hermit state uses the crypto mixer Tornado Cash to launder stolen crypto assets. The hermit state is said to use the proceeds of its crypto heists to fund its nuclear and missile programs.

To read full editions, subscribe . Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah to those who celebrate. Kwanzaa kicks off tomorrow too. While Santa’s elves worked hard in the holiday lead-up, bitcoin miners were busy raising money for different purposes. We touched on this phenomenon earlier this month. Bitdeer noted proceeds from its convertible senior notes offering would go toward datacenter expansion and mining rig development. Marathon and Riot Platforms have signaled the route of using raised capital to buy more BTC. More recent announcements from two other segment players continue to highlight that not all BTC miners agree on the best way to spend the capital they secure. Less than a week ago, Hut 8 touted its purchase of 990 BTC for $100 million (avg. price of ~$101,710). Two days earlier, CleanSpark CFO Gary Vecchiarelli noted his company was choosing not to pay such a price for BTC. Very pleased to incorporate this instrument into our capital stack and strategy. Instead of buying bitcoin at prices over $100k, we are investing in our ability to mine bitcoin at a cost under $40k. $CLSK #Bitcoin https://t.co/TZsn0jqayD — Gary A. Vecchiarelli (@GaryVec) December 17, 2024 I followed up with Vecchiarelli. He told me the company is “laser focused on producing bitcoin from our mining operations at a significant discount to the spot price.” The marginal cost to produce each coin last quarter was roughly $36,250, he explained. The company’s main 2025 growth priority is reaching a hash rate of 50 EH/s as soon as possible, while also growing its digital asset management group to manage its bitcoin treasury (9,297 BTC, as of Nov. 30). As Hut 8 buys more BTC, Marathon Digital has used capital from convertible notes to boost its BTC holdings to 44,394 BTC, as of Dec. 18. “We are happy to be different [from] those companies,” Vecchiarelli said, adding that CleanSpark’s healthy margins allow the company to build its balance sheet holdings “in a durable fashion.” Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot made clear to me the company’s strategic bitcoin reserve is “a complement, not a substitute, to our core operating strategy, which prioritizes disciplined, fundamentals-driven growth.” The miner doesn’t have explicit price levels at which it would totally rule out buying BTC, Genoot added — but is “extremely sensitive to valuation extremes and [optimizes] for risk-adjusted returns.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

38111457,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314132,1735160142,"Additional Downside for Bitcoin To Be Expected As Resistance Remains Strong, According to Analyst","A crypto strategist who nailed the pre-halving Bitcoin correction earlier this year is warning that BTC may head lower as resistance continues to strengthen. Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 523,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is looking near-term bearish as it struggles to reclaim key support levels on the weekly chart while it chops around the $90,000 range. “[Monday], Bitcoin showed some signs of a relief rally after which price was rejected to almost new lows. [Tuesday], Bitcoin [was] rebounding yet again and once again into the old support. Overall, as long as the previously lost supports turn into new resistance additional downside should be expected. Conversely, a reclaim of these previously lost supports would obviously be bullish.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst also says that a Bitcoin correction during these weeks of the current bull market cycle is not unusual based on historical precedence, and it could set the flagship crypto asset up for rallies. “BTC is offering more confirmation for additional downside than reasons to be bullish for the moment. Once Bitcoin clears its historically corrective weeks seven, eight and nine in price discovery the opposite will be true. It’s Christmas and this retrace is a gift.” Lastly, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin has about 38% left to complete in the bull market cycle based on previous cycles and that the final stage is traditionally the most explosive phase. “Bitcoin bull market progress: 62%. (Progress will speed up in the parabolic phase).” Source: Rekt Capital/X Bitcoin is trading for $98,151 at time of writing, up more than 125% in the last year.

Both are exciting projects, but one stands out for its potential to deliver massive gains. While Filecoin offers stability, Altura is a hidden gem with the chance to grow 10x, 15x, or even 20x. Let’s break it down. Filecoin ($FIL): A Solid but Limited Option Filecoin is a big name in the decentralized storage world, with a market cap of $3.3 billion. It’s already listed on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, making it accessible to millions of investors. But this also means Filecoin’s growth potential is limited. - To 10x, Filecoin would need to grow its market cap to $33 billion, which is very difficult in today’s market.- Realistically, Filecoin has room for a 2-3x growth, bringing it to $6.6–$10 billion. While that’s respectable, it doesn’t match the explosive potential of smaller, undervaluedprojects like Altura. Altura ($ALU): The Undervalued Gem Altura is a much smaller project with a market cap of just $100 million, making it extremely undervalued compared to Filecoin. This gives it a huge opportunity to grow. - If Altura grows 10x, its market cap would reach $1 billion, which is very achievable.- With the right momentum, it could grow 15x or even 20x, reaching $1.5–$2 billion, placing it in the ranks of mid-cap crypto projects. 1. Not Yet on Major Exchanges Altura isn’t listed on Binance or Coinbase yet, which have over 300 million users combined. A listing on these platforms could skyrocket Altura’s price and visibility. 2. Revolutionary Technology Altura focuses on AI-powered smart NFTs. These are intelligent digital assets that can adapt based on user interactions or real-world events. This technology is cutting-edge and has massive use cases in gaming and virtual economies. 3. Room for Massive Growth With its small market cap and innovative ideas, Altura has the space to grow rapidly. As more people recognize its value, Altura could become a multi-billion-dollar project. Why Altura is the Better Bet While Filecoin is a great choice for investors looking for steady, moderate returns, Altura is where the real growth potential lies. Its low market cap, innovative tech, and chances of being listed on major exchanges make it a strong contender for 10x or more. - Filecoin is reliable but already mature, with limited room to grow.- Altura is still in its early stages, with the potential to explode in value as more investors discover it. Final Thoughts: Altura is the Future If you’re looking for a cryptocurrency that could multiply your investment many times over, Altura ($ALU) is the better choice. It has everything—low market cap, innovative tech, and untapped potential. With the right momentum, Altura could be one of the next big names in crypto.As always, do your research and invest wisely, but don’t miss out on what could be a life-changing opportunity with Altura.

38110730,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667024,1735158630,"Possible Deep Correction Could Push Cardano Price To $0.43, Here’s How","The Cardano price action has continued to stall below the $1 mark in light of corrections in the past seven days. This correction, which played out across the entire crypto industry, saw Cardano break below the $1 mark again on December 18%. Although the broader trend suggests a possible move on the weekly timeframe towards a new all-time high (ATH), recent technical analysis on TradingView has opened up the possibility for a continued correction towards $0.43 before another strong upward move. Current Price Movements Highlight Resistance And Cooling Period According to technical analysis of the Cardano (ADA) price action on the weekly candlestick timeframe, the cryptocurrency has encountered notable resistance around the $1.2046 mark. This resistance has emerged after Cardano’s remarkable 205% surge from $0.4322 in late October to $1.32 in late November. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Wave 2 And 5 Targets Put XRP At $7 And $13 Interestingly, this remarkable price surge saw Cardano form significant lows that serve as support levels for the price. Furthermore, the rally ended up with Cardano entering the overbought zone on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. The rally culminated in the Cardano price peaking at 82.87 on the RSI, but it has since retraced into a cooling/corrective period where buying pressure is consolidating at the time of writing. Cardano’s consolidation has opened up outlooks as to its next direction, with substantial buying volumes observed in recent trading sessions. Deep Correction Could Test Critical Support At $0.43 While the long-term outlook remains bullish, the analysis highlights the scenario of a deep correction that could send the Cardano price falling further in the short term. With this in mind, the analyst points to support levels that ADA may revisit in the event of a deeper correction. The first key level at $0.7683 has already proven its significance, acting as a reactionary zone in recent price movements. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 Below this, $0.4322 stands as the ultimate support for the current bullish leg. What this means is that ADA has to hold above the $0.43 support level in order for a bullish trajectory to remain valid. Failure to hold above $0.43 is likely to cascade into more price declines at this point and a change into bearish outlook. The analyst also identifies $0.3166 and $0.2427 as primary supports. These levels are Cardano’s lowest support during the previous bear market and are considered less likely to be breached in case of a longer-term decline. Despite the potential for a deep correction, Cardano’s recent market behavior and buying trends suggest a promising long-term outlook. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.912 and has increased by 2% in the past 24 hours. Once the current resistance at $1.2046 is cleared, ADA is well-positioned to challenge its $3.09 all-time high and possibly establish new highs in the current cycle.

To read full editions, subscribe . Starting next year, the SEC will operate with a smaller team of commissioners while we wait for the Senate to approve President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees. SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, both Republicans, are the only sitting commissioners who will remain with the agency after Inauguration Day. After SEC Chair Gary Gensler departs , how the agency approaches the crypto industry should see a big shift , according to Peirce. “We have a big toolkit,” Peirce said earlier this month during an appearance at the Blockchain Association Policy Summit. “We’ve always gravitated toward enforcement in this area as our tool of choice,” she added. “I think when you see new commission changes and the composition changes, then the mix of cases can change as well.” The nature of federal agencies means that some — or most, in the SEC’s case — policy discussions happen behind closed doors, Uyeda added. “That’s why we have the Administrative Procedure Act, to allow the public to comment on regulation,” he said. “That’s our accountability for the American public to provide that transparency.” In cases where agency staff issue guidance that differs from SEC rules (for example SAB 121 ), there is no public comment period. In the case of SAB 121, both chambers of Congress elected to overturn the policy, which states that digital asset custodians should report a liability and “ corresponding assets ” on their balance sheets. President Biden ultimately vetoed the resolution, however. Uyeda looks forward to the agency providing more opportunities for public input. “Writing the shift is hard because we are pretty far down this road,” Peirce said.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

Technological Developments- Cardano's advancements, such as the launch of its over-collateralized stablecoin, Djed, enhance its ecosystem's appeal, potentially driving ADA's value upward. Market Sentiment and Speculation- SHIB's price is significantly affected by investor sentiment and speculative trading, often driven by social media trends and community engagement. Network Growth and Adoption- An increase in new addresses and active users on both networks indicates rising adoption, which can positively impact their respective token values. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Trends- Overall market dynamics, including Bitcoin's performance and regulatory developments, play a crucial role in shaping the price movements of ADA and SHIB. These factors collectively contribute to the complex and dynamic price trajectories of Cardano and Shiba Inu in the cryptocurrency market. Lightchain AI Features That Set It Apart Lightchain AI distinguishes itself through several innovative features. Proof of Intelligence (PoI)- This novel consensus mechanism rewards nodes for executing valuable AI computations, such as model training and optimization, enhancing network security while advancing AI development. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM)- Serving as a dedicated computational layer, the AIVM efficiently executes AI-specific tasks on the blockchain, supporting real-time applications and ensuring seamless integration with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Transparent AI Framework- By ensuring that all AI decision-making processes are auditable and explainable, this framework fosters trust and reliability within the ecosystem. Decentralized Governance Integration- Lightchain AI empowers token holders to actively participate in decision-making processes, promoting a community-driven approach to the platform's evolution. These features collectively position Lightchain AI as a pioneering platform at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Why Lightchain AI Could Outpace ADA and SHIB Lightchain AI stands out in the blockchain space, combining innovation, scalability, and real-world utility to position itself as a project capable of surpassing Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Unlike ADA’s focus on blockchain infrastructure and SHIB’s memecoin-driven appeal, Lightchain AI integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, creating a decentralized ecosystem tailored for AI-specific tasks. Its roadmap highlights a clear path to growth. Phase 1- Prototype Development establishes core features in a controlled environment.

38110713,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633249,1735158004,"Israel approves six Bitcoin mutual funds, launching December 31","The Israel Securities Authority (ISA) just approved six Bitcoin mutual funds, all set to roll out on December 31. This is the first time Israeli investors will have access to Bitcoin-focused mutual funds. The funds, offered by Migdal Capital Markets, More, Ayalon, Phoenix Investment, Meitav, and IBI, will all go live at once, per a condition from regulators. Management fees are set between 0.25% and 1.5%, with one fund standing out by actively managing its portfolio to beat Bitcoin’s market performance. For now, transactions will be limited to once a day, although future funds may allow continuous trading. Regulators finally loosen the reins Investment firms have been begging for this moment for over a year. “The investment houses have been pleading for more than a year for ETFs to be approved and started sending prospectuses for Bitcoin funds in the middle of the year. But the regulator marches to its own tune. It has to check the details,” an anonymous investment executive told Calcalist . This follows in the footsteps of the U.S., where the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs last January. Those funds have attracted $35.6 billion in capital while Bitcoin’s value has doubled, making over five new all-time highs this year. Israel’s crypto industry has been bubbling under the surface for years. The so-called “Start-Up Nation” is home to around 174 crypto-focused companies employing 3,800 people, covering areas like blockchain development and algorithmic trading. Despite the innovation, regulatory bottlenecks have held the market back. Israeli banks are still highly skeptical of crypto transactions, citing fears of money laundering and compliance issues. Many banks won’t even process funds derived from crypto, making it a nightmare for investors to comply with tax regulations. The Israel Tax Authority (ITA) introduced a temporary measure in January to allow taxpayers to report crypto profits through special accounts. That measure has been extended until December 31, but it’s a band-aid for a much bigger problem. Alongside Bitcoin mutual funds, Israel has also gotten into Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The Bank of Israel has been working on a digital shekel, releasing an architecture paper earlier this year and launching a test environment in May. Economically, Israel is on solid ground. The country posted a $4.96 billion current account surplus in Q2 2024, thanks to strong exports and investment inflows. Analysts predict the surplus could grow to $7.8 billion by the end of the year.

Mog Coin (MOG) is making waves with its Coinbase roadmap listing, and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) continues to intrigue with its Truth Terminal AI-backed momentum. But amidst these exciting narratives, one name is attracting bulls: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Since its presale launch, BTFD Coin has surged past a jaw-dropping $4.5 million in funds raised, selling over 59 billion tokens to more than 6,600 holders.

The BTFD presale is currently in its 12th stage, offering tokens at $0.000064—a hefty 50.77% discount from the launch price of $0.0006.

Mog Coin: Meme Meets Momentum Ethereum-based Mog Coin has had a wild ride, trading at $2.56 with a market cap nearing $1 billion after its Coinbase listing roadmap announcement. This move ignited a 20% price surge, underlining the power of accessibility and credibility. However, MOG’s volatility raises questions. Bearish signals, including an RSI drop to neutral territory and EMA crossovers hinting at potential declines, leave analysts wary. With 390 trillion tokens in circulation, liquidity isn’t an issue, but sustaining upward momentum might be. Despite these challenges, Mog Coin’s community-driven energy is its trump card. A listing on Kraken, Bybit, and Bitstamp ensures broad access, catering to traders ready to weather short-term fluctuations for potential long-term gains. If meme coins thrive on hype and accessibility, MOG is making the right noise.

At its peak, GOAT hit $1.35, cementing its position as a serious contender in the meme coin world. This wasn’t just hype; Truth Terminal’s AI drove a massive wave of interest, creating a unique narrative around tech-backed tokens. While GOAT’s price has corrected, the project’s long-term potential remains intriguing. With a focus on AI adoption and a decentralised ethos, it’s carving a niche within a crowded market. Investors are drawn not just to its meme coin appeal but to the broader vision it represents—a fusion of technology and community-driven innovation. Conclusion Looking at the latest market trends and the stories unfolding in the crypto space, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is shaping up to be more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement. With its impressive presale momentum, unique ecosystem, and the 50% festive discount on offer right now, the opportunity to invest in a potential 100x winner has never been better.

As crypto enthusiasts flock to meme coins for their wild returns, three projects are stealing the spotlight: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Popcat (POPCAT). While the market is rife with speculation, BTFD Coin is turning heads with its mind-blowing presale performance—$4.5 million raised and counting—and a festive bonus that’s pure gold for smart investors. Meanwhile, Floki Inu is making waves with its metaverse rollout, and Popcat, inspired by a viral meme, continues to attract a loyal following on the Solana blockchain. Let’s break down why these are the best new meme coins to join this week and which one holds the most promise for your portfolio. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Ride the Bull and Claim the Festive Dip Imagine investing in a project that blends the resilience of Warren Buffett’s market strategy with the meme coin hype of the crypto world. That’s what BTFD Coin is delivering, and it’s nothing short of spectacular. The BTFD presale is now in its 12th stage, and early adopters are already celebrating a monumental $4.5 million raised. With over 59 billion coins sold and more than 6,600 holders on board, the BTFD community is proving that buying the dip is more than a meme—it’s a winning strategy. Features That Set BTFD Apart The BTFD project isn’t just about hype. Built on Ethereum, it offers the security, scalability, and liquidity that every serious investor craves. Its P2E game, currently in beta, is another game-changer. While rewards aren’t live in the beta, the immersive gameplay is already drawing players who see this as the next big thing in crypto gaming. Add staking rewards with a 90% APY, and you’ve got a project that combines fun with financial gains. Tokenomics is another strong suit. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, 48% allocated for presale, and staking rewards vested to maintain stability, BTFD is structured for long-term success. And let’s not forget the referral program—earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens if your referral code cracks the top 20. Why the Festive Dip Is a Golden Opportunity Inspired by the 1973 financial crash, where legends like Buffett turned chaos into wealth, BTFD is rolling back prices to $0.000064 for a limited time. With a massive 50.77% discount available until January 5, 2025, and the final listing price set at $0.0006, the potential ROI is a staggering 837.5%. For example, an investment of $4,500 in this stage could yield nearly $42,187 when the coin hits its listing price. Buying BTFD is a breeze. Connect your wallet to the BTFD presale page , don’t forget to enter the bonus code “ BIG50 ”, and grab your discounted coins before this festive deal ends. The Bulls Squad, BTFD’s vibrant community, is ready to welcome you to this movement. Floki Inu (FLOKI): From Meme Coin to Metaverse Giant Floki Inu started as a simple meme coin but has quickly evolved into a multi-faceted ecosystem. In 2024, it launched the Valhalla Metaverse game on the mainnet, a play-to-earn platform that merges gaming with NFTs. Players can earn tokens, level up, and even cash out in real-world currencies, making Floki more than just a speculative asset. Highlights of the Floki Ecosystem Beyond gaming, Floki Inu has rolled out a robust roadmap for 2024. This includes regulated digital banking accounts, Floki debit cards, and integration with DeFi protocols like Venus. These advancements show a clear intent to shift from meme coin status to a utility-driven cryptocurrency. While the token’s price has been relatively stable at $0.00017734, its community-driven initiatives continue to build momentum. However, Floki isn’t without its challenges. Critics argue that its reliance on community sentiment makes it vulnerable to market volatility. But with a strong development pipeline, it’s hard to ignore Floki Inu as a long-term contender. Popcat (POPCAT): The Meme That Keeps Popping Popcat, built on the Solana blockchain, is a crypto project that thrives on its meme origins. With a current price of $0.825076 and a history of hitting an all-time high of $2.06 in November 2024, Popcat has carved a niche for itself in the meme coin universe. Its vibrant community and viral appeal are its strongest assets, making it a favourite among younger investors. What’s Next for Popcat? While Popcat’s charm lies in its simplicity, it’s not without risks. The token’s price predictions vary widely, with analysts forecasting a potential decline to $0.80 by year-end but a surge to $10.09 by 2030. Its reliance on meme culture makes it a double-edged sword—great for viral growth but susceptible to fading interest. Despite these risks, Popcat’s loyal following and steady market performance make it a viable option for those looking to diversify their meme coin investments. Conclusion If you’re seeking to invest in the best new meme coins to join this week , BTFD Coin is the undeniable frontrunner. Its robust presale performance, innovative features like staking and P2E gaming, and a community-driven approach make it a must-watch. Floki Inu’s metaverse ambitions and Popcat’s viral appeal also deserve a place in your portfolio, but BTFD’s festive discount offers a rare chance to buy big and potentially earn huge returns. Don’t wait too long. The market waits for no one, and opportunities like these are fleeting.

A Detailed Look at Blockchain’s Top Contenders,"Solana and Lightchain AI are two rising players in the blockchain space, each with unique approaches to addressing industry challenges. Solana is well-known for its high-speed transactions and scalability, making it a favorite for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. On the other hand, Lightchain AI is breaking new ground by combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. With features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI is designed to handle complex, real-time AI-driven tasks across industries such as healthcare, finance, and supply chain. While Solana focuses on speed and scalability, Lightchain AI's innovative AI integration positions it as a game-changer for the future of decentralized technologies. For those looking to invest early, the Lightchain AI presale is live at just $0.003—a promising opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this cutting-edge blockchain. This article compares the key features and potential of both platforms, helping investors decide which is best suited for the evolving decentralized tech landscape. Technical Overview Solana Solana is a fast blockchain that uses a special way to get its quick transaction speeds. Instead of the old single-threaded method, Solana uses a many-threaded, free Proof of History (PoH) agreement mechanism. This lets side by side work and helps many deals to be checked at the same time, leading to quick block times and big ͏flow rates. Also, Solana uses a new mix of Proof of Stake (PoS) and PoH for safe and good checking of blocks. The site also has small deal costs from its improved info setup and flat growth plan. With these smart changes, Solana has done well with more than 65,000 deals each second (TPS) and a block time of 400 milliseconds. Lightchain AI Lightchain AI distinguishes itself with a technical framework that blends cutting-edge blockchain technology with the power of artificial intelligence. The platform’s architecture is designed to handle AI-driven tasks efficiently, allowing for real-time decision-making across decentralized applications. Its robust scalability solutions, such as sharding and Layer 2 integration, ensure that Lightchain AI can manage high throughput and complex AI workloads without compromising performance. Additionally, its decentralized governance model empowers the community to influence the development and evolution of the platform. By creating a system that rewards nodes for valuable AI contributions and enables seamless integration with existing AI frameworks, Lightchain AI positions itself as a leader in the next phase of blockchain evolution. This unique blend of blockchain and AI makes Lightchain AI an appealing choice for industries seeking more intelligent, efficient solutions to real-world challenges. Why Solana and Lightchain AI are Important for the Future Solana and Lightchain AI are both crucial players in the future of blockchain technology, but they take different approaches to addressing the industry’s evolving needs. Solana is recognized for its speed and scalability, offering a high-throughput platform ideal for decentralized applications and finance. Its ability to process transactions at scale with low costs positions it well for mainstream adoption. In contrast, Lightchain AI focuses on blending blockchain with artificial intelligence, offering a unique solution to tackle complex real-time AI computations on the blockchain. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) bring intelligent automation and scalability to industries like finance, healthcare, and supply chain. As blockchain continues to mature, both Solana and Lightchain AI have the potential to play pivotal roles—Solana in streamlining transactions and Lightchain AI in integrating AI to drive intelligent, decentralized solutions. Why Lightchain AI More Promising in the Long Run Lightchain AI is poised to be more promising in the long run due to its innovative integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. While Solana offers impressive scalability and speed, Lightchain AI stands out by addressing the growing demand for intelligent, decentralized solutions. The platform’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism ensures that the network rewards valuable AI computations, enabling efficient AI-driven decision-making. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) is designed to execute AI-specific tasks with high scalability, supporting industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain. This AI-powered approach creates new opportunities for decentralized applications, making Lightchain AI a key player in the future of blockchain. As industries continue to seek more advanced, AI-enhanced blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI’s ability to combine cutting-edge technology with decentralized governance positions it as a stronger contender for long-term growth compared to traditional blockchain projects like Solana. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38110182,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376092,1735157553,Binance Backs Bitcoin Payment Pilot Proposal in Thailand,"Thailand is considering a potential Bitcoin pilot project, proposed by former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, to be tested in Phuket as a tourism-focused sandbox. The proposal has received support from the Binance Thailand CEO, who sees it as a positive step for the country’s competitiveness and ability to attract tech-savvy visitors. However, despite efforts from industry advocates and some political proponents to turn the Kingdom into a digital hub, crypto payments remain outlawed in Thailand by the central bank. Thailand Warming to Crypto? The proposal “reflects not only the momentum of global crypto adoption but also demonstrates that leaders at the highest level are embracing these transformative technologies,” Nirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Gulf Binance, told the Bangkok Post before adding: “As more countries adopt digital assets and cryptocurrencies, Thailand must not be left behind,” He continued to state that given the country’s reliance on tourism and foreign inflows, “integrating cryptocurrencies into Phuket’s economy could align well with Thailand’s strategic strengths, potentially attracting tech-savvy visitors and investors.” However, there is currently a division of regulatory oversight in Thailand as payment systems come under the central bank’s jurisdiction, while digital assets are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thailand also operates under a restricted currency system, unlike countries like the United States and Japan, which have already implemented Bitcoin payments. Before implementation, several key challenges need to be addressed, and the Bank of Thailand, which has been vehemently anti-crypto in the past, will have ultimate oversight. The central bank needs to thoroughly study the risks, particularly regarding monetary flow and economic stability, and regulatory frameworks need updating through collaboration between the BoT and SEC, which could take time. Consumer protection and anti-money laundering measures also need to be established, according to the report. Foreign Access Restricted The proposal suggests starting with a controlled sandbox environment in Phuket to monitor and assess implications before considering any nationwide adoption. However, the wheels of bureaucracy rotate slowly in Thailand. Additionally, many local payment systems and platforms, such as PayPal and Binance Thailand, are not available to foreigners visiting or residing in the kingdom. Moreover, Thailand’s digital assets market is undergoing a transition from retail to a more institutional focus, Fuwattananukul said in October. At the time, the Thai securities regulator proposed rules that would allow institutional-grade mutual and private funds to invest in crypto products such as US spot crypto ETFs.

38110060,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633215,1735156858,Citi analysts predict make or break factors for crypto in 2025,"Citi analysts predict 2025 will be a transformative year for crypto, driven by ETF growth, stablecoin adoption, and a more supportive regulatory shift despite macroeconomic uncertainty. According to Business Insider’s report , Citi analysts led by Alex Saunders stated in a Friday note, “This year was a strong one for crypto, registering a 90%+ increase in the total market cap”. The cryptocurrency market surged in January 2024, with a dozen Bitcoin spot ETFs launching. Thanks to these funds, investors could trade Bitcoin more easily, fueling a positive outlook in the industry. Moreover, the central bank’s rate cuts, along with other policies, encouraged economic growth in September. On Election Day, Donald Trump’s victory was the most significant moment for digital assets. Trump himself was very supportive of cryptocurrencies, and winning his campaign generated a wave of optimism. He appointed many crypto advocates to key positions, and he named Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin reached $100,000 for the first time, thanks in part to Trump’s crypto-friendly stance. Altcoins also benefitted. The surge propelled the total cryptocurrency market to $3.4 trillion, almost double its value last year, even after some turbulence ensuing from the Federal Reserve’s hawkish comments. A favorable economic environment, but how long? Citi analysts believe high-risk trades will stay up through early 2025 against the current backdrop. However, they warn that the outlook could change later in the year as uncertainty persists over what Trump will do about the economy and stock market volatility. The Citi analysts said that “macro may turn less favorable over the rest of the year given heightened US policy uncertainty and forecasted equity volatility.” Continued growth of spot ETFs as a game changer for crypto It’s been a game-changer for the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. After years of scrutiny from the SEC, these crypto funds have made buying and selling cryptocurrency as easy as tracking prices without having to own the coins. Since July, Bitcoin ETFs have seen $36.4 billion in inflows, while Ethereum ETFs have seen $2.4 billion. “These flows have been the most significant driver of crypto returns, and we expect this to continue in 2025,” the analysts stated. Crypto as a part of a multi-asset portfolio Another focus point is the role of crypto in diverse portfolios. During this year’s rally, analysts also noted that adding Bitcoin to multi-asset portfolios did add value. Still, it’s too volatile an option. With allocations larger in percentage, crypto needs to yield much higher rates of returns than equities in the first place to justify that risk. “For a 5% allocation, performance needs to be higher – double-digits using the S&P’s longer-term risk-reward trade-off, or 21% using recent returns where the high reward/risk implies investors need to be compensated well for taking additional risks,” the Citi analysts’ note explained. The Rise of Stablecoins The momentum for stablecoins , i.e., cryptocurrencies pegged to the stability of assets like the U.S. dollar, is increasing. Trump’s victory generated optimism in the robust market for stablecoins, stimulating new issuances and partnership plans. One example is a partnership between Circle and Binance, which can threaten Tether’s lead in the space. Citi analysts see diversification as a positive step, as “it will lessen the potential for systemic risks from a specific issuer. ” They also consider how more stablecoins could be used in wider use cases to spur more adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi). Sustained growth is only possible through adoption According to the analysts, digital asset adoption has to grow if the crypto rally is to continue. Though trading volumes are high and stablecoin values have grown, widespread use of cryptocurrencies is essential. Citi analysts are monitoring Turkey, Argentina, and Venezuela, all of which are facing economic instability that has driven more people to the cash. Citi analysts expect regulation to take a pivotal turn in 2025 Trump’s administration will change the regulatory landscape . The industry is hoping for lighter regulations, and his administration has several pro-crypto appointees. But analysts forecast this will be about clarity rather than full deregulation. “The result is likely to be a shift from regulation by enforcement to a more legislative-based approach.” Analysts added it’s “less a de-regulation story; more so a removal of headwinds.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/citi-analysts-predict-make-or-break-factors-for-crypto-in-2025/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38110060.jpeg

Cardano Price Prediction & Dogecoin Whale Activity Rises As the altcoin market gears up for a projected $2.5 trillion boom, key players like Cardano, Dogecoin, and BlockDAG (BDAG) are showing impressive momentum. The Cardano price prediction highlights renewed whale interest, as large holders accumulate 160 million ADA tokens following its recent dip to $0.91. Similarly, Dogecoin whales are strategically navigating key support levels, aiming for $0.684. On the flip side, BlockDAG (BDAG), with its newly released Whitepaper V3, continues attracting crypto whales looking for the next big crypto. The whitepaper revealed key updates and insights into BlockDAG’s technology and plans for 2025. Moreover, this utility-driven project has made waves in the presale market by raising over $172 million across 26 batches, as it swiftly progresses toward its ambitious $600 million presale target. Cardano Price Prediction: Will it Break $1 and Reach $2.27? The Cardano price prediction is gaining attention as large holders accumulate 160 million ADA tokens following its drop to $0.91. With a 6% recovery, ADA is trading at $0.95, and analysts project it could reach $1.2 within a month if it breaks the crucial $1 resistance. Long-term predictions suggest a target of $2.27, making the $1 milestone pivotal for its upward momentum. While the Cardano price prediction shows potential recovery, challenges remain. Daily active users have dropped by 58%, raising questions about sustained engagement. Additionally, concerns over its ability to maintain key support at $0.90 amidst market fluctuations leave investors uncertain. Can Dogecoin Whale Activity Propel to $0.415? A recent post by @CryptoMichNL on X mentioned that the “Altcoin market capitalization has had a beautiful retest and is expected to continue to $2.5T.” This highlights the increasing momentum across altcoins, including Dogecoin, which continues to draw attention due to whale activity. Currently trading at $0.348, Dogecoin Whale movements have kept its key support level at $0.264 intact, with targets at $0.415 and $0.684. While whales often drive price surges, this reliance raises concerns about market stability. Analysts point out that Dogecoin’s limited use makes it less competitive. Additionally, its unpredictable price swings make some investors hesitant, emphasizing the need for stronger fundamentals to support long-term growth. BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3: Solving Scalability & Privacy Challenges in Crypto The upcoming altcoin boom is projected to push the market to an incredible $2.5 trillion, and all eyes are on the projects poised to lead this explosive growth. At the forefront of this movement is BlockDAG, a next-gen blockchain platform that’s redefining the crypto market. With its presale already raising over $172 million by selling more than 17.5 billion BDAG coins, BlockDAG has exceeded all expectations. Those who jumped early into the project have enjoyed a remarkable 2,240% growth in their holdings, as the BDAG coin price surged from an initial $0.001 to $0.0234 in the current batch. Adding to its appeal, BlockDAG’s newly released Whitepaper V3 has captivated developers and whales alike, detailing innovative advancements that address scalability, privacy, and compatibility challenges. By integrating the UTXO model for private payments and the account-based model for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, BlockDAG offers the perfect hybrid environment for DeFi, dApps, and NFTs. The whitepaper also highlighted the Phantom GhostDAG protocol, which introduces a partially ordered transaction system that reduces fees while maintaining transaction integrity, setting a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency. This innovation is fueling a surge of interest among crypto enthusiasts, propelling a rapid increase in presale funding. Market analysts are now optimistic that BlockDAG could reach its $600 million presale target before than anticipated. With the demand for BDAG coins surging, the current presale batch is on the verge of closing soon, which will trigger a significant price increase in the next one. For those eyeing this rapidly expanding crypto giant, now could be the perfect time to act before prices soar and BlockDAG becomes as hard to access as other major crypto market leaders. What is the Next Big Crypto? The altcoin market is heating up with Cardano price prediction suggesting a renewed whale accumulation, while Dogecoin whale activity drives key support levels. However, the spotlight is shifting to BlockDAG, which is setting a new standard with its latest Whitepaper V3 and presale success. With its presale smashing the $172 million mark, BlockDAG is rapidly approaching its $600 million target. For those still questioning what is the next big crypto, BlockDAG is emerging as a clear contender, offering unmatched growth potential.

According to a recent report, over 30% of its population is now engaged in crypto investments. As of November 2024, the number of crypto investors soared to 15.59 million. Analysts revealed that South Korea’s crypto market has hit an incredible value of 102.6 trillion won, equivalent to $78 billion. This is driven by economic optimism and booming global blockchain trends. South Korea Explosive Crypto Growth Multiple factors drive the surge in South Korea’s crypto investments. This includes a combination of market sentiment and global political changes. One key event that significantly influenced this shift was Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Following his win, investor optimism soared, particularly in sectors like digital assets. This surge in confidence led South Korean investors to diversify their portfolios increasingly. Many turned to digital currencies to safeguard or grow their wealth. Between July and November 2024, South Korea’s crypto market experienced a dramatic increase in value. The total market capitalization nearly doubled, rising from 58 trillion won, about $44 billion, to a whopping 102.6 trillion won, equivalent to almost $78 billion. South Korean investors now hold an average of 6.58 million won in digital assets. This reflects growing trust in crypto as a mainstream, long-term investment. South Korea’s Exchange Trading Volumes Rival Stock Markets Amid Scrutiny South Korea’s top five crypto exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and GoPax, saw a remarkable daily volume. Together, these exchanges raked in a daily trading volume of nearly 15 trillion won in November 2024. This achievement rivals the daily trading volume of the country’s traditional stock markets . This growth highlights the crypto sector’s maturity and appeal to retail and institutional investors. However, market stability and consumer protection concerns have led lawmakers to push for stricter regulations. In July 2024, the government enacted the Virtual Asset User Protection Act (VAUPA) to set clear exchange standards. This is to improve transparency in trading and protect users from fraud and hacking. The government also plans to regulate cross-border crypto transactions . This includes mandatory registration and reporting to combat money laundering and illicit activities. South Korea; A Nation at the Forefront of Blockchain Innovation South Korea is a leader in blockchain and cryptocurrency, not just in market participation.The country has also adopted blockchain across industries like finance, healthcare, and logistics. The government’s support for innovation has encouraged both startups and established companies to explore blockchain. Looking ahead, analysts predict the South Korean crypto market will grow at 15.7% annually. By 2030, it could reach $635.4 million in revenue. This growth will depend on the government’s ability to balance innovation with market stability.

With its unique focus on AI, Lightchain AI addresses the growing demand for smart, decentralized solutions that can handle complex tasks. The presale , currently priced at $0.003, provides early investors with an opportunity to secure tokens before the platform’s full launch. As AI continues to gain momentum, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach positions it to potentially outperform established players like Solana and Ethereum in the upcoming bull run. Which One Will Champion the Bull Run? While Ethereum, Solana, and Lightchain AI each bring unique strengths to the table, it is difficult to predict which one will emerge as the champion of the next bull run. Ethereum’s established network and community give it a significant advantage, but Solana’s high-speed transactions and scalability also make it a strong contender. However, Lightchain AI presents a fresh perspective in the blockchain space with its integration of artificial intelligence, offering real-world solutions for various industries. And better yet, its presale provides an opportunity for early investors to potentially reap substantial gains as the market rallies. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38109368,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633258,1735155601,"Bitcoin ends the year with gains, but mining stocks are deeply in the red","Public mining companies have posted deep losses in 2024, based on data from Hashrate Index, tracking the biggest miners and data center operators. Despite the new all-time highs for Bitcoin (BTC), the shares of most mining entities are on track to end the year in the red. Not all publicly traded mining companies are sharing in the success of MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, or Hut8. The stocks of most mining entities are on track to end the year in the red. The stock market performance of mining companies shows deep losses for the year to date, based on data collection by Hashrate Index. A total of 17 companies out of 25 publicly traded miners were in the red as of December 25, though some still have a chance to turn the trend by the end of the year. MicroStrategy (MSTR) remains the exception, starting the year at $68 and rallying to a peak of $473.83 in November. As of December 25, MSTR traded at $358.18, though its price performance depended on its ongoing buying of more BTC. Mining companies try to diversify into new data-based tasks Argo Blockchain Plc had the deepest losses, erasing 82.92% of its share price, down to $0.0615. The miner has not taken track of building up a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury and only has three coins in its reserves. Argo is a hosted mining company, a new model that relies on renting out electricity, rack, and cooling access, as well as delivering and installing ASIC on behalf of users. One of the biggest winners for 2024 is also a hosted mining company – Bitdeer Technologies Group. BTDR shares are up by 165.32%, trading at $23.56. BTDR holds 443 BTC, a small treasury from mining and not from acquisitions. As a contrast, Hut8 shares expanded by 92.7% in the year to date, trading at $24.28, slightly down from their peak of over $29. Hut8 also expanded its BTC acquisitions with debt financing. The other winner was Iris Energy Ltd, which shifted to investments in data centers. TeraWulf is another winner with 170.87% growth, based on its previous commitment to expand to AI data centers. WULF shares traded at $6.23, near their highest level for the past six months. WULF also got a boost from its attempt at carbon-neutral mining. For most miners, production prices vary and some are weighed down by costs. For others, the current BTC prices are favorable for realizing profits and financing future projects. Miners retain 1.9M BTC, down from over 2.02M in August 2024. Mining as a whole is not always a good proxy for the performance of BTC, and mining companies are facing different pressures. While individual shares were volatile, the overall HI Crypto Mining Stock Index retained relatively high levels in 2024. The index ended the year at 5,330.37 points, up from 4,234.18 points in January. The HI Crypto Mining Index posted net growth in 2024, though slowing down at the end of the year. | Source: Solactive The index includes chip producers and mining-related companies and has been rising for both 2023 and 2024, recovering after its 2021 and 2022 crashes. The index also includes the most prominent mining companies, though the selection may differ from the selection of Hashrate Index. BTC mining activity remains at peak levels BTC mining activity is showing no signs of slowing down or capitulation. Mining companies are using some of their proceeds to acquire new ASIC while retaining their previous contracts for energy access. The BTC hashrate is at over 770 EH/s, near all-time highs. Miners also produce blocks at the absolute highest difficulty, with constant growth over the past year. Individual miners, farms, companies, and even governments are also trying to mine with the most competitive pools. At the end of 2024, Foundry USA is the biggest pool, controlling over 31% of the total hashrate. Foundry is the choice for most mining companies that produce coins for their own reserves. The closest competitors Antpool and ViaBTC make up another 30% of mining. Binance Pool remains competitive but shuts down capacity during unfavorable conditions.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field.

38110647,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322708,1735153758,PENGU Meme Coin Surges 28% as Pudgy Penguins Creator Takes Shots at Dogecoin – Can it Overtake DOGE?,"Amid a stagnant crypto market, PENGU, the meme coin tied to Pudgy Penguins, has become a standout performer, surging by 28% in a single day. The rise is part of a broader narrative where creator Luca Netz aims to challenge the dominance of Dogecoin (DOGE), calling it a “bad assumption” that DOGE will hold its top position forever. According to Netz, Pudgy Penguins’ potential, especially in the cultural realm, has been vastly underestimated, and it could become the next big thing in the meme coin sector. The price surge comes as PENGU garners attention from both retail and institutional investors, with whale accumulation playing a key role. On-chain data reveals that a newly created wallet amassed 519.99 million PENGU tokens worth $14.72 million on Binance. This spike in demand is reflective of growing interest in the token, fueled by its meme coin appeal and the backing of its creator’s visionary plans. PENGU’s Vision: A Cultural Phenomenon Luca Netz has set his sights on making Pudgy Penguins more than just a meme. He believes that unlike other meme coins that have plateaued, Pudgy Penguins has the potential to break into mainstream culture. Netz compares the vision for Pudgy Penguins to the success of Dogecoin and the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which have managed to transcend crypto and establish themselves as pop culture icons. To achieve this, Netz envisions a future for Pudgy Penguins that includes a movie, TV show, and a blockbuster game. This roadmap sets a bold trajectory for the project, especially as the meme coin sector continues to grow in popularity. PENGU’s 28% surge suggests that investors are beginning to believe in this vision, positioning the coin as a viable contender to challenge established players like DOGE.

38108110,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314136,1735153558,"Russian Companies Now Using Bitcoin (BTC) for Foreign Trade, According to Finance Minister: Report","The Finance Minister of Russia has reportedly confirmed that many companies in the country are now using Bitcoin ( BTC ) to engage in foreign trade and skirt Western sanctions. Reuters reports that the Russian government has recently taken legislative measures to legalize the mining of the crypto king and other crypto assets, helping firms find ways around sanctions placed on them by the West. As stated by Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov to Reuters earlier this week, “As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions). Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further. I am confident this will happen next year.” Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the US government was undermining the use of the US dollar as a reserve currency, forcing nations to turn to other assets. At the time, Putin cited Bitcoin as the top replacement for the US dollar as a reserve asset, noting that no nation could regulate it. However, earlier this week, the Russian government reportedly said it’s planning on shutting down Bitcoin mining in 10 different regions throughout the nation starting on January 1, 2025 due to energy shortages. The prohibition period affects both miners of mining pools and is expected to remain in effect until March 5th, 2031. BTC is trading for $98,505 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

Toncoin (TON), the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), has garnered significant attention for its integration with the Telegram ecosystem and its focus on seamless payments and scalability. However, Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a new blockchain project blending artificial intelligence with decentralized technology, is emerging as a formidable challenger. With its groundbreaking features, Lightchain AI might not only rival Toncoin but potentially render it obsolete by 2025. Toncoin’s Strengths and Limitations Toncoin has positioned itself as a versatile cryptocurrency focused on decentralized payments and integrations with Telegram’s massive user base. It offers low fees and fast transactions, making it an attractive choice for everyday users and developers. Toncoin’s Strengths Seamless Integration Toncoin’s close ties with Telegram provide a direct path to millions of users. Fast Transactions With its dynamic sharding technology, Toncoin achieves high throughput and scalability. User-Friendly Ecosystem Its integration into Telegram simplifies onboarding for non-technical users. Limitations Restricted Use Cases Toncoin’s utility remains largely confined to payments and basic decentralized applications. Dependency on Telegram Toncoin’s growth is closely tied to Telegram’s ecosystem, which limits its broader appeal. Limited Innovation While efficient, Toncoin lacks groundbreaking features to distinguish itself in the rapidly evolving blockchain space. Lightchain AI’s Innovative Edge Lightchain AI (LCAI) stands out as a groundbreaking platform by merging blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, creating a decentralized ecosystem tailored for real-world impact. Its special traits, like the Memecoin Launchpad, give a fun and safe space for token growth helping money-making chances for users. The staking setup helps community take part allowing users to get rewards while joining in the rule choic͏es ensuring a fair and clear system. With a clear plan, LCAI aims at linking different chains, growing its community, and providing solutions for specific fields like health care and money. Its token model that loses value over time, along with new ideas, helps keep growth steady. By solving issues of size, honesty, and real use, Lightchain AI sets itself up as a leader in the blockchain area offering a benefit that is not matched by other companies. Comparing Lightchain AI and Toncoin Feature Toncoin (TON) Lightchain AI (LCAI) Core Utility Payments and Telegram integrations AI-powered dApps across industries Consensus Mechanism Proof of Stake Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Scalability High, using dynamic sharding High, optimized for AI workloads Tokenomics Fixed supply Deflationary with token burning Market Dependency Telegram ecosystem Cross-industry appeal While Toncoin focuses on convenience and integration, Lightchain AI addresses a much broader range of challenges with its AI-driven innovations, offering a platform that appeals to developers, enterprises, and industries beyond payments. Could Lightchain AI Make Toncoin Obsolete? By 2025, the blockchain market will likely prioritize projects that combine scalability, utility, and innovation. Lightchain AI’s ability to bridge artificial intelligence and blockchain could overshadow Toncoin’s limited ecosystem. Its focus on real-world applications, coupled with a scalable and productive consensus model, ensures sustained relevance in a competitive market. Toncoin’s dependency on Telegram, while a strength, may also limit its long-term growth. If Lightchain AI successfully executes its roadmap—culminating in the widespread adoption of its AI-powered ecosystem—it could outpace Toncoin in both utility and market share, making Toncoin appear outdated in comparison. A Shift in Blockchain Landscape? Toncoin has carved out a niche with its payment solutions and Telegram integration, but its scope remains narrow. Lightchain AI (LCAI) , with its innovative features like Proof of Intelligence and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine, brings a fresh perspective to blockchain’s potential. As the blockchain industry shifts toward utility-driven projects, Lightchain AI’s ability to address real-world problems gives it a competitive edge that could challenge, and possibly eclipse, Toncoin’s relevance by 2025. For investors and developers looking for the next big thing, Lightchain AI represents an opportunity to be part of a platform that could redefine the future of decentralized technology. While Toncoin’s future remains uncertain, Lightchain AI’s potential cannot be ignored. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38108167,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631381,1735153200,Affordable Cryptocurrencies with High Growth Potential Transform Small Investments into Fortunes,"In a market dominated by pricey tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum, finding affordable cryptocurrencies with huge potential can feel like a challenge. However, emerging projects like Lightchain AI Presale are proving that small investments can lead to big rewards. For those who missed out on the early days of top-tier coins, these low-cost assets provide a second chance to turn modest investments into significant profits. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Leveraging AI for Exponential Growth What It Offers Lightchain AI (LCAI) stands out by merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, enabling developers to build AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps). At a presale price of just $0.003, LCAI provides unprecedented upside potential. Key Features Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) A dedicated layer crafted for AI-specific tasks like model training and inference, seamlessly integrated into the blockchain. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) A groundbreaking consensus mechanism that doesn’t just secure the network but also rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations. Scalability That Delivers With advanced features like sharding and Layer 2 solutions, Lightchain AI ensures high-speed, high-throughput AI tasks without breaking a sweat. Unmatched Privacy & Security In a world where data is king, Lightchain AI takes privacy and security to the next level Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) Keep sensitive data fully protected during computations, building trust for both developers and users. Homomorphic Encryption Perform computations on encrypted data without ever exposing it—ensuring your data stays confidential every step of the way. Growth Prospects If LCAI’s technology and roadmap milestones are realized, early adopters who buy in at $0.003 could see dramatic returns—potentially turning a few hundred dollars into substantial wealth. Manta Network (MANTA) Privacy Solutions for DeFi With privacy becoming a big worry in DeFi, Manta Network gives safe deals and keeps users hidden on the chain, which helps small investors join DeFi too with its trade cost under a dollar. MANTA’s aim on privacy is really nice, using zero-know proofs to keep user info and trade plans secret. With DeFi use still getting bigger the need for privacy-based answers seems to grow, putting MANTA as a main part in this key market spot. By focusing on privacy, MANTA can pull in both shops and big money players, raising need and maybe giving great profits to first back͏ers. Casper (CSPR) Enterprise-Grade Blockchain for Future Growth Casper (CSPR) offers an enterprise-friendly blockchain that is upgradeable, scalable, and energy-efficient, making it an appealing choice for companies seeking secure, professional-grade blockchain solutions. Often priced well under $1, Casper’s foundational technology positions it as a strong contender in the blockchain market. As businesses increasingly explore blockchain integration, Casper’s reliable infrastructure could emerge as a go-to platform, boosting token utility and value. Its methodical approach and focus on sustainability may also provide more predictable growth, attracting investors with a moderate risk appetite. While Casper might not deliver overnight riches, its steady trajectory and enterprise focus could lead to impressive long-term returns for patient early investors. Memecoin Contenders Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) may not be known for cutting-edge technology, but they boast devoted communities and a strong social media presence. With low prices, they serve as accessible entry points into the crypto world. These memecoins remain relevant thanks to the power of their communities, driven by viral marketing, celebrity endorsements, and a sense of fun that fuels occasional price surges. Their affordability and widespread name recognition make them particularly appealing to new crypto investors, ensuring both liquidity and ongoing interest. While they offer less utility compared to projects like LCAI or MANTA, memecoins can still deliver significant short-term gains during market hype cycles, though they come with higher volatility and unpredictability. Lightchain AI Presale An Opportunity That Can’t Be Missed Lightchain AI (LCAI) is currently conducting a presale of its native tokens, presenting a compelling opportunity for early investors to participate in a project that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. As of December 20, 2024, the presale is in its sixth stage, with tokens priced at $0.003 each. The price is set to increase to $0.003375 in the next phase, indicating a structured approach to token distribution. The presale has garnered significant attention, raising $2.2 million to date, reflecting strong investor confidence in the project’s potential. Investors can participate in the presale by visiting the official Lightchain AI website and following the outlined steps to purchase tokens using Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT). Given the increasing interest and the upcoming price increment, potential investors are encouraged to act promptly to secure tokens at the current rate.

This comes amidst improved crypto regulatory framework across many major jurisdictions, including Europe. It is Noteworthy that the Middle Eastern country was inspired by this positive global sentiment and refused to be left behind by its counterparts. By February 25, 2025, Turkey’s new regulatory framework will become effective. Turkey to Combat Laundering of Illicit Funds Following the introduction of the crypto regulatory framework, any transaction above 15,000 Turkish liras, which is approximately $425, is expected to be properly reported. Users executing such transactions must share their identifying information with Turkey’s crypto service providers. They are not under any obligation to report details of digital asset transfers below the $425 threshold. By implementing this new Anti Money Laundering (AML) rule, Turkey intends to reduce the occurrence of risky transactions involving cryptocurrencies. This includes the incident of crypto scams, laundering of illicit funds as well as terrorism financing, as reported in the document issued by the Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey, EU to Implement MiCA by December 30 There is a general rise in the global demand for cryptocurrencies and crypto-related solutions. Consequently, many jurisdictions are putting measures to ensure the sector does not go out of hand. In about five days, the European Union (EU) will welcome the much-anticipated world’s first comprehensive crypto regulatory framework dubbed the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill. Like the new Turkish digital asset regulation, MiCA is focused on combating illicit activities like money laundering. A few experts think the bill may kick Europe out of a potential incoming crypto boom , but the region remains undisturbed. Rather, it is preparing to implement the bill that requires all stablecoins to be issued by entities with an e-money license. US Crypto Regulation Landscape to Take a Different Turn On the other hand, the United States is taking a different approach to cryptocurrencies. With Republican politician Donald Trump coming into office by January, the crypto landscape in the region is expected to change. He even plans to dethrone Gary Gensler as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman. Trump has already nominated Paul Atkins as the replacement for Gensler. Trump has promised to establish a dedicated crypto advisory council, and many crypto leaders are pushing to get a seat.

Prices are climbing, and investors are searching for the next big opportunity. This festive period might be the perfect time to explore promising altcoins.

This sensational all-sports meme token has hit the market with unstoppable momentum, knocking out weak competitors and scammy cryptos. As it charges ahead, XYZ is set to deliver jaw-dropping gains, leaving the likes of BOME and WIF far behind. With eyes on a staggering 9,900% growth, XYZ is ready to claim the meme coin crown in the next crypto bull marathon! 💸 Rule the game, cash in as the bets roll in 💸 XYZ is the star player in XYZVerse – the ultimate fusion of sports thrill and meme culture. This community-centered ecosystem is the perfect playground for crypto degens and sports fans alike. Think back to Polymarket's $1 billion trading volume during the US elections betting frenzy, and now, picture that on steroids with XYZVerse. With millions of sport bettors getting ready to jump in the action, opportunities for early investors in XYZ are really huge! XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, launched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, has revolutionized the blockchain world. It's known for its smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps). With platforms like Arbitrum and Polygon enhancing transaction efficiency, Ethereum remains at the forefront of innovation. In 2022, it transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, aiming for greater scalability and energy efficiency. The upcoming sharding phase promises to reduce costs and improve performance. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that powers this ecosystem, playing a crucial role in transactions and rewarding those who support the network. Looking at market trends, Ethereum shows significant potential. Based on historical movements and Bitcoin's halving cycles, some predict ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, estimates suggest a yearly low of $2,700.31. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum's continuous development and commitment to decentralization make it stand out. In the current market cycle, with its evolving technology and ambitious roadmap, ETH presents an interesting opportunity for those watching the crypto space. PEPE (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency scene, launched as a deflationary memecoin on Ethereum. Inspired by the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s, it embraces the fun and viral nature of internet culture. PEPE aims to join the ranks of famous meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a straightforward approach, it appeals to those who appreciate simplicity in the crypto world. In the spring of 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap hitting a peak of $1.6 billion. Early holders saw incredible gains, and a strong community of supporters grew around it. This rise sparked what some call a ""memecoin season,"" where many meme-based coins saw dramatic ups and downs. PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a goal of a ""meme takeover."" While it's uncertain if PEPE will reach new heights in the current market cycle, its rapid ascent mirrors the trends of other successful meme coins, capturing the attention and hope of many in the crypto community. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful spin on Dogecoin, inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous ""Ryoshi,"" SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, granting it access to Ethereum's vast ecosystem. Out of a quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to build credibility. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, removing them from circulation. These actions boosted SHIB's standing in the crypto world. SHIB sets itself apart with its technological capabilities. Being on Ethereum allows it to support projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a governance system for holders. In today's market, where utility matters, SHIB's expanding ecosystem may attract investors. Though it began as a meme, its growth and Ethereum integration could make it more appealing than other meme coins. As trends favor functionality, SHIB's prospects look promising. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is turning heads in the cryptocurrency landscape as a flexible and sustainable blockchain platform tailored for smart contracts. This innovative network empowers developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games with greater ease and efficiency. At its core is ADA, Cardano's native cryptocurrency, which stands as a formidable rival to Ethereum's ETH. ADA enables users to store value, make payments, and engage in staking on the Cardano network, contributing to a more decentralized and secure ecosystem. What truly sets Cardano apart is its commitment to environmental sustainability. By utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, Cardano operates with significantly improved energy efficiency compared to the energy-intensive proof-of-work models used by some other cryptocurrencies. Its unique architecture divides the blockchain into two layers—the Cardano Settlement Layer for handling transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This design enhances its capability to process potentially up to a million transactions per second. Since the introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021, the platform has established a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. In a rapidly evolving crypto market, Cardano's innovative technology and sustainable approach position it as a noteworthy player to watch. Conclusion ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and ADA are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims higher, blending meme culture and sports in a community-driven platform targeting 20,000% growth this bull run.

Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum's ETH, allowing users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network.

The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts, enhancing transaction processing capability potentially up to a million transactions per second. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. Cardano's innovative approach and technological advancements position it prominently in the evolving cryptocurrency market. Solana (SOL): A High-Speed Blockchain Platform for Scalable DApps Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability, focusing on fast transactions and support for decentralized applications.

Uniswap's UNI Token: Governance in Decentralized Exchange Uniswap's UNI token is a governance token launched in September 2020.

Uniswap distributed 150 million UNI tokens to past users, with each receiving 400 UNI tokens worth over $1,000 at launch. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain, operating since 2018. It uses an automated liquidity protocol, enabling trading without an order book and giving users control of their funds. Its open-source nature and free token listing set it apart. Uniswap is the fourth-largest DeFi platform with over $3 billion in assets. The UNI token's role in governance and the platform's innovation make it potentially attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion While ADA, SOL, SUI, and UNI may offer less immediate gains, DOGEN stands out. It's designed for those seeking luxury and success, with expected 700% growth by presale's end and potential for thousand-fold returns.

From artificial intelligence (AI) to decentralized finance ( DeFi ) infrastructure and education, developers can apply for a promising 2025. “Growth Games presents an important acceleration milestone for MultiversX and the broader blockchain community,” said Beniamin Mincu, Co-Founder of the MultiversX Foundation. “This $1.5 million initiative is a call to innovators and builders to build, accelerate, and launch the products that will make our lives better. ” As described in the program, the Growth Games will go beyond just funding these projects to offer mentorship, marketing, and strategic support to the approved participants.

First, “Build” will receive 50% of the grants, paying up to $750,000 to crypto developers who apply to one or more of the available Requests for Proposals ( RFPs ). The RFPs list requests for blockchain-based AI and AI agents, DeFi, infrastructure and tooling, education, and other decentralized solutions. In the meantime, developers already active in the MultiversX ecosystem can look for growth through the “Accelerate” program. This grants category has $250,000 in funding for “established builders looking to scale their projects to new heights.” Finally, $500,000 are reserved for startups ready to give their next step and participate at the xLaunchpad. “Launch” will deploy this funding together with the EGLD community in the public launchpad, which has successfully seen millions of dollars deployed to community-funded startups.

Here is a Compilation of Predictions,"As 2025 approaches, the cryptocurrency world is once again awash with bold predictions about the future of Bitcoin. So, industry giants like Cathie Wood, Mike Novogratz, and Michael Saylor have frequently made headlines with their predictions, but how well did their 2024 predictions come true? Here's a look at some of the top predictions and how they performed against reality. While crypto executives are rarely pessimistic, some have taken a more cautious stance on Bitcoin’s 2024 trajectory. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and head of the Maelstrom Fund, predicted in late 2023 that Bitcoin would climb to around $70,000 by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, VanEck and analysts at Bitwise have predicted that Bitcoin will reach new all-time highs without committing to exact figures. By the fourth quarter of 2024, Bitcoin had indeed surpassed previous highs, breaking through the $100,000 mark for the first time. While Hayes downplayed the bull run, his broader outlook remained optimistic, with predictions that Bitcoin could reach $750,000 to $1 million by 2026. Others were more ambitious and less accurate. Tim Draper, known for his relentless bullishness, has long been a proponent of Bitcoin’s potential to explode. In 2018, he claimed that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by 2022. When that didn’t happen, he extended the timeline to 2023, then 2024, citing the momentum from the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs as a major driver. By November, Draper revised his forecast again, predicting $120,000 by December 2024. Similarly, analysts at Matrixport and Standard Chartered have also changed their forecasts throughout the year. Both had predicted a Bitcoin price of $125,000, but ended up settling for a more modest result. Related News: Whales Show Suspicious Activity in This Altcoin: Fresh Whales Bought $34 Million in the Last Five Days Among the boldest forecasters, Cathie Wood, Mike Novogratz, and Michael Saylor stood out. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, once claimed that Bitcoin would reach $500,000 by 2024. However, as the year progressed, he scaled back his expectations and eventually predicted $100,000, which came pretty close to the actual figure. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, a firm with a history of aggressive Bitcoin investments, has maintained its forecasts of $500,000 by 2026 and $1 million by 2030. While those long-term targets remain under test, ARK’s short-term outlook has been less emphasized. Then there’s Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy and the face of Bitcoin maximalism. Saylor’s eye-popping prediction of $13 million per Bitcoin by 2045 remains one of the boldest statements in the space. But for 2024, he remained focused on accumulation rather than specific price points. The guessing game continues as the industry’s biggest names look to 2025 and beyond. VanEck sees more records on the horizon, while analysts like Noelle Acheson predict Bitcoin will surpass $125,000 next year. *This is not investment advice.

This article will explore what makes FXGuys a high-potential altcoin, what’s driving the buzz, and why it could be the next big thing in the crypto market. FXGuys: The high-potential altcoin with real utility FXGuys is gaining attention mainly because of its practical utility and smart approach. Unlike many altcoins that rely on speculation or hype alone, FX Guys has been designed with real-world applications in mind. As a Top PropFi Project, FXGuys blends the best aspects of DeFi with a proprietary trading firm model, allowing users to invest in the token and actively engage in profitable trading. One of the key selling points of FXGuys is its Trade2Earn program. This feature rewards users with FXG tokens every time they trade, helping to boost trading activity and liquidity. This built-in incentive structure helps grow the platform’s ecosystem while ensuring participants are continually rewarded for their engagement. Staking FXG for passive income and revenue share FXGuys goes beyond just a simple trading platform, it’s an ecosystem that rewards long-term participation.

This staking feature creates an attractive opportunity for investors and traders to earn passive income on top of their trading activities. For those looking to maximize their returns, this staking model provides a clear incentive to hold FXG tokens rather than selling them off immediately. The combination of staking rewards and the opportunity to earn a share of trading profits positions the FXguys as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in the market. FXGuys’ trader funding program: The path to up to $500,000 in capital Another key feature that sets FX Guys apart is its Trader Funding Program . This program allows talented retail traders to access funded accounts with up to $500,000 in trading capital after passing a series of evaluations and challenges. Once funded, traders keep 80% of the profits, a generous profit split that makes FXGuys one of the most attractive proprietary trading firms in the crypto space. This program provides traders with a way to scale their trading activities without having to risk their capital. For those who have the skill but lack the capital to trade at a larger scale, FX Guys offers a platform where they can grow their profits while minimizing personal risk. This unique offering has earned FXGuys a reputation as a smart prop trader platform, and it’s one of the driving factors behind the project’s growing buzz. Interested investors can join FXGUYS here.

Meanwhile, capital is flowing into emerging projects like Chainlink (LINK) and DTX Exchange (DTX), both of which are gaining momentum with their innovative features and promising returns. Let’s dive deeper into what’s driving these trends. Ripple at a Crossroads: Will $2 Support Hold, or Is a Bigger Dip Coming? There has been a lot of volatility in XRP's price trend over the last month. The coin fluctuated in a somewhat limited range due to regulatory barriers and shifting market sentiment; it most recently traded around $0.60 after falling from a peak of $0.80. However, seasoned investors claim that this is nothing new. Sarah Greene, a crypto expert, states, ""We've seen it before."" After extended periods of consolidation and negative momentum, XRP frequently recovers quickly. ""The way this pattern looks mirrors the setup on the run that we saw in late 2021."" This week marks the fourth anniversary of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple Labs, co-founder Chris Larsen, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The legal dispute has had a major impact on XRP and its investors since December 2020, changing the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Currently, Ripple (XRP) is trading at $2.23, experiencing a dip of over 17% in the past week. XRP’s price is nearing its crucial price support of $2, which, if Ripple (XRP) fails to hold, then investors can expect a larger dip to $1 or below. Due to their long-ongoing battle with the SEC and prolonged bearish sentiment around the project, Ripple (XRP), investors have started to rotate their capital to more innovative and profitable projects. These projects include Chainlink (LINK) and DTX Exchange (DTX). LINK Gains Momentum: 16 New Integrations Driving Demand Chainlink (LINK), a blockchain abstraction layer, makes it possible for smart contracts to connect with external data—a crucial feature for intricate digital contracts. Chainlink's significance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem is cemented by the fact that its decentralized oracle network underpins a number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. With 16 new integrations across 11 chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, recent adoption updates highlight Chainlink's expanding impact. These collaborations boost its capabilities and reach, which might lead to a rise in demand for its Oracle services. The price of LINK increased by 3.43% on the last day, which is in line with this network activity and indicates that even in a weak market, investor interest is high. With a volume-to-market cap ratio of 0.1089, Chainlink's liquidity is still strong, guaranteeing investors may trade with ease. It has maintained good momentum, as seen by its 53% green days during the past month. Chainlink may appeal to investors looking for a balance of innovation and consistent performance. Transforming Trading Forever: Why DTX Exchange Is the Project to Watch As capital rotates from Ripple (XRP), another altcoin is seeing a major surge in demand - DTX Exchange (DTX) . DTX is the crypto world’s first unified exchange, which will offer stocks, cryptos, ETFs, and forex all under the same roof. It will save you from the hassle of managing multiple platforms for different asset classes. This feature of managing multiple assets in a single place is enabled by its VulcanX blockchain. This blockchain is made to interact with conventional assets like stocks and forex. With an anticipated TPS of more than 100,000, the blockchain has already started the testnet. DTX exchange introduced its token to the public through its presale, which launched at $0.01 per DTX token. Now, it stands at a $0.12 price point, translating a price jump of over 500%. This sharp price hike is attributed to the innovative features that DTX Exchange is offering. These include over 1000x liquidity model, phoenix wallet introduction, community-driven growth, listing on well-known platforms, and a lot more. Early investors of the DTX Exchange (DTX) presale have already enjoyed over 440% ROI over the past few months and are now all set to enjoy additional 80% gains in the subsequent presale rounds till the official listing. The presale has already collected over $10.5M and is now nearing its conclusion.

It includes 18,000 unstaked Ethereum worth over $70.8 million moved to the exchange on Dec. 13. “A whale (related to #Nexo) deposited 4,946 $ETH ($17.2M) to #Binance again in the past hour. Since Dec 2, #Nexo has deposited a total of 114,262 $ETH ($423.3M) into #Binance at an average price of $3,705.” Lookonchain The Ethereum market has witnessed a significant offloading by whales in recent weeks.

While the transactions aren’t much of a panic selling, the whale’s behaviour adds to similar sell-offs seen in the past month. A number of large wallets have dumped ETH as the altcoin struggled to break higher. With BTC price retreating from its all-time high above $108k, Ethereum dropped to below $3,200. The gains to nearly $4,000 earlier provided a profit-taking opportunity. Some addresses took the cash, contributing to the decline and struggle engulfing bulls. Other than Nexo, which has been active in recent days, some notable sellers have included the Ethereum Foundation. Justin Sun, Tron’s founder, has also been aggressive.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/winter-pepe-pepewint-will-skyrocket-over-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38107001,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322701,1735150876,"Russia Expands Use of Bitcoin in Foreign Trade, Says Finance Minister","Russia is ramping up its use of digital financial assets (DFAs), including Bitcoin, in international trade. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed the development on Dec. 25 in an interview with Russia-24, a state-owned news channel. Overcoming Sanctions: How Russia Uses Bitcoin in Trade with China Businesses in Russia are increasingly using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for international trade. This move is part of a broader effort to bypass Western sanctions and navigate challenges in global commerce. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed the shift today , citing recent legislative changes that allow the use of cryptocurrencies for foreign payments. Russia has faced growing difficulties in conducting trade with major partners like China. Many banks are cautious about transactions with Russian entities, fearing potential repercussions from Western regulators. In response, Russia has embraced cryptocurrencies as an alternative. Siluanov revealed that Russia has passed legislation allowing DFAs and Bitcoin to be used in foreign trade. He stated that such transactions are underway and that the government plans to scale their implementation further. The minister emphasized that utilizing DFAs as an alternative to the U.S. dollar in foreign trade is both practical and forward-looking. He described it as a step toward modernizing global settlement systems. “This is the future,” Siluanov said, noting that Russia’s experimental legal framework for DFAs, implemented in September 2024, permits these practices. He further explained: “We can pay for goods with DFAs. It’s also possible to use Bitcoin mined within Russia under this regime.” Siluanov highlighted that the regulatory groundwork is complete and that such transactions are already taking place. He expressed optimism about the next development phase, stating, “These activities will grow. By next year, it will be a reality.” Putin Challenges U.S. Dollar Dominance, Sees Bitcoin as an Alternative Despite embracing Bitcoin for trade, Siluanov has advised caution regarding cryptocurrency investments. Speaking at an educational event in November, he warned the public against seeing crypto as a source of quick profits. He said: “I don’t recommend cryptocurrency as a means of investment. There are safer ways to invest and achieve good returns.” At the time, Bitcoin had surged past $76,000 and was nearing the $100,000 mark . Siluanov’s comments reflect the government’s dual approach to crypto: supporting its use in trade while urging caution in personal investments. Russia has advanced its cryptocurrency framework this year to boost international trade. In August, the country legalized crypto mining , including Bitcoin. President Vladimir Putin has criticized the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global finance, accusing the U.S. of weaponizing its currency. Putin suggested that Bitcoin offers an alternative as it operates outside government control. Despite expanding crypto use, Russia has imposed regional mining restrictions . The Russian government has approved a decree banning cryptocurrency mining in 10 regions from January 1, 2025, according to TASS. #CryptoMining #Russia https://t.co/CIaaIZFypk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 24, 2024 Mining will be banned in Dagestan, Chechnya, and parts of Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson on January 1, 2025. These bans, effective until March 15, 2031, aim to address power issues linked to subsidized energy in these areas. Elsewhere, miners must report earnings to the Federal Tax Service and follow energy regulations. While Russia recognized Bitcoin as a financial asset in 2021, its use as a domestic payment method remains prohibited.

38106758,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376062,1735150778,Bitfinex: AI Agents Using Smart Contracts Will Revolutionize Crypto,"The synergies between AI and crypto are very promising. In fact, the incoming Trump administration is combining the two sectors into one advisory office. President-elect is calling it the White House Crypto and AI Czar. Trump’s appointee for the office, former PayPal COO David Sacks, has close ties to payments and crypto. AI Could Transform Digital Assets The AI and crypto brief posed the question, “Are AI agents the future of digital assets?” The Virgin Islands-based crypto exchange for users outside the United States says: Probably so. The note defines AI agents as decentralized, self-governing, autonomous, and intelligent software programs that can use the blockchain with some of the dexterity of a human. Their owners can use AI agents for “tasks like transaction execution and wallet management to enhance efficiency and scalability,” the industry brief says. It highlights a recent press page from Stanford University announcing a research partnership with the ai16z-linked Eliza Labs. “Partnerships like that of Eliza Labs and Stanford University’s Future Digital Currency Initiative are advancing this intersection, while projects such as AI16z highlight the potential for decentralized, self-governing AI agents to optimize blockchain networks,” the brief says. Furthermore, the Bitfinex report says, “These AI agents are envisioned to perform tasks such as executing transactions, managing wallets, and optimizing investment strategies, with the potential to streamline operations while introducing new efficiencies.” But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. The report highlights significant risks and challenges that require “robust safeguards, ethical guidelines, and fail-safes to prevent misuse or exploitation of autonomous agents.” What It Could Mean For Altcoin Prices No fewer than 11 AI-focused, powered, or adjacent cryptocurrencies have already achieved multi-billion dollar market caps. That’s according to data from CoinMarketCap, which lists among these, assets like: Bittensor (TAO), Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), and AIOZ Network (AIOZ). Meanwhile, a meme coin, Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), exploded from nothing in October to over $1 per token and a billion-dollar total market cap in November. The rally was due in great measure to two AI agent chatbots inventing a compelling origin story for the coin. Self-governing, automated AI apps running on smart contract decentralized finance platforms like Ethereum and Solana could add similar value to these ecosystems. As a result, they could attract similar capital and liquidity to back their operations. That would introduce more long-term support for many altcoin prices.

VanEck responds as Bitcoin stays under $100K,"As Bitcoin stays below $100,000, attention is shifting to altcoins, with many expecting an altseason rally soon. VanEck analysts say “altcoin season” has started. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has struggled to surpass its all-time high of $108,135, remaining below the $100,000 mark, raising uncertainty about its next move. VanEck analysts suggest that the current market conditions favor altcoins over Bitcoin. Although altcoins also dropped along with Bitcoin, many investors and analysts are hopeful that an altcoin rally will soon occur. VanEck has even stated that the altcoin season started on November 27. Bitcoin has remained below the $100,000 mark, holding around $90,000. Some predict it may rise in 2025 with expected crypto-friendly policies under the Trump administration, while others believe the current market favors altcoins. VanEck: Altcoin season has arrived VanEck analyst Matthew Sigel, head of digital research, explained that Bitcoin’s dominance in market size, liquidity, and volume often allows altcoins to do better. As more money flows into the market, investors are more willing to take risks, directing capital into emerging sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and NFTs, which helps altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Sigel says altcoins are ready to grow as more investors explore new blockchain applications. Data from Artemis’s Altcoin Season Index shows that altcoins are performing well. The index tracks how the top 50 altcoins perform compared to Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The index ranges from 0 to 1, and an index reading of 0.6 signals the start of the altcoin season. The current score of 0.8 shows strong altcoin performance, suggesting that profits from Bitcoin are moving into top altcoins. CoinMarketCap uses a different method to calculate the altcoin season index. It defines it as when 75% of the top 100 altcoins perform better than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Right now, the index is at 51, but it already reached 87 on December 4, which shows a strong period for altcoins. While different methods are used to measure this, most analysts agree that an altcoin rally is already happening, with expectations that many top altcoins will outperform Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Captain Faibik recently confirmed the start of the altcoin season through technical analysis. On social media platform X, he pointed out a breakout in Bitcoin’s dominance, saying, “Bitcoin dominance has broken out of a rising wedge pattern, and the retest is confirmed! Altcoin season has officially begun—get ready for the ride!” This suggests that, according to Faibik’s analysis, the conditions are right for altcoins to outperform Bitcoin. As Bitcoin’s price correction continues to make news, more attention is shifting to altcoins, which are already showing a change in market sentiment . Also, with the rising interest in decentralized finance, gaming, and NFTs, the altcoin market looks ready for a rally.

With the year coming to a close, many investors hope ADA can end the year with one last rally. To gain insight into the asset’s future movements, we consulted Grok. Grok, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot which runs on X shared a detailed analysis of Cardano’s potential price for January 1, 2025. Grok’s Prediction for Cardano (ADA) Prices Drawing from various cryptocurrency forecasting platforms, Grok synthesizes available data to offer a speculative estimate, emphasizing the inherent unpredictability of cryptocurrency markets. According to Grok, predicting precise cryptocurrency prices is a significant challenge due to market volatility. Nonetheless, it suggests a speculative price range for Cardano between $1.04 and $1.96, with a midpoint estimate of around $1.50. The digital asset is currently trading at $0.9248. This suggests that it could build some momentum to enter the new year. This forecast is based on data from sources such as Ambcrypto.com, which projects an average price of $1.18, Longforecast.com, which estimates $1.96, and Changelly.com, which anticipates $1.04 for early January 2025. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Influencing Cardano (ADA) Price Cardano remains a prominent blockchain platform, and while Grok did not provide any specific factors that could push ADA toward these targets, certain market factors might help it reach them. There are rumors that the Swiss government plans to adopt Cardano as its first-ever national cryptocurrency. This would be a major milestone for ADA and the crypto space and further legitimize cryptocurrencies in traditional financial circles. Other external factors such as regulatory policies and macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates and investor sentiment, play significant roles in shaping ADA’s trajectory. These interconnected elements contribute to the complexity of accurately predicting the cryptocurrency’s price. Grok’s analysis offers a speculative but data-informed view of Cardano’s price potential for January 2025, suggesting a notable price increase before the new year. As Grok notes, actual market conditions can deviate significantly from these projections. However, with notable upgrades in the ecosystem, and the support and excitement from the community, there’s a good chance ADA will reach these targets by January 1.

38106708,https://blockworks.co/news/lost-bitcoin-myth-quantum-computing,1735149600,The myth of ‘lost bitcoin’ in the age of quantum computing,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . For years, Bitcoin enthusiasts have clung to the narrative that some of its 21 million supply is irretrievably “lost,” forever locked in wallets with forgotten keys. These “lost” coins have been viewed as a permanent reduction in the circulating supply, making bitcoin even scarcer than its fixed cap implies. But what if that scarcity isn’t as definitive as we think? The rise of quantum computing and breakthroughs in cryptographic techniques have sparked speculation that no bitcoin is truly “lost.” As computational power evolves, the security underpinning bitcoin’s oldest key pairs — generated using what may soon be outdated cryptography — could be compromised. This isn’t an immediate concern, as Bitcoin developers are well-equipped to implement protocol upgrades that shield active wallets. However, wallets abandoned long ago — like Satoshi Nakamoto’s — and whose owners are unlikely to migrate them to new encryption schemes, could become targets. Imagine quantum computing so advanced that “key miners” can derive private keys from public ones, effectively “cracking” these forgotten wallets. This would bring dormant bitcoin back into circulation — not through the intent of the original owners, but rather new actors exploiting advances on the periphery of technology. Far from being FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), this idea reframes Bitcoin’s evolution . The network’s adaptability ensures it remains robust in a quantum future, but it also challenges the idea that its circulating supply will permanently exclude lost coins. As Nic Carter has noted, Bitcoin’s security model doubles as a $400 billion “bug bounty” driving quantum advancements. The treasure hunting of old wallets might one day become a competitive market, reshaping the narrative of bitcoin’s scarcity. In this future, “lost” bitcoin doesn’t stay lost — it merely waits for someone to unlock it, keeping the promise of 21 million circulating coins intact. Whether that promise itself can be kept in the future is also an open question, but that’s a topic for another day. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Though established major players like Ripple (XRP), valued at $2.50, and Solana (SOL), priced at $218.68, a new wave of under $1 tokens is gathering steam. These tokens— Rexas Finance (RXS), Algorand (ALGO), Bonk (BONK), and The Graph (GRT)—offer accessibility and the possibility for exponential expansion, therefore positioning themselves to outperform their more expensive rivals in the next market rise. Rexas Finance (RXS): Changing Asset Management With a creative approach to tokenizing real-world assets (RWA), Rexas Finance (RXS) is transforming the financial industry. At just $0.150 in its continuous Stage 10 presale, Rexas Finance has now raised over $30.8 million with an amazing 95.98% of tokens sold. Even before its official introduction on exchanges, the project showed great investor confidence and notable demand, with the next stage price set to rise to $0.175. By being listed on CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance recently reached a milestone and improved its reputation in the crypto scene. These listings, together with its intentions to debut on three tier-one exchanges, should generate liquidity, draw institutional interest, and significantly raise the value of the coin. Rexas Finance is unique mostly in its strong ecology. While the Rexas Launchpad helps with funding for new token projects, features like the Rexas Token Builder let users tokenize their own assets. Advanced tools like Rexas GenAI, which democratizes NFT creation via AI-driven technologies, are also provided on the platform. Rexas Finance is holding a $1 million contest in which 20 winners will get $50,000 in RXS tokens each, enhancing community involvement. Together with its innovative platform, this project helps Rexas Finance stand out as a fierce competitor and outperform established players like Solana and Ripple in the upcoming market surge. Algorand (ALGO): An Environmentally Friendly, Scalable Blockchain Priced at $0.4222, Algorand (ALGO) is another interesting cryptocurrency that might outperform in the next months. Algorand has established a name as a scalable and environmentally friendly blockchain with a market valuation of $3.51 billion and a circulating supply of 8.31 billion ALGO. Both developers and companies choose it as its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus process offers speed and energy economy. Algorand is especially suited for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) thanks to its capacity to manage significant applications without sacrificing security or efficiency. A strong competitor with collaborations with worldwide companies, emphasis on carbon neutrality, and creative application in both financial and non-financial industries is its Algorand, which keeps drawing a growing user base by providing scalability and adaptability, thereby creating conditions for notable price increases. Bonk (BONK) Priced at just $0.00003713, Bonk (BONK) is the Meme Token with a Purpose that stands out among others. The token has drawn interest from speculative investors with a market capitalization of $2.81 billion and an astonishing 75.7 trillion BONK circulating supply. Unlike conventional meme tokens that depend just on hype, Bonk is progressively becoming useful with integrations with DeFi and community-driven initiatives adding value to its ecosystem. Bonk appeals to investors trying to profit from transient market swings because of its high-risk, high-reward nature. Although meme tokens are sometimes dismissed as fads, Bonk's increasing focus on utility could help it eventually compete with more ambitious, well-known initiatives. The Graph (GRT) Forms Blockchain Data's Foundation A fundamental infrastructure token found in the blockchain ecosystem is the Graph (GRT). Priced at $0.2795, with a market capitalization of $2.66 billion and a circulating supply of 9.54 billion GRT, The Graph offers a decentralized method for searching blockchain data. It is a necessary tool for developers since it drives decentralized apps (dApps) across Ethereum and other networks by allowing effective retrieval of information. The Graph benefits DeFi, NFTs, and a broad spectrum of blockchain-based apps. Its subgraph technology guarantees its relevance and acceptance in an expanding market. The Graph's subgraph technology drives demand for GRT tokens by letting developers easily create and expand projects. Under $1, the Graph is a great investment choice as the blockchain ecosystem grows, positioned for a steady increase. Why These Tokens Should Outperform These under-$1 tokens appeal because of their affordable price, solid foundations, and creative application possibilities. Rexas Finance , Algorand, Bonk, and The Graph appeal to a wider spectrum of investors because they offer notable development opportunities, unlike Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL), which already demand premium pricing. With its ambitious road map and emphasis on tokenizing actual assets—a trend altering the financial scene—Rexas Finance distinguishes itself. Algorand is a sustainable choice for companies and developers because of its environmental focus and scalability. While The Graph's function as the ""Google of blockchain data"" highlights its long-term promise, Bonk's meme-token roots are matched by its expanding usefulness. Conclusion Under $1 tokens include Rexas Finance, Algorand, Bonk, and The Graph, leading the next wave of expansion as the cryptocurrency market develops.

38106107,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314039,1735149357,Crypto.com Announces Launch of New Custody Service for High Net Worth Clients in US and Canada,"The Singapore-based digital asset exchange giant Crypto.com plans to offer custody services for high-net-worth individuals and institutions in the US and Canada. This week, the exchange announced the launch of a US trust company to enable the new services. Crypto.com also plans to shift all US and Canadian customer digital assets to the new trust company for custody in the next few weeks. Kris Marszalek, co-founder and chief executive of Crypto.com, says the move reflects the firm’s confidence in the North American market. “Launching a U.S. trust company is our latest significant step in our product roadmap to building our business and presence in two of the most important and active crypto markets in the world – the U.S. and Canada.” Marszalek met with US President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month to discuss the possibility of a national Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, among other things. Earlier this year, Crypto.com acquired the US broker-dealer Watchdog Capital to launch equities trading for American customers. The New Hampshire-based broker is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory organization that creates and enforces rules for brokerage firms. Crypto.com is the 16th-largest digital asset exchange in the world in terms of 24-hour normalized volume, according to CoinGecko .

Crypto investors, especially newbies, need to remember that what goes up can always come down. Many inexperienced investors forget it when the markets are bullish and surging. This proved the case last week as markets dropped after cautionary comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell after the FOMC meeting. Popular dog meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a deep drop along with most of the crypto market. Retail investors were left fumbling to manage their portfolio holdings as traders shorted their long holdings to control their damages. This has led to increased interest in exploring sure gain options like DTX Exchange, which has sure and high returns. The proposed listing price of the DTX token is $0.20, but its current price is $0.12 for Stage 6, giving investors an 80% profit on listing alone. Shiba Inu (SHIB): $0.00002 Holds Strong Shiba Inu (SHIB) has also experienced a bearish performance since December 18. Shiba Inu experienced a price drop of over 20% last week when trading at the lowest of $0.000018. However, this proved a one-off, and its price rose to trade over the $0.000021 range. Source: CoinMarketCap Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top altcoins to watch for quick performance once the markets recover. Analysts are optimistic about the altcoin’s possible recovery to new ATHs in the next few weeks. Shiba Inu's performance improved after the development of its crypto utility. To improve its technical processing capacity and decrease transaction costs on the Shiba Inu network, Shiba Inu recently launched its Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium. DTX Exchange: 500% Growth Increases Investor’s Confidence DTX Exchange is becoming the go-to platform for crypto traders looking to add some stability and innovation, as it is known for its robust ecosystem and multi-asset integration. DTX Exchange has leveraged the bearish market to attract a growing investor base. DTX Exchange offers an integrated trading platform for cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex. It uses the Vulcan X blockchain to offer advanced DeFi tools. This network has shown an impressive transaction speed of 0.4 milliseconds and the capacity to process over 100,000 transactions per second. Another major plus for DTX is its Phoenix Wallet, which offers non-custodial, multi-asset storage. It is also going to launch an upcoming tokenization platform for real-world assets. The platform’s focus on serving the users has bred community trust. With a loyal user base exceeding 200,000 and a successful ICO that has raised $10.5 million, DTX Exchange is an established and credible player in the crypto ecosystem. Its ongoing token presale, now in its sixth stage at $0.12, offers attractive incentives such as profit-sharing and governance rights, enticing both retail and institutional investors. Conclusion As SHIB faces a challenge in maintaining its price above critical support levels, traders look for more stable opportunities like DTX Exchange . Recent projections suggest that early investors in DTX could see returns of up to 321% as it gains traction in the market. The previous gains from the past few months prove a potential for more traction after its broader launch.

38105752,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/lightchain-ai-ai-driven-blockchain-solution-investors-are-watching,1735148582,Lightchain AI AI-Driven Blockchain Solution Investors Are Watching,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, innovative projects are taking center stage, capturing the attention of forward-thinking investors. Among these is Lightchain AI (LCAI), a blockchain solution that merges artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized technology to address real-world challenges. With its cutting-edge features and ambitious roadmap, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming one of the most anticipated projects in the crypto space. Here’s why investors are keeping a close eye on this AI-driven blockchain solution. The Vision Behind Lightchain AI Lightchain AI joins the strength of smart machines with the clear and safe nature of block chain tech. This new platform i͏s made to change industries by dealing with big problems like growth, privacy and control. By breaking down AI calculations, Lightchain AI hopes to make AI development fair so all can get to better tech. Safety is also a big need, with the site using code tricks to guard soft info while allowing joint AI model learning. With uses going from health checks to supply line fixing, Lightchain AI is made to deal with real-life issues and push new ideas across many fields. The Features That Set Lightchain AI Apart What makes Lightchain AI stand out from other blockchain projects is its unique combination of technological innovations, including its groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Proof of Intelligence (PoI) The PoI consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing meaningful AI computations, such as training machine learning models or running inference tasks. Unlike traditional consensus models like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoI ensures that network resources contribute to advancing artificial intelligence while maintaining security and decentralization. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) The AIVM is the computational layer of Lightchain AI, enabling developers to deploy AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). It supports seamless integration with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, providing a user-friendly environment for building scalable, real-time AI solutions. Lightchain AI’s Deflationary Tokenomics The LCAI token is the backbone of Lightchain AI’s ecosystem, featuring a deflationary tokenomics model designed to create long-term value for holders. A portion of transaction fees is burned over time, gradually reducing the total supply and creating scarcity. This approach fosters sustainable growth by balancing demand and availability. Additionally, the platform incentivizes participation by rewarding node operators and contributors, building an active and engaged community. LCAI tokens also serve multiple purposes within the ecosystem, including transaction fees, staking, governance participation, and access to premium features in the AIVM. Roadmap Clear Path to Adoption Lightchain AI’s roadmap showcases a thoughtful and strategic approach to growth and adoption. The journey begins with the completion of prototype development, focusing on the PoI consensus mechanism and AIVM in a sandbox environment. From there, the project will advance to the testnet rollout, inviting developers and node operators to evaluate the platform’s scalability and performance. The mainnet launch will mark the full deployment of the platform, including features such as staking, governance, and decentralized AI applications. Finally, the roadmap emphasizes ecosystem growth through partnerships, cross-chain integrations, and community-driven initiatives to drive widespread adoption. Why Investors Are Watching Lightchain AI Lightchain AI, with its innovative features and emphasis on real-world utility, is set to attract both institutional and retail investors. By combining blockchain and AI, it stands out in a market that increasingly prioritizes utility over speculation. With a presale price of just $0.003, Lightchain AI presents a unique opportunity for early adopters to capitalize on significant growth as the project gains traction. Its integration of AI and blockchain addresses critical challenges in industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics, ensuring ongoing demand for the platform. Additionally, its robust tokenomics, featuring deflationary mechanisms and staking rewards, creates a self-sustaining ecosystem that incentivizes participation and enhances long-term value. Project to Watch Closely Lightchain AI is more than just another blockchain project—it’s a transformative solution that bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and decentralized technology. With its innovative features, strong roadmap, and focus on real-world applications, Lightchain AI is positioned to become a leading player in the crypto space. For investors seeking to capitalize on the next wave of blockchain innovation, Lightchain AI offers a compelling opportunity to be part of a project that is reshaping industries and redefining what’s possible in the decentralized world. As Lightchain AI moves closer to its mainnet launch, its potential to disrupt markets and deliver substantial returns makes it a project worth watching closel. Keep an eye on this pioneering platform and its vision for a more transparent, secure, and equitable future powered by the synergy of AI and blockchain technology. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This would make its parabolic price growth mirror the coin’s past performance. Cardano (ADA) has increased its ecosystem and is now focusing on reaching a price of $10 in this market cycle. Cardano has captured massive investor confidence within the crypto sphere with its proof-of-stake mechanism and consistent development milestones. It is performing exceptionally well in the altcoin race. Although ADA is heavily dominant in the market, three alternative altcoins— Rexas Finance (RXS), Bonk, and Sei (SEI)—could see parabolic growth and deserve strong support. These tokens are significant for investors seeking to diversify due to their features, real-world applications, and growth potential. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Shift in Token Utility and Tokenization Rexas Finance has emerged as a platform accelerating business growth in tokenization. Through a singular integrated platform, it enables a wide range of asset classes to connect with blockchain technology. This platform allows physical assets such as real estate, artworks, and other illiquid investments to be tokenized via blockchain, bridging the gap to new, previously unreachable markets. The elements of its project make Rexas one of the most multi-dimensional tokens in the market. The project enables businesses to access funding on a decentralized basis through the Rexas Launchpad, building the necessary infrastructure to grow and launch startups. Its Rexas Token Builder facilitates the creation of bespoke tokens while supporting liquidity through the Rexas Treasury, ensuring sustainability over time. With state-of-the-art AI tools like Rexas GenAI for NFT promotion, the platform addresses crucial market shortcomings and enhances cross-sectoral adoption. In Rexas Finance, the welfare of tokenomics is well-devised, with a clear focus on growth and the appreciation of early-stage investors. Of the total 1 billion RXS tokens, 42.5% are designated for presale, 22.5% for staking rewards, and 15% for liquidity. Other tokens are allocated for marketing, partnerships, and the platform’s treasury. This mechanism promotes growth through long-term holding by investors. Currently, Rexas Finance is in Stage 10 of the presale, with tokens selling at $0.15. The project's popularity and investor trust are reflected in the sale of over 364 million tokens, which raised more than $30 million. By the first half of 2025, RXS is expected to list on major exchanges, increasing its rate and creating significant profit potential. Rexas Finance has launched a $1 million giveaway campaign to broaden its engagement base. Presale investors are also promised RXS tokens worth up to $50,000, adding to the project’s hype. Bonk: A Meme Coin That Has Gained Momentum Over the Years Bonk is one of the most promising meme coins within the Solana ecosystem. With a price of $0.00003745 and strong community support, It is well-positioned among mega tokens that are likely to remain for the long term. Bonk is currently retailing at fractions of a cent, appealing to high-risk, high-reward retail traders. The growing adoption and Solana’s improved network performance are likely to boost Bonk’s price in the upcoming cycle, making it a sensible addition to any portfolio. Sei (SEI): A High-Speed Blockchain Revolution Sei has disrupted the blockchain space with its high-speed and low-latency network, supporting decentralized exchanges and trading applications. Its combination of out-of-game business logic and a unique consensus mechanism has allowed Sei to prioritize ecosystem growth while maintaining scalability. Currently priced at $0.5665 with a market cap of $2.38 billion, Sei is attractive to investors aiming for significant returns. Emerging businesses worldwide continue to seek efficient and fast solutions, and enterprises like Sei stand to benefit from capturing a substantial market share. Conclusion Cardano’s evolution toward the $10 mark reflects its sound fundamentals, robust adoption, and steady progress. On the other hand, Rexas Finance (RXS), Bonk, and Sei are well-poised to deliver even better returns to investors. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself with unique offerings, robust tokenomics, and a successful presale, making it the top choice among the three. The $1 million giveaway and early 2025 exchange listings are expected to drive RXS prices higher, offering extensive returns for early investors. RXS allows those who missed earlier market chances to benefit from the next significant crypto wave. Bonk and Sei add further upside potential to a solid portfolio. Together with Cardano, these tokens can help investors achieve substantial gains during the next bullish cycle, turning small-scale investments into impressive profits.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/donald-saves-crypto-donalcry-solana-memecoin-will-surge-18000-before-exchange-listing-as-pepe-and-shib-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The swift rally has reignited bullish sentiment as the price successfully held a critical demand level, signaling strength and positioning BTC to challenge the psychological $100,000 milestone. Market participants are now closely watching Bitcoin’s next move, anticipating continued momentum in the coming days. Related Reading: XRP Whales Keep Buying – Data Reveals Smart Money Prepares For A Rally Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a compelling technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s formation of a symmetrical triangle on the hourly timeframe. This pattern often indicates a period of consolidation before a significant breakout, and Runefelt believes BTC is on the verge of such a move. A confirmed break above this triangle could propel Bitcoin into price discovery, unlocking further gains and marking a pivotal moment in its current market cycle. With strong demand levels providing support and technical patterns aligning for a potential breakout, Bitcoin’s path to $100,000 appears clearer than ever. However, traders remain cautious as volatility could still play a role in the short term. All eyes are on the leading cryptocurrency as it enters a critical phase, with investors eagerly awaiting confirmation of a new leg in its historic bull run. Bitcoin Looks Ready To Rally Again Bitcoin appears primed for another rally into price discovery, maintaining a bullish structure after holding critical demand levels. This resilience underscores the market’s confidence in BTC’s ability to reclaim the $100,000 mark and push higher, with both analysts and investors closely monitoring its price action for confirmation. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared an insightful technical analysis on X, highlighting a symmetrical triangle pattern on Bitcoin’s hourly chart. Symmetrical triangles often indicate a period of consolidation before a breakout, and Runefelt suggests that BTC is poised to break upward. He further identified $100,700 as a key level; surpassing it would signal strong bullish momentum, potentially driving Bitcoin to new all-time highs. Conversely, he cautioned that a drop to $95,200 would signal weakness, indicating a bearish turn in the short term. Runefelt’s analysis aligns with market sentiment, as many traders view Bitcoin’s current consolidation as a precursor to significant upward movement. If BTC confirms a breakout above the triangle, it could trigger a surge of buying activity, driving the price into uncharted territory. However, a failure to sustain momentum above critical levels may lead to heightened volatility, challenging Bitcoin’s bullish outlook. Related Reading: If History Repeats Dogecoin Has Potential For A Parabolic Rally – Details For now, the leading cryptocurrency holds steady, with all eyes on the pivotal $100,700 mark. If Bitcoin successfully breaks this resistance, it could ignite the next phase of its bull run, reaffirming its position as the dominant force in the crypto market. Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,400, marking a notable 7% surge from its recent local lows of $92,000. This recovery highlights renewed bullish momentum, with the price reclaiming the critical 4-hour 200 EMA, a key indicator of short-term strength. BTC now faces a significant hurdle as it attempts to push above the 4-hour 200 MA, which sits at $98,470. Reclaiming the 200 MA would confirm Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory, potentially igniting aggressive buying activity to propel the price above the psychological $100,000 mark. Breaking this level would not only reinforce market confidence but could also trigger further upside momentum, pushing BTC into new all-time highs. Related Reading: Solana Holds Weekly Support At $180 – Analyst Expects $330 Mid-Term On the flip side, failure to reclaim the 200 MA could result in Bitcoin consolidating below $100,000.

The value of all coins and tokens combined recently hit an all-time high of $3.8 trillion, more than quadrupling from its bear-market low point of $823 billion in 2022. But those gains have come with significant volatility, especially in the more speculative corners of the crypto space. The famous meme coin, Dogecoin, was sitting on an incredible year-to-date return of 414% until last Wednesday, but it has plunged by 31% in the week since. The DOGE price slump has caused panic among investors, who now view DTX Exchange as a better investment option than Dogecoin. DTX’s increasing popularity, staggering presale raise, and unmatched leverage make it a lucrative opportunity in this bull run. Dogecoin Analysis: Investors Anxious About DOGE Price Dip Of 31% Dogecoin is heading into 2025 with the wind at its back, thanks to a more favorable regulatory environment and continued support from the world's richest person, Elon Musk. Therefore, should investors use the recent dip as a buying opportunity? The DOGE price decline has raised concern among investors. Elon Musk has been a big supporter of Dogecoin since 2021, when he regularly promoted it on social media and even during his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL) in May of that year. He even called it his favorite cryptocurrency. The DOGE price was trading at $0.0046 per token at the beginning of 2021, and within five months, it had soared by 15,769% to a record high of $0.73. Musk's support was a big contributor to that move, but his SNL appearance happened to mark the peak. Investors realized he didn't have a concrete plan to back up his vocal support for Dogecoin, so it wound up losing 92% of its value by mid-2022. After remaining mostly dormant in 2023 and for most of 2024, Trump's election win on Nov. 5 was the spark DOGE price needed to stage a recovery. It appears he will be a very pro-crypto president, and he recently nominated pro-crypto businessman Paul Atkins to run the SEC, pending Senate approval. Dogecoin soared to a 52-week high of $0.47 earlier this month, and it was charging toward its 2021 record of $0.73. However, it has plummeted 31% since last Wednesday because the U.S. Federal Reserve issued a new forecast pointing to fewer interest rate cuts next year. Interest rates don't affect DOGE prices directly, but a higher cost of money tends to weigh on the more speculative areas of the financial markets. It's easier to profit from borrowed funds when interest rates are low, after all. Therefore, savvy investors shift to DTX Exchange, which becomes a more enticing investment in this bull run. DTX Exchange: The Unsung Hero Grabs Attention With Presale Raise As the DOGE price trajectory remains baffling, the focus is turning more and more to DTX Exchange , a platform that’s making rapid strides as a favorite among early adopters and savvy traders alike. DTX Exchange integrates multi-asset trading, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex on one platform — a far cry from traditional crypto platforms that only allow crypto trading. The hype isn’t without merit. In the current market conditions, DTX’s token has already proved to be resilient, with the results of its presale rounds delivering never-before-seen interest. Just recently, community adoption has been on the rise, showcasing massive demand in retail users. With a 1000x liquidity model and next-level trading tools, DTX is distinguishing itself from rivals, giving its users an advantage. This element makes it especially appealing to high-risk traders with little funds trying to capitalize for maximum returns. The introduction of the Phoenix Wallet, a safe custody option, along with tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), reflects DTX’s ambitious plans. These innovations will greatly transform how assets or tokens are managed and executed within the crypto environment. DTX’s user base is exploding, with over 160,000 active users and counting, and it is building a solid base for continued growth. The community’s zeal is seen in colorful discussions throughout social media platforms and on specialized forums. Now in its 6th round, the DTX presale has surpassed $10.5 million in presale raise, reflecting strong demand and investor confidence. This sign of interest is telling of a high level of faith in the project’s potential to shake up the market. Key Takeaways Dogecoin whales are rushing to DTX Exchange as DOGE price faces turbulence after a massive rally. The 31% price dip has forced the Dogecoin investors to shift to the emerging hybrid platform, which is safe from any market volatility.

On January 1 (Wednesday), the company will unlock over $2 billion worth of tokens in three transactions of 200 million, 300 million, and 500 million XRP. Interestingly, January 2025’s unlock accounts for 1.74% of the current 57.25 billion circulating supply. Moreover, accrues for 2.63% of the remaining 38 billion XRP tokens locked in escrows under Ripple’s control. Three escrows will reach finality in the last minutes of December 31, held by two known wallet addresses Ripple owns. In particular, ‘ Ripple (24) ’ will unlock 200 and 300 million XRP, previously locked in December 2020 and January 2021. Second, ‘ Ripple (25) ’ will unlock 500 million tokens, previously locked in January 2021. These will be the last unlocks from ‘Ripple (24) and (25)’, but there are more escrows in other Ripple-controlled addresses. rw2hzLZgiQ9q62KCuaTWuFHWfiX7JWg3wY and rDqGA2GfveHypDguQ1KXrJzYymFZmKxEsF accounts. Source: XRP Scan / Finbold This is what Ripple did to the 1 billion XRP unlock in December We can look at previous monthly events as a reference to better understand what is next following this unlock. Notably, the escrow system unlocked 1 billion XRP on December 1 . Later, Ripple re-locked 800 million of the total in escrows that will end by February 2028 in two accounts. Meanwhile, the remaining 200 million was reserved at ‘ Ripple (1) ‘ for further distribution. The company then proceeded to sell the $500 million stash all at once, moving the amounts to other known and unknown accounts and selling more of the reserved XRP from ‘ Ripple (50) ‘ and Ripple (29)—all going unannounced. Interestingly, the previous month, November, marked Ripple’s largest dump in seven years, selling 470 million XRP from the 1 billion unlocked from escrows. For that, the company sent 470 million XRP to ‘Ripple (1)’. These reserved tokens were later split and sent to ‘Ripple (50)’ and rP4X2h(…) , as Finbold reported . Ripple’s XRP unlock in November 2024, by November 8. Source: Finbold So far, in 2024, Ripple has sold 3.246 billion XRP from the ‘Ripple (1)’ reserve account alone, not counting movements from other accounts – as seen occasionally from ‘Ripple (50), (29)’, and more. With XRP trading above the $2 mark, these sales represent more than $6.5 billion of selling pressure year-to-date. In comparison, the Ethereum Foundation has a yearly budget of $100 million for Ethereum (ETH) sales, which wasn’t reached. As things develop, Ripple’s aggressive strategies impose a challenge for XRP’s growth, requiring a proportional demand increase for sustainability. According to Ripple’s Q3 2024 report , the company is using an On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) model, selling at market price to willing customers, which diminishes the economic effects of gigantic potential sell walls.

Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson , hailed Lace, a feature-packed native wallet, as a game-changer for the ecosystem. Lace: A New Era for Cardano Wallets Speaking on December 24, Hoskinson praised Lace’s growing popularity. He noted that its smooth transition from Nami, one of Cardano’s most-used wallets , has fueled its adoption. Nami, with over 200,000 users, has been central to Cardano’s network. Backed by Cardano’s primary developers, Input Output, Lace aims to transform how users engage with the blockchain. When Input Output acquired Nami in 2023, it laid the groundwork for innovation. The embedded mode of Lace allows users to keep the familiar Nami experience. At the same time, unlock advanced features like enhanced security, transaction bundling, and seamless governance tools. More than just a wallet, Lace serves as a gateway to Cardano. Designed for simplicity, it aims to attract millions of new users. Currently, Lace exists as a browser extension for platforms like Chrome and Brave, but a mobile app is on the horizon. This future accessibility could be the key to Cardano’s broader adoption. Balancing Innovation and Monopoly Concerns Despite its promise, not everyone in the Cardano community cheers for Lace. Some fear that Input Output’s growing control over the wallet space could stifle competition. Alessandro “Ales” Konrad, the creator of Nami, has addressed these concerns. He explained that Nami’s rapid growth exceeded his expectations. This prompted him to entrust it to Input Output for sustained innovation. While his decision reassures some, the broader community remains divided. Hoskinson Gives Glimpse into 2025 As Lace’s adoption gains momentum, Hokinson mentioned its impact on Cardano’s ecosystem could be profound. Whether it becomes the gateway to a thriving decentralized future or sparks debates over-centralization, one thing is clear. The wallet is shaping up to be one of the most influential tools in blockchain’s next chapter. Many are watching if Lace will deliver on its promise and bring Cardano closer to its ambitious goals in the coming year.

38105328,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53143,1735146747,XRP Fibonacci Levels Precisely Align with the 2017 Historical Pattern,"Dark Defender (@DefendDark), a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, recently shared insights on X about XRP’s price action. Accompanied by a chart, the analysis suggests that XRP might repeat its historical pattern from 2017. This assertion has sparked significant discussion within the crypto community, particularly due to its implications for potential price movements. The chart highlights specific Fibonacci levels, such as 161.80% at $8.76, 261.80% at $5.85, and 361.80% at $18.22, which align with historical patterns. Dark Defender highlighted the possible correlation between past market behavior and current retracement levels. I don't know why our Fibonacci Levels precisely align with the 2017 Historical Pattern. (NFA) Ho Ho Ho! Merry Christmas! pic.twitter.com/LPk448b3EY — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 24, 2024 This alignment draws attention to XRP’s significant performance in 2017, during which the cryptocurrency experienced a surge of over 80,000%, rising from a few cents to $3.84. Such historical data is often referenced by technical analysts to predict future trends, especially in speculative markets like cryptocurrency. Many analysts believe XRP can recreate this performance and the alignment of the Fibonacci levels adds credence to this belief. Important Targets for XRP Dark Defender’s chart emphasized the 161.80% Fibonacci level at $8.76 as a key target. If this level is reached, it would represent a substantial price increase from XRP’s current price of $2.33. Other notable levels, such as $5.85 and $18.22, are additional milestones the asset can reach on its journey. These levels are resistance levels that could become strong support levels when breached. While optimistic projections dominate the narrative, it is essential to approach such analyses with caution. Market conditions in 2024 differ significantly from those in 2017, influenced by factors like regulatory developments, global economic trends, and changes in investor sentiment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, some see this as an advantage for XRP. Some have theorized that if XRP could hit $3.84 based on speculation alone, the asset’s rising utility will help it surpass its all-time high , potentially reaching unprecedented levels. The ongoing legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also plays a crucial role in determining XRP’s price trajectory. Although Ripple’s legal victories have been well-documented, the outcome of the case could impact investor confidence, and prominent voices are confident that the new administration will dismiss the lawsuit . Analysts agree that something big is brewing for XRP and we might see a massive pump very soon. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

As the year draws to a close, certain lesser-known digital coins are catching the eye of savvy investors. Explore five promising alternative cryptocurrencies that could make a splash this Christmas season, and consider adding them to your watchlist. The All-Sports Meme Token You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where degens can score big off the growing demand for meme coins Picture this: Polymarket hitting $1 billion in trading volume during the US presidential election – now throw in the hype of meme coins and the thrill of sports betting. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field and cash in the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding – and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! >>>XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! In 2024, meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. With potential thousand-fold returns that will blow past the finish line, the presale plan draws a hefty 9,900% growth by the TGE. Forget about BOME’s 5,000% rise or WIF’s 1,000% rally – XYZ is here to outscore them all! With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here – get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! >>Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, launched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, has revolutionized the blockchain world. It’s known for its smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps). With platforms like Arbitrum and Polygon enhancing transaction efficiency, Ethereum remains at the forefront of innovation. In 2022, it transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, aiming for greater scalability and energy efficiency. The upcoming sharding phase promises to reduce costs and improve performance. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that powers this ecosystem, playing a crucial role in transactions and rewarding those who support the network. Looking at market trends, Ethereum shows significant potential. Based on historical movements and Bitcoin’s halving cycles, some predict ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, estimates suggest a yearly low of $2,700.31. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum’s continuous development and commitment to decentralization make it stand out. In the current market cycle, with its evolving technology and ambitious roadmap, ETH presents an interesting opportunity for those watching the crypto space. PEPE (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency scene, launched as a deflationary memecoin on Ethereum. Inspired by the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s, it embraces the fun and viral nature of internet culture. PEPE aims to join the ranks of famous meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a straightforward approach, it appeals to those who appreciate simplicity in the crypto world. In the spring of 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap hitting a peak of $1.6 billion. Early holders saw incredible gains, and a strong community of supporters grew around it. This rise sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” where many meme-based coins saw dramatic ups and downs. PEPE’s roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a goal of a “meme takeover.” While it’s uncertain if PEPE will reach new heights in the current market cycle, its rapid ascent mirrors the trends of other successful meme coins, capturing the attention and hope of many in the crypto community. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful spin on Dogecoin, inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous “Ryoshi,” SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, granting it access to Ethereum’s vast ecosystem. Out of a quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to build credibility. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, removing them from circulation. These actions boosted SHIB’s standing in the crypto world. SHIB sets itself apart with its technological capabilities. Being on Ethereum allows it to support projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a governance system for holders. In today’s market, where utility matters, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem may attract investors. Though it began as a meme, its growth and Ethereum integration could make it more appealing than other meme coins. As trends favor functionality, SHIB’s prospects look promising. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is turning heads in the cryptocurrency landscape as a flexible and sustainable blockchain platform tailored for smart contracts. This innovative network empowers developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games with greater ease and efficiency. At its core is ADA, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, which stands as a formidable rival to Ethereum’s ETH. ADA enables users to store value, make payments, and engage in staking on the Cardano network, contributing to a more decentralized and secure ecosystem. What truly sets Cardano apart is its commitment to environmental sustainability. By utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, Cardano operates with significantly improved energy efficiency compared to the energy-intensive proof-of-work models used by some other cryptocurrencies. Its unique architecture divides the blockchain into two layers—the Cardano Settlement Layer for handling transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This design enhances its capability to process potentially up to a million transactions per second. Since the introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021, the platform has established a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. In a rapidly evolving crypto market, Cardano’s innovative technology and sustainable approach position it as a noteworthy player to watch. Conclusion ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and ADA are promising, but XYZVerse stands out as a pioneering sports memecoin targeting massive growth and community-driven success this Christmas.

Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is redefining blockchain connectivity, while Avalanche’s recent upgrade slashes deployment costs and ramps up its scalability. Cardano continues to innovate, integrating Bitcoin liquidity into its DeFi ecosystem. But among these names, BlockDAG is turning heads with its unique approach, combining blockchain and DAG technology for unmatched transaction speeds and scalability. With its BDAG400 bonus and growing presale success, it’s positioning itself as a frontrunner and arguably the best crypto to buy for 2025. BlockDAG: The Future of Fast Transactions BlockDAG is making headlines with its presale success, raising over $172 million and selling more than 17.5 billion BDAG tokens. Currently priced at $0.0234 in its latest batch, BDAG has already delivered a remarkable 2240% return for early buyers. With its mainnet launch scheduled for 2025, BlockDAG aims to combine blockchain and DAG technology for unmatched scalability and speed. What’s driving attention is the BDAG400 bonus, offering up to 270% rewards across multiple tiers, including exciting mystery box bonuses for repeat buyers. This makes BlockDAG not just innovative but incredibly rewarding. Positioned as a competitor to networks like Solana and Kaspa, BlockDAG is a strong contender to be the best crypto to buy for 2025, offering long-term growth potential and robust community support. It’s a must-watch project for those looking ahead. Chainlink Price Prediction: A Reliable Bet for 2025 Chainlink’s innovative Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is rapidly expanding, now integrated with 14 blockchain networks, including the Ronin Network. This growth highlights its utility in connecting blockchain ecosystems seamlessly. With $6.5 billion in value locked in DeFi protocols and its adoption by giants like Apex Global Group for asset tokenization, Chainlink is proving its long-term potential. Analysts are optimistic, with the Chainlink price prediction pointing toward continued gains as adoption grows. For those planning ahead, Chainlink is shaping up as a solid pick and one of the best crypto to buy for 2025, blending robust tech with increasing real-world use cases. AVAX Price Outlook: A Strong Contender Avalanche recently implemented its Avalanche9000 upgrade, significantly reducing deployment costs and making it easier to launch subnets. These advancements enhance its scalability and appeal for developers building custom blockchain solutions. With the AVAX price currently hovering around $41.32, it has shown strong resilience and potential for further growth. The network's $250 million fundraising effort has boosted its ecosystem development, drawing in institutional interest and funding new initiatives. Avalanche's innovative features and growing adoption place it firmly in the spotlight as a leading blockchain platform and one of the best crypto to buy for 2025. Cardano Price 2025: A Promising Projection Cardano continues to build momentum with significant developments, including its integration with Bitcoin's OS Bridge, unlocking new liquidity for DeFi applications. Analysts are split on the Cardano price 2025, with predictions ranging from steady growth to a potential $15 surge if key upgrades succeed. Cardano's emphasis on innovation, particularly in tokenized assets and decentralized ecosystems, keeps it in the spotlight. With its commitment to scalability and partnerships expanding its reach, Cardano remains a strong candidate for the best crypto to buy in 2025, offering both growth potential and a solid foundation for long-term adoption in the blockchain space. Key Insights As 2025 approaches, all four cryptos—BlockDAG, Chainlink, Avalanche, and Cardano—bring exciting opportunities to the table. Chainlink's utility with CCIP and the positive Chainlink price prediction highlight its strong position. Avalanche's innovations, backed by the Avalanche9000 upgrade, and its promising AVAX price projections make it a solid choice. Cardano’s integration with Bitcoin liquidity and steady growth potential also stand out. However, BlockDAG’s unmatched scalability, rewarding BDAG400 bonus, and presale success position it as the best crypto to buy for 2025 . With its cutting-edge technology and community-driven approach, BlockDAG stands above the rest as the most compelling choice.

Affordable digital coins exist that could surpass established ones like XRP in gains. This article highlights three such altcoins that might deliver significant returns. Find out which coins are poised for growth and why they could be the next big opportunity in cryptocurrency. Score Big with XYZ: The New Meme Coin Heavyweight The fans are losing it! The XYZ token is in the crypto ring, landing blows on the competition – bullshit coins, worthless farming schemes, and scam projects. Like a true champ, this first-ever all-sports meme token has fought its way through the bear market with fearless momentum and shows no signs of slowing down. With eyes set on a roaring 9,900% growth, XYZ is destined to leave the 2024 meme coin triumphants like BOME and WIF trailing in its wake. Own the field, earn while the crowd plays XYZ is more than just a benchwarmer in the meme coin game; it’s creating the ultimate playing field with XYZVerse, where the thrill of sports meets the energy of meme culture. With a roadmap equipped with entertainment dApps, prediction markets, and sports betting options, XYZ is poised to draw in millions of gamblers ready to join the action. Remember Polymarket’s massive $1 billion trading volume during the US election betting fever? XYZ is gearing up for an even bigger win in the GameFi arena, letting its stakeholders cash in on the perfect combo of meme coin vibes, sports hype, and crypto mass adoption. Missed meme coin supercycle? By capitalizing on the ever-expanding gambling niche, XYZ is set to become the G.O.A.T of meme coins. BOME’s 5,000% takeoff and WIF’s 1,000% year-to-date rally are now relics of the past because XYZ is set to explode by over 9,900% from its current price by the TGE and outshine its sensational predecessors. Get in the game early to secure your spot – currently undervalued, XYZ is going the distance to break new records! Rallying the community, securing the win XYZVerse will be the MVP in this bull run, giving the community the control to call the plays and steer the ecosystem’s direction.

JasmyCoin (JASMY) Imagine having full control over your personal data in a world flooded with digital information. JasmyCoin (JASMY) is striving to make this possible. Hailing from Tokyo, Jasmy Corporation connects devices like computers, cars, and phones through the Internet of Things (IoT).

As we become more connected, projects like JASMY could play a key role in shaping a more secure digital future. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa is shaking up the crypto world with its unique approach to transactions. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that can be slow and sometimes leave some transactions behind, Kaspa allows multiple blocks to exist side by side. This means it can handle many transactions at once, making it faster and more efficient. With a goal of creating ten blocks per second—and dreams of a hundred—Kaspa aims to make waiting times a thing of the past. In today’s fast-paced market, speed and efficiency are key. Kaspa stands out by offering quicker transaction times compared to many other coins. Its innovative technology could make it an attractive option for those looking for faster, more reliable crypto transactions. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, coins like Kaspa that prioritize speed and scalability may lead the way. If you’re keeping an eye on emerging trends, Kaspa is definitely a coin to watch.

At this point, analysts expect BTC to mostly trade below $100,000 due to lack of liquidity during the holiday season. However, based on macroeconomic trends, analysts predict that the Bitcoin price could rise above $105,000 after Christmas. Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee said he expects Bitcoin to move within a certain range until the New Year, but argued that the price of Bitcoin could exceed $105,000 as liquidity returns after the Christmas holiday. Stating that the current downtrend in Bitcoin is a natural result of the lack of liquidity during the holiday period, the analyst explained his expectation for this week: “After Christmas, liquidity usually returns and market activity picks up again. Funds are expected to actively position in sectors that could benefit from Trump’s upcoming inauguration. At this point, the cryptocurrency sector is among the sectors that can benefit from Trump's inauguration ceremony, so the Bitcoin price will move after Christmas. The expected trading range for BTC this week is $94,000 – $105,000. The price is expected to exceed $105,000 after Christmas.” *This is not investment advice.

Dogen, a new player with a price tag of just $0.0013, is turning heads. Its potential for a stunning 40,000% return is drawing attention away from well-known tokens like SHIB and PEPE. Crypto investors are intrigued by what this newcomer might bring to the table. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon?

Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump’s love for crypto is no secret — he’s promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by Ryoshi, it started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated a large amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB’s prominence. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can interact with Ethereum applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a community governance system, giving SHIB potential for broader use. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s developments and Ethereum compatibility may make it an attractive option. PEPE Coin: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum network, drawing inspiration from the popular Pepe the Frog meme of the early 2000s. It seeks to replicate the success of memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin by eliminating transaction taxes and embracing its identity as a pure memecoin without utility. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market capitalization of $1.6 billion, igniting enthusiasm among crypto enthusiasts and fostering a vibrant community. The coin’s roadmap includes phases aimed at boosting visibility and adoption through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. PEPE features a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, operating as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake network. Conclusion In the current bull run of 2024, while SHIB and PEPE show less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a new meme token catering to those who seek the best in life. Inspired by tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN aims to build a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits such as exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

It consists of a series of candlestick patterns, and in Shiba Inu’s case, the formation suggests that the current downtrend may be nearing its end. SHIB price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts According to Martinez, with SHIB currently trading near $0.00002307, the buy signal hints at a possible rally toward the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, approximately $0.000026. If buying pressure intensifies, SHIB could aim for the next resistance at $0.000029, corresponding to the 0.236 Fibonacci level. X trading expert Javon Marks also highlighted the bullish sentiment, stating that SHIB’s technical layout indicates the possibility of claiming the $0.000081 level. This would mark a 3.33-fold surge, reflecting a more than 234% climb from its current levels. SHIB price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Indeed, SHIB has formed a descending wedge pattern, a bullish reversal formation. This pattern was followed by a breakout to the upside, indicating the possibility of further gains. After consolidating, SHIB has begun forming higher lows, showing strong resilience and buyer confidence. Possible reprieve for SHIB after sell-off The bullish outlook may relieve Shiba Inu investors, considering that the meme coin has witnessed sustained trading sessions of losses that have largely mirrored the general cryptocurrency market. At the same time, the current SHIB investors’ profits and losses might offer insights into what to expect from the coin. In this case, data retrieved by Finbold from crypto onchain analysis platform IntoTheBlock on December 25 indicates that 55% of Shiba Inu holders are in profit, 8% are at breakeven, and 37% are at a loss.

Source: IntoTheBlock Profit-taking by the majority could create selling pressure, capping price growth, while losses for 37% of holders may reduce selling activity, providing price stability. Meanwhile, the investors at breakeven might add short-term resistance if they sell as prices rise. Besides the technical outlook, SHIB will be banking on network-specific elements that are likely to spur possible price growth. For instance, the network’s layer-two scaling solution, Shibarium, is taking center stage with notable milestones. On December 25, the platform surpassed 700 million total transactions since its launch last summer, pointing to the rapid adoption of the protocol. The milestone has come with several additional developments, such as a revamped user interface to enhance compatibility with wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. Additionally, a hard fork introduced faster block processing and empowered developers, while a refined burning mechanism aims to reduce token supply. SHIB price analysis By press time, SHIB was trading at $0.000022, down 2% in the last 24 hours. The meme coin has plunged almost 10% on the weekly time frame. SHIB seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Shiba Inu’s technical setup suggests that the coin will likely witness more bearish sentiments in the short term since the current price is below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) but remains above its 200-day SMA, signaling a positive long-term trend. The relative strength index (RSI) at 47.31 is neutral, suggesting no overbought or oversold conditions, while moderate volatility (11.38%) hints at stable fluctuations.

With the correct selections, a $500 investment might turn into $75,000 before SOL hits its high point. Rexas Finance (RXS), Sui, and Cardano (ADA) are among the most forward-looking substitutes. Although each offers unique advantages, Rexas Finance is the best choice for anyone looking for transforming results. Sui (SUI) Among the most scalable blockchain systems available on the market, Sui is quickly becoming well-known. Sui started at $1.4 and has grown by 227%, with a current trading price of $4.58, according to coinmarketcap. With a market cap worth $13.37 billion, it offers significant future expansion space. Sui's established position partially offsets her potential for quick exponential expansion, even with her great start and strong foundations. Cardano (ADA) Enabling interoperability, sustainability and scalability in blockchain, Cardano has been providing value in the ecosystem as a key player owing to trading at $1.02 today while consistently growing from the start of the year where its price was $0.59 thereby increasing by 73% year to date. With a $35.97 billion market value, Cardano has shown itself to be a consistent investment, especially for those looking for consistency. Nevertheless, its ability to provide quick benefits in the near term is limited by its large market capitalization and slower development rate than recent initiatives. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Breakout Star Conversely, Rexas Finance is shown to be a fascinating competitor. This presents unmatched growth potential at just $0.15 in its 10th presale. With its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization—which lets consumers tokenize valuable assets such as intellectual property, fine art, and real estate, Rexas is creating waves. This utility-driven approach gives the token inherent worth, elevating it above mere speculative investment. Rexas already shows great market confidence with over $30.8 million raised and 364.7 million tokens sold. Early investors can see exponential returns as analysts estimate the token can soar to $3 soon after its debut. Besides its innovative use, Rexas has acquired a reputation using its CertiK audit, guaranteeing top-notch security and openness. Its ratings among professional investors have been strengthened even more by its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The ongoing $1 million contest, in which twenty winners will get $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, has created significant buzz and attracted much project interest. With a whole ecosystem, including the Rexas Launchpad and Token Builder, Rexas Finance is also meant for long-term sustainability. These instruments enable companies and developers to tokenize assets, guaranteeing ongoing innovation and acceptance on its platform. Rexas distinguishes itself from rivals concentrated only on DeFi or NFTs by using an ecosystem-centric approach, leading it to pioneer the next wave of crypto development. The Case for Rexas For individuals looking for spectacular short-term gains, Rexas Finance is the best choice, even though Sui and Cardano are strong challengers with significant technical underpinnings and consistent development. Rexas presents a rare chance to enter early on a project ready for exponential success with a presale pricing of $0.15 and a roadmap prepared for quick adoption. Solana is rising towards $1,000 while its rivals are forging their routes to success. Sui's speed and expansion make it an interesting choice; Cardano's proven ecosystem guarantees dependability. Still, Rexas Finance is the obvious choice for anybody ready to grab the next major cryptocurrency breakthrough. Rexas is a contender and a leader because its presale price is poised to climb, and creative real-world utility boosts demand. Investors prepared to convert $500,000 into $75,000 should act right now.

38104114,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376163,1735145218,Major Declines in BTC Mining Stocks Despite Bitcoin’s 128% YoY Rally,"The cryptocurrency market has been on a rollercoaster, especially in the last couple of months, with Bitcoin rallying 128% year-on-year as of Christmas Day. However, despite the bullish trends, the impressive performance hasn’t translated into gains for publicly listed Bitcoin mining companies, with many of their stocks showing significant declines. Mining Stocks Falter Despite Market Gains Data from the Hashrate Index shows that several major players in the sector are experiencing downturns. The biggest losses were recorded by Argo Blockchain. The stock of the UK-based BTC miner with a 1,500 PH/s hashrate has plunged 84.31% year-to-date (YTD), accompanied by a 5% dip over 24 hours. Greenidge, which operates two main data centers in Dresden, New York, and Spartanburg, South Carolina, also suffered major losses, going down nearly 9% in the last day and more than 74% YTD. Other poorly performing stocks included Sphere 3D, whose market cap fell to $23 million after share prices dipped by 4.22% overnight and 71.32% since the year began. Mawson Infrastructure Group and Ebang International also registered 70% and 53% drops in their YTD values, respectively, with the same scenario replicated in their 24-hour performances, where both fell more than 4%. Bigger capped firms such as Riot Platforms, with a recorded hashrate of 29,400 PH/s, also posted notable losses, sliding almost 8% in the last day and 29.92% YTD. On its part, Marathon Digital reported a 3.56% reduction over 24 hours and a more significant 16.05% from the year’s start. Outliers Reaping From Bitcoin’s Surge On the brighter side, companies like TeraWulf bucked the trend, posting a YTD surge of 152.61%, pushing its stock price to $5.81. Interestingly, it suffered the worst one-day dip of all BTC-miner stocks, shedding more than 12% from its price in that period. Similarly, Bitdeer gained 131% across 12 months, boosted by a slight 0.15% increase in the last 24 hours to breach the $20 mark. Other stocks that showcased resilience included Hut 8 Mining and Northern Data, with a combined hashrate of 8,400 PH/s, whose prices have jumped 71.83% and 65.73% in that order. This divergence between BTC’s bullish run and the mining sector’s struggles highlights the complexity of virtual asset investment. It continues to dominate the crypto market, with a 5% increase since December 24, to push its price to just below $99,000. However, the world’s largest virtual asset by market cap is down 5.6% across seven days, balanced by the 128% it has gained since January. Elsewhere, statistics recently shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed that institutional holders of the OG crypto have spiked to 31% from only 14% in 2023. The uptick has been driven by the growing popularity of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), government acquisitions, and the effect of MicroStrategy’s BTC-buying spree.

What this means is that the AI-driven venture capital DAO has finally emerged as a strong force in DeFi. A recent transaction by a crypto whale further underlines the growing influence of the project. The whale bought 2.86 million $AI6Z tokens valued at $2.58 million at an average price of $0.90 per token. As a result of the acquisition, the whale’s main wallet now contains 15.6 million $AI6Z tokens and is worth about $14.93 million. Large-scale accumulation like this shows the immense confidence of the market in AI16Z’s potential to redefine the future of venture capital with AI-driven innovation. Eliza Plugin Integration Expands Functionality Adding to the excitement , ai16z recently integrated the Abstract plugin into its Eliza platform, a decentralized AI-powered framework. This plugin enables users to automate Ethereum and ERC20 token transfers within the Abstract testnet environment. By simply configuring commands, users can streamline token transactions, making blockchain interactions more efficient and user-friendly. This upgrade significantly increases Eliza’s functionality on the platform, making it really versatile within them ecosystem. Pragmatic innovations like this will continue to cement the value of ai16z to a wide range of users and developers with increased blockchain adoption. AI Meets Decentralized Venture Capital ai16z is a first-of-its-kind venture capital combining artificial intelligence with decentralized governance. While many funds are controlled by a person or a group of persons, ai16z operates via a DAO. Drawing inspiration from Marc Andreessen’s investment philosophy, the project uses AI to refine and improve decision-making processes. The $AI6Z token is used for governance and utility purposes. Such holders will be able to vote in the most important strategic decisions, allowing the community to have its voice heard in the project’s decision-making. This approach empowers stakeholders and maximizes token utility within the ecosystem . Redesigning Blockchain Ecosystems The rapid rise of ai16z puts a spotlight on the power of innovation in AI and DeFi to transform blockchain ecosystems. ai16z is differentiated by strategic whale activity, integrations that are truly groundbreaking, such as the Eliza plugin, and its unique governance model.

Turkey’s New Crypto Law Sparks Global Debate appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The global crypto scene is booming, with Bitcoin touching its ATH in December breaking the historic target of $100k this year the interest in crypto assets is bound to increase. While countries are setting a softer crypto tone, Turkey has passed a law requiring cryptocurrency users to provide identification data for transactions exceeding $425. Interestingly, anyone in Turkey caught not doing KYC will have a prison sentence of up to 25 years for money laundering. The country is not compromising on its user safety and steps like this show they are open to digital assets yet keep a hawk eye on crypto usage. Will this move backfire? Let’s see how it will impact the investors. In 2023, Turkey introduced its first legal framework for cryptocurrencies. This move has created a more secure and structured environment for investors, addressing long-standing concerns about trust and reliability in the market. Turkey is currently the fourth-largest crypto market globally, with a trading volume reaching $170 billion, surpassing Russia and Canada (as of September 2023). Salim Karaman, CEO of BtcTurk, highlighted that these regulations are capturing investor attention and encouraging digitalization through tokenization projects. Growing Interest from Investors The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. has had a ripple effect globally, inspiring more Turkish investors to explore crypto markets. Kutluhan Akcin, Turkey’s country manager at Bybit, noted that the country’s Capital Markets Board (SPK) has established a list of approved crypto platforms. This provides a much-needed layer of security for investors, ensuring they can trade on reliable and legal platforms. With uncertainties around the legal framework fading, both individual and institutional investors are showing greater confidence in Turkey’s crypto market. Rising Trading Volumes and Institutional Growth Despite strict laws, Turkey has seen an increase in its trading activity. OKX Turkey, for example, reported an impressive $2.5 billion in transactions since its launch in February 2024. CEO Mehmet Camir described 2024 as the “year of adoption” for crypto, with growing interest from institutional players such as pension funds and corporate treasuries. These developments underscore Turkey’s position as the largest crypto market in the Middle East and North Africa. A Bright Future for Crypto in Turkey Experts agree that Turkey’s regulatory framework is a game-changer for the crypto industry. By creating an organized and trustworthy environment, the country is paving the way for increased institutional investments and a wider user base. With its strategic location and growing market activity, Turkey is set to become a key player in the global crypto space, fostering optimism for 2025 and beyond. The regulation also extends to unregistered wallet addresses, mandating exchanges to collect complete information before processing transactions.

38103853,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633172,1735144517,Tech stocks see historic gains in 2024 thanks to crypto and AI,"Tech stocks are having their biggest year in decades, with 2024 turning into a profit carnival for companies tied to artificial intelligence and crypto. The Nasdaq exploded with a 33% jump, while other U.S. indices flexed double-digit gains. From AI-powered ad platforms to Bitcoin-fueled investments, the tech market has become the ultimate money machine, pumping out billion-dollar valuations like a broken faucet. Businesses are adopting at breakneck speed while the average consumer remains clueless about what AI even does. But nothing turbocharged the market quite like Donald Trump’s election victory, heavily bankrolled by crypto giants. With just four trading days left in the year, the biggest winners in tech are clear. MicroStrategy: Bitcoin’s top lover MicroStrategy had already made a name for itself in the crypto industry, but 2024 turned the company into a juggernaut. Its stock (MSTR) soared 467%. The company now holds over 444,000 Bitcoins, valued at around $44 billion, making it overall the fourth-largest Bitcoin holder in the world. Founder Michael Saylor made Bitcoin the centerpiece of MicroStrategy’s strategy back in 2020, ditching its old identity as a software vendor. The company has used its rising stock price to raise cash and buy more Bitcoin, creating a feedback loop that Wall Street couldn’t ignore. Trump’s win gave MicroStrategy another boost, with the stock jumping 57% and Bitcoin surging 44% in the same period. Saylor, never shy about his Bitcoin obsession, called it the “safe trade” in crypto and predicted an industry-wide rally as new regulations come into play. AppLovin explodes with AI-driven ad tech AppLovin started 2024 as a middleweight in the tech sector, valued at $13 billion. Most people knew the company for its quirky mobile games like Woody Block Puzzle and Clockmaker . Fast forward 12 months, and it’s worth over $110 billion, overtaking Starbucks and Intel. The stock rocketed 758%, the kind of leap that turns heads and lines pockets. The secret? AI. AppLovin’s pivot to AI-powered advertising has paid off. Its AXON 2.0 ad engine became the star of the show, using machine learning to match ads to users with sniper-level accuracy. Third-quarter software platform revenue jumped 66% to $835 million. Total revenue grew 39%. Net income is up 300%, smashing expectations. Robinhood cashes in on crypto trading Robinhood’s 2024 comeback story is all about crypto. The stock more than tripled in value, despite stumbling in October after a weak earnings report. Investors didn’t care. By early November, the stock was soaring again, driven by Trump’s win and the broader rally. Crypto trading has become Robinhood’s moneymaker. Revenue from crypto transactions jumped 165% in Q3 to $61 million, making up 10% of total net revenue. Robinhood’s app makes it easy for retail investors to buy Bitcoin , Ethereum, Dogecoin, and even meme coins like PEPE. CEO Vlad Tenev has been pretty clear about his crypto ambitions. He called it a “disruptive technology” that will reshape everything from payments to loans. Analysts expect Q4 revenue to grow 70% to $805.7 million, the company’s fastest growth rate since 2021. Nvidia dominates the AI hardware race Nvidia has been the golden child of AI, and 2024 cemented its status as the king of tech. Its stock jumped 183%, adding $2.2 trillion to its market cap. Twice this year, Nvidia briefly became the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, overtaking Apple before slipping back. The company’s GPUs are the backbone of AI applications, and demand has been off the charts. Revenue grew by at least 94% in every quarter, with some quarters exceeding 200%. CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia’s next-gen AI chip, Blackwell, is already in production and generating billions in revenue. CFO Colette Kress said the company’s biggest customers are racing to deploy AI applications, creating what she called “billions of agents” in the coming years. While analysts predict slower growth in 2025, Nvidia’s dominance in AI hardware isn’t going anywhere. 2024 has been a year for the history books. Tech stocks, powered by AI and crypto, are rewriting the rules of the market. The question now is how long this ride can last.

""Bitcoin (BTC) Will Be on the Agenda!""","El Salvador, which broke new ground by accepting Bitcoin as legal currency, has set an example for other countries with this move and has recently been talked about with the agreement it made with the IMF. But now it has come to the agenda with a possible visit to Russia. According to CNN, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele is reportedly planning a trip to Russia in the new year and Bitcoin will be an important part of these talks. It is not clear whether the meeting will take place, and experts said at an early stage that the visit would largely depend on the political landscape, particularly the U.S. stance on Russia under President-elect Donald Trump. Alexander Ilyukhin, First Secretary of the Russian Embassy in Nicaragua and Head of the Office in El Salvador, confirmed that talks on the visit were ongoing, adding that both sides were optimistic about the meeting, but that approval would depend on several factors, especially the political climate after Trump's possible return to power. “US policies will play important role in Russia-El Salvador talks.” A Russian diplomat also stated that one of the key topics of the Latin American leader's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will be Bitcoin (BTC). *This is not investment advice.

38103541,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322658,1735143980,XRP Price Rises as Bitcoin Hits $98K – Altseason Starting?,"Even though the price of Bitcoin has retreated lately from its all-time high of $108K, XRP continues to deliver gains to investors. Analysts believe that the contrasting performance of these two digital assets could be an early indication that the so-called alt-season is getting started. This is a part of the crypto market’s bullish cycle that is usually marked by a spike in the price of other cryptocurrencies aside from BTC after the latter experiences a significant push. According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP delivered gains of 54.7% in the past 30 days that have propelled its market cap to the fourth place in the list of most valuable digital assets. During this same period, the price of BTC has stood unchanged at around $98,075. We’re pleased to announce that @Ripple ’s regulated stablecoin #RLUSD is now available on #Bullish . Starting today, eligible regions can trade the following markets: $RLUSD /USDC $BTC /RLUSD $XRP /RLUSD $ETH /RLUSD $USD /RLUSD $EUR /RLUSD $SOL /RLUSD — Bullish (@Bullish) December 24, 2024 One of the most significant drivers of these gains is the launch of RLUSD, the novel stablecoin launched by Ripple that is already listed on top crypto exchanges . On Christmas Eve, the project announced that multiple trading pairs were now available on Bullish including BTC/RLUSD and ETH/RLUSD. These announcements come after several other exchanges like CoinMENA, Bitso, and Uphold made similar announcements. “Combining our 10+ yrs in the business; the rigor & compliance required with stablecoin issuance by a @NYDFS chartered company; and an experienced Advisory Board – RLUSD is launching from Day 1 with credibility, utility and a whole host of partners ready to support it!” commented Monica Long, the President of Ripple in regard to the stablecoin’s prospects. History Repeats Itself? Altseason Typically Begins after Huge BTC Drawdowns One analyst on X called Mister Crypto shared an interesting chart that shows historical parallels between Bitcoin’s post-halving dominance. History may not repeat itself, but it sure rhymes based on this chart. The real altseason starts in 2025. Be prepared. pic.twitter.com/HUzseqbcfE — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) December 21, 2024 It appears that BTC dominance has declined significantly shortly after the network experienced a halving both in 2016 and 2020. In 2020, dominance jumped from 66% to 71% just seven months after the halving. However, it progressively collapsed until reaching a bottom at 40% around twelve months later. Meanwhile, BTC dominance has been steadily increasing to a peak of 60% in October – 6 months after the halving – and has started to decline since then. If a similar pattern unfolds during this cycle, the next 12 months could witness a phenomenal performance from the altcoin sector. XRP is positioned favorably to reap the rewards of an altcoin supercycle as Ripple is based in the United States – an increasingly pro-crypto jurisdiction now that Donald Trump has taken office and dozens of supportive lawmakers are about to push for favorable legislative changes. A closer look at the XRP chart shows that the $1.95 horizontal support is the most critical area to watch moving forward. A drop below this threshold could signal that altseason is not yet beginning. However, a break above the $3 area could mean that XRP’s bulls are ready to push the asset to new heights. The confluence of several tailwinds including the launch of RLUSD, Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, and changes within the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are all playing in favor of a new dawn for altcoins . Presale Tokens Like This Could 10X During an Altcoin Supercycle The Flockerz presale has received significant attention from investors lately as reflected by its remarkable $7.8 million capital raise in just a matter of days. This token introduces a novel model called vote-to-earn (V2E) that hands over governance decisions to the project’s community entirely and incentivizes holders to participate in the decision-making process via monetary crypto rewards. The token is currently available at a discounted price of $0.00653 but the presale event will soon come to an end. Big Announcement for The Flock In just 30 days the Flockerz presale will end. This is your last chance to get in on the ground floor, to grab your share of the presale head on over to: https://t.co/HKN509Un5J It's time to join The Flock! pic.twitter.com/OWkEzSXu3u — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 23, 2024 This kind of bargain doesn’t come often in a market like this where most investors only get the chance to buy promising digital assets once they have made it to centralized exchanges (CEXs). Similar to how other trends have managed to propel the value of pioneer tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) for meme coins and Uniswap (UNI) for decentralized finance (DEFI), $FLOCK is cutting the ribbon of a nascent movement called V2E. No other blockchain has rewarded holders for participating in its governance decisions and that is what makes $FLOCK so unique. To purchase $FLOCK while the presale event is still going, simply visit the Flockerz official website and connect your wallet to convert USDT or ETH. It is also possible to buy the token with a bank card in case you don’t own any crypto at the moment. The presale ends in just a few days so don’t wait any longer to buy your share before the price rises.

38103540,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322636,1735143629,Sui Explodes 13% as Traders Say It’s the ‘Next Solana’ – $100 $SUI Possible?,"The native token of the Sui blockchain experienced a significant surge ahead of Christmas Eve despite the overall weakness that the crypto market has displayed as investors believe that this network could easily compete and beat Solana at its own game. On December 23, the $SUI token experienced a 9% increase that pushed to $4.71 per coin after posting fresh all-time highs just a few days before at $4.9577 per token. Just 5 days before the month ends, $SUI has produced monthly gains of 29.9% even though the entire value of the crypto market has advanced by a mere 2% during this same period. Your favorite hub for easy cross-chain transfers just added another option: $USDT has launched on Sui Bridge! Ethereum users can now enjoy easy, streamlined access to the Sui DeFi ecosystem by moving assets like ETH and USDT with the signature speed and security of Sui. — Sui (@SuiNetwork) December 23, 2024 The launch of Sui Bridge, a cross-chain crypto transfer protocol, on December 23 may have influenced the token’s latest performance. The developing team announced that users could now send $ETH and $USDT easily and rapidly via the Sui blockchain to their favorite decentralized apps (dApps) built on its ecosystem. According to CoinMarketCap, the combined market value of all tokens that currently live on the Sui blockchain currently stands at $16.65 billion with the First Digital USD stablecoin and the DeepBook Protocol leading the scoreboard with market capitalizations exceeding the $1 billion mark already. Although Solana is a well-established layer-one blockchain with dozens of successful and widely adopted dApps in its portfolio and thousands of meme coins minted via protocols like pump.fun, Sui could rapidly catch up if network congestion affects Solana’s long-standing reputation for being the fastest smart contracts blockchain in town. Theoretically, the Sui blockchain is faster as it can process and execute around 300,000 transactions per second compared to 65,000 for Solana. However, its ecosystem remains small – although growing. Moving forward, as scalability may become an issue for Solana, Sui could emerge to progressively replace the latter as the preferred infrastructure for developers to create dApps and mint new digital assets. $SUI is on a Clear Upward Trend but Needs to Overcome this Resistance The $SUI chart shows that the price of the asset is on a clear uptrend that could soon propel it above the $5 mark. The most relevant support areas to watch moving forward would be the trend line support and the $4 psychological threshold that investors seem to have defended fiercely in the past few days. Meanwhile, a break above $5 could result in significant short-term gains of approximately 24% if the upper bound of the price channel shown in the chart is next in line. That said, there’s one major red flag that traders should consider. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a divergence that appeared between December 5 and 13. This is a bearish signal that is typically interpreted as a sign of weakness during a bullish move. A divergence implies that, even though the price of the asset went higher, positive momentum could be fading. Considering the overall bearish tone that the market has embraced following the Federal Reserve’s hawkish comments, traders should approach $SUI with caution, especially if it breaks below the $4 mark. In the long term, reaching $100 per token would mean that the market cap of this project would jump to around $260 billion. The highest the value of Solana ($SOL) has gone since the network was launched in 2020 is $97 billion. Hence, a $100 $SUI sounds a bit far-fetched. However, nothing prevents the token from becoming a valuable asset that could easily double its price if its ecosystem continues to grow rapidly as it has in the past year. Solaxy Comes to Solana’s Rescue as Investors Pour $5.3M During its Presale A layer-two protocol for the Solana blockchain called Solaxy is attracting significant interest from the crypto community amid its ambitious plan to ramp up the efficiency of the main net by bundling transactions offline. After just a few days, its native token $SOLX has been sold to thousands of early buyers and has resulted in the project raising over $5.3 million to finance the developing team’s efforts. Solaxy’s innovative architecture is appealing as it increases the speed at which transactions are executed within the Solana network and alleviates it from the latest congestion it has experienced amid the meme coin hype. $SOLX is currently offered at a discounted price of $0.001578 but this offer expires in the next 18 hours. After that, the price of the token will increase while the presale event could end soon as the project is getting close to achieving their funding target. Crypto influencers believe that Solaxy could become Solana’s Optimism and Arbitrum while its $SOLX token can deliver 10X gains or higher to early buyers once the protocol is widely adopted. To buy $SOL, visit the official Solaxy website and connect your wallet or download the Best Wallet app if you don’t have one. Meanwhile, if you don’t own any crypto at the moment, you can also use your bank card to complete the purchase. The most successful crypto investors are those that get in early on promising projects. This is an incredible chance to make history by helping a novel protocol help the Solana network scale up efficiently.

Solana set for a surge amid incoming altcoin season Solana (SOL) is showing signs of potential growth despite recent dips. Its current price ranges between $160.72 and $214.48. The nearest resistance level is at $249, and breaking this could propel the price higher towards $302. The relative strength index is at 38.17, indicating that SOL is nearing oversold territory. The stochastic indicator is low at 16.72, which often precedes price increases. While the 1-week and 1-month price changes are down by over 20% and 30% respectively, the 6-month change remains positive at 30.16%. With the altcoin season on the horizon and a global crypto bull run expected, Solana could see significant upward movement soon. Cosmos gears up for potential breakout ahead of altcoin season Cosmos (ATOM) is showing signs of a possible upward move. Trading between $5.06 and $8.52, it’s below the 100-day simple moving average of $6.82. The Relative Strength Index is around 38, indicating it’s nearing oversold territory. This could lead to increased buying interest. If ATOM surpasses the nearest resistance at $10, it may target the next level at $14. This would be an increase of over 60% from current prices. With the anticipated altcoin season and a bullish crypto market, Cosmos has the potential for significant growth in the coming period. CHILLGUY set to break resistance amid upcoming altcoin season Just a chill guy (CHILLGUY) is trading between $0.10 and $0.33, showing signs of consolidation. The RSI is at 49.59, indicating the market is ready for a move. The Stochastic oscillator is low at 15.39, suggesting the coin is oversold and could rebound soon. With the MACD level positive at 0.0018, momentum might be shifting upwards. The next resistance is at $0.47, and breaking this could see CHILLGUY reaching $0.70, which would be over a 100% gain from current levels. With altcoin season approaching, CHILLGUY could be poised for significant growth despite recent declines. Polkadot poised for surge amid incoming altcoin season Polkadot (DOT) is showing signs of upward momentum despite a recent weekly dip of over 25%. Currently trading near the lower end of its price range, indicators suggest a potential reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 38, hinting at an oversold condition. The stochastic oscillator is also low, indicating possible bullish activity ahead. If DOT can break through the nearest resistance level at $10, it could target the next resistance at $13.63. This move would represent a significant gain of more than 50% from current levels. With the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, Polkadot might be ready to capitalize on market optimism. Conclusion While SOL, ATOM, CHILLGUY, and DOT may offer less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to all.

On Tuesday, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded its biggest outflow. As U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs see four straight days of withdrawals, over $1.5 billion has vanished, leaving traders wondering what is next. BlackRock’s Historic Outflow Shakes Confidence BlackRock’s IBIT made headlines with its largest outflow since its inception, as $188.7 million exited the ETF on December 25. This record nearly doubled the $72.7 million record set just last Friday. Data from Farside Investors revealed that the U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs suffered four consecutive days of outflows, totaling $338.4 million. Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark Invest’s ARKB contributed $83.2 million and $75 million, respectively, amplifying the bearish signals. The timing of these withdrawals has sparked debate among traders and analysts. This is because the holiday season is usually a period of low liquidity. Predictions of a market crash around Donald Trump’s inauguration and sudden sell-offs highlight the market’s cautious sentiment. Market Optimism Rekindled with Bitcoin’s Price Recovery Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin’s price demonstrated resilience as traders fueled a potential Santa rally. The asset surged from $94,000 to $99,000, up by 5.70% within 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data. For now, BTC holds strong above $98,000. But as optimism grows, so does the risk of profit-taking. Analysts are closely monitoring the $100,000 level as liquidity at this price point and beyond could shape the next move. Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins also participated in the recovery, signaling a broader market rebound. However, the declining trading volume, which has dropped by 24% in the past 24 hours, signals reduced enthusiasm among retail investors. Institutions Bet Big Amid Uncertainty While some investors pull back, institutional players are doubling down. MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor has called for a shareholder vote on a bold plan to expand their Bitcoin reserves. Other firms like Matador Technologies and Metaplanet are also scooping up Bitcoin , seeing opportunity in the chaos. The upcoming Bitcoin options expiry of 147 BTC on Deribit, with a notional value of $14.4 billion, could bring more pressure on the market. With a max pain price of $84,000 and a put-call ratio 0.68, volatility is likely to rise; traders position themselves for the new year.

38102843,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667022,1735142426,"Dogecoin Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle Pattern, Analyst Puts Target Above $0.37","A crypto analyst, known as ‘CryptoSanders9563’, disclosed in a report on TradingView that the Dogecoin price has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern. This technical pattern, signaling a bullish continuation for Dogecoin, is expected to trigger a price surge to a new target above $0.375. Symmetrical Triangle To Drive Dogecoin Price Above $0.37 CryptoSanders has shared a Dogecoin price chart, showing a symmetrical triangle pattern formed by converging trendlines. According to the TradingView analyst, Dogecoin’s price broke above the symmetrical triangle’s upper trendline at approximately $0.316, confirming a bullish breakout and signaling a potential surge to a new price target above $0.375. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Can Recover To $107,000 Again If This Important Level Is Broken A symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern that signals a period of consolidation before a price breakout. When the price of a cryptocurrency experiences a breakout from this pattern, it often indicates the start of a new trend or a continuation of a former trend. As a result, breaking out of the lower trendline marks the beginning of a bearish phase and vice versa. CryptoSanders has revealed that Dogecoin’s price breakout is accompanied by continued price action above critical moving averages, further strengthening its bullish setup. At the time of the analyst’s report, the Dogecoin price was trading above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 200-EMA. These two moving averages are critical indicators that suggest a continued upward momentum in the Dogecoin price. The TradingView analyst has surmised that converging both moving averages could be a dynamic support for Dogecoin, potentially fortifying its upside momentum. Following the recent breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern, the analyst has pinpointed $0.375 as Dogecoin’s next significant resistance level. This price point is also a psychological level for Dogecoin, triggering profit-taking for investors. If the Dogecoin price can break above the $0.375 resistance level, it could trigger a more substantial price rally to new highs. However, a failure to breach this level could catalyze another downtrend, potentially pushing Dogecoin’s price to the $0.306 support level. Dogecoin Trade Setup and Strategy While sharing his optimistic projection for Dogecoin’s price trajectory, CryptoSanders also outlined a well-defined trade strategy for investors looking to capitalize on this symmetrical triangle breakout. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Wave 2 And 5 Targets Put XRP At $7 And $13 The analyst pinpointed an entry zone at the $0.316 price level after the confirmation of the breakout. A stop loss of $0.306 has been set to mitigate downside risk and avoid financial loss in the event of a failed breakout. Furthermore, the previously projected target of $0.375 has been reaffirmed as the primary profit-taking zone, coinciding with the highlighted resistance area on the chart. CryptoSanders has revealed that this trade setup offers a favorable risk-to-reward ratio. Investors can potentially earn a significant profit as long as the price of Dogecoin holds above the breakout level and the stop loss is respected.

38105079,https://invezz.com/?p=2404530,1735142400,"Under $0.20 today, this altcoin is positioned to repeat the success of prime Solana (SOL) and Polygon (POL)","Early movers usually get the most benefits from the quickly changing crypto scene. For those who saw Solana’s (SOL) and Polygon’s (POL) explosive climbs, the question now is not what happened but rather where the next great prospect resides. The solution seems obvious today: Under less than $0.20, the altcoin Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast acquiring popularity as the following big success narrative in cryptocurrencies. Rexas Finance is making analogies to the early days of SOL and POL. These projects transformed early adopters into millionaires through their creative approach to blockchain technology, real-world utility, and presale, which has already raised over $30.4 million. Here’s how RXS prepares the ground for exponential expansion and why this might be the decade’s investment of choice. Solana and Polygon: the benchmarks for success Prime instances of cryptocurrencies that started with low pricing but exploded to incredible values, Solana and Polygon, give investors life-changing profits. While Polygon addressed Ethereum’s scalability concerns and became a necessary layer-2 solution, Solana set itself apart with its fast blockchain, capable of handling hundreds of transactions per second. These tokens solved actual problems, acquired acceptance, and created strong ecosystems rather than merely riding the wave of enthusiasm. Now Rexas Finance finds itself at a similar junction. Placing itself on the same level as these heavyweights in their early years, it combines the finest scalability, usability, and utility features. Rexas Finance (RXS): the rising star of 2025 Designed to take the forefront of blockchain, Rexas Finance is a combination of Solana, which concentrates on transaction speed, and Polygon, which focuses on scalability. However, Rexas presents a different value proposition: Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenizing. This innovative tool lets users tokenize fine art, intellectual property, and real estate assets, enabling daily investors to access them. Rexas is an ecosystem for expansion and practical acceptance, not just another cryptocurrency. Maintaining minimal transaction costs and excellent security, the ERC-20 token standard guarantees compatibility with Ethereum-based projects. Explosive potential for growth With its modest $0.15 presale pricing in the 10th stage, Rexas Finance is a fantastic prospect for early adopters. Strong investor confidence is shown by the fact that over 362 million tokens have already been sold. With Rexas positioned for a successful debut, the presale offers first investors an instant profit opportunity. In the following years, analysts estimate RXS might reach double-digit pricing, repeating or possibly surpassing Solana and Polygon’s paths. Why Rexas Finance stands out Why does Rexas Finance transcend mere altcoins? Initially, its emphasis was scalability and utility. Rexas addresses real-world blockchain-based concerns, unlike many speculative ventures. Tokenizing real-world assets creates new investment possibilities and improves liquidity in usually illiquid markets. Rexas Finance also has a strong basis since it completed a thorough CertiK audit, reassuring investors of its dependability and security. It is also shown on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, raising its global audience’s accessibility. The Rexas Launchpad and Token Builder are other essential elements that distinguish this project. These instruments let companies and developers design their currencies and introduce blockchain-based solutions, encouraging innovation inside the Rexas network. Community engagement and giveaway A vibrant community has always defined practical crypto projects; Rexas Finance is no exception. Its $1 million prize has generated buzz throughout the crypto scene. Each of the twenty lucky winners will receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, generating enthusiasm and involvement during this vital early phase. This project benefits the community and helps establish its inclusive and investor-friendly profile. The road ahead Though Rexas can grow much farther, the similarities between early Solana or Polygon and Rexas Finance are evident. Combining real-world utility, innovative technology, and a vibrant community helps one to be positioned to rule the next bull run and beyond. Rexas Finance presents a unique chance for investors to participate on the ground floor of a project with excellent upside potential as the crypto sector prepares for its next phase of expansion. For those who wish to guarantee RXS at its low price, the clock is running out as the presale is almost finished, and momentum building is mounting. AI Predicts $RXS Will Hit $7 by 2025: Ethereum Whales Are Bullish on Rexas Finance (RXS) Final thought Finding the next Solana or Polygon is no simple chore in cryptocurrencies. Still, Rexas Finance embodies all the traits of a breakthrough star: creative technology, active community involvement, and an emphasis on practical solutions. At just $0.15, Rexas offers early investors an unmatched chance to ride the wave of an enterprise destined for brilliance. As Solana and Polygon have demonstrated, early actors profit the most. Don’t miss your opportunity to join the following central success narrative. Ready to lead the way is Rexas Finance.

38102821,https://crypto.news/?p=14322089,1735142400,This week’s top crypto picks – 6 altcoins primed for 2025 profits,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto investors seek the next big opportunity; here are six altcoins poised for massive growth by 2025. Table of Contents DOGEN: The ultimate memetoken for alphas who demand the best Toncoin: Potential growth and price predictions to 2030 Aptos: A scalable blockchain using Move programming language Aave: Decentralized lending and borrowing with flash loans Uniswap’s UNI token: Governance in decentralized exchange Solana: A high-speed blockchain platform for scalable DApps Conclusion Cryptocurrency markets are constantly changing, and investors seek the next big opportunity. In this dynamic environment, some lesser-known digital coins are showing great promise for future growth. This article highlights six altcoins that could deliver significant returns by 2025. Explore these potential game-changers and stay ahead in the evolving crypto landscape. DOGEN: The ultimate memetoken for alphas who demand the best Unleash your inner alpha with DOGEN , the memetoken crafted for those who aspire to live life on their own terms. Designed for winners who never settle, DOGEN is the ultimate token for those who crave more — luxury cars, overflowing cash, and the lifestyle others only dream about. This is the Alpha DOGEN way, where every move is a power play. You might also like: ETH and FLOKI set for breakouts, DOGEN smashes records with $4M presale HODL like a boss, dominate the market Ready to step into the Alpha DOGEN lifestyle and claim the finer things in life? DOGEN is ready for takeoff, with a projected 700% surge by the end of its presale — and that’s just the beginning. As meme tokens lead the charge in this altcoin season, DOGEN is on track to deliver legendary thousand-fold returns. The earlier someone joins, the their your gains. This isn’t just an investment; it’s a statement. Others will be left watching from the sidelines as early investors rise to the top of the pack. Missed out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the next big player in the Solana memetoken ecosystem, standing tall with icons like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, all of which have achieved stunning 1000% growth. Undervalued and underappreciated — for now — DOGEN is set to rewrite the narrative, with the bull run positioning it as a record-breaking contender. A community that delivers real value This isn’t just hype; DOGEN is a movement. Backed by a dedicated team, DOGEN is focused on fostering a thriving community of alpha leaders who know how to dominate. With exclusive campaigns, enticing perks, and a commitment to lasting value, DOGEN is more than a token, it’s a long-term opportunity. The multi-level referral program is as bold as the token itself. Users earn 7% from every token their direct recruits (1st level) buy using their referral code, and watch their rewards grow as the network expands. The more users you bring in, the more profits stacked — it’s a system designed for leaders who know how to win. Toncoin: Potential growth and price predictions to 2030 Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized, open-source layer-1 blockchain. Originally developed by Telegram, the project is now led by the TON Foundation. Toncoin uses a proof-of-stake model, aiming for scalability and reliability. It offers fast, secure payments with low fees and plans to develop a comprehensive ecosystem with decentralized services. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Toncoin’s price could reach up to $30.30 by 2025 and $26.04 by 2030. Compared to today’s price, this suggests significant potential growth. In the current market cycle, Toncoin appears attractive due to its technology and projected price increases. Aptos: A scalable blockchain using Move programming language Aptos (APT) is a new layer-one blockchain designed to tackle high transaction fees and network congestion. It was developed by Aptos Labs, founded by core contributors from Meta’s Diem project. Aptos uses the Move programming language for smart contracts, emphasizing safety and flexibility. It operates with a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and supports various Web3 applications. The technology aims for scalability and reliability. In the current market cycle, Aptos offers potential as an emerging platform addressing existing blockchain limitations. Aave: Decentralized lending and borrowing with flash loans Aave is a decentralized finance platform on Ethereum that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. It supports 17 cryptocurrencies for lending and borrowing. Users earn interest through aTokens. A unique feature is flash loans, which are instant loans without collateral that must be repaid within the same block. The AAVE token offers benefits like fee reductions and voting rights, and it can be used as collateral. The platform’s Safety Module allows staking for risk mitigation. With a limited supply and deflationary mechanisms, AAVE may have growth potential. In the current market cycle, Aave’s innovative features could make it an attractive option. Uniswap’s UNI token: Governance in decentralized exchange Uniswap’s UNI token is a governance token launched in September 2020. It allows holders to vote on platform developments like fee structures and token distribution. This move came after competition from SushiSwap. Uniswap distributed 150 million UNI tokens to past users, with each receiving 400 UNI tokens worth over $1,000 at launch. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain, operating since 2018. It uses an automated liquidity protocol, enabling trading without an order book and giving users control of their funds. Its open-source nature and free token listing set it apart. Uniswap is the fourth-largest DeFi platform with over $3 billion in assets. The UNI token’s role in governance and the platform’s innovation make it potentially attractive in the current market cycle. Solana: A high-speed blockchain platform for scalable DApps Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability, focusing on fast transactions and support for decentralized applications. It competes with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano but stands out by avoiding sharding or second-layer solutions. Solana’s architecture allows developers to build applications using different programming languages. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the network, enabling transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding participants. SOL holds value as it supports the Solana ecosystem and provides access to various projects on the platform. With its high-capacity network and potential for hosting high-activity services, Solana has gained attention from developers and investors, making SOL a notable coin in the current market. Conclusion While TON, APT, AAVE, and UNI may offer less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN expects 700% growth by presale’s end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of alpha leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

38102733,https://finbold.com/?p=221822,1735142160,AI picks 2 cryptocurrencies that will outperform others in Q1 2025,"Q4 2024 marked the start of a new crypto bull market cycle , with most projects rallying to impressive gains. However, some cryptocurrencies outperformed others, led by strong momentum and favorable narratives, which could happen again in Q1 2025. In this context, Finbold turned to Grok 2, an artificial intelligence model (AI) designed by Elon Musk ’s company xAI . We asked Grok to pick two cryptocurrencies that have a good chance of outperforming the market in 2025’s first quarter. The xAI most-advanced model was used given its ability to scan X and the web for up-to-date data and analysis. Some experts believe Grok AI could one day replace Google due to its real-time scanning feature and accuracy. Grok AI is bullish on Ethereum (ETH) for Q1 2025 As a response , Grok AI first picked Ethereum ( ETH ) as a promising cryptocurrency for Q1 2025, expecting an altseason. In particular, the model considered seven posts and 15 web pages while delivering this result. Ethereum has shown significant growth and still plays a key role in decentralized finance ( DeFi ), benefiting from positive network effects. On that note, Grok found three analyses that anticipate ETH will continue its upward trajectory to new all-time highs. “This is supported by its established developer community, wide adoption in decentralized applications, and the increasing interest in Ethereum-based NFTs and DeFi protocols.” – Grok AI Grok 2 picks Ethereum (ETH) to outperform other cryptocurrencies in Q1 2025. Source: Finbold / Vini Barbosa (@vinibarbosabr) Grok AI picks Solana (SOL) to outperform other cryptocurrencies Notably, Grok’s second pick is Solana ( SOL ), which is getting the spotlight for its “high transaction throughput and low costs.” According to the analyses, Solana has proven a strong contender against Ethereum’s DeFi and NFT dominance, conquering significant market share. SOL was one of the best performers in 2023 and also in 2024, displaying solid momentum among the top cryptocurrencies. Grok believes Solana can do it again in the first quarter of 2025. “Solana’s ecosystem has been expanding, with growing interest from both developers and investors due to its speed and scalability. Various sources indicate that Solana might see considerable growth due to its fundamental strengths and the momentum from its recent market performance.” – Grok AI Grok 2 picks Solana (SOL) to outperform other cryptocurrencies in Q1 2025. Source: Finbold / Vini Barbosa (@vinibarbosabr) Nevertheless, Grok can always make mistakes, and investors should not consider this analysis alone when making financial decisions. As disclosed, these cryptocurrencies have established market presence and ongoing technological advancements, benefiting from positive market sentiment, but other projects could surge in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency market as we move into 2025.

38102585,https://nulltx.com/?p=136648,1735141767,Safest Crypto Wallets for 2025: Top Picks for Security & Usability,"Picking the Most Secure Crypto Wallets: Ideal Choices for Safety-Conscious Investors In 2024, the cryptocurrency industry witnessed a 21% increase in security breaches from the previous year, totaling losses up to $2.2 billion. Centralized servers, which store private keys, were frequently attacked, highlighting a significant vulnerability. In such a perilous digital landscape, securing a highly protective crypto wallet is crucial for safeguarding digital assets. Yet, optimal security must be balanced with additional features like cross-chain compatibility and ease of use. This article outlines the leading secure crypto wallets of the year—Plus Wallet, Exodus, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet—designed to offer top-notch security while enhancing user experience with added functionality. 1. Plus Wallet: Premier Security Meets Unlimited Earning Potential Plus Wallet distinguishes itself as a top contender among secure crypto wallets, combining stringent security measures and cross-chain functionality within a user-friendly interface. It uses self-custody storage, ensuring that private keys remain on the user’s device, which provides complete control and protection against external breaches. It supports two-factor authentication, including Face ID and PIN codes, adding an extra layer of security. For additional safety, users can create a recovery phrase to regain access if needed. Moreover, Plus Wallet enriches user experience by offering limitless rewards through its Swap to Earn and Refer to Earn programs, allowing users to earn on every transaction without any caps on the activity. By merging rigorous security protocols with enticing user rewards, Plus Wallet caters to those seeking both robust protection and financial incentives. 2. Trust Wallet: A Versatile Platform for Multiple Crypto Assets As an affiliate of Binance, Trust Wallet enables direct purchases, sales, and exchanges of cryptocurrencies from the app. It supports over 100 blockchains and integrates smoothly with decentralized applications (dApps), offering access to DeFi platforms, gaming, and NFT markets. This integration enhances overall functionality, making it easier for users to engage with diverse crypto services. However, its connection to the centralized entity Binance might deter those desiring a fully decentralized wallet solution. 3. Exodus: Simplified Crypto Management with External Hardware Support Exodus stands out by offering an integrated suite of applications for managing cryptocurrencies, accessible via mobile, desktop, and a web extension. Notably, it connects seamlessly with Trezor, facilitating easy crypto transfers from hot to cold storage, enhancing security significantly. While Exodus is free and provides a wealth of educational resources, its status as closed-source software could be a downside for those who prefer open-source solutions for greater transparency and security assurance. 4. Coinbase Wallet: User-Friendly Interface with Direct Exchange Access Coinbase Wallet operates independently from its exchange counterpart, allowing users to manage their cryptocurrencies separately from the exchange. The wallet’s user-friendly design and integration with Coinbase’s exchange services make it an attractive option for newcomers to non-custodial wallets. It supports various decentralized applications and provides smooth transactions of assets like Solana. Nonetheless, its close ties with the centralized Coinbase exchange could be less appealing for those prioritizing decentralization. Choosing the Most Secure Crypto Wallet Each wallet listed here is recognized for its strong security features, yet they cater to diverse preferences and needs. Coinbase Wallet is particularly beneficial for those already using Coinbase’s services, due to its integration. Trust Wallet offers broad access to various cryptocurrencies and services, although its association with Binance may not suit everyone’s taste. Exodus is an excellent choice for those interested in combining hot and cold storage solutions, and Plus Wallet excels in providing both superior security and flexibility, making it the most secure crypto wallet for users interested in exploring new projects and earning passive income.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-fuks-santa-muskfsan-solana-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

TRX found a temporal support level and now slowly shows signs of strength, potential rally ahead. The early month explosion saw TRX price through a major milestone as it rallied by 100% in a single day to test exactly $0.45. Unfortunately, it lost buzz due to rejection and was dumped, ending the first week in loss. It dumped harder this month amid rising supply and the price corrected deeply to as low as $0.22 during last week’s meltdown. The crypto mounted support there and increased slightly amid this week’s recovery. Closing Monday bullish for the first time in a week, TRX is now sitting well above the $0.25 level as capital gradually flows back into the market. From the look of things, it appeared to have ended correction on a daily scale and if more money rolls in, we can expect a bigger price recovery. However, if the crypto loses momentum again due to rising supply, the price will continue to correct until it finds a firm support level for a fresh increase. As it stands now, the demand level appears low. Regardless of that, the trend remains bullish in the long term following a 5x rally in the last two years. The price can hit $1 if the adoption rate rises during this bull cycle. TRX’s Key Level to Watch Source: Tradingview Moving higher, the $0.225 level is an immediate resistance to watch along with the $0.31 level. A push from there could bring a full recovery to $0.37 and the $0.45 resistance level with a potential break up. Losing grip above last week’s $0.225 low could fuel another leg down to the $0.186 support level. Right below it lies the $0.17 level that flipped as resistance during last month’s surge.

38103538,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322663,1735140633,"Turkey Tightens Crypto AML Rules, Mandating User Info for Transactions by 2025","Turkey is set to implement stringent crypto regulations by February 2025 as part of their effort to tighten anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks to align with global standards. This legislative move, announced in the final week of 2024 , is inspired by similar regulatory initiatives in major jurisdictions, particularly the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Source: resmigazete.gov.tr Under the new rule, Turkish crypto service providers will be required to collect identifying information from users who execute transactions worth more than 15,000 Turkish lira (approximately $425). This measure aims to curb money laundering and terrorist financing through digital assets. The regulations arrive at a time of heightened scrutiny over the crypto sector, driven by Turkey’s growing prominence in global cryptocurrency markets. According to Chainalysis, Turkey ranked as the world’s eleventh-largest crypto market by adoption this year. Source: Chainalysis Turkish regulators see this as a necessity for comprehensive oversight to prevent abuse within the sector. New Turkey’s AML Rule Demands User Identity: What Does Mean For Your Crypto Transactions? From February 25, 2025, all crypto transactions exceeding the 15,000-lira threshold will require Turkish crypto service providers to verify identities. Additionally, any customer using wallet addresses not previously registered with the provider will need to undergo identity checks. Providers are authorized to classify the transaction as “risky” and potentially halt it if they cannot obtain sufficient information from the sender. The bill stipulates that providers may limit transactions or terminate business relationships with non-compliant users in such cases. This regulatory shift places significant responsibility on crypto exchanges and service providers, requiring them to implement advanced customer verification systems. To operate legally, firms must obtain licenses from the Capital Markets Board (CMB), which has already received 47 applications since mid-2024 under the new crypto regulatory framework. Compliance extends beyond user verification, as the Financial Crimes Investigation Board will oversee ongoing operations. At the same time, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) will audit the technological infrastructure deployed by crypto firms. Although these regulations could enhance consumer protection and fortify Turkey’s financial system against illicit activities, industry experts warn of potential drawbacks. The rigorous requirements may stifle innovation and deter smaller startups from meeting compliance costs. Conversely, established international crypto firms may view the regulations as an opportunity to enter the Turkish market. 2025 Global Crypto Regulation Outlook Turkey’s approach mirrors the European Union’s MiCA framework, which sets a precedent for comprehensive crypto regulation across member states. However, Turkey’s measures impose stricter conditions on licensing and internal controls. This contrasts with the fragmented regulatory landscape in the United States, where crypto oversight varies across agencies, leading to inconsistent enforcement. However, the prohibition of crypto payments—in effect since 2021—remains a notable constraint. While trading, holding, and investing in crypto are permitted, the inability to use digital assets for direct payments limits their utility within the domestic economy. To address fiscal challenges, Turkish authorities are also contemplating a 0.03% transaction tax on crypto trades , which could bolster national revenues without significantly impeding market growth. Turkey is not the only country preparing to implement rigorous regulations for the crypto market by 2025. According to a recent report, the Central Bank of Russia is developing a centralized surveillance platform to curb illegal financial activities . Russia's Central Bank is developing a new surveillance platform to combat illegal crypto OTC services and enhance financial security! #Crypto #Russia https://t.co/gSD4mDWDar — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 25, 2024 The platform will identify and block “mules”—individuals who use their accounts for illicit transactions, including crypto OTC trades.

38102000,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314046,1735140614,"CryptoQuant CEO Says Using Strategic Bitcoin Reserve To Offset US Debt Is Feasible, Calls the Approach Practical","The chief executive of the digital asset analytics firm CryptoQuant thinks a national strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve could offset US debt. Ki Young Ju tells his 389,600 followers on the social media platform X that $790 billion in realized capital inflows have ballooned Bitcoin’s market cap to $2 trillion over the past 15 years. “This year alone, $352 billion in inflows have added $1 trillion to its market cap. However, using a pumpable asset like Bitcoin to offset dollar-denominated debt—rather than gold or dollars—could make gaining creditors’ consensus challenging. For Bitcoin to achieve broader market acceptance, Bitcoin must attain global, nationwide authority on par with gold. Establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) could serve as a symbolic first step. With 70% of U.S. debt held domestically, offsetting 36% of it by acquiring 1 million Bitcoin by 2050 becomes feasible if the U.S. government designates Bitcoin as a strategic asset.” The CryptoQuant CEO adds that the 30% of debt held by foreign entities might resist that approach, but he argues that the strategy remains practical nonetheless. “If a consensus is reached on Bitcoin’s status, achieving this is entirely possible. The only risk would be old whales dumping BTC to attack the US. However, if governments continue accumulating Bitcoin until 2050 and its price keeps rising, I doubt they would actually dump it.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider VanEck, initially outlined how a strategic Bitcoin reserve could offset US debt. “Assume the US Treasury starts buying one million Bitcoin over five years at a starting price of $200,000. Assume US debt grows at 5% (vs. last 10 years 8% compound annual growth rate) and BTC price compounds at 25%. In such a scenario, the US Strategic BTC Reserve would hold assets equivalent to 36% of debt by 2050. In that scenario, BTC would be $42 million/coin (same as Michael Saylor’s target, coincidentally) and the market cap would be 18% of global financial assets. But even at a 15% compound annual growth rate, the BTC stash would still be quite valuable.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While the asset remains under correction, the price looks weak following an 8% drop in 7 days. Unlike many top altcoins, XRP has not seen much change since last week because of low trading volatility. The price currently looks indecisive on the daily chart as it continues to stay in a retracement phase. This phase, which came after testing the $2.9 level earlier this month, is still considered minor compared to what ETH, BNB and SOL experienced during the last leg down. These altcoins have provided a notable discount and are now looking set for major recovery from a technical standpoint. The minor retracement suggests a strong conviction for a bigger rally amongst the long-term buyers (whales) as they reaccumulate while the weak hands sell off positions. Once the reaccumulation ends, we can expect a sudden price movement above the falling resistance line that prevented the bulls since the start of the month. This could catch many traders unaware as they FOMO along. A dump in the price could provide a bigger discount for a long-term buy. Though, trading may look uninteresting for some days, but the market structure is still considered bullish on the daily chart. While the overall market may enter an anaemic state as the year runs to an end, XRP remains the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap since it occupied that spot last month. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Taking advantage of the latest recovery, XRP may reclaim $2.5 before flipping the resistance line to $2.7. The main resistance for a such move is $2.9, followed by a break to the all-time high of $3.3. For a broader retracement move, the price must fall below the holding $1.9 support before testing a lower support of $1.63 and $1.28.

A trend has formed where Ethereum (ETH) is still the leader in nominal value locked, but has a smaller share of the DeFi market as a whole. The DeFi market is shifting, as Ethereum (ETH) was joined by several other chains with successful financial apps. At the end of 2023, the influence of Ethereum over the entire DeFi sector was at 72.2%. Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi was at $109B, still affected by the bear market. In the past 12 months, the total value locked ranged between $125B and up to $275B , depending on the method of reporting. DeFi added more active new chains in 2024 The BNB Chain remained a low-key staple of the DeFi space, with an unchanged 4.5% market share, the same as the end of 2024. Solana achieved slight growth, from 3.6% at the end of last year to 6.7% of the market at the end of 2024. Solana’s bid for DeFi success came from DEX activity, as well as the attempt to create a native form of liquid staking and liquid re-staking. Solana boosted its transaction count and value locked based on increased DEX traffic from swapping meme tokens. The other big shift in 2024 is the appearance of Bitcoin-based DeFi sector. Currently, up to 5.6% of all value is locked in BTC-based DeFi. Babylon Labs holds the biggest share, with $5.59B in self-custodied BTC staking. The current form of Bitcoin-based DeFi did not take off from the proposed L2 projects, which ended up with almost no value locked. The appeal of Babylon Labs lies in the ability to unlock BTC at any moment, with no need for bridging. TRON is the other big shift in DeFi. The chain first appeared as a DeFi hub in 2022, and currently has a 6% market share. TRON reached a peak of 6.5% of the DeFi market at the end of 2023, with a share of 6.5%. The TRON ecosystem grew based on crypto-collateral lending, in addition to the $60B in stablecoin liquidity. Arbitrum was one of the go-to chains during the 2022-2023 bear market, but did not graduate to a major chain. It became a part of the mix of minor chains with early-stage DeFi. The big change in 2024 affected smaller chains, which make up an estimated 21.6% of all DeFi value. Just a year ago, minor chains made up 10.4% of DeFi value locked. Base, Sui and Aptos emerged as alternatives to Ethereum, offering low costs and innovation. In the last days of 2024, Hyperliquid trended, after the launch of its native HYPE token. The new super-fast chains are focusing on trading opportunities, gaining liquidity with targeted high-activity pairs. Ethereum still leads DeFi with its collateral influence Ethereum (ETH) still carries more than $70B in value locked, due to being used as collateral. ETH bridged to Binance Smart Chain is also driving the value of DeFi. DeFi on Ethereum is high-value due to the model of most apps, which require large-scale collaterals or another form of locking ETH. Liquid staking from LidoDAO built the biggest ETH reserve. Aave (AAVE) rose to the second spot, after becoming the leading lending protocol in 2024. Ethereum-based DeFi remains a strong proposition, as there are still expectations for an ETH rally to a higher range. The new year is usually a historically strong period for ETH , potentially raising the value locked in all DeFi apps. ETH retained its value at $3,494.45, with strong support at $3,400. For now, the DeFi sector is safe, as most of the collaterals have been deposited at a much lower price range. The other reason for the growth of Ethereum-based DeFi is the inflow of Tether (USDT) as an ERC-20 token. The supply of ERC-20 USDT expanded to 79.92B tokens, swapping some of the TRON-based and niche chain versions due to liquidity demand.

Israel Securities Authority Approves Bitcoin Mutual Funds According to CoinDesk – who was the first to publish a translated version of the news – the report states that the six mutual funds of the Satoshi Nakamoto-created cryptocurrency will formally debut on December 31. Approved mutual funds include those operated by Migdal Capital Markets, Phoenix Investment, More, Ayalon, IBI, and Meitav. “The investment houses have been pleading for more than a year for ETFs to be approved and started sending prospectuses for bitcoin funds in the middle of the year,” an unnamed investment executive told the media outlet. Trump And Bitcoin’s Post-Election Surge News of Israel’s mutual funds comes as Bitcoin’s value cools after a surge in light of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The coin spiked at an all time high of $108,000 on December 16 amid anticipation President-elect Donald Trump could significantly shift crypto regulation in the United States. The New York-born businessman has all the more reason to champion a balanced blockchain regulatory framework given he helped to launch his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial earlier in the year. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” The former reality television star has long supported crypto-friendly American policy , vowing to replace current United States Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler when he returns to the Oval Office. Gensler, who has since announced his resignation from the federal regulator, will likely be replaced by former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to spearhead the government agency.

On the campaign trail for the November 2024 elections, now President-elect Donald Trump made several big promises to the crypto industry. Still, none has been as talked about following the election as his intention to launch a strategic U.S. Bitcoin reserve.However, while pundits continue to debate the feasibility of such a move at the Federal level and its possible market impacts, some states may be looking to get in on the action.U.S. States Consider the Orange PillFollowing Donald Trump's election victory, at least three U.S. states are considering building their own Bitcoin stockpile employing unique frameworks, as recently highlighted in a CNBC Crypto World report on Tuesday, December 24. Speaking with CNBC , Centrifuge General Counsel Eli Cohen asserted that the development was significantly positive for the crypto markets.Pennsylvania On November 12, barely a week after Trump's announcement as the next U.S. president, Pennsylvania State Representative Mike Cabell proposed a bill to allow the state treasurer to invest state funds in Bitcoin.House Bill 2664, or the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, seeks to allow the treasurer to invest up to 10% of the State General Fund, the Rainy Day Fund, and the State Investment Fund in Bitcoin.Cabell argues that implementing the bill would help protect state assets against inflation. He asserted that the state's purchasing power had reduced by a staggering 20% in the past four years alone while Bitcoin continues to gain strength against the dollar.So far, Pennsylvania's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act has received only one co-sponsor, Representative Aaron Kaufer.TexasOn December 12, Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione proposed House Bill 1598 , or the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, to allow the state to establish a Bitcoin reserve within its treasury.Unlike Pennsylvania's proposed bill allowing the treasurer to purchase Bitcoin with established state funds, the proposed Texas bill will establish the reserve by enabling residents to pay charges and taxes with Bitcoin. The stockpile will also be open to voluntary donations.The Texas bill also details the establishment of cold storage and a holding period, noting that the state must not sell the reserve for at least five years.Like Pennsylvania's Cabell, Capriglione also argues that Bitcoin could act as an inflationary hedge preserving value for Texans.On Tuesday, Centrifuge's Eli Cohen told CNBC that Texas' bill may face significant infrastructure hurdles and problems getting the crypto community to submit their wallet for taxes.OhioOhio is the most recent to join the Bitcoin rush. On December 17, state Representative Derek Merrin submitted a proposal to allow the state to establish a Bitcoin stockpile.House Bill 703, or Ohio's Bitcoin Reserve Act, seeks to give the state treasurer the flexibility to invest in Bitcoin if they desire and build a reserve from seized assets.Merrin hopes the bill will pave the way for quick legislation in 2025.The recent state bills, like the proposed national effort, are all in their early stages, and it remains unclear if they can garner the needed support to become law.

Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): The Underdog with a Roaring Past If you’ve ever felt like the underdog, you’ll relate to Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW). This Solana-based meme coin has carved a niche for itself as the anti-dog meme coin, offering a fresh perspective in a market dominated by dog-themed tokens. Over the past nine months, MEW has grown by an impressive 828.5%, thanks to listings on major exchanges like KuCoin. But the journey hasn’t been all smooth sailing. As of December 24, MEW is trading at $0.00657983, down 19.49% over the past week and 34.3% over the past month. Despite these setbacks, its strong community and unique branding make it a contender in the meme coin space. Investors should keep an eye on MEW as it navigates market volatility, offering potential opportunities for those who can ride the waves. Notcoin (NOT): A Tale of Resilience in a Volatile Market Next up is NOT, a meme coin that’s making waves on The Open Network (TON) blockchain. Known for its Telegram-based tap-to-earn game, NOT has built a loyal following among crypto gamers. Currently priced at $0.00662674, NOT has seen its share of ups and downs. Large holders have offloaded positions recently, leading to a downtrend. But July’s bullish divergence hints that the tide could turn. What sets NOT apart is its integration with TON’s gaming ecosystem, offering real utility in a sector that’s often criticised for being all hype. Still, like MEW, NOT faces stiff competition from meme coins with broader ecosystems, like BTFD. Its current price might attract speculative investors, but its lack of a clear long-term vision keeps it a step behind. Conclusion When it comes to the best new meme coins to invest in this week, BTFD Coin, MEW, and NOT each bring something unique to the table. BTFD’s presale, with its 50% discount and exciting features like a P2E game and staking rewards, makes it the standout choice for those looking to buy the dip and ride the next bull wave. MEW’s growth story and NOT’s resilience add depth to the meme coin landscape, offering opportunities for diversification and long-term potential. Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is the one to watch. Don’t miss your chance to join the presale and secure your stake in what could be the next big meme coin success story.

38101587,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376147,1735139707,"Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2024 From Crypto Big Names, Hit or Miss?","As 2024 comes to an end, so does the timeline for several price predictions for bitcoin (BTC) from big names and companies in the crypto industry. While new reports are emerging with price forecasts and expectations for 2025, examining how well previous predictions performed is essential. Several experts and market analysts expected BTC to rally well above $100,000 by the end of the year, while others underestimated the potential effect of the ongoing bull season and predicted that the leading cryptocurrency would remain below $100,000. Regardless, BTC hit a new high of $108,200 about a week ago and was trading at $98,000 by press time. Experts’ BTC Predictions for 2024 Some crypto executives were off the mark with their predictions, while others narrowly missed the target. In October 2023, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of the crypto exchange and derivatives trading platform BitMEX and founder of the family office Maelstrom Fund, forecasted that BTC would end 2024 at around $70,000 based on several economic factors. He also stated that BTC would be worth between $750,000 and $1 million by 2026 as financial assets experience an unprecedented boom. Hayes’ prediction fell short as BTC has traded above $100,000 over the past few weeks. It remains to be seen if the 2026 forecast will come true, although that would be unlikely because the bear season is expected to kick off that year. Hit or Miss? Several industry experts changed their predictions as they monitored Bitcoin market dynamics in this bull season. One such analyst is Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-seller Rich Dad, Poor Dad. He initially predicted that BTC would be worth $300,000 by the end of 2024 but eventually changed his prediction to $105,000 by August 2025. Fortunately, his prediction fell a bit closer to bitcoin’s current price. Another financial executive is venture capital investor Tim Draper, who predicted that BTC would be worth $250,000 by year-end in April but retracted and changed his prediction to $120,000. BTC has yet to rally past $110,000. Furthermore, Mike Novogratz, the CEO of the crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital, predicted in 2021 that BTC would surge to $500,000 in 2024. However, in March 2024, the prominent Bitcoin advocate adjusted his year-end forecast to $100,000. Meanwhile, the crypto industry is looking forward to heavier predictions for bitcoin’s future price. Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of the asset manager Ark Invest, says BTC will be worth $500,000 by 2026 and $1 million by 2030. On the other hand, Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of the business intelligence firm and largest corporate BTC holder, MicroStrategy, sees BTC at $13 million by 2045.

The company’s stock climbed up to 402% on the year, pushing the company’s market cap to $83 billion. This continued the trend of MicroStrategy buying more Bitcoin ( BTC ) in 2024. According to reports from Dec. 23, the firm currently possesses close to 444,262 BTC, worth in excess of $45 billion at present-day prices. BTC’s phenomenal 120% price rally in 2024 — spurred on by market boosters such as a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, April’s BTC halving, and geopolitical endorsements of the asset class — played an important role in the firm’s holdings.

Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed this development in a statement today. Siluanov noted that legislative changes this year have enabled the use of cryptocurrencies for foreign payments.The move comes as Russia faces increasing difficulties in conducting trade with major partners like China due to heightened caution from banks. These institutions are wary of engaging in transactions with Russia, fearing potential repercussions from Western regulatory bodies.Legislative Changes Open Path for Crypto UsageThis year, Russia passed laws allowing the use of cryptocurrencies in international trade. In August, the country legitimized the mining of crypto assets, including Bitcoin. Russia has become one of the world’s leading Bitcoin mining nations, giving it a strong foundation for this new phase of financial operations.Siluanov emphasized that the nation has already integrated Bitcoin, along with other crypto assets, into some foreign trade transactions under an experimental regime. ""It is possible to use BTC, which we had mined here in Russia,"" he explained during a broadcast today.Furthermore, Siluanov expressed confidence that using cryptocurrencies in international trade will continue to expand. ""We think they should be further expanded and developed. I am confident this will take place next year,"" he stated.Earlier, President Vladimir Putin criticized the U.S. government for weakening the U.S. dollar's status as the global reserve currency by using it for political leverage. He argued that this has pushed numerous nations to explore alternative assets. He specifically highlighted Bitcoin as an example, noting that it remains beyond the control of any government. Latest Regulation on Bitcoin Mining in RussiaIn a related development, Russia has outlawed Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining in key regions, effective January 1, 2025, until March 15, 2031. Affected areas include Dagestan, Chechnya, and parts of Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson. The move aims to address electricity imbalances caused by subsidized energy costs in these regions. While crypto mining remains legal in Russia, miners must report earnings to the Federal Tax Service, with limits on energy use.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/25/russia-finance-minister-confirms-use-of-bitcoin-for-international-trade/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=russia-finance-minister-confirms-use-of-bitcoin-for-international-trade,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
38101359,https://finbold.com/?p=222964,1735139197,January’s crypto hotlist: Top 3 picks,"The cryptocurrency market is set to start 2025 with remarkable momentum, riding on a wave of optimism that shaped much of 2024. The approval of spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) was a key catalyst, drawing massive capital inflows and capturing the attention of institutional investors across the globe. This surge in confidence, bolstered by blockchain’s growing integration into traditional finance (TradFi) and regulatory clarity under the pro-crypto Trump administration, propelled Bitcoin to a historic milestone— crossing the $100,000 mark . While Bitcoin continues to dominate the spotlight, the broader market is gaining momentum. Solana ( SOL ), XRP , and Sui ( SUI ) stand out as January’s top picks, each uniquely positioned to capitalize on the evolving crypto landscape. Solana (SOL) Solana’s rapid adoption in global markets has secured its place as a top cryptocurrency to watch this year. Brazil’s approval of a spot Solana ETF and the active trading of eight Solana-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) in Europe highlight its institutional appeal. The momentum is expected to expand further into the U.S. market, with several leading investment firms already filing for spot Solana ETFs with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Solana’s robust developer ecosystem is another factor bolstering its appeal. For the first time since 2016, Solana outpaced Ethereum in new developer growth, with an 83% year-on-year increase in 2024, according to Electric Capital. In total, 7,625 new developers joined Solana’s ecosystem, compared to 6,456 for Ethereum. This surge in developer activity has fueled an expanding ecosystem of projects on the Solana network. In fact, Solana briefly surpassed Ethereum in daily network activity on multiple occasions in 2024, including memecoin activity in March and daily fee generation in October. Solana seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold With institutional interest ramping up and a robust developer community driving innovation, Solana is positioned to make significant strides next year. XRP XRP is surging on the back of several key developments that have bolstered confidence in its ecosystem. In December 2024, Ripple’s RLUSD—a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar—received final regulatory approval. Adding to the optimism, the re-election of Donald Trump has injected new energy into the cryptocurrency market, with XRP emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries. At the center of this confidence is Trump’s nomination of pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as the incoming SEC Chair, a move widely expected to deliver long-awaited regulatory clarity for Ripple Labs, whose legal battle with the SEC has loomed over XRP since 2020. The timing of the SEC’s appeal, scheduled for January 15—just days before Trump’s inauguration—has heightened expectations. With Atkins set to take over, many believe XRP could be freed from its regulatory overhang. This sentiment has already propelled XRP’s price from $0.50 in November to $2.50, driven by optimism surrounding the lawsuit’s outcome, its relisting on major exchanges like Robinhood , and bullish market sentiment following Trump’s election victory. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Looking ahead, XRP’s prospects continue to strengthen. The potential approval of a spot ETF, supported by filings from asset managers like WisdomTree and Bitwise, could attract significant institutional investment in 2025. Combined with its historical resilience, strong partnerships, and a revitalized regulatory environment, XRP is well-positioned for significant growth, making it a top pick for the year ahead. Sui (SUI) Sui has established itself as one of the fastest-growing Layer 1 blockchain networks, outpacing even Bitcoin in 2024. Since its launch in May 2023, Sui has achieved remarkable growth, reaching a market cap of $13 billion in just 18 months. This performance has earned it comparisons to Ethereum as “the next Ethereum” and a potential “Solana killer.” Sui’s rapid adoption is evident in its underlying metrics, particularly its total value locked (TVL), which surged to an all-time high of $1.84 billion in December 2024—a clear indication of its traction in DeFi. ‘ Sui has maintained consistent TVL above $1 billion since November, reflecting robust capital inflows and sustained user engagement. Daily decentralized exchange ( DEX ) activity also hit a record $466 million in December, pushing cumulative DEX volume beyond $35 billion. One major catalyst for Sui in 2025 is the launch of the SuiPlay0X1 , a Web3 handheld gaming device that could potentially offer a pathway to mainstream adoption, cementing Sui’s position as a leader in gaming and attracting more users to its ecosystem. Sui’s growth trajectory is also fueled by strategic partnerships. In November 2024, it collaborated with $1.7 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton to explore innovative use cases. It also partnered with Babylon Labs, Lombard, and Cubist to integrate Bitcoin liquidity, unlocking programmable Bitcoin capabilities within its ecosystem. SUI seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Adding to its appeal, Sui has expanded its functionality through key wallet integrations. Recent integrations, including Phantom Wallet and Backpack, have further enhanced Sui’s accessibility and user appeal. As its fundamentals strengthen and market utility expands, Sui is poised to capitalize on its momentum in 2025, setting the stage for continued growth and solidifying its reputation as one of the most promising assets to watch. Despite the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, the outlook for Solana, XRP, and Sui remains highly optimistic as we enter 2025. Investors seeking opportunities in the digital asset space should consider these projects while remaining mindful of the risks involved in this dynamic market.

""Wait for January! Ethereum (ETH) May Start Altcoin Rally!""","While Ethereum is preparing to close 2024 with a lower performance compared to Bitcoin, it is preparing for its great days again in 2025. At this point, successful analyst Michael van de Poppe said that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in January and experience a boom in price. Poppe stated that the ETH/BTC parity, which fell to historical lows during the year, could exceed the 0.04 level, and argued that this situation could initiate an Ethereum altcoin rally. Poppe predicted that interest in Ethereum would increase in January with the start of the new year, saying that ETH would rise and Bitcoin would remain weaker against ETH. “I wouldn't be surprised if ETH/BTC exceeds 0.04 in January. There may be inflows in Ethereum and outflows in Bitcoin. Bitcoin's progress through the consolidation phase could initiate an altcoin rally in the Ethereum ecosystem.” Other market analysts, like Poppe, have also noted that spot Ethereum ETFs could outperform Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. At this point, ETF Store president Nate Geraci said in a post, “Net inflows into ETH ETFs are currently the same amount as gold ETFs, but I expect inflows to accelerate.” The ETH/BTC ratio last reached 0.04 on December 8, 2024. When it reached this level, Ethereum was traded at $ 4,018, rising above the critical $ 4,000 psychological level. *This is not investment advice.

38101938,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53125,1735138815,Earn from Swaps & Referrals with Plus Wallet – Bitget Integrates HyperEVM & Chivo’s Future Wobbles,"With the number of crypto users growing at an impressive annual rate of 99%, the demand for advanced digital crypto wallets is escalating. At the forefront is Plus Wallet , which offers innovative features that facilitate passive income generation for its users. Its “Swap to Earn” system rewards traders for each currency exchange, and the “Refer to Earn” scheme compensates them for trades conducted by referred users. Moreover, Bitget Wallet has captured attention by integrating the HyperEVM testnet, which simplifies network customization and enhances the user experience. Conversely, El Salvador’s Bitcoin wallet, Chivo, may soon be discontinued or sold following new fiscal strategies prompted by a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Bitget Wallet Enhances User Experience with HyperEVM Integration Bitget Wallet remains a notable player in the Web3 domain, providing an all-encompassing solution for users. It has recently integrated the HyperEVM testnet, revolutionizing access to high-quality decentralized applications (dApps), various projects, and DeFi services. This integration facilitates lending, staking, and commission-free trading, all supported by the $HYPE token. Additionally, the introduction of a Hyperliquid faucet for test tokens improves accessibility and engagement with the blockchain ecosystem, solidifying Bitget Wallet’s position as a leader in user experience innovation within the Web3 space. Uncertain Future for El Salvador’s Chivo Wallet Recent developments have put El Salvador’s digital Bitcoin wallet, Chivo, under the spotlight as the government contemplates its discontinuation or sale. This move aligns with financial adjustments linked to a recent IMF loan. Despite these changes, Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s Bitcoin office, confirmed the nation’s continued investment in Bitcoin, highlighting a sustained commitment to leveraging cryptocurrency for financial innovation. Plus Wallet’s Dual Rewards Mechanism Ensures Steady Passive Income Plus Wallet differentiates itself with innovative reward programs that facilitate continuous passive income through two primary methods. The “Swap to Earn” program is the first, providing USDT rewards for each transaction users complete, aligning well with transactional frequency. The “Refer to Earn” program complements this by allowing users to share a unique referral code or link, thereby amplifying their earnings potential. Each swap completed by a referred participant generates a commission in USDT for the referrer, with the potential for earnings scaling with the number of referrals made. The rapid processing of referral payouts, typically within 24-48 hours, underscores the system’s efficiency and reliability. Although Plus Wallet implements a nominal 0.5% commission on transactions, the value derived from its comprehensive reward structure significantly exceeds this cost. The popularity of Plus Wallet is rising as it enables users to earn extensively through both trading and referrals, without any restrictions on the number of transactions or the amount of income generated. In a forward-looking perspective, Plus Wallet is setting a precedent in the digital crypto wallet industry by merging effective crypto management with substantial reward opportunities. Best Crypto Wallets The dynamic landscape of digital crypto wallets is continuously evolving, providing users with innovative features. Recent developments highlight Bitget Wallet’s strategic adoption of HyperEVM to facilitate easier access to dApps and DeFi services. Meanwhile, the potential discontinuation or sale of El Salvador’s Chivo wallet reflects shifts in the country’s approach to cryptocurrency adoption. Among these updates, Plus Wallet has emerged as a leader by offering unparalleled opportunities for earning through its Swap to Earn and Refer to Earn programs, positioning itself as a top choice for users aiming to optimize their trading activities for additional income. As the market expands, Plus Wallet is setting new benchmarks in user engagement and reward mechanisms.

38103333,https://invezz.com/?p=2404572,1735138800,"Stop chasing Ripple (XRP), here are 3 coins positioning for the next breakout run","The ongoing bull cycle has seen XRP take center stage, rising above competitors like Solana and Binance coin to become the fourth-highest-ranked crypto. The 350% surge has reignited interest in the once SEC-doomed coin, with the price reaching a six-year high of $2.74 before consolidating around $2.40. Despite this impressive run, experts believe the bigger rally is in XRP alternatives. Cardano, Rexas Finance , and Sei are emerging as leading challengers. Could any of these coins outperform XRP in the next few months? Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance is a blockchain based real world asset (RWA) tokenization ecosystem for real estate, commodities, and art. Its capacity to fractionalize illiquid assets into tradable tokens creates a trillion-dollar market for investors, delivering unprecedented liquidity and accessibility. Rexas Finance is currently in Stage 10 of its presale, having raised an incredible $31 million and sold 364 million tokens. Each RXS is priced at $0.15, and Stage 10 is already 95% complete. As demand increases, the price will rise to $0.175 in the following stage. After the presale, RXS will be available on at least three tier-1 cryptocurrency exchanges for $0.20. This structured presale pricing ensures that early investors will see significant returns after the launch.The Rexas Finance ecosystem includes a no-code token creator, AI-driven NFT generation, and a multi-chain yield optimizer for DeFi investors. The Certik assessment, a vital security benchmark, confirms that Rexas Finance adheres to the highest industry requirements. This increases trust and reduces the risks associated with smart contract weaknesses. Rexas Finance’s legitimacy has been strengthened by its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which increase its exposure to a global investor base. The platform’s ongoing $1 million giveaway has boosted engagement. With 20 winners set to receive $50,000 in RXS apiece, this offer draws new users while reinforcing the token’s investor-driven momentum. Analysts believe that once Rexas Finance debuts, its price will replicate surges seen in the early days of projects like Solana and Shiba Inu. Given its vast market potential and cutting-edge ecosystem, RXS could be the breakout altcoin investors have been waiting for. Cardano (ADA) With its price skyrocketing above the $1 mark for the first time in three years, Cardano has been a terrific actor this cycle. However, recent whale activity has raised concerns. According to cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez, Cardano whales profited by selling big holdings when ADA traded between $1.15 and $1.33. When the price fell to $0.91, these whales instantly purchased 160 million ADA tokens, indicating fresh trust in the network. Despite the short-term volatility, Cardano’s long-term prospects remain positive. The network’s Daedalus v7.0.0 upgrade is increasing positive sentiment, streamlining governance involvement, and making voting more accessible. ADA’s fundamentals are strengthening with hints of a possible collaboration between Cardano and Ripple. Analysts estimate Cardano’s price to settle around $1.20 before rising to $3 and beyond as investor confidence recovers. Sei (SEI) Sei Network is gaining notice for its record-breaking speed and adoption performance. Sei’s transaction finality ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 seconds, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the business. This speed advantage makes it perfect for DeFi applications and high-frequency trading, surpassing Ethereum’s 13-20 minutes and Solana’s 1-2 seconds. Recent on-chain data shows that Sei’s monthly active addresses have topped 2.5 million, indicating increased user adoption and developer interest. The platform’s rich ecosystem, which supports dApps and DeFi protocols, has contributed to increased activity. SEI’s price has recently corrected to the $0.56-$0.58 support zone, a crucial region noted by analysts. Technical indicators point to a bullish ABCD formation, implying a short-term comeback to $0.70-$0.73. If this support holds, SEI could experience an upsurge fueled by its technological advantage and increased user activity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qR31NjsdEQ While XRP’s stalemate annoys investors, Cardano, Rexas Finance , and Sei are emerging as front-runners for the next big run. Strong fundamentals, whale accumulation, and record-breaking adoption suggest these initiatives have enormous upside potential. Rexas Finance stands out because of its extensive market reach, presale performance, and investor-friendly features.

38101937,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53132,1735138418,Top Exchange to XRP Holders: What Are Your XRP Price Targets for 2025?,"Uphold, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, recently ignited a lively debate with a post on X regarding XRP’s potential value in 2025. The exchange highlighted current analyst predictions ranging from $3 to $7 and called on the community members to share their predictions for the digital asset. Some investors view these estimates as conservative, citing the XRP’s increasing adoption and potential regulatory clarity as drivers for a much higher valuation. Others, however, argue that price forecasts in the volatile cryptocurrency market are inherently unpredictable and should be approached with caution. $3–$7 for $XRP in 2025? That’s laughable. $100+ isn’t just possible—it’s inevitable. And after $100, things get really interesting. With regulatory clarity secured and $RLUSD driving global liquidity, ODL adoption will hit unstoppable momentum. Institutions, CBDCs, and massive… — ꪑỉᨶꫝꪖꫀꪶ ꪖꪹꪶỉ᭢ (@mrcauliman) December 23, 2024 XRP Army Predictions One user commented that a target of “$3–$7 for XRP in 2025” is laughable, asserting that “$100+ isn’t just possible—it’s inevitable.” He attributed this confidence to the digital asset’s regulatory clarity and broader adoption of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), Ripple’s payment solution powered by XRP. The user further emphasized that institutional use cases, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and increased transaction volumes could create a feedback loop of demand for XRP, pushing its price up. Increased demand is one of many reasons why the community is also excited about RLUSD’s launch and its benefits for XRP. In contrast, other responses reflected a more cautious stance. One user expressed skepticism, stating, “These things are super unpredictable,” adding that we can only hope the asset surpasses its all-time high. More Bullish Expectations for XRP Among the optimistic projections, some users provided detailed reasoning behind their price targets. For instance, one participant highlighted Bitstamp’s plans to build a derivatives exchange as a bullish development. Bitstamp recently partnered with Robinhood to achieve this goal, and the commenter set an initial price target of $10. He also emphasized a long-term outlook, citing expectations for blockchain growth and potential staking opportunities for XRP holders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On the institutional front, several developments could influence XRP’s trajectory. Regulatory clarity is widely regarded as a critical factor, particularly in the U.S., where Ripple has been engaged in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, many experts believe the incoming administration led by Donald Trump will end this lawsuit , improving XRP’s legal clarity and opening more doors for innovation in the crypto space. Additionally, the growing adoption of ODL could bolster XRP’s utility and value proposition. ODL facilitates cross-border payments by leveraging XRP as a bridge currency, reducing transaction costs and settlement times. The integration of XRP into CBDC initiatives and increased use of the XRPL for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications could also further strengthen demand and fuel a price increase.

38101115,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633152,1735138374,Russia is using Bitcoin for international payments,"Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has announced that Russian companies have started using Bitcoin and other cryptos for international trade. “Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further,” he told Russia 24 TV . He also made it clear that this is just the beginning, calling crypto payments “the future of international trade.” From Bitcoin bans to full-blown adoption Russia’s crypto history has been wild. In 2017, the government looked at blockchain tech like a curious kid with a new toy, but it quickly slammed the brakes, banning cryptos for payments. The official excuse? Concerns about financial stability and preventing shady activities. Fast forward to 2020, and the rules softened, but not by much. Crypto was legalized, but their use for transactions remained off the table. Now, 2024 has flipped the script. Russia’s lawmakers gave mining the green light, effective November 1, and legalized the use of crypto for cross-border payments. The timing isn’t random. With sanctions making traditional trade channels nearly impossible, crypto has become the lifeline. Russia isn’t playing small ball here. In 2023 alone, the country mined 54,000 Bitcoins, pulling in 50 billion rubles (around $550 million) in tax revenue. With new laws in place, the potential for growth is massive. President Vladimir Putin threw his weight behind them, criticizing the U.S. for using the dollar as a political weapon. “The U.S. undermines the dollar’s role as a global reserve currency,” he said earlier this month, calling Bitcoin a viable alternative. And for good measure, he added, “No one in the world can regulate Bitcoin.” The country is now the second-largest Bitcoin mining hub in the world, right behind the United States. Why? Cheap electricity and freezing weather. Perfect conditions for running mining rigs 24/7. But here’s the catch: all that mining comes with a huge electricity bill. To keep things under control, the government has slapped mining bans on ten regions, including Dagestan and Chechnya. Starting January 1, these bans will last six years. And it doesn’t stop there. Seasonal restrictions are set for energy-heavy areas like Irkutsk during winter. Eastern Europe is already a hotbed for crypto activity, and Russia is leading the charge. Between July 2023 and June 2024, the region handled $499 billion in on-chain crypto value, and Russia ranked seventh globally for crypto adoption. These platforms allow users to sidestep traditional banks, which have become increasingly isolated due to sanctions.

The bulls have not lost hope Bitcoin stood right up and touched $98K today. Israel is stepping into the crypto spotlight with the launch of six Bitcoin mutual funds on December 31. These funds, approved by the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) last week, aim to provide regulated access to Bitcoin investments, reflecting the nation’s growing interest in the digital asset market. Is it a Santa rally effect? let’s understand the market scene in Israel. Key Details About the Funds The timing seems to be right as Bitcoin will see a massive jump despite some short-term losses in between next year. The mutual funds, offered by prominent firms like Migdal Capital Markets, More, Ayalon, Phoenix Investment, Meitav, and IBI, will initially trade once a day, with management fees ranging from 0.25% to 1.5%. Notably, one fund will be actively managed, aiming to outperform Bitcoin’s market performance. Global Context and Impact This move comes nearly a year after the U.S. SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have since attracted $35.6 billion in investments. The ISA’s decision aligns with global trends, such as South Korea’s surging trading volumes and Turkey’s strict anti-money laundering steps, signaling a maturing crypto market. With Bitcoin prices doubling over the past year and institutional demand surging, Israel’s entry into the Bitcoin fund market highlights the growing acceptance of crypto as a mainstream investment. This development further cements the global momentum toward regulated and accessible digital asset products. Bitcoin Current Market Snapshot Bitcoin is currently testing resistance near $101,000, with a potential pullback to $69,000 as key support. Historical trends show post-Christmas rallies aligning with halving cycles, often driving significant price surges. Long-term targets from technical patterns suggest Bitcoin could reach $150,000 and even $250,000 if the bullish structure holds. However, short-term movements depend on breaking resistance and defending critical support levels. Bitcoin’s pullback shows that the market is maturing no matter what comes on the way. Israel is taking this slowdown as a strategy to tap the crypto adoption in the region with a safe plan of mutual funds instead of ETFs. However, to raise their crypto plans in the future they have to approve ETFs as it is the only way to bring fresh capital into the system.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/israel-joins-the-bitcoin-boom-with-six-mutual-funds-whats-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

For context, ADA is one of the biggest victims of the current market turbulence. After recovering above $1 to claim $1.18 on Dec. 12, Cardano faced another phase of intense selling pressure, dropping to a one-month floor of $0.7618 on Dec. 20 before rebounding slightly.Cardano Addresses in Profit Amid Price DropDespite the mild rebound, Cardano remains below the $1 psychologically relevant threshold at press time, down 15.39% in December. However, this turbulent phase has not impacted investor profitability as many would expect.Notably, data from blockchain analytics resource IntoTheBlock confirms that up to 2.71 million Cardano addresses are still witnessing profits on their ADA holdings. This figure represents an impressive 61.63% of the total wallets holding Cardano. Cardano GIOM IntoTheBlock Cardano GIOM | IntoTheBlock In contrast, about 1.51 million addresses, marking 34.28% of total wallets, bought Cardano above the current price, and are seeing losses as a result of the price collapse. Meanwhile, wallets at a breakeven currently amount to 179,970.Interestingly, Cardano address profitability was at a much better position earlier this month, in the heat of the latest market uptrend. With ADA climbing to a three-year peak of $1.23 on Dec. 3, addresses in the money rose to a whopping 3.27 million, representing 74.35% of the total.With Cardano now 26% down from the recent peak, profitability ratio has dropped below the 70% mark. This metric could improve significantly once the current consolidation phase passes, as ADA looks to break back above the $1 price region .Cardano Eyes Break Above $1The path to this recovery would involve a breach of the Dec. 21 resistance at $0.9972. Once the bulls break above this level, Cardano could face another roadblock at the dynamic 20-day moving average (MA) ceiling currently at $1.0321. Conquering this area would allow ADA cement its position above $1 and flip it back to support.IntoTheBlock identifies a robust supply wall between $0.9696 and $1.09. Within this price range, over 243,900 addresses purchased 3.77 billion ADA tokens. This sell wall could bolster the resistance for Cardano when prices reach this range. ADA Sell Wall IntoTheBlock ADA Sell Wall | IntoTheBlock Analysts such as Javon Marks believe in ADA's potential to breach these resistance levels. In an analysis this morning, Marks suggested that Cardano's next direction could be bullish, evident from its recent breakout. The market watcher expects another 180% surge, which could take prices to $2.77.https://twitter.com/JavonTM1/status/1871703135628173618At press time, Cardano changes hands for $0.9135, down 2.26% today after two days of bullish performance.

XRP Is Up More Than 4% On Christmas Day After a period of struggle in cryptocurrencies across the board, Christmas has brought back some bullish winds as Bitcoin and company have made some recovery. XRP has been no exception, with its price going up over 4% in the last 24 hours to reclaim $2.31. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Still Close To Extreme Greed: More Cooldown Needed For Bottom? Below is a chart that shows how the digital asset has performed during the last few days. As with any surge in the coin’s value, profit-taking can become a threat as investor gains balloon up. It appears one whale may have fallen prey to such a temptation. A Large Transfer Has Just Been Spotted On The Network According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive transaction has occurred on the XRP blockchain during the past day. The transfer in question involved the movement of 30,171,667 tokens worth more than $69.2 million at the time the sender executed the move. This is quite a large transaction, so it’s likely that a whale entity was responsible for it. Whales are investors who carry massive holdings in their wallets. As the influence of any entity on the market goes up, the more coins that they own, whales are considered a key part of the ecosystem. Because of this reason, their moves can be worth keeping an eye on. They may not always directly influence the price, but they can still inform us about the sentiment among these giants. Problem is, the anonymous nature of the blockchain means that a lot of the time, it’s not possible to discern what an investor’s intent was behind a move. Luckily, in the case of this XRP whale transaction, one end of the move contains a wallet that can be identified as being tied to a centralized platform. Here are the address details related to the transfer: As is visible above, the receiving address for this transaction was a wallet attached to the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The sending address was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was likely the whale’s personal, self-custodial wallet. Transactions of this kind, where coins flow from self-custody to a centralized exchange, are known as exchange inflows. Generally, one of the main reasons why investors deposit to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, so exchange inflows can have bearish implications for the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Giving Potential Buy Signal, Quant Says it’s uncertain, though, whether taking profits from the latest surge was indeed the goal in mind when the whale made the transaction.

38100713,https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-new-age-in-2025,1735137000,Crypto could see the ‘dawning of a new age’ in 2025,"“Next year is gonna really show everyday people what crypto is for,” Hashdex co-founder Bruno Caratori confidently told me last week. And, no, he didn’t just mean bitcoin. He added that this next year could be the “dawning of the age … of a crypto beyond bitcoin.” A lot of Caratori’s thinking comes from the fact that stablecoins have seen such a breakthrough to mainstream attention, as has a lot of the real-world asset offerings (if you include stablecoins in that mix, though I’m not so sure David would). RWA onchain totals out at nearly $14 billion, with stablecoin value topping $200 billion Here’s a look at total RWA value with stablecoins Caratori noted that stablecoins get an upper hand because they’re “easy enough” to understand. If you were to ask Caratori for some predictions — and, dear reader, you best bet I did — he’d tell you that he thinks we could see “everyday transactions” in the US using stablecoins starting next year. Part of this is due to the potential for Circle to enter the public markets in 2025. If you remember, we recently talked about what a Circle IPO could look like . If we see them enter the public stage, it’ll be the “most significant IPO in crypto since Coinbase.” “This is a player that’s going to get a lot of notoriety. First of all, it’s going to get resources to invest in the ecosystem. And even what they’ve been doing so far, initiatives such as integrating into Stripe may be the major gateway for online commerce. [With] initiatives like these, they’ll just be better resourced with not just money, but the credibility that comes with establishing the relationships,” he explained. If we see adoption across crypto, then Caratori thinks we could see the end of the boom-bust cycle. Controversial, I know. “There’s this widespread consensus in crypto that it behaves in this four-year cycle, and that it’s been like this forever, and it’s going to continue to be like this. And that 2025 will be the year of exuberance, and that will inevitably be followed by a big 70-80% drawdown. I see how this was true before [but] I think that real adoption by governments, by big players — such as the BlackRocks of the world — [stabilize crypto].” “So I don’t expect this to be a big exuberance and then a bust cycle after and again. The first applications are really going to become real for the public,” Caratori said. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

FLOKI announced in its official statement that they will launch the Floki ETP product in Europe. Stating that the new Floki ETP could be launched in the first quarter of 2025, the developers propose to allocate part of the FLOKI required for the ETP from the treasury wallet, which contains 16 billion tokens. If the proposal is approved, FLOKI tokens will provide liquidity to the ETP and can be withdrawn if there is sufficient third-party liquidity in the ETP. The developers added that they have partnered with an undisclosed asset manager to develop an exchange-traded product (ETP) tracking the FLOKI token. Lead developer B said in a statement: “We have been actively working with a reputable Asset Manager and an ETP Publisher to launch a Floki ETP for some time now. After months of meticulous review and hard work, the Floki ETP is set to launch in early Q1 2025. Floki ETP will be traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Switzerland and the third largest in Europe. Once underway, the Floki ETP will allow institutional investors, regulated entities and retail investors to gain regulated exposure to FLOKI.” B added that the team cannot disclose further details about the ETP due to confidentiality agreements, such as opening prices, fund structure, and institutional partners.

38101673,https://invezz.com/?p=2404760,1735136172,"MOVE, BGB, JASMY rally as Bitcoin goes past $98k again","Bitcoin displayed stability as the world celebrated Christmas, with its recovery from around $93,000 to over $98,000 when writing, reigniting hopes for a Santa rally. The broader crypto market continued recovering from weekly lows and settled above $3.6 trillion, up 2.68% in the past 24 hours. While the Altcoin Season Index, which indicates the onset of an alt market rally, remained below 50, green candles were seen across several major altcoins. Gains were led by MOVE, BGB, and JASMY in response to Bitcoin’s recovery towards $100,000, which has become the next key resistance level for the leading crypto. The idea of a Santa rally , before and after Christmas when the crypto market tends to rally, was also driving the current momentum for Bitcoin and altcoins. Will Bitcoin go up? According to the market commentary channel Exitpump, BTC’s large spot buyers saw an uptick on December 24. Further, the analytics platform Bitcoindata21 pointed to a rebound in the Coinbase premium, which reflects the price difference between BTC on Coinbase and other global exchanges, adding weight to the narrative that institutional demand was pushing prices higher. Bitcoin hit a daily high of $99,303.79, narrowly missing the psychological $100,000 mark while maintaining strong upward momentum as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stayed in the ‘Greed’ zone. Technicals on the one-day BTC/USDT chart were strong, with a chart shared by pseudonymous analyst Captain Faibik showing the flagship crypto trading within an ascending channel. The chart suggests Bitcoin could be eyeing a potential breakout toward the $110,000 level if it maintains its current upward trajectory. Another bullish perspective for Bitcoin was offered by fellow analyst Sensei, who pointed to historical cycle patterns. Drawing parallels from previous market cycles, Sensei highlighted recurring trends where Bitcoin undergoes a period of consolidation, followed by a breakout and an extended parabolic rally. If this historical pattern holds, the chart suggests Bitcoin could follow a parabolic curve, potentially pushing prices towards a new all-time high. On the contrary, analyst Rekt Capital advised against being too optimistic. He highlighted that while Bitcoin shows signs of a relief rally and attempts to reclaim previous support levels, the price has faced repeated rejections near these zones. Unless Bitcoin can successfully reclaim and hold key support zones, particularly around $97,894–$96,935, the chances of further downside remain a strong possibility, according to the analyst. However, he noted that a successful reclaim of these lost supports, coupled with a sustained hold above the ascending trendline, would shift the outlook bullish. Upon writing, BTC was trading slightly above the $98,000 mark, but it is yet to be seen if bulls manage to establish support by the end of the day. Meanwhile, altcoins followed Bitcoin’s lead, with the top movers raking in noticeable gains on the day. Altcoin rally to sustain? Over the past 24 hours, MOVE rallied 26% to hit a 7-day high of $1.13 on December 25. The altcoin continued rallying for the third straight day and held a market capitalisation of $2.35 billion at press time. Source: CoinMarketCap Movement (MOVE) is the native token of the Layer 2 network built on Ethereum to boost scalability and introduce advanced features for users, and its rally was driven partly by strong technicals, which drew in buyers. According to analysts on X, MOVE had recently confirmed a Cup and Handle pattern, which is a bullish sign. Further, the token also saw an uptick in demand from South Korean traders following its listing on Upbit and Bithumb earlier this month. Bitget Token Bitget Token (BGB) surged 18% in the past 24 hours to hit weekly highs of $5.76 earlier today. At the time of writing, its daily trading volume was up 61%, and it boasted a market cap of approximately $8.0 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap BGB’s recent performance was driven by several developments in the cryptocurrency exchange. First, the launch of LaunchX, a token distribution platform, drew strong investor interest. Second, the success of BGB Launchpool has also helped inflate prices for the altcoin. More recently, the exchange announced a collaboration with the Tron blockchain and a partnership with SunPump, a meme coin launcher on the network, adding to the bullish momentum. Jasmy Coin JASMY was up 15% as it enjoyed the Santa rally, which saw it hit an intraday and a weekly high of $0.0405 on Christmas day. Its total market capitalisation stood at over $1.9 billion at press time. Source: CoinMarketCap Jasmy, often referred to as Japan’s Bitcoin, surged on retail demand, which has been on the rise over the past week. The number of JASMY tokens on exchanges steadily decreased, dropping by 1.97% to 16.74 billion tokens on December 24. As of this writing, the value stands at just over 13 billion tokens, according to CryptoQuant data. The altcoin also witnessed increased whale activity, with one whale scoping up over 37.9 million tokens on December 24.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/donald-saves-crypto-donalcry-solana-memecoin-will-surge-18000-before-exchange-listing-while-pepe-and-shib-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, launched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, has revolutionized the blockchain world. It’s known for its smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps). With platforms like Arbitrum and Polygon enhancing transaction efficiency, Ethereum remains at the forefront of innovation. In 2022, it transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, aiming for greater scalability and energy efficiency. The upcoming sharding phase promises to reduce costs and improve performance. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that powers this ecosystem, playing a crucial role in transactions and rewarding those who support the network. Looking at market trends, Ethereum shows significant potential. Based on historical movements and Bitcoin’s halving cycles, some predict ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, estimates suggest a yearly low of $2,700.31. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum’s continuous development and commitment to decentralization make it stand out. In the current market cycle, with its evolving technology and ambitious roadmap, ETH presents an interesting opportunity for those watching the crypto space. PEPE (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency scene, launched as a deflationary memecoin on Ethereum. Inspired by the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s, it embraces the fun and viral nature of internet culture. PEPE aims to join the ranks of famous meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a straightforward approach, it appeals to those who appreciate simplicity in the crypto world. In the spring of 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap hitting a peak of $1.6 billion. Early holders saw incredible gains, and a strong community of supporters grew around it. This rise sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” where many meme-based coins saw dramatic ups and downs. PEPE’s roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a goal of a “meme takeover.” While it’s uncertain if PEPE will reach new heights in the current market cycle, its rapid ascent mirrors the trends of other successful meme coins, capturing the attention and hope of many in the crypto community. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful spin on Dogecoin, inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous “Ryoshi,” SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, granting it access to Ethereum’s vast ecosystem. Out of a quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to build credibility. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, removing them from circulation. These actions boosted SHIB’s standing in the crypto world. SHIB sets itself apart with its technological capabilities. Being on Ethereum allows it to support projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a governance system for holders. In today’s market, where utility matters, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem may attract investors. Though it began as a meme, its growth and Ethereum integration could make it more appealing than other meme coins. As trends favor functionality, SHIB’s prospects look promising. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is turning heads in the cryptocurrency landscape as a flexible and sustainable blockchain platform tailored for smart contracts. This innovative network empowers developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games with greater ease and efficiency. At its core is ADA, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, which stands as a formidable rival to Ethereum’s ETH. ADA enables users to store value, make payments, and engage in staking on the Cardano network, contributing to a more decentralized and secure ecosystem. What truly sets Cardano apart is its commitment to environmental sustainability. By utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, Cardano operates with significantly improved energy efficiency compared to the energy-intensive proof-of-work models used by some other cryptocurrencies. Its unique architecture divides the blockchain into two layers—the Cardano Settlement Layer for handling transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This design enhances its capability to process potentially up to a million transactions per second. Since the introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021, the platform has established a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. In a rapidly evolving crypto market, Cardano’s innovative technology and sustainable approach position it as a noteworthy player to watch. Conclusion ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and ADA are solid options, but XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a unique memecoin ecosystem, aiming for 20,000% growth as the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

38100191,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53090,1735135244,Dogecoin Faces Resistance at $0.333 While 1Fuel Gains Traction over PEPE,"Dogecoin , one of the most recognized tokens in the crypto market, currently faces resistance at $0.333, raising some concerns about its momentum. Meanwhile, 1Fuel , a rising monument in the DeFi industry, has begun to make waves over tokens like PEPE . 1FUEL is currently in presale where tokens can be purchased for as low as $0.012 per token. With world-class features and massive gain potential, 1Fuel offers impressive options for investors looking for the best cryptocurrencies to trade in 2025. DOGE upward trend despite price resistance Dogecoin, the poster child of meme cryptocurrencies, has shown resilience amid recent market fluctuations. After experiencing a significant 17% decline over the past week, DOGE has rebounded with a 1.83% increase in the past 24 hours, trading at approximately $0.333. This slight upward momentum suggests a potential stabilization, although the cryptocurrency remains below its 21-day and 50-day moving averages. Analysts observe that while Dogecoin is inherently volatile and susceptible to further dips, its strong community and widespread adoption continue to provide a foundation for potential recovery. As market conditions evolve, investors remain cautiously optimistic about DOGE’s prospects in the near term. The emerging crypto project, 1Fuel’s rising momentum 1Fuel is emerging as a fresh and attractive player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. Whales are turning their watch to the token as it gains momentum day by day. Unlike Dogecoin and PEPE , which rely mainly on speculative appeal, 1Fuel stands out with a focus on functionality and innovation. 1Fuel offers attractive use cases such as one-click cross-chain transactions, an inbuilt mixer for increased privacy, disposable wallets, and cold storage options. The network plans to launch virtual and physical debit cards linked to the 1Fuel cryptocurrency wallet , allowing users to transact directly with their digital coins in real life. Plus, its staking rewards program offers long-term investors the possibility of substantial annual returns, making it an appealing option for those who prioritize growth over speculation. Investors tracking PEPE eye 1Fuel’s presale PEPE has gained waves for its community-based rallies, reaching its all-time high of $0.0000293 on December 9. However, the price dropped dramatically afterward, raising concerns that the upward trend may be departing. In contrast, 1Fuel’s potent tokenomics and integration into the DeFi ecology make it a genuine contender among the best cryptocurrencies ahead of 2025. PEPE investors seeking the next breakout token for massive returns pour into 1Fuel’s fast-moving presale for a seat at the table of top gainers next year. At just $0.012/token, 1Fuel is the cheapest it’ll ever be which is why smart investors are adding it to their portfolios. Investing in 1Fuel? Market dynamics and investor insights The shift in market operations highlights the changing attitude of investors. As investors turn to assets with observable perks, meme tokens like DOGE and PEPE , which were once popular, are now coming under more scrutiny. This transition demonstrates why 1Fuel is causing a stir since its emphasis on long-term potential, security, and utility fits in well with these emerging targets. This strategy ensures its continued viability in the crypto industry while also boosting its appeal. Analysts predict a whooping 100x return in 2025 for those who add 1Fuel early on to their cryptocurrency wallet . Conclusion The distinction between highly speculative and utility-driven assets is becoming increasingly apparent as the crypto market evolves. For investors looking for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, 1Fuel makes a convincing case. Its emphasis on usability, security, and longevity distinguishes it from both Dogecoin and PEPE . As 1Fuel gets traction, it becomes evident that the future belongs to tokens that incorporate vision and value.

In July, Russia passed a major law legalizing cryptocurrency for international payments . It’s a big deal. The goal? To sidestep sanctions and keep goods moving with countries like China and Turkey. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov says this isn’t just a plan on paper—companies are already using Bitcoin to settle deals. And it’s not just Russia doing this. Iran has been using mined Bitcoin to dodge sanctions for years. Russia seems to be borrowing a page from their playbook, hoping digital currencies can provide some much-needed breathing room. Officials even predict crypto demand will skyrocket next year as more businesses get on board. But this isn’t just about Bitcoin. President Vladimir Putin has also backed the digital ruble, a blockchain-based version of the national currency. He called it “experimental” but said it’s a necessary step forward. At the same time, Putin stressed the need to regulate mining farms , which are booming but causing power shortages in some regions. Not Everything’s Fair Game Here’s the catch: while Russia is all-in on crypto for international trade, domestic use is still off-limits . You can’t buy a coffee with Bitcoin in Moscow, and the Central Bank wants to keep it that way. They’re worried about fraud and energy consumption spiraling out of control. Even so, the government’s creating a framework to regulate the industry. They’re considering a Bitcoin reserve to support foreign trade exclusively. It’s a careful balancing act—embracing crypto without letting it disrupt things at home. What to Expect This is just the beginning. By betting on cryptocurrencies, Russia’s trying to break free from a system it feels has been weaponized against it. Will it work? That’s the big question. For now, one thing’s clear: digital currencies are playing a bigger role in global trade. And for countries like Russia, they’re not just an experiment—they’re a lifeline.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/russia-turns-to-bitcoin-to-fight-sanctions/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

According to Reuters, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that Russia has started using Bitcoin in foreign trade. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that Russian companies started using Bitcoin and other digital currencies in international payments after the introduction of legal regulations against Western sanctions. Siluanov told Russia 24 television: “As part of the experimental phase, it is possible to use Bitcoins mined in Russia in foreign trade transactions. “Such transactions are already taking place. We believe they need to be expanded and developed further. I am confident that this expansion will happen next year.” Siluanov said the move was aimed at circumventing Western sanctions and increasing financial independence, adding that Russia would be trading more in digital currencies. Western sanctions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have made it difficult for Russia to trade with major partners such as China or Turkey, as local banks are extremely cautious in dealing with Russia to avoid scrutiny from Western regulators. *This is not investment advice.

38098826,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376139,1735133982,Do Kwon’s Appeal Dismissed: Montenegro’s Court Upholds Extradition Ruling (Report),"The Constitutional Court of Montenegro has dismissed an appeal filed by Do Kwon, the South Korean crypto mogul and co-founder of Terraform Labs, who is at the center of the catastrophic collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin and its token, Luna. Kwon’s appeal, which challenged his extradition ruling, was unanimously rejected by the court. Dwindling Legal Options for Kwon According to the report by local media outlet ‘Korea JoongAng Daily,’ the court’s decision upheld the earlier ruling favoring Kwon’s extradition, with the Justice Minister, Bojan Božović, set to make the final call on whether he will face trial in his home country of South Korea or be sent to the United States. Kwon’s appeal was rejected on grounds of legal inconsistencies. The court also dismissed his arguments of procedural unfairness and violations of his rights. Kwon has been under intense scrutiny since the May 2022 collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin and its sister token, Luna, which caused a devastating $40 billion market loss. Both the US and South Korea have requested his extradition, accusing him of financial crimes, including fraud and market manipulation. After fleeing South Korea, Kwon traveled through several countries, including Singapore, the UAE, and Serbia, before being arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 for attempting to travel with a forged passport. As such, the latest ruling by the court significantly narrows Kwon’s legal options for delaying extradition, and analysts predict that Montenegro may ultimately send him to the US, where he faces charges related to the Terra-Luna collapse. Kwon’s legal situation is further complicated by a massive civil penalty imposed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June 2024, Terraform Labs and Kwon agreed to a $4.5 billion settlement with the securities agency, including hefty fines for Kwon personally, as well as a ban on engaging in crypto transactions. Kwon’s Fate Hangs in Limbo Despite the ruling, Kwon’s legal team is expected to continue fighting against his extradition, particularly to the US, where the charges are more extensive. Meanwhile, South Korea has urged for a quicker resolution while expressing concerns over potential human rights violations due to delays in the extradition process. With the ruling, Kwon’s fate now lies in the hands of Montenegro’s Justice Minister, who will determine his next legal steps.

38098974,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633139,1735133788,MicroStrategy (MSTR) bears are in for a painful short squeeze next year,"MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is about to make short sellers wish they had stayed in cash. This software company turned Bitcoin whale looks posied to be a problem for the bears betting against it. With over 444,000 bitcoins in its arsenal right now, MicroStrategy owns more Bitcoin than any other corporation in the world. President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies are fueling a meteoric rise for the industry. He is expected to flip the script on regulation and set up a strategic national Bitcoin reserve. But what’s really about to light up is MicroStrategy, just as it joins the Nasdaq-100. This will force institutional investors to buy MSTR, adding nearly $11 million in retail capital to the pot. The result? A potential short squeeze that could send the stock price into orbit. MicroStrategy’s numbers: A high-stakes gamble with Bitcoin MicroStrategy has gone all in, staking its future on Bitcoin’s success. The company’s 2024 has been insane—its stock is up 440% over the past year and 123% in just three months. For context, that’s more than triple the performance of Bitcoin itself. In Q3, MicroStrategy reported $116.1 million in revenue, a 10.3% drop from the previous year. That’s not great, but let’s be real—nobody cares about the software business anymore. What matters is Bitcoin. By the end of October, the company’s stash had grown to 252,220 bitcoins, valued at $9.9 billion. This is the core of its strategy: buy Bitcoin, hold it, and wait for the price to explode. To fund this, MicroStrategy sold 8 million Class A shares for $1.1 billion and doubled its long-term debt to $4.3 billion. The company’s “21/21 Plan” is as ambitious as it sounds. MicroStrategy wants to raise $42 billion, split between equity and debt, to buy even more Bitcoin. If you think that’s excessive, you’re not wrong. But the market seems to love it. Gautam Chhugani from Bernstein raised his price target for MSTR to $600, calling the company’s Bitcoin strategy “unprecedented.” TD Cowen followed with a target of $525. Benchmark has the most bullish target at $650, nearly double the current price. Risks and rewards: The Bitcoin rollercoaster MicroStrategy’s bet on Bitcoin has paid off so far, but it’s not without risks. The company’s operating expenses soared by 300% in Q3 to $514.3 million, thanks to impairment losses on its digital assets. Its cash balance is just $46.3 million—a tiny cushion for a company this leveraged. And while the $3 billion convertible bond issuance at a 0% coupon provided interest-free capital, it’s a double-edged sword. If the stock price falls, MicroStrategy could be forced to raise more money to repay debt, creating a potential liquidity crisis. Yet, this hasn’t stopped CEO Michael Saylor from doubling down. MicroStrategy is banking on Bitcoin hitting $1 million by 2033. Analysts seem to think this is more than a pipe dream. Chhugani predicts MicroStrategy could own 4% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2033. TD Cowen estimates the company’s holdings will reach $108 billion by 2027. As of press time though, short interest in MicroStrategy is climbing. Bears are betting the company’s focus on Bitcoin will backfire, but they’re playing with fire. When institutional money starts pouring in after Christmas, those shorts will be forced to cover, driving the stock price even higher. Analysts are calling this a perfect setup for a short squeeze, and they’re probably right. MicroStrategy’s current valuation is steep—157.65 times forward sales, to be exact. That’s higher than Coinbase and Block, two giants in the crypto industry. But investors don’t seem to care.

The 21-day SMA, around $99,600, and the 50-day SMA, near $94,650, now define the asset’s immediate range. Alan questioned which level would break first, noting that Bitcoin had maintained support above the 21-day SMA since mid-October before briefly dipping below it this week. However, not all metrics were bullish.

Crypto investor Satoshi Stacker pointed out that Bitcoin markets would get temporary relief from selling pressure as U.S. traditional finance markets closed for the holiday. “US tradfi markets are closed today so $BTC gets a break from the recent selling,” he said.

It reported increased Bitcoin exposure among speculative short-term holders during the recent market dip, particularly driven by demand in South Korea. Contributor Joo Hyun Ryu noted that the “Kimchi Premium,” which measures the price gap between South Korean exchanges and others, reached a local high of 5.12, signaling robust local demand. “This sharp correction in the market, however, appears to be attracting new investors, as evidenced by a 3 percentage point increase in the share of short-term holders (STH) under three months within just one week,” Ryu explained. The rise in South Korean buying interest suggests a regional optimism about Bitcoin’s prospects, even as global markets navigate mixed signals. As reported, South Korea’s cryptocurrency investors crossed 15 million in November. According to figures submitted by the Bank of Korea, 15.59 million South Koreans held accounts on the nation’s top five cryptocurrency exchanges—Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and GOPAX—by the end of November. Deposits in crypto exchanges also doubled, rising from 4.7 trillion won (3.2 billion USD) in October to 8.8 trillion won (6.03 billion USD) in November, signaling heightened investor interest.

38098570,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376122,1735133458,RLUSD Adoption on the Rise: This Popular Crypto Exchange Embraces the Stablecoin,"TL;DR Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD gained support from another well-known cryptocurrency exchange. XRP rebounded to $2.27 after a correction, with analysts predicting a substantial rally in the short term. The Next Exchange to Jump on the Bandwagon After months of testing and preparation, Ripple’s stablecoin officially went live mid-December. This became possible after the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approved it. The product, called RLUSD, is pegged 1:1 to the American dollar and designed to play a crucial role in Ripple’s cross-border payment solutions. Upon launch, the stablecoin was embraced by multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, Moonpay, CoinMENA, and others. Most recently, the Peter Thiel-backed Bullish also joined the list. The company announced that users can deal with the following trading pairs: RLUSD/USDC, BTC/RLUSD, XRP/RLUSD, ETH/RLUSD, USD/RLUSD, EUR/RLUSD, and SOL/RLUSD. Earlier this month, Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz warned the community about a potential volatility surrounding the product. He said there might be initial fluctuations but eventually the price should settle around $1. The exec also alerted people not to FOMO into a stablecoin since it is “not an opportunity to get rich.” According to CoinGecko’s data, RLUSD started trading at approximately $1 upon launch, but in the following days, it hovered between $0.96 and $1.06. The valuation has stabilized since the beginning of the week, currently set at around $0.99. RLUSD Price, Source: CoinGecko XRP Price Outlook Numerous industry participants have maintained that RLUSD’s introduction could be among the factors fueling a price rally for Ripple’s native token. In fact, XRP saw a substantial pump in mid-December (when the product saw the light of day), with its price tapping $2.70. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko However, the crypto market correction witnessed at the end of last week suppressed the asset to under $2. In the last few days, the bulls managed to recover some of the lost ground, and XRP is currently worth around $2.27. Crypto X is full of analysts who believe it is time for a new rally. Crypto Bitlord, an X user with almost 400,000 followers, recently suggested that “the final pump for 2024 is loading.” For their part, CrediBULL Crypto claimed that “the XRP/BTC chart below looks absolutely fantastic” and “the most bullish-looking chart in the entire space.” One element indicating that Ripple’s native token could indeed experience a price jump in the near future is the whales’ activity. Ali Martinez claimed that such large investors have purchased millions of tokens in the past week. These actions decrease the available supply of XRP on the open market, potentially leading to a price increase if demand remains steady or grows. Significant whale purchases might also generate enthusiasm among smaller investors, encouraging them to buy in as well , which could amplify the upward momentum.

Token Ecosystem and Market Demand MATIC tokens enable: Network security through staking Transaction fee payments Governance voting Validator node operation Deciphering the Crypto Frontier: A Strategic Guide to Altcoin Acquisition The cryptocurrency ecosystem is a dynamic and multifaceted realm, teeming with innovative projects beyond the original cryptocurrency. This vibrant landscape of altcoins—digital assets beyond the first—presents both compelling opportunities and inherent risks for discerning investors. Timing is a critical factor in this volatile market, and identifying the optimal moment to acquire an altcoin demands a sophisticated understanding of market dynamics, project fundamentals, and strategic avenues like presales. This exploration delves into the art of timing your altcoin investments, offering insights to navigate this complex terrain. Beyond the Original: Exploring the Altcoin Galaxy Altcoins represent a diverse spectrum of digital assets, each striving to carve a unique niche in the crypto space. They encompass a wide array of functionalities, from facilitating decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and powering non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces to enabling decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and driving innovation in various sectors. This diversity fuels the dynamism of the altcoin market, presenting a wealth of potential investment opportunities. How and When To Invest in Altcoins: Key Considerations for Strategic Entry Entering the altcoin market necessitates meticulous research and strategic evaluation. Several crucial factors should guide your decision-making process: Project Genesis: Evaluating the Core Foundation: Check the altcoin’s underlying technology, its intended use case, the expertise and track record of the development team, and the project’s long-term roadmap. A robust project with a clear value proposition, a dedicated team, and a tangible problem it aims to solve is more likely to achieve sustainable growth. As Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder, a venture firm specializing in crypto assets, emphasizes, “Focus on assets that are creating new economic activity, not just replicating existing ones.” This highlights the importance of identifying projects with genuine innovation. Market Pulse: Gauging Collective Sentiment: Monitor the prevailing market sentiment surrounding the altcoin. Look for positive news coverage, strategic partnerships, active community engagement on platforms like Discord and Telegram, and increasing developer activity. Growing interest and adoption can create upward price momentum. Willy Woo, a renowned on-chain analyst, often discusses the importance of network effects in driving crypto asset value, stating that “value accrues to networks with increasing users.” This underscores the significance of community growth and adoption. Technical Cartography: Mapping Price Movements: Employ technical analysis tools and indicators to identify potential entry points. Analyze price charts for patterns, trends, support and resistance levels, and trading volume. This can provide valuable insights into potential price movements and optimal buying opportunities. However, it’s crucial to remember that technical analysis is not foolproof. As Benjamin Cowen, a popular crypto analyst, cautions, “Technical analysis is a probability game, not a certainty.” Liquidity and Depth: Assessing Market Maturity: Consider the altcoin’s market capitalization and trading volume (liquidity). Higher market capitalization and greater liquidity generally suggest a more stable and mature project, reducing the risk of significant price manipulation or slippage during trades. Risk Appetite: Understanding Your Tolerance: Honestly assess your personal risk tolerance. The altcoin market is inherently volatile, and prices can fluctuate dramatically. Invest only capital you can afford to potentially lose, and diversify your portfolio to mitigate risk. The Presale Advantage: Early Access and Potential Upside Presales, encompassing various forms like initial coin offerings (ICOs), initial exchange offerings (IEOs), and private sales, offer a unique opportunity to acquire altcoins at a potentially discounted price before they are officially listed on public exchanges. This strategy presents several potential benefits: Price Discovery: Early Bird Advantage: Altcoins are typically offered at a lower price during presales compared to their initial listing price. This allows early investors to potentially realize substantial gains if the project gains traction and market value after listing. Community Genesis: Becoming an Early Adopter: Presales provide early access to promising projects, allowing investors to become part of the community from the outset. This can provide valuable insights into the project’s development and future direction. Multiplicative Potential: Amplified Returns: If the project resonates with the market and achieves significant price appreciation after listing, presale investors stand to benefit from amplified returns on their initial investment. Strategic Conclusion: A Calculated Approach to Altcoin Investment Investing in altcoins presents a compelling opportunity for high-growth potential, but it requires a disciplined and strategic approach. By understanding the intricate dynamics of the altcoin market, conducting thorough research, and carefully considering the potential advantages and risks of presales, investors can enhance their prospects for success. Remember, the altcoin market is characterized by volatility, and a calculated, long-term perspective is essential for navigating this exciting yet challenging landscape. Concluding Thoughts – Best Altcoins to Buy Now: Navigating the 2025 Crypto Landscape As the crypto market evolves in the upcoming year, selecting the right investment opportunity becomes crucial for maximizing returns. While each project we’ve analyzed offers unique value propositions, LuckHunter (LHUNT) stands out as the premier choice for forward-thinking investors. LuckHunter is revolutionizing the $227 billion online gambling industry through its groundbreaking metaverse casino platform. With its current presale price of $0.001, projected to reach $0.005 at launch, early investors are positioned for potential 400% returns. The platform’s limited token supply of 8.06 billion LHUNT creates natural scarcity, while its Croatian gaming license ensures regulatory compliance. What sets LuckHunter apart is its unique virtual property ownership model across iconic casino cities, allowing investors to generate passive income through table ownership, gameplay revenue, and staking rewards. As the first-ever metaverse casino with VR integration, LuckHunter represents the perfect confluence of innovation, accessibility, and sustainable growth potential. For investors seeking the optimal entry point into the future of digital gaming and metaverse technology, LuckHunter presents an unmatched opportunity to participate in the next evolution of online gambling. Strategic Portfolio Diversification: High-Performing Cryptocurrencies to Complement LuckHunter While LuckHunter presents a compelling primary investment opportunity in the metaverse casino space, strategic portfolio diversification remains crucial for maximizing potential returns. According to Goldman Sachs’ latest crypto market analysis, a well-balanced crypto portfolio should include exposure to different sectors within the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC): The Digital Gold Standard As reported by BlackRock’s digital asset research division, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate strong institutional adoption, with over $45 billion in institutional inflows during Q1 2024. With its limited supply of 21 million coins and growing mainstream acceptance, Bitcoin provides a stable foundation for any crypto portfolio. Market analysts project a potential price target of $157,000 in January 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Infrastructure Champion Ethereum remains the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, processing over $4.2 trillion in total transaction volume in 2023. With the successful implementation of the Proof of Stake mechanism, Ethereum has reduced its energy consumption by 99.9%, attracting environmentally conscious institutional investors. JPMorgan’s crypto desk reports that ETH’s staking yields, averaging 4.7% annually, provide an attractive passive income stream alongside potential capital appreciation. Solana (SOL): Speed and Scalability Solana’s high-performance blockchain processes over 65,000 transactions per second, making it ideal for gaming and NFT applications. According to DappRadar, Solana’s gaming ecosystem grew by 287% in 2023, complementing LuckHunter’s focus on the gaming sector. The platform’s low transaction costs and rapid settlement times position it as a strong performer in the high-frequency trading and gaming segments. Chainlink (LINK): Oracle Network Leader As the premier decentralized oracle network, Chainlink secured over $200 billion in smart contract value in 2023. Its critical role in connecting blockchain platforms with real-world data makes it essential for gaming and betting platforms like LuckHunter. With over 1,500 project integrations, LINK tokens benefit from growing network effects and increased demand for reliable oracle services. Portfolio Allocation Strategy Based on market analysis from Messari Research, a balanced crypto portfolio alongside LuckHunter might consider the following allocation: LuckHunter (LHUNT): 30-40% (Primary growth opportunity) Bitcoin (BTC): 25-30% (Store of value) Ethereum (ETH): 15-20% (Infrastructure exposure) Solana (SOL): 10-15% (Gaming sector synergy) Chainlink (LINK): 5-10% (Oracle network exposure) This diversification strategy provides exposure to various growth catalysts while maintaining LuckHunter as the core position for maximum upside potential. The combination offers: Stable value preservation through Bitcoin Infrastructure growth with Ethereum Gaming sector synergy via Solana Oracle network exposure through Chainlink Primary growth potential with LuckHunter’s metaverse casino innovation Market analysts at Binance Research suggest that this balanced approach could potentially capture both the stability of established cryptocurrencies and the explosive growth potential of emerging platforms like LuckHunter, which is positioned to revolutionize the online gaming sector through its innovative metaverse casino concept.

38098453,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53122,1735132730,3 Undervalued Cryptocurrencies to Reach $1 This Bull Cycle,"Investors are actively looking for tokens that will provide significant profits as the crypto market prepares for a fresh bull cycle. Among the underpriced treasures ready for a revolution, Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and TRON (TRX) mainly show promise for expansion. Rexas Finance (RXS) is leading the way, as its innovative approach to asset management and significant presale momentum help these three cryptocurrencies reach the sought-after $1 mark. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Top Contender to Reach $1 Thanks to its creative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance (RXS) has rapidly become one of the most promising cryptocurrencies of this bull cycle. By letting people tokenize and invest in real estate, art, and commodities, Rexas Finance is building a future with unlimited asset ownership and liquidity. This utility-driven approach makes it the most underpriced cryptocurrency worth observing. Priced at $0.15 in its 10th presale round as of writing, RXS has so far raised an impressive $30.70 million, which reflects great investor confidence. The earlier presale stages of the token sold out ahead of time, which is evidence of its increasing appeal. According to market analysts, Rexas Finance (RXS) will see a 567% price increase during this bull cycle, forcing its price to $1. The token’s notable 400% increase from the commencement of its presale—where it was first valued at just $0.03—helps to corroborate this estimate. Approaching its expected listing price of $0.20, Rexas Finance (RXS) promises assured returns. Furthermore, the coin, which intends to be listed on three tier-1 platforms, can draw even more liquidity and interest. These elements make Rexas Finance a revolution in asset management and a great cryptocurrency. Its creative use case and great presale momentum help distinguish it as the most significant underpriced cryptocurrency to hit $1 in this bull cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Memecoin with Serious Momentum With growing acceptance and community support, Dogecoin (DOGE) has become a powerhouse cryptocurrency. At $0.3845 as of writing, DOGE has shown amazing performance: over 300% year-to-date growth and a 250% increase in the last three months. Its comeback underscores the growing curiosity of institutional and individual investors. Over the medium to long term, DOGE’s price movement has been within a horizontal trend channel, indicating the possibility of an ongoing increase. Supported at $0.17 and opposed at $0.47, the token is about to exceed its resistance level. Analysts estimate that Dogecoin will hit $1 in this bull cycle driven by increasing payment acceptance and the support of well-known activists. Dogecoin appeals mostly for its simplicity and general availability. Initially driven by excitement, the coin has recently become a respectable investment thanks to growing use cases on e-commerce and tipping systems. DOGE is still a strong competitor to reach $1 even if its path depends mostly on market mood and community-driven initiatives as the market turns positive. TRON (TRX): The Blockchain Pioneer Poised for a Breakout Rising steadily to become among the strongest blockchain systems, TRON (TRX) has a native token positioned for notable expansion. Priced at $0.2721, TRX has shown great investor optimism, with an 85% rise over the past three months and over 150% year-to-date increase. TRON’s technical arrangement is one of its strongest suits. The token’s upward trend has broken in the medium to long term, suggesting a quickening of its development path. TRX is well-positioned for further growth since its price chart shows no obvious opposition. A good volume balance also implies investors are more optimistic about the token’s future. Driven by its burgeoning ecosystem and increasing acceptance of distributed apps (dApps), analysts project that TRON will hit $1 during this bull cycle. Developers have chosen TRON’s blockchain because of its low transaction fees and outstanding throughput, which are well-known features. Consistent development of the network and alliances helps to increase its appeal even more. TRX is still a highly undervalued cryptocurrency with the potential to hit $1 in the bull cycle as it gains strength. Conclusion Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a unique chance for investors wishing to profit on the bull market to participate in the future of asset management and gain from its expected 567% price increase to $1. Don’t miss the chance to invest in the most promising cryptocurrency of this cycle.

38098144,https://finbold.com/?p=222633,1735132500,These U.S. politicians made the most from crypto in 2024,"Thanks to numerous factors, cryptocurrency regained some legitimacy in 2024 following the calamities of the ‘crypto winter.’ These include the industry’s massive lobbying expenditure , approval of investment vehicles such as spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), and the anticipated crypto-friendly nature of the incoming Trump administration. Under such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that many U.S. politicians – generally known as savvy and prolific traders – have started engaging with the sector. Receive Signals on SEC-verified Insider Stock Trades Stocks This signal is triggered upon the reporting of the trade to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Enable signal Since the start of 2024, there has been no shortage of filings showing Congresspeople buying meme coins , as well as more established coins and tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). Politicians aggressively trading meme coins in 2024 Despite this activity, the cryptocurrency market’s volatility, paired with the more common roadblocks to accurately measuring politicians’ returns, makes it somewhat difficult to determine which elected officials made the most in the cryptocurrency market this year. Representative Mike Collins, for example, is a prime candidate for Congress’ big cryptocurrency winner. In 2024, the politician has been actively trading both established digital assets such as Ethereum and meme coins such as Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ) and Ski Mask Dog ( SKI ). The Congressman’s current meme coin holdings – most notably AERO purchased in early November and SKI bought in early December – are solidly in the green, and his earlier cryptocurrency investments have potentially provided triple-digit returns.

The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Enable signal On the other hand, though it is dubious if he is in the green on his digital assets at press time, Barry Moore has a significant potential to make stellar returns on his digital assets. Representative Morre is a long-term holder of multiple coins and tokens, including Cardano ( ADA ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Ethereum, and Bitcoin. Moore, however, also has the misfortune that the bulk of his cryptocurrency was purchased near the 2021 highs. Are these early adopters the most successful crypto traders in Congress? The story is much the same for the prominent blockchain advocate in the Senate, Cynthia Lummis . Still, unlike Representative Moore, Senator Lummis is likely in the green on her 2021 BTC investment due to the coin’s rise to new and exceptionally high all-time highs (ATH) in 2024. Ultimately, the case may be that a somewhat uninteresting answer to which U.S. politicians made the most from digital assets in 2024 is correct. Receive Signals on US Senators' Stock Trades Stocks Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Senators. The signal triggers based on updates from the Senate disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions.

38103277,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106431,1735132143,Tether Blacklists Address Linked to Roost Coin Amid Possible Connection to $22M NFT Fraud,"According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, Tether has added the Ethereum address ""0x88E6...4d47"" to its blacklist. The blacklisted wallet reportedly holds 13.144 million USDT on Ethereum and 2.66 million ROOST tokens on Base. Moreover, this address received 150 ETH in multiple transactions from ""0x71B2...18a6,"" an entity known to have removed ROOST/WETH liquidity on the Base blockchain approximately nine months ago.Meanwhile, blockchain sleuth ZachXBT recently highlighted a possible link between the blacklisting and a recent indictment against two California men: Gabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has accused them of orchestrating a $22 million rug pull across multiple NFT and digital asset projects. Among the projects listed in the DOJ report is Roost Coin, a token now tied to the blacklisted address.https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1871760292159574389The $22M Rug Pull ScandalLast Friday, the DOJ unsealed a six-count indictment against Hay and Mayo, charging them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and stalking. From May 2021 to May 2024, the duo allegedly defrauded investors by promoting fraudulent NFT projects with false claims. These include the now-infamous Vault of Gems, Faceless, and Roost Coin. Instead of delivering on their promises, Hay and Mayo are accused of abandoning the projects after raising millions.In their schemes, Hay and Mayo allegedly concealed their involvement by falsely naming others as project leaders. Notably, when a project manager exposed their role in the Faceless NFT project , the duo allegedly launched a harassment campaign against the individual and their family.The Blockchain TrailThe blacklisted address's connection to ROOST tokens and its ties to liquidity removal on Base further deepen suspicions surrounding Roost Coin’s involvement in the fraudulent operations. Tether blacklisting the wallet may be part of broader efforts to disrupt the financial networks of those implicated in the fraud case.Notably, the last time PeckShieldAlert reported Tether blacklisting a wallet was in connection with addresses involved in the theft of thousands of USDT tokens from the FixedFloat exchange hack seven months ago.",NEGATIVE,ETH | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | USDT | ZRX,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/25/tether-blacklists-address-linked-to-roost-coin-amid-possible-connection-to-22m-nft-fraud/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=tether-blacklists-address-linked-to-roost-coin-amid-possible-connection-to-22m-nft-fraud,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bogus Copyright Notices Leveraged to Dupe Victims The attacker impersonated the X platform team and sent fake copyright infringement notices to targeted users. These messages were urgent, meaning the victims clicked on phishing links. On these phishing websites, the users unknowingly reset their account passwords and 2FA credentials, thus giving the hacker complete access. Crypto Accounts with Large Followings Targeted Among the compromised accounts were Kick, Cursor, The Arena, Brett, and Alex Blania, all very popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Combined, these accounts have in excess of 200,000 followers, most of whom are memecoin investors looking for the next big thing. The hacker posted scams in each of these accounts, captioned “Incoming Transmission”, followed by a fake token announcement and contract address. The posts deceived users into interacting with the scam projects to siphon funds. Obfuscation of Stolen Funds ZachXBT followed the operation to six deployer addresses used in the scams. The attacker bridged assets between the Solana and Ethereum networks , a modus operandi of cyber attackers as they mask the origin of stolen funds and confuse their movements in order not to be traced. Security Tips for X Users ZachXBT encouraged the users to take extra care to secure their accounts. Suggestions include not using the same email address on different platforms and providing 2FA for critical accounts. Making these options stronger will reduce the chance of such attacks. Wider Context of Crypto Scams This incident joins a spate of crimes related to crypto that seem to be on the increase. Although phishing losses decreased 53% month-over-month in November to $9.3 million, it appears scammers are trying harder during the holiday season. As it were, Chainalysis estimates that already in 2024, $2.2 billion has been stolen across 303 major incidents-a 21% increase from the previous year. Centralized services remain the hardest hit, making cybersecurity a critical concern for the crypto community . By exposing these scams, investigators like ZachXBT highlight the growing need for vigilance among cryptocurrency users.

38103276,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106429,1735131756,Shiba Inu Position in Danger As SUI Hits $13.4B Market Cap in Push to Overtake Shib,"Sui, a new market entrant, is doubling down on its attempt to surpass Shiba Inu in the crypto ranking, as its market cap recently hit a new milestone. Notably, this comes as Shiba Inu has regained bullish momentum after a notable correction last week. The second-largest meme coin by market cap has surged almost 4% in the past 24 hours, mirroring a broader market rebound.Despite the recovery phase, SHIB has dropped three places in the market cap ranking in the past month. Bullish traction on Avalanche, Chainlink, and Toncoin has ensured the high-caliber meme coin moved to 14th place.Meanwhile, the doggy-themed meme coin could move lower as a strong rival draws increasingly closer. SUI may be the next asset to flip Shiba Inu in market cap rankings amidst sustained bullish momentum.Sui Nears All-Time HighThe Sui network's native token has continued consolidating around its all-time high of $4.96, achieved early in the month. The sustained momentum has seen it reclaim the $13 billion market cap, hitting $13.9 billion yesterday.Moreover, SUI’s continued upward push has placed it in contention to flip Shiba Inu in market cap. At press time, the network’s valuation stands at $13.42 billion, less than $400 million from Shiba Inu’s $13.84 billion.This means that SUI needs to surge less than 2% to $4.67 to surpass Shiba Inu’s market cap and rank 14th. However, this will materialize if the meme coin remains at the current valuation and does not rise alongside the market.Will TVL Surge Push Sui Past Shiba Inu?Meanwhile, bullish momentum continues to swell in the SUI ecosystem. The SUI token has surged a jaw-dropping 522% in the past year, with 32% of the uptick from its solid move from sub $3.5 to the current market price.Furthermore, the total value locked (TVL) on the Sui network increased with the asset's price. Data from DeFiLlama shows an over 10% TVL uptick to $1.788 billion in the ecosystem over the past 30 days.Based on this, analysis suggests that SUI will target $5 next, with the expected reach at the 78.60% Fibonacci level at $5.7. Meanwhile, other commentaries asserted further upsides to $6.61 and $7.73 for SUI.In the meantime, SUI trades at $4.59, up 2.28% in the past 24 hours.",NEGATIVE,SHIB | SUI,LINK | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | SUI,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/25/shiba-inu-position-in-danger-as-sui-hits-13-4b-market-cap-in-push-to-overtake-shib/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-position-in-danger-as-sui-hits-13-4b-market-cap-in-push-to-overtake-shib,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
38098452,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53054,1735131654,Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) Won’t Make Another All-Time High This Cycle: DTX Exchange (DTX) Aims For Top-100 Listing,"Market experts and city investors always follow how the prevailing cryptocurrencies, such as Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP), perform. Recent market analyses suggest that these two giants may not yet hit their new all-time highs in this ongoing cycle. Such unexpected changes will likely make a difference in investors’ business conduct. Suddenly, new tokens emerged that brought in more promise for upward movement. One such bright star is DTX Exchange (DTX), which is currently stirring up hype and positioning itself to be recognized as one of the most serious contenders on the grounds of this much-waited top 100 listing. Most importantly, DTX Exchange is becoming popular fast with its innovative managed platform for crypto trading. The individual characterizes a solid intersection of traditional finance and digital assets inside one seamless and comprehensive platform. Investors are restructuring their portfolios and re-strategizing for high-gaining new opportunities with prospective developing ecosystems and the dynamic market shift. Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) Struggle to Realize Their Full Potential Cardano and Ripple compete to break records from all-time highs, which are highly popular for their strong community bases around these two currencies. Presently trading above $0.9, Cardano remains on the move and is grasping again. While this great praise is directed towards its steady approach to development, it has left the project slow in adopting new advantages compared to more agile competitors. More or less similar goes with Ripple (XRP), the last two litigation controversies have taken the edge off XRP, which has caused RLUSD to launch into the world. Though XRP is presently trading between $2.20 and $2.30, price action has not been as high as anticipated just a few days back. Current developments of the XRP are still tied under regulatory clouds hovering over it, so its market performance continues to be affected. Despite their good showings in the angularity networks, Cardano and Ripple continue falling behind as good prospects for increased growth. DTX Is Revolutionizing Crypto Trading with 1000x Leverage, High-Performance Technology, and Comprehensive Market Integration With Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) struggling against the market’s tide, a glimmer of hope shines in DTX Exchange (DTX), heralding another innovative entry into the crypto space. The ongoing presale, now at the sixth stage, has so far netted DTX an impressive $10.5 million from tokens selling at $0.12. The next stage will record a hike to $0.14, which denotes rising confidence and investor inflow. The thing that DTX Exchange adds to trade is the comprehensive outlook, being the first crypto-native proposition on stocks, forex, ETF trading, and more than 100,000 currency pairs bridges the new with the old in finance. This unique stance is being endorsed by over 300,000 wallets due to the high level of usage registered by its traders and investors. A mouthful of online currencies promising an exchange trading platform is much more than just a revolution. It boasts up to 1000x leverage, and thus, users considerably amplify trade possibilities. The VulcanX testnet attests to the phenomenal ability to carry out upwards of 100,000 transactions per second, thus positioning DTX Exchange powerfully as a high-performance trading ecosystem. The Phoenix Wallet, on the other side, pledges a very secure custody solution for crypto, stocks, and forex in an attempt to address the very vital clouds hanging over the evolving digital asset space. Conclusion The crypto community is all set to go through all expected anticipation just before the DTX Exchange live launch in Q1 of 2025. Tokenized ETF trading adds a different dimension to the DTX canvas, especially among users in jurisdictions with limited access to traditional ETFs. This innovative approach is bound to see DTX become a significant disruptor in the crypto trading landscape. While still huge players in the crypto realm, Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) leave way for other market frontiers occupied by platforms such as DTX Exchange . All of such aspirations, coupled with a full range of trading options, pushing-edge technology, and a growing community backing, hold DTX in a firm position to rock the world with possible high tides in crypto. As the platform aspires to enter the top 100, its early investors stand a rare chance of being part of what could become the single most lucrative tale of success in digital assets. The crypto space is ever-changing, and DTX Exchange only appears to be one of the few that lead through this change, showing a glimpse of future integrated digital finance.

38098451,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53113,1735131648,"Forget Previous Crypto Favorites—Dogen’s 18,500% Rally Redefines the Meme Market","A fresh contender is turning heads in the world of meme cryptocurrencies, soaring to unprecedented heights and disrupting the status quo.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The Rise of a Fun and Plentiful Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. It features a Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially considered a “memecoin,” it gained significant value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This growth was influenced by social media attention and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s community-driven nature and widespread popularity demonstrate the impact of social media on financial markets. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin’s accessibility and strong community support may make it an attractive option for some investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by Ryoshi, it started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated a large amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB’s prominence. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can interact with Ethereum applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a community governance system, giving SHIB potential for broader use. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s developments and Ethereum compatibility may make it an attractive option. Conclusion With DOGEN’s astounding rally, meme coins like DOGE and SHIB have less short-term potential. DOGEN caters to those seeking the finest, embodying luxury and success. Expected 700% growth by presale’s end with potential for thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

38098449,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53057,1735131631,"XRP Volume Crosses $10 Billion After Christmas, DTX Exchange Set to Sellout Stage 6","Christmas time always presents a surprising twist in the cryptocurrency market, and this year has been no exception. XRP has captured headlines as its trading volume surged past $10 billion at the peak of the holiday season, reaffirming its dominance amid ongoing market corrections. At the same time, DTX Exchange is making waves with its Stage 6 presale nearing a sellout and strong investor momentum fueling excitement for what’s next. As XRP eyes a potential breakout and DTX builds anticipation for a rally, the stage is set for these two assets to drive the next chapter of the bull cycle. XRP Trading Volume Crosses $10 Billion Despite broader market pullbacks, XRP’s trading volume soared to over $10.12 billion, positioning it as one of the most actively traded cryptocurrencies in December. Currently trading at $2.31, XRP has maintained its place as the fourth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $125.29 billion. Source: Tradingview While XRP is down 11.08% over the past week, analysts remain optimistic about its next move. Key support at $1.92 has been identified as a crucial rebuy zone for bullish traders, with resistance levels at $2.28 serving as the next hurdle. Once broken, XRP could rally to the much-anticipated $4 mark, with projections pointing to a potential breakout in early 2025. XRP has also dominated Binance Futures, accounting for $116.6 million in December trading volume and emerging as the platform’s most traded altcoin. Additionally, wallet growth has surged by 28% over the past two years, reflecting a growing adoption rate and sustained investor confidence in Ripple’s ecosystem. With the RLUSD stablecoin launch bolstering Ripple’s utility and regulatory clarity on the horizon in 2025, XRP’s strong volume and price action suggest the token is poised for further gains in the new year. DTX Exchange: Stage 6 Presale on the Verge of Sellout While XRP commands attention in the broader market, DTX Exchange is creating its own buzz in the DeFi space. The platform’s Stage 6 presale is close to selling out, following its $10.24 million presale raise, which has cemented DTX as one of the most promising projects of this cycle. DTX’s appeal lies in its distributed liquidity pools, which aggregate liquidity from multiple sources to reduce slippage and enhance trading execution. This innovative approach has positioned DTX Exchange as a leader in decentralized trading, catering to both retail and institutional investors. With growing community support and analysts predicting a 33x rally in the near term, DTX is being closely compared to the early success stories of Solana and Cardano. Investors are racing to secure positions before the presale ends, as DTX gears up for what could be a transformative breakout in 2025. What Lies Ahead for XRP and DTX As the year comes to a close, XRP and DTX Exchange are shaping up to be key players in the crypto market. XRP’s surge in trading volume and anticipation of a breakout to $4 underscore its resilience as a market leader, while DTX’s presale momentum and unique features position it as a rising star in the DeFi sector. The interplay between XRP’s established dominance and DTX’s rapid growth could define early trends in 2025, as both projects attract attention from retail and institutional investors alike. With strong fundamentals and bullish sentiment surrounding these assets, their next moves will be critical in shaping the broader market narrative heading into the new year.

38098259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667031,1735131622,Solana Sees Consistent Capital Inflows Since 2023 – Liquidity Influx Signals Growth,"Solana has staged an impressive recovery, surging over 14% from its recent local lows, showcasing resilience after a period of correction. This renewed momentum has reignited investor optimism, positioning Solana as a standout in the crypto market. Key metrics from Glassnode further bolster this sentiment, revealing that Solana has consistently maintained a positive net capital inflow since early September 2023. While minor outflows were observed, the overall trend underscores sustained interest and confidence in the project. Related Reading: XRP Whales Keep Buying – Data Reveals Smart Money Prepares For A Rally These capital inflows highlight Solana’s growing adoption and utility, indicating that the blockchain ecosystem continues to attract new participants and capital. As the market evolves, such metrics suggest that Solana is poised for continued growth, supported by strong fundamentals and a thriving developer community. With its recovery gaining traction, Solana remains a top contender for investors eyeing projects with robust long-term potential. The consistent inflow of capital not only reflects market confidence but also sets the stage for further expansion in the coming months. Whether through innovative dApps, enhanced scalability, or increasing network activity, Solana’s upward trajectory seems far from over, making it a focal point in the broader crypto landscape. Solana Metrics Reveal A Growing Network Solana appears to be on the brink of a massive rally next year as its network continues to demonstrate sustained growth and resilience. According to an insightful report by Glassnode, Solana has consistently recorded positive net capital inflows since early September 2023. Despite minor outflows during this period, the overall trend highlights the network’s ability to attract liquidity and maintain investor confidence. One of the report’s most striking revelations is the peak daily inflow of $776 million in new capital, underscoring significant interest and participation within the ecosystem. This sustained influx of liquidity has not only bolstered Solana’s growth but has also played a pivotal role in supporting its price stability and appreciation. Such a consistent capital inflow suggests that investors view Solana as a high-potential project capable of outperforming in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Fueling Potential Dip – $90K Support Crucial Level To Hold With robust fundamentals, growing adoption, and increasing developer activity, Solana’s upward trajectory is well-positioned to continue. If the current trend of capital inflows persists, it could serve as a catalyst for a massive rally, potentially surpassing previous highs. As we look ahead to 2025, Solana remains a project to watch, offering investors an opportunity to participate in a blockchain ecosystem that is rapidly gaining prominence in the crypto space. Strong Bounce From Key Demand Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $199 after successfully bouncing from the $175 level, a critical demand zone that has proven to be a robust support area. This rebound showcases Solana’s underlying strength and its ability to attract buyers at key levels, setting the stage for further upward momentum. The $175 mark has historically acted as a launchpad for SOL, and this time is no different, as the price now targets higher levels. If Solana manages to push above the $210 resistance level in the coming days, a rapid surge is likely to follow. Breaking this barrier would signal strong bullish momentum, potentially propelling SOL into new highs and reigniting investor enthusiasm. However, the market could also experience a period of sideways consolidation as traders assess the current conditions and prepare for the next significant move. Related Reading: If History Repeats Dogecoin Has Potential For A Parabolic Rally – Details Consolidation above the $190 level would still be a positive sign, indicating that SOL is building a solid foundation for its next rally. Maintaining strength around these levels is critical to sustaining the bullish outlook, as any failure to hold could lead to a retest of lower demand zones. For now, all eyes are on Solana as it navigates key price levels and prepares for its next move.

38097284,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314079,1735130714,Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev Predicts Stock Market Will Move On-Chain in Merging of Crypto and Equities,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is predicting that stocks and other traditional finance (TradFi) assets will eventually move on-chain like cryptocurrencies. In a new interview with investor Anthony Pompliano, Tenev says that the efficiencies gained by using blockchain technology make its adoption by traditional finance inevitable. He also predicts that US President-elect Donald Trump and his administration will enact policies that will speed up the move to on-chain by stocks, private companies and real-world assets (RWAs) by tokenizing them. “What will happen is traditional equities – and I think all of this will be accelerated by the new [Trump] administration – will move onto blockchain rails, along with all sorts of other real-world assets. You’ll see private companies going on blockchain rails as well. Once you have public companies, then you’ll have to think through what does it mean to actually go public and list on a blockchain as opposed to on a traditional stock exchange? I think we’ll have to figure that out, and then that opens up private markets as well. And what you gain is interoperability. I don’t know if you’ve tried to move stocks from a legacy discount broker to Robinhood. A lot of people do it, and it’s very, very painful. And by the way, the big brokerage houses don’t want to make it easy. They want to keep those assets there, so they’ll put all sorts of non-technical barriers in the way too. But contrast that with how easy it is to move dollar stablecoins or Bitcoin from your MetaMask wallet to your Phantom or your Robinhood wallet, everything just kind of works, because the infrastructure underlying the assets and the transactions is all public.” Tenev believes on-chain transactions are the logical next step in the evolution of TradFi processes since it would simplify them. “You have no need for transfer agents, for central clearing houses or payment processors. All of that’s replaced by software. My view of crypto is it’s sort of the next step in how financial infrastructure evolves. It started with pen and paper and filing cabinet. It went to mainframe. It went to on-premise and cloud. And then crypto is just the next layer there where you’ll see traditional financial services on crypto rails. They’ll be easier to use, better, more interoperable, and I think the US will have to adopt it. The efficiency gains are just going to be too high to ignore.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

38097307,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397847,1735130702,"Singapore Issues 13 Crypto Licenses in 2024, Surpassing Hong Kong’s Efforts","The post Singapore Issues 13 Crypto Licenses in 2024, Surpassing Hong Kong’s Efforts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News China’s strict ban on cryptocurrencies has pushed many crypto traders to find safer markets. This has worked in Singapore’s favor, as the city has become a top destination for crypto companies. Unlike Hong Kong, which has slow approval processes and stricter rules, Singapore offers a more crypto-friendly environment for digital assets. Singapore Outpaces Hong Kong in Crypto Licenses In 2024, Singapore has taken the lead in the cryptocurrency sector, issuing 13 licenses to crypto companies this year, surpassing Hong Kong’s efforts. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is on track to issue these licenses by 2024, double the number granted last year and more than Hong Kong, which is also striving to become a crypto hub. As per the Bloomberg report , Singapore’s regulatory environment has attracted major players, including exchanges like OKX and Upbit. On the other hand, Hong Kong is lacking behind other countries, so far they have only approved 7 licenses and issued several temporary licenses. The strict regulations in Hong Kong can prove fatal as big institutions can easily turn their focus on other countries causing a financial disruption. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Montenegro’s Top Court Rejects Do Kwon’s Appeal on Extradition, Likely To Go U.S. , Singapore vs Hong Kong Singapore’s regulatory system is seen as more supportive and stable, making it a safer place for crypto companies to grow. Firms like B2C2 have chosen to apply for licenses in Singapore to reduce risks. David Rogers, CEO of cryptocurrency market maker B2C2 Ltd has urged more crypto exchanges to apply for licenses in Singapore as a way to manage risks and expand their businesses. Interestingly, Singapore’s initiatives, like Project Guardian and Global Layer 1, led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, will increase asset tokenization and blockchain adoption in financial markets. These efforts make Singapore a stable and attractive hub for digital asset companies looking for a regional base. However talking about Hong Kong’s market, Angela Ang, senior policy adviser at consultancy TRM Labs, stated that Hong Kong’s tougher rules around asset custody and token listing have made it less appealing to new crypto firms. While Hong Kong has tried to attract crypto firms with initiatives like Bitcoin ETFs and a digital green bond, Singapore has done better in drawing companies. Conclusion Singapore is no doubt creating a secure place for crypto exchanges while other nations are still working on regulations and restricting cross-border transitions Singapore is paving the way for innovation in the country. Recently Ripple launched its stablecoin RLUSD in Singapore while it is still waiting for regulatory approval in the US. This is one of the best examples of cross-border payments. But looking at the global scale despite the ban, China showed its interest in Bitcoin to leverage this industry to support their economy and if they jump into the crypto game it will be a serious threat for many countries depending largely on Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-will-rally-14000-before-exchange-listing-while-dogecoin-and-bonk-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Dogecoin: The Memecoin with Growing Market Potential Dogecoin (DOGE) started in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to other cryptocurrencies. It features a Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no limit on its supply, with 10,000 new coins produced every minute. In 2021, its value soared, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. This was driven by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. The coin's community and its appeal as a fun currency have given it staying power. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to attract interest. Its potential lies in its strong community and the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Solana (SOL): A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). Competing with Ethereum and Cardano, it aims for faster transactions without using sharding or second-layer solutions. SOL, its native cryptocurrency, facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The platform's high-capacity network and support for multiple programming languages make it attractive to developers and investors. In the current market cycle, SOL's potential for hosting high-activity products and services may offer appealing opportunities for those interested in blockchain technology. Conclusion While Dogecoin and Solana may have less immediate potential during the current bull run, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone.

38097049,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397850,1735130192,Solana Rebounds From a Crucial Support; Is This an Indication of the Start of a Fresh Bullish Run?,"The post Solana Rebounds From a Crucial Support; Is This an Indication of the Start of a Fresh Bullish Run? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin recently surged close to $100K , undergoing over 6% rise ahead of Christmas. This move circulated bullish waves across the markets as most of the altcoins surged back within a bullish pattern. The Solana price halted the bearish trend after reaching a pivotal support and after a brief consolidation, it initiated a strong rebound within the bullish zone. However, the price continues to face significant upward pressure, which raises concerns over the next price action. The SOL price faced a decent pullback that ousted the token from the top 5 cryptos as per the market capitalisation. However, the token is expected to revive a strong bullish action as it has entered the bullish range after triggering a rebound from the pivotal support. Therefore, this suggests the price is gearing up for another ascending price action towards new highs. The recent rebound from the crucial support at the 200-day EMA suggests the bulls have become active as they prevent the token from excess price drain. Meanwhile, the RSI has triggered a rebound after reaching the lower threshold, which may further keep up the momentum of the rally. However, the volume has dropped to a large extent which may raise some concerns over the next price action. After the rebound, the SOL price has entered within the bullish range, above the ascending trend line, which has been acting as strong support. Unless and until the price remains above the range, the probability of an extended ascending trend remains higher. In case of a bearish pullback, the 200-day EMA may offer a strong base and trigger a strong rebound. Now that the Solana (SOL) price has rebounded from a support confluence, the trend is expected to remain elevated and reclaim the levels at $300 in the first few days of 2025.",POSITIVE,SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/solana-rebounds-from-a-crucial-support-is-this-an-indication-of-the-start-of-a-fresh-bullish-run/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

These projects embody the spirit of decentralised technology, making them the best crypto to buy on 25 December. Qubetics: Pioneering Privacy and Decentralization Qubetics is redefining blockchain by integrating a decentralised VPN (dVPN) into its ecosystem. This addition enhances the platform’s value by supporting privacy-centric applications and as a building block for decentralised services like DeFi, NFTs, and decentralised storage. By ensuring secure and private connections, the Qubetics dVPN upholds the core principles of Web3: autonomy and decentralisation. Currently, in Presale Phase 14, Qubetics offers $TICS tokens at $0.037, with over $7.7 million raised, 374 million tokens sold, and a robust community of 11,700+ holders. With the next phase imminent, a post-presale target of $0.25 per token presents an ROI potential of 563.81% for early adopters. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $10 to $15 post-mainnet, offering returns of up to 39,728.85% for current investors. Qubetics ’ partnership with SWFT Blockchain further strengthens its ecosystem, introducing a state-of-the-art wallet that supports cross-chain functionality and multi-asset management. These innovations position Qubetics as a trailblazer in blockchain technology, driving adoption and user trust. AAVE Set for a Powerful Bullish Breakout AAVE is demonstrating strong bullish momentum, with its price action signalling a potential breakout to new highs. After breaking out of a long-term bullish pattern, AAVE’s ascending trend strengthens. The token has surpassed the critical resistance level at $400, spurred by a breakout from the Adam & Eve pattern that triggered a 10% price increase. While the stochastic RSI indicates oversold conditions and the MACD suggests a potential bearish crossover, a minor retracement below $370 could provide an opportunity for accumulation. Analysts forecast that AAVE could rebound strongly and climb to $420, with the potential for further growth in early 2025. With its solid fundamentals and a leading role in the DeFi space, AAVE is well-positioned to capitalise on the growing demand for decentralised financial services. Bitcoin Cash: Staying True to Satoshi’s Vision Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues championing Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision of permissionless peer-to-peer cash. Unlike Bitcoin, which has seen adoption by institutions and a shift toward “store of value” narratives, Bitcoin Cash is focused on usability, scalability, and low fees. While Bitcoin Cash operates under the radar compared to BTC’s institutional fanfare, its community remains committed to developing a decentralised currency that anyone can use. Recent commentary from community members emphasises BCH’s alignment with the principles of sound money and its ability to facilitate everyday transactions efficiently. As scepticism around Bitcoin’s 21-million cap grows, Bitcoin Cash remains steadfast in delivering a solution that prioritises accessibility and practicality. This focus on usability makes BCH a strong contender for investors looking for cryptocurrencies that stay true to their roots. Conclusion As the year draws to a close, Qubetics, AAVE, and Bitcoin Cash represent compelling opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. Qubetics leads with its innovative dVPN integration, presale success, and ambitious roadmap. AAVE shows strong bullish potential and is poised to reach new highs in the coming months. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash offers a practical and scalable alternative for those who value the original principles of cryptocurrency. Whether your focus is on cutting-edge privacy solutions, DeFi innovation, or decentralised cash, these projects stand out as the best crypto to buy on 25 December .

Cardano: Navigating Market Challenges Cardano’s ADA token has recently faced significant price challenges, reflecting broader market volatility. After a 14% decline over seven days following the post-FOMC conference, ADA dropped below $1, prompting investors to reconsider their positions. Experts predict a potential 20% price drop in the coming weeks before a recovery phase begins. Cardano investors respond cautiously, waiting for the price dip to stabilise before making further commitments. Meanwhile, some are reallocating profits to new opportunities like FXGuys, a promising crypto trading platform projected to make waves in 2024. For long-term investors, patience is advised as Cardano works through its price correction phase. The project’s solid foundation and history of innovation suggest recovery and future growth potential. SEI: Rapid Adoption and Utility Growth SEI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing blockchain projects, significantly increasing daily transactions. Between mid-September and early December, SEI experienced a sixfold growth in daily transactions, rising from 116,000 to 608,000. This remarkable growth reflects increasing user activity and network utilisation. The token has shown consistent week-over-week growth, with notable spikes in late November and early December, indicating strong adoption drivers. SEI’s rapid expansion demonstrates its early utility within the blockchain space, making it an exciting project for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Conclusion This week’s crypto market highlights the diverse opportunities offered by Qubetics, Cardano, and SEI. Qubetics leads with its innovative wallet ecosystem, robust presale performance, and focus on user empowerment.

Meanwhile, SEI showcases impressive adoption and network growth, cementing its place as a high-potential blockchain project.

In May, the cyberattack resulted in the theft of 4,502 Bitcoin, valued at $308 million, causing severe financial damage and the eventual shutdown of the Japanese crypto exchange. The attack began with sophisticated social engineering tactics targeting Ginco, a Japanese cryptocurrency wallet company. Hackers posed as recruiters on LinkedIn, sending malicious links disguised as pre-employment tests hosted on GitHub. A Ginco employee unknowingly clicked the link, enabling the hackers to compromise their GitHub account. This access allowed the attackers to impersonate the employee in internal communications. By May, the group exploited this access to manipulate a legitimate transaction request from a DMM Bitcoin employee. The stolen Bitcoin was swiftly transferred to wallets controlled by the hackers. Despite efforts by DMM Bitcoin to recover funds and compensate users through Bitcoin repurchases, the financial losses were insurmountable. As a result, the exchange announced its permanent closure and plans to transfer customer accounts to SBI VC Trade by March 2025. This breach stands as one of Japan's most significant crypto thefts , second only to the 2018 Coincheck hack, where $530 million was stolen. The incident sheds light on the growing threat posed by North Korean cybercriminal groups in the cryptocurrency sector. In 2024 alone, these groups have been responsible for stealing $1.34 billion in crypto assets, representing about two-thirds of all global crypto thefts. In July, the stolen funds were funneled through Huione Guarantee, a company operating in Cambodia. Reports from Chainalysis suggest the firm has been involved in pig butchering scams valued at approximately $49 billion. In response, Cambodia initiated a crackdown in December, blocking access to 16 cryptocurrency exchanges, including major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. Taylor Monahan, a security expert from MetaMask , emphasized the ongoing risk: “Crypto folks (hopefully) already know that Lazarus is one of the most prevalent threat actors targeting this industry. They rekt more people, companies, protocols than anyone else. But it’s good to know exactly how they get in. Because another smart contract audit won’t save you.” This attack serves as a stark reminder of the persistent and evolving threat posed by North Korean cybercriminals. Their ability to exploit human error through social engineering and advanced infiltration techniques remains a serious challenge for the global cryptocurrency industry.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/fbi-links-308m-dmm-bitcoin-hack-to-north-korea-s-tradertraitor-group,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38096750.jpeg

38096685,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microstrategy-plans-massive-share-expansion-to-buy-42-billion-in-bitcoin,1735129482,MicroStrategy Plans Massive Share Expansion to Buy $42 Billion in Bitcoin,"MicroStrategy is gearing up to issue more shares as part of its strategy to boost Bitcoin purchases. The company aims to acquire $42 billion worth of Bitcoin through a mix of equity and debt funding. This move comes as MicroStrategy's stock, $MSTR, has soared by nearly 420% in 2024, mirroring Bitcoin's impressive performance. A special shareholder meeting is planned to approve changes in the firm’s equity issuance policy to support its ambitious acquisition plans. A recent SEC filing dated December 23 outlines MicroStrategy’s proposal to increase its authorized Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.33 billion shares and preferred stock from 5 million to over 1 billion shares. This substantial expansion will give the company more flexibility to issue shares for future funding needs. These changes align with MicroStrategy’s 21/21 Plan, revealed in October, which aims to acquire $42 billion in Bitcoin over three years, funded by $21 billion in equity sales and another $21 billion through fixed-income securities. In December alone, MicroStrategy purchased 42,162 BTC , valued at over $4 billion at current prices. This marks the company’s most aggressive acquisition phase, driven by the belief that acquiring Bitcoin during peak prices maximizes potential returns. “If you are not buying Bitcoin at the top, you are leaving money on the table,” stated Michael Saylor on X (formerly Twitter). As of October, the company reported a Bitcoin yield of 17.8% and is targeting an annual yield of 6% to 10% from 2025 to 2027. So far, MicroStrategy has raised $13 billion through stock sales and $3 billion via convertible bonds. However, a temporary pause in Bitcoin purchases is expected in January due to a planned blackout period. The surge in Bitcoin’s value throughout 2024 has significantly boosted MicroStrategy’s performance, leading to its inclusion in the Nasdaq-100. The company is also a potential candidate for the S&P 500 in the coming year. Michael Saylor highlighted the impact of their treasury operations, which generated a Bitcoin yield equivalent to 3,177 BTC in just one week, adding a net benefit of $299 million to shareholders at $94,000 per BTC.

This marks the largest single-day outflow since Bitcoin ETFs were launched. Analysts suggest profit-taking as the primary reason, although some question if this signals a deeper structural shift in investor sentiment. Before this downturn, Bitcoin ETFs enjoyed 15 consecutive days of positive net inflows, driving their total assets from $100 billion to $121 billion. However, recent outflows have pushed total net assets down to $105 billion. Data from SoSoValue indicates Grayscale’s GBTC fund was the main contributor, selling 1,870 BTC in just three days. In contrast, BlackRock’s IBIT fund continued buying, but its activity wasn't enough to offset the sell pressure. Despite this negative trend, confidence in Bitcoin remains strong. In December, Bitcoin ETFs surpassed gold ETFs in total assets under management (AUM), underlining growing trust in digital assets among institutional and retail investors. However, these recent outflows have temporarily stalled Bitcoin’s upward price trajectory. While Bitcoin struggled, Ethereum ETFs recorded inflows exceeding $130 million , with a notable surge during the December 23 trading session. On the same day, Bitcoin ETFs saw $226 million in outflows. BlackRock's Ethereum ETF has now accumulated over 1 million ETH, signaling increasing institutional interest in the asset. Investor Dan Gambardello remarked that Ethereum’s current accumulation phase, combined with BlackRock’s growing holdings, hints at a potential altcoin market revival . This comes as Ethereum’s price recently corrected from $4,100 to around $3,100. Many investors view this as a sign of a brewing altcoin season. Market experts suggest that while profit-taking explains much of the Bitcoin ETF outflows, the growing interest in Ethereum could indicate shifting investment preferences. BlackRock's substantial ETH holdings , coupled with Ethereum's price consolidation below its all-time high, may create momentum for further inflows into Ethereum ETFs. In summary, Bitcoin ETFs are facing heavy profit-taking pressure, while Ethereum ETFs are experiencing increased institutional attention. Investors are now closely watching whether this trend is temporary or marks the start of a larger shift in digital asset investment strategies. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate institutional portfolios, and their performance in the coming weeks will likely set the tone for the broader cryptocurrency market.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-face-1-2b-outflows-ethereum-sees-130m-inflows,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38096584.jpeg
38096742,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322589,1735129144,Russia’s Central Bank Develops New Surveillance Platform to Target Illegal Crypto OTC Services: Report,"The Central Bank of Russia is developing a centralized surveillance platform to identify and block illegal financial activities facilitated by so-called “mules”—individuals who use their bank accounts for dubious transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trading. According to a source close to the report, this initiative was conducted in collaboration with Rosfinmonitoring. It aims to enhance financial security and reduce the volume of shadow transactions involving online casinos, crypto exchanges, and illicit businesses. The platform will centralize information about suspicious activities, allowing banks to act preemptively by refusing to open accounts for high-risk individuals. Bogdan Shablya, head of the Financial Monitoring and Currency Control Service of the Central Bank, confirmed that the platform’s goal is to make illegal financial operations economically unviable by blocking access at the point of entry. Unlike existing Know Your Client (KYC) systems, which primarily monitor businesses and rely heavily on reactive measures, this platform will proactively target personal accounts and focus on real-time detection of anomalous transaction patterns. It will leverage advanced data analytics and AI-driven risk models to flag potential threats. Russia Attack Crypto OTC: What’s Happening? The platform under development will function as a unified database shared among Russian banks, allowing for the centralized dissemination of information about individuals identified as “droppers.” These people knowingly or unknowingly facilitate illegal financial activities by providing access to their bank accounts. Currently, the Central Bank can only alert the financial institutions where the dropper holds an account. However, the new system will ensure that all banks have access to this information, preventing droppers from exploiting loopholes by opening accounts at different institutions. According to Shablya in the report, this system is not a duplicate of the existing KYC platform for businesses but a specialized mechanism targeting personal accounts used for illicit purposes. Source: rbc.ru The Central Bank’s data reveals that cashing out through individual accounts remains a significant issue, with 44.9 billion rubles processed through such channels in 2023 alone. The platform aims to reduce this by blocking high-risk individuals from accessing banking services at the outset. However, Shablya emphasized balancing security measures with citizens’ rights to avoid unnecessary disruption for legitimate account holders. How the Platform Will Operate and Industry Reactions The surveillance platform will compile information on suspicious transactions and distribute this data to participating banks. While the Central Bank will provide initial assessments, individual banks will decide to block or restrict services. The goal is to create a more synchronized approach to financial monitoring by ensuring that droppers cannot circumvent restrictions by shifting to smaller or less vigilant institutions. Banks such as Sber, VTB, and Post Bank have supported the initiative. Representatives from Sber noted that large banks with robust compliance frameworks can already detect suspicious activity. However, smaller institutions often lack the resources to identify and mitigate risks effectively. Critics of the platform have raised concerns about false positives and the long-term impact on individuals misidentified as droppers, similar to Shablya’s concerns. However, the Central Bank has acknowledged this issue and called for a rehabilitation process that allows flagged individuals to contest their status and regain access to financial services over time. Measures are said to be implemented to ensure that affected individuals are not left entirely excluded from the financial system. The development is ongoing, and no specific launch timeline has been announced. Russia’s stance on crypto regulations is getting tightened. A recent report shows that Russia is set to ban mining activities in 10 regions starting in January 2025. The Russian government has approved a decree banning cryptocurrency mining in 10 regions from January 1, 2025, according to TASS. #CryptoMining #Russia https://t.co/CIaaIZFypk — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 24, 2024 The post Russia’s Central Bank Develops New Surveillance Platform to Target Illegal Crypto OTC Services: Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/russias-central-bank-develops-new-surveillance-platform-to-target-illegal-crypto-otc-services-report/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38096742.jpeg

Best and Worst Performing Crypto Stocks of 2024: MicroStrategy and Core Scientific Lead the Gains These developments have fueled optimism and volatility in crypto markets and have significantly impacted crypto-related stocks.

38096484,https://coinpaprika.com/news/russia-imposes-6-year-crypto-mining-ban,1735129095,Russia Imposes 6-Year Crypto Mining Ban,"Russia is tightening its grip on cryptocurrency mining with a 6-year ban in 10 regions starting January 2025 and lasting until March 2031. This move comes as part of a broader strategy to balance energy consumption and ensure grid stability amid rising demand. Seasonal restrictions will also apply in other areas, highlighting the government's cautious approach to regulating the sector. The regions facing an outright ban include Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, Chechnya, Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Meanwhile, in regions like Irkutsk, Buryatia, and the Trans-Baikal Territory, crypto mining will be paused during peak energy seasons: from January 1 to March 15, 2025, and annually from November 15 to March 15 thereafter. According to TASS, Russia’s state news agency, these restrictions are not set in stone and could change depending on the decisions made by the government’s legal committee overseeing energy policies. The aim is to balance electricity usage across regions, preventing energy shortages while maintaining economic stability. Sergei Kolobanov, Deputy Director of the Center for Economics of the Fuel and Energy Complex at CSR, explained that electricity subsidies play a significant role in this decision. In regions with low-cost energy, producers and consumers in other areas often shoulder the financial burden. Kolobanov suggests that if the energy market becomes more liberalized and capacity increases, some restrictions might eventually be lifted. Russia’s share in global Bitcoin mining hashrate has dropped significantly over the years. In 2021, Russia accounted for 11% of the global hashrate, but by 2024, this figure had fallen to 4.7% . Data from Cambridge University also reveals a decline in Russia’s average monthly hashrate, falling from 13.6 Eh/s to 8.7 Eh/s. In contrast, the United States dominates with a 37.8% share of the global Bitcoin mining hashrate. Despite legalizing cryptocurrency mining in August 2023, Russia has struggled to see meaningful growth in the sector. The government’s energy concerns and regional restrictions have acted as significant roadblocks. However, Russia has shown increasing openness to cryptocurrency usage in other areas. Cross-border crypto payments are now permitted, and plans are underway to launch state-backed cryptocurrency exchanges . Additionally, Russian lawmakers have floated the idea of holding Bitcoin reserves to strengthen financial stability amid international sanctions and economic challenges. While the regulatory environment remains complex, these developments indicate Russia’s evolving stance toward integrating cryptocurrencies into its financial system.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/russia-imposes-6-year-crypto-mining-ban,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38096484.jpeg
38103275,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106419,1735129063,Solana Eyes $200 Breakout: Is a Parabolic Run to $263 Imminent?,"Is Solana (SOL) ready for a bull run to its all-time high with an emerging breakout event for 2025? With Bitcoin rebounding significantly in the last 24 hours, the altcoin segment is gaining momentum. Amid improving conditions for altcoins, Solana's market price has increased by 2.17% over the past 24 hours. Despite negative returns over the past 7 and 13 days, Solana maintains a market cap of $94 billion. As it slips under BNB coin to occupy the sixth-largest cryptocurrency spot, Solana is approaching the psychological $200 mark, signaling the potential for a new breakout rally.SOL Price AnalysisIn the 4-hour chart, Solana's price trend showcases a bearish influence. However, the underlying support indicates several technical signals pointing to a potential reversal rally. For instance, it shows a descending broadening wedge pattern, typically considered bullish, increasing the likelihood of a breakout. Solana Price Chart The price trend within the pattern suggests a bullish reversal from the support trend line. Additionally, the reversal forms an Adam and Eve pattern with a neckline near the $198 level.Slightly below the $200 psychological mark, a breakout above the neckline could trigger an explosive parabolic rally. Furthermore, the recovery has surpassed the 50-EMA line and the 23.6% Fibonacci level at $196.36.During the recovery, the 4-hour RSI has remained above the 50% level, indicating increased buying pressure. Moreover, sustained support above the 50-EMA line on the 4-hour chart enhances the chances of an uptrend continuation.As a result, the technical indicators are gradually signaling a buying opportunity for Solana in the short term.Solana Price TargetsThe technical patterns and the recovery rally suggest that Solana could rise to test the overhead resistance near $215. Optimistically, a bullish breakout from the broadening wedge pattern could propel the uptrend to $263 by January 2025.Looking further ahead, with a broader market recovery in Q1 2025, the Fibonacci levels suggest a new all-time high (ATH) target at $286.85. On the other hand, if the bullish rally fails to reclaim the $200 mark, Solana may retest the 20-EMA line at $192.58.",POSITIVE,SOL | BNB,ALTCOIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/25/solana-eyes-200-breakout-is-a-parabolic-run-to-263-imminent/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=solana-eyes-200-breakout-is-a-parabolic-run-to-263-imminent,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

By late 2024, the number of crypto investors surged to 15.59 million , marking a record in the country’s history. This rapid growth highlights the increasing prominence of digital assets in South Korea’s financial landscape. In November, the daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies hit $10.5 billion, rivaling the combined activity of the KOSPI and KOSDAQ stock markets. The data, sourced from the country’s five largest cryptocurrency exchanges—Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax—demonstrates the growing significance of digital assets. The government, in response, may need to focus on creating a safer trading environment, protecting investor rights, and stabilizing the market. Representative Lim Gwang-hyun of the Democratic Party, who serves on the National Assembly’s Finance and Planning Committee, revealed data from the Bank of Korea showing a sharp rise in crypto investors. The 15.59 million investors account for 30% of South Korea’s population , which stands at approximately 51.23 million. In just one month, between October and November, the investor count grew by 610,000. The total value of digital assets held by South Korean investors soared to $70.3 billion (102.6 trillion KRW) by late November, compared to $39.7 billion (58 trillion KRW) in October. Meanwhile, funds deposited on exchanges, awaiting investment, rose from $3.2 billion (4.7 trillion KRW) in October to $6.03 billion (8.8 trillion KRW) by November’s end. The surge in trading activity was driven largely by altcoins, which now account for 88% of trades. Upbit, South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, dominates the market with an impressive 90% share. Upbit’s market dominance, which grew significantly between 2020 and 2021, remains strong today. Despite the impressive growth, South Korea’s crypto market continues to face challenges. The announcement of martial law by President Yoon Suk Yeol earlier this year, though later revoked, caused some disruption. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty and market volatility remain persistent issues. Policymakers are under increasing pressure to address these hurdles as the scale of cryptocurrency trading grows closer to that of traditional stock markets. The remarkable rise of digital assets in South Korea highlights their potential to transform the financial system, but it also underscores the urgent need for effective regulation and investor protection measures.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/over-30-of-south-koreans-now-invest-in-crypto,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38096277.jpeg

It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. BONK surged over 100% after a Coinbase listing. It serves as a community coin, airdropping 50% of its supply to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants. As of mid-December 2023, BONK was the third-largest memecoin by market cap. Its growth includes integration into the Solana ecosystem and the launch of BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange. The coin’s potential lies in its community-driven approach and involvement in a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications. In the current market cycle, BONK stands out as a notable player in the cryptocurrency space. PEPE Coin: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum network, drawing inspiration from the popular Pepe the Frog meme of the early 2000s. It seeks to replicate the success of memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin by eliminating transaction taxes and embracing its identity as a pure memecoin without utility. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market capitalization of $1.6 billion, igniting enthusiasm among crypto enthusiasts and fostering a vibrant community. The coin’s roadmap includes phases aimed at boosting visibility and adoption through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. PEPE features a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, operating as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake network. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by Ryoshi, it started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated a large amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB’s prominence. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can interact with Ethereum applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a community governance system, giving SHIB potential for broader use. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s developments and Ethereum compatibility may make it an attractive option. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Rise of a Fun and Plentiful Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. It features a Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially considered a “memecoin,” it gained significant value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This growth was influenced by social media attention and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s community-driven nature and widespread popularity demonstrate the impact of social media on financial markets. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin’s accessibility and strong community support may make it an attractive option for some investors. Conclusion While BONK, PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE may have less potential in the short term, DOGEN stands out as a promising choice. Designed for those who seek excellence, DOGEN embodies luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and potential for massive returns, it’s building a community of leaders with real benefits for early adopters.

Cardano network sees declining active addresses and whale transactions. A drop below $0.87 could target $0.77, while $1.00 remains critical for recovery. Cardano (ADA) remains stuck in a bearish phase, trading within a narrow range of $0.87 to $1.00. Weak investor sentiment and declining market activity continue to weigh on its recovery prospects, keeping the price below the psychologically important $1 level. The altcoin’s struggles began after a sharp decline, and its inability to regain momentum has left investors cautious. Daily Active Addresses (DAA), which reflect blockchain activity, highlight diminishing buying pressure, further stalling ADA’s potential rebound. Declining Market Activity and Bearish Momentum Cardano’s DAA divergence is currently flashing bearish signals, with fewer participants interacting with its blockchain.

38095706,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376123,1735127569,ZachXBT Exposes $500K Scheme Targeting Solana Meme Coin Investors on X,"Blockchain investigator ZachXBT has exposed a sophisticated phishing operation that has managed to compromise over 15 X accounts. The scheme targeted investors in Solana-based meme coins and has resulted in an estimated loss of $500,000. Solana Meme Coin Fraud The Blockchain detective revealed in a December 24 social media post that the operation involved impersonating the X team and leveraging phishing websites to gain unauthorized access to high-profile accounts. The attackers used fake copyright infringement notices to create a sense of urgency, tricking account holders into visiting phishing websites. These sites prompted users to reset their two-factor authentication (2FA) or passwords. Once credentials were obtained, the hackers used the compromised accounts to push scams targeting meme coin enthusiasts. Each compromised account shared a specific contract address tied to fraudulent Solana tokens, urging followers to invest using SOL. Posts often featured the caption “Incoming Transmission,” followed by a token announcement and contract details. The cybercriminals also attempted to obscure their operations by bridging stolen funds between the Solana and Ethereum networks. However, ZachXBT’s investigation uncovered that all the hacked accounts were linked through six deployer addresses used for the scams. The scheme exploited the trust and large audiences of crypto-focused accounts, many of which had over 200,000 followers. Prominent ones affected included Kick, Cursor, The Arena, Brett, and Alex Blania, with the first reported incident occurring on November 26 involving RuneMine, while the most recent was Kick on December 24. Growing Threats to Social Media Platforms This attack is not an isolated incident but part of a broader social media platform exploitation trend by threat actors. X, a hub for crypto projects and creators, has increasingly been targeted for its prominence within the community. In a similar investigation in November, ZachXBT exposed several account takeovers on X and Instagram, which fueled pump-and-dump schemes tied to meme coins. Victims reportedly lost over $3.5 million during this spree, which began in August 2024. The pattern of these attacks remains consistent: accounts are breached, fraudulent tokens are promoted, and the proceeds are funneled into anonymous wallets. Notable examples include the hacking of Symbiotic’s X account in October, where phishing links disguised as airdrop checklists led to tokens being stolen. EigenLayer’s account was hijacked that month to promote a fake airdrop campaign. Truth Terminal AI founder Andy Ayrey’s account was also used to promote fraudulent meme coins, netting the hacker $1.5 million. Following the latest incident, the on-chain sleuth has advised users to increase their account security by limiting the reuse of email addresses across services and using security keys for 2FA whenever possible.

The king crypto Bitcoin went up from $94K to $99K which is seen as a “ Santa Claus rally ,” but it could also be a profit-taking shift. BTC is currently holding above $98K , but traders are cautious as year-end expiry approaches. In the meanwhile, current savior ETFs are also taking a toll by losing $1.4B within 4 days. ETFs in January this year have given an instant boost to the dull market however the assets lost their charm mid-way but analysts are positive that they will revive soon. With ETH ETF inflow, is the market showing signs of an early altcoin rally? Let’s dive in! US Spot BTC ETFs Are Bleeding BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), saw a record outflow of $188.7 million on Christmas Eve, marking its largest single-day outflow. This was part of a larger trend, with Bitcoin funds losing $1.5 billion over four days (Dec. 19–24). Other Bitcoin ETFs, including those from Fidelity and ARK 21Shares, also saw significant outflows, while Bitwise Bitcoin ETFs were the only ones to record an inflow. Altcoins Take the Lead In the meanwhile ETH ETFs are moving slowly and steadily with rising traders’ interest in altcoins , with Bitcoin’s role in the market weakening slightly. In the downtrend, Ether funds saw $53.6 million in inflows, followed by a $130.8 million inflow the previous day. Despite a slow start this year, analysts speculate that Ether may outperform Bitcoin in January 2025 , as the ETH/BTC ratio shows strength. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Angel Investor Warn Against MicroStrategy Buying Too Much Bitcoin , What’s Next for Bitcoin?

He suggests that large market entities might be strategically positioning for higher prices into the new year. $BTC Market Flow Update $BTC Binance Spot So far this previous post has pretty much played out Furthermore market has seemingly found it's demand zone around $94K & lower ~ would like to see this demand moving higher with price From here it's more seeing what the passive flow… https://t.co/CiTPpslOO8 pic.twitter.com/ahiWqsBJnu — Skew Δ (@52kskew) December 25, 2024 Bitcoin’s price recently jumped 4% to $98,014, though trading volume has decreased by 24%, signaling reduced interest. Traders are advised to monitor volume and sentiment, with significant BTC options expiring this Friday, adding another layer of uncertainty to the market. The shift in investor focus suggests that Bitcoin’s dominance may soon be tested—only time will tell which way the market will blow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The ChatGPT maker is considering building human-like robots which could be a major coup in artificial intelligence-powered robotics. However, this development comes after Elon Musk’s Tesla recently showcased its Optimus robots. The AI giant used to operate a robotics division when it first appeared on the scene. However, it scrapped it in 2021. Co-founder Wojciech Zaremba stated that the division was closed due to a lack of training data for advancing intelligence systems. Times have changed for the IOT world after several major breakthroughs in AI systems and hardware over the last few years. OpenAI’s robotic comeback OpenAI is playing catch-up in a competitive space dominated by players like Boston Dynamics and Tesla. It has invested in robotics startups like Figure AI, 1X Technologies, and Physical Intelligence. After bagging positive results in the AI sector, the company seems to be focusing on integrating GPT models into robots. According to the report , OpenAI is discussing humanoid robot development. While no roadmap has been confirmed so far, the company recently posted job listings for robotics research. It is looking for engineers to train multimodal AI models to “unlock new capabilities” for partner robots. If the AI giant builds its own humanoid robots, it will enter a fiercely competitive arena. Tesla’s Optimus and Boston Dynamics’ bots are already making waves. Earlier, OpenAI rolled out its ChatGPT Search feature to all free users, enabling real-time web data fetching. Initially available to paid subscribers, it lets ChatGPT access live information by tapping a globe icon, making it more interactive and up-to-date. It is also adding maps and a “Search with Advanced Voice” feature Elon Musk’s vision for Optimus At the We, Robot event, Tesla stole the show not once but twice. First, it showcased the futuristic Cybercab, and second, with an update on the Optimus humanoid robot. Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous taxi with no steering wheel and no pedals is expected to start production in 2026. Elon Musk also made the ambitious promise of cheaper rides than mass transit. Tesla’s Optimus turned out to be the showstopper of the event. Elon Musk even said, “It can do anything.” Babysit, mow your lawn, walk your dog, even serve drinks. “The Optimus will walk amongst you,” he declared. Priced between $20K-$30K, Tesla’s CEO claims that Optimus will be the “most significant product ever created.” He even thinks all 8 billion humans will want one. Optimus Gen 2 was introduced in December 2023 and it looked like it has evolved fast. The robot is able to fold shirts, walk better, and have tactile sensors for precise tasks. Meanwhile, Tesla first teased the Optimus concept back in 2021 during AI Day. Fast forward, and Gen 2 is showcasing real progress, from folding clothes to watering plants. It’s not just sci-fi anymore.

All six will start operations on the same day, Dec. 31, a condition imposed by the regulator, Calcalist said. Final approval for the funds was granted last week.

One of the funds will be actively managed, trying to beat bitcon's performance.

Solaxy’s native token, $SOLX, has seen a remarkable presale success, raising over $5.34 million in a short period. This layer-two solution for the Solana blockchain promises to solve scalability issues by providing zero congestion, errors, and delays — addressing the ongoing congestion Solana has faced. As interest grows in meme coins and the Solana ecosystem, Solaxy’s innovative solution could offer the scalability needed for the network’s future growth. With the presale ending soon, the strong capital raise suggests substantial demand for $SOLX once it hits decentralized exchanges (DEXs). n addition to the excitement around the presale, the early success of Solaxy could also lead to potential listings on major centralized exchanges (CEXs), further boosting its prospects. To purchase $SOLX , simply visit the Solaxy website, connect your wallet, and make a purchase using ETH, USDT, or BNB. Alternatively, you can pay with a bank card.

This reflects the platform’s focus on institutional clients outside the US, where Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the most sought-after assets.

This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-fuks-santa-muskfsan-solana-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

These transactions allow users to unlock rewards and level up faster, and many users have been known to spend high amounts on these achievements. This teenager is not the first to spend a big chunk of money on Monopoly GO. Previously, another user also reported spending $1,000 on the game before removing it. However, even that case is only a small fraction of what this teenager spent recently on the free-to-play game, as discovered by the parents. Deleted Reddit comment of a parent complaining about their child’s Monopoly GO in-app spending. Source: Reddit In a deleted Reddit post, the parent of a 17-year-old shared that their daughter had spent $25,000 without consent on over 368 purchases in Monopoly GO through the App Store. The parent seemed concerned and looking to find “who to write to” and was hoping for a return. The comment section didn’t bring any good news for the parents, as Monopoly GO’s terms and conditions hold the user responsible for any payment made, whether intentional or not. Monopoly GO and other games raise revenue through micro-transactions Free-to-play games can earn profit through small transactions.

Source: PocketGamer Back in 2023, an NBA 2K player also filed a lawsuit against Take-Two Interactive for its microtransaction strategy . The recent Monopoly GO case by the teenager won’t reach any positive conclusion, especially one that the parent receives any returns on the unauthorized transactions. However, it does raise concerns about the nature of in-app spending, especially in games that underaged players can access. It’s not difficult to understand why the gaming industry prefers this model, as it generates high revenues for the publishers. For example, Diablo 4 brought in 150 million from player micro-transactions. The information is publicly shared in the LinkedIn profile of the game’s Senior Product Manager. He detailed his work on Diablo 4 monetization, which includes bundles and discounts that reportedly brought in $150 million. It also works because players tend to consent to smaller payments more easily, which eventually becomes a regular expense. Still, gamers consider micro-transactions within apps misleading and often criticize them.

38098182,https://invezz.com/?p=2404655,1735126257,The Donald Trump effect? 30% South Koreans now invested in crypto,"South Koreans are riding the cryptocurrency wave, with the country seeing a surge in adoption following the victory of incoming United States President Donald Trump. Local media outlet Yonhap News reports a rise in cryptocurrency users, now accounting for over 30% of the roughly 51.23 million people living in South Korea. Bank of Korea data publicised by the Democratic Party of Korea Representative Lim Kwang-Hyun indicate that the total number of crypto users went up by 610,000, bringing the total number of such individuals to 15.6 million by the end of November. This report marks the first time the central bank has disclosed crypto-related data. The metrics show an uptick in both investors and the funds invested since July. The Donald Trump effect 14.74 million held 58.6 trillion won (approximately $41.4 billion) worth of digital assets in July, with the investment amount almost doubling to 102.6 trillion won (around $72.5 billion) in November, right after Trump secured his return to the White House. On Nov. 5, Trump clinched the US presidential election, solidifying hopes of a crypto-friendly administration in Washington. The crypto market has rallied in response post-election, while the President-elect has continued to appoint pro-crypto allies to key positions. However, South Koreans seemed to have been prepping for this surge ever since Trump began his campaign, with the market consistently onboarding roughly 100,000 new virtual asset investors every month since July, the report noted. Further, it added that trading volumes, which were mostly concentrated across five of the country’s top domestic exchanges, had reached levels that challenged the stock market. The average daily trading volume on domestic exchanges hit a staggering 14.9 trillion won, matching the combined totals of the KOSPI (9.92 trillion won) and KOSDAQ (6.97 trillion won) markets. Commenting on the rapid growth of the virtual asset market, Lim Kwang-Hyun said: Thorough preparations are needed at a government-wide level to enhance the stability of the virtual asset market and establish sound trading practices that protect users’ rights and interests. Regulating the crypto sector South Korea has tightened its grip over the crypto sector this year with the introduction of regulations aimed at enhancing user protection and mitigating illicit activities. Specifically, exchanges, which form the backbone of any crypto economy, are monitored under the Virtual Asset User Protection Act . The regulation came into effect on July 19 and requires exchanges to implement measures such as holding at least 80% of users’ assets in cold storage and segregation of customer funds from company assets. Service providers are also required to report suspicious transactions and assess listed cryptocurrencies to maintain a healthy market environment. Meanwhile, exchanges are also subject to periodic evaluations conducted by the Financial Supervisory Service. However, the nation has yet to finalise its taxation laws for the sector. A draft regulation on the matter has been repeatedly delayed and is now set for a 2027 implementation. The law proposes taxing crypto gains at 20%. Several key regulations are still in the pipeline regarding the ban on initial coin offerings, permitting real-name accounts for crypto trading, letting local companies hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets, approving a Bitcoin spot ETF, and regulations for securities token offerings.

38095082,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667023,1735126229,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern Says ETH Will Touch $12,000","The Ethereum price is showing signs of a breakout, as an analyst has identified the formation of an inverse head and shoulder pattern on its 6-month long-term price chart. This bullish formation has fueled predictions that Ethereum could rally to $12,000 soon, marking a new all-time high for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ethereum Price Targets $12 With New Chart Pattern In a Tuesday X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst Tony Severino released an Ethereum price chart illustrating an inverse head and shoulder, a technical analysis indicator signaling a potential trend reversal. This distinctive chart pattern has four key components: a left shoulder, head, right shoulder, and neckline. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 Typically, when the pattern is completely formed, and a cryptocurrency breaks through the neckline, it indicates a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. In Ethereum’s case, its price has been on a significant downward trajectory, declining by over 8% in the past week. Despite dropping from a price high of over $4,000 to below $3,500 recently, Severino remains optimistic about Ethereum’s potential for a trend reversal, predicting a bullish price target of $12,000 for the top altcoin. Examining the analyst’s price chart, the left shoulder of the inverse head and shoulder was formed in 2021, while the head emerged during Ethereum’s price crash at the end of 2022, marking the lowest point in the pattern. Additionally, the right shoulder of the inverse head and shoulder pattern is complete, with Ethereum recently testing the neckline — a key resistance level by a horizontal trendline. At the time, Ethereum broke above $3,400, confirming the bullish trend reversal often associated with this chart pattern. Looking at the price chart, the distance between the head and the neckline measures approximately 265.84%, suggesting that Ethereum could rally between $10,000 and $12,000 if the pattern plays out as expected. The upward-sloping channel of the inverse head and shoulder further supports this bullish trend outlook, with Severino’s Ethereum price target likely aligning with the channel’s trajectory. Ethereum Whale Accumulation Trend Skyrockets While the Ethereum price is trading at $3,493 after surging by 2.3% in the past 24 hours, an analyst known as ‘Mister Crypto’ revealed that whales have been on a major buying spree. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Can Recover To $107,000 Again If This Important Level Is Broken The analyst shared a chart illustrating Ethereum’s balance on accumulation addresses. He disclosed that Ethereum whales are purchasing ETH tokens exponentially, steadily increasing their holdings since 2017. The sharp rise in accumulation suggests that investors are potentially positioning themselves ahead of a bullish price action. The red arrow in the analyst’s chart also shows a major spike in the ETH balance on accumulation addresses in recent months. Most wallets associated with this surging accumulation have seen minor outflows, signaling long-term holding behavior by investors.

While this regulation was published in the official gazette today, new obligations were imposed on cryptocurrency exchanges. Accordingly, exchanges will now have to constantly monitor their transactions and customers. In addition, controls on cryptocurrency transfers have been increased and exchanges have been required to verify their identities for transactions of 15 thousand TL and above. Accordingly, comprehensive identity verification has been made mandatory for cryptocurrency transfers exceeding 15 thousand TL. In this context, the sender will have to present their name, surname, trade registry information, wallet address, and citizenship or passport number. In transfers between exchanges, if the exchange receiving the transaction cannot confirm the sender's information, it may categorize the crypto transfer as risky and send it back. “If sufficient information cannot be obtained, consideration will be given to not performing the transfer, limiting transactions with the financial institution in question, or terminating the business relationship.” It was stated that the new regulation aims to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.

38094311,https://finbold.com/?p=222865,1735124696,4 altcoins to buy under $1 at the start of 2025,"As Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to dominate headlines with its record-breaking surge, up 46% since November’s election and 133% year-to-date, attention is shifting to altcoins that offer high potential at a lower price point. While Bitcoin sets the pace for the market, cryptocurrencies like Stellar ( XLM ), Hedera ( HBAR ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and Algorand ( ALGO ) are carving out their niches with their use cases and growing adoption. Trading under $1, these altcoins stand out for their partnerships and growing utility making them intriguing prospects for investors looking to diversify in 2025. STELLAR (XLM) Stellar Lumens is gaining recognition as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies under $1, strengthened by institutional backing and its role in cross-border payments. Grayscale Investments LLC’s Stellar Lumens Trust recently posted a 10% increase in net assets for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. This growth, linked to the addition of 34,875,230 XLM tokens valued at $3,923, has reignited interest in Stellar, driving a recent price spike. Founded by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, Stellar has established itself as a key solution for global money transfers, strengthened by partnerships with platforms like Félix and Bitso, which shows its real-world utility. Stellar’s price movements have historically mirrored Ripple ( XRP ), offering another layer of potential upside. Ripple’s latest development, including the RLUSD launch, has analysts forecasting a bullish trajectory, with some suggesting XRP could reach $5 or higher. Given their overlapping use cases in cross-border payments, Stellar appears well-positioned to capitalize on Ripple’s momentum. XLM one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently priced at $0.39, Stellar has faced a 28% decline over the past month but boasts a 199% year-to-date (YTD) gain, highlighting its potential for significant returns. With strong institutional support, strategic partnerships, and robust fundamentals, Stellar stands out as a cryptocurrency to watch closely as 2025 approaches. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera (HBAR) has strengthened its position in the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) space through a partnership with Chainlink ( LINK ). The collaboration integrates Chainlink’s Data Feeds and Proof of Reserve mechanisms into Hedera, allowing developers to access tamper-proof market data critical for building decentralized applications and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This initiative addresses long-standing risks, such as data manipulation, while enhancing liquidity and risk management across DeFi platforms, thereby boosting Hedera’s utility. HBAR one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently trading at $0.31, HBAR has achieved a one-month gain of 113% and a year-to-date increase of 261%, reflecting growing market confidence. Adding to its appeal, Bloomberg analysts have identified Hedera as a strong candidate for ETF approval, citing its regulatory compliance and classification outside the realm of securities. The potential departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the possible appointment of pro-crypto Paul Atkins could further ease regulatory pathways for digital assets like HBAR. With a combination of technological advancements and the prospect of ETF inclusion, Hedera is positioning itself as a leading asset for investors seeking high-growth opportunities in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) DOGE continues to capture attention as one of the most volatile yet intriguing cryptocurrencies, bolstered by its cultural significance and recent political ties. The incoming Trump administration, widely considered the most crypto-friendly in U.S. history, has sparked renewed interest in Dogecoin. With Elon Musk, a long-time advocate of the token, now heading the newly established “Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E.), Dogecoin has found itself indirectly linked to significant political narratives. While the agency’s primary focus is reducing government spending, the indirect connection to Dogecoin has further fueled speculation in the meme coin market. DOGE one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently trading at $0.33, Dogecoin has seen a one-month decline of 23%, reflecting its notorious volatility. However, it remains up an impressive 271% year-to-date, highlighting its ability to deliver substantial short-term gains. While its price movements often defy conventional market logic, investors should approach it cautiously. The potential for another speculative rally exists, especially under a pro-crypto administration, but the token’s history suggests that such gains may be short-lived. As a result, Dogecoin represents both an opportunity and a risk, making it a speculative bet for 2025 rather than a stable investment. Algorand (ALGO) Algorand is increasingly becoming a cryptocurrency to watch for 2025 due to its growing presence in DeFi and non-fungible token ( NFT ) applications. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in Algorand’s ecosystem rose significantly from $117 million in November to $160 million as of December 24, showcasing its expanding utility and adoption in blockchain-based solutions. Currently trading at $0.39, Algorand has recorded a 33% gain over the past month and a 73% increase year-to-date. These gains highlight strong market interest and confidence in its long-term potential. ALGO one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Derivatives data from CoinGlass also supports Algorand’s momentum, with open interest increasing by 0.92% to $96.11 million, indicating growing activity in futures and options markets. Additionally, the weighted funding rate, long/short ratios, and rekt statistics suggest heightened trading interest, reflecting broader optimism for the asset. These factors position ALGO as a key cryptocurrency for investors to monitor as the digital asset space evolves in 2025. While these altcoins come with varying degrees of risk, their potential to leverage market trends and ecosystem partnerships positions them as strong candidates for investors seeking diversification and higher returns in 2025. However, it is important to note that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and prices can fluctuate unpredictably.

While Cardano (ADA) targets a price of $3 and Ethereum (ETH) eyes an ambitious $5,000, the real buzz surrounds Lightchain AI (LCAI) and its groundbreaking presale. With projections of an astonishing 25,305% return by 2025, the Lightchain AI Presale is capturing attention like never before. Each of these coins offers unique value propositions: Cardano’s methodical development, Ethereum’s dominance in smart contracts, and LCAI’s game-changing fusion of AI and blockchain. The big question remains Which one will deliver the highest returns in the coming years? Cardano (ADA) Aiming for Sustainable Growth to $3 Cardano has got its name by hard work, checked by others and a steady plan that focuses on growth, working together, and lasting change. Its Proof of Stake way of agreeing makes energy use good and cuts down costs for deals more than old leaders like Bitcoin. With coming Hydra growth fixes, Cardano may boost flow a lot, making DeFi and NFT uses easier for more folks to get. Also, its strong system growth, helped by a loyal group and smart links, pushes steady ADA use, adding to slow but real price rise. While a $3 goal for ADA may not be as striking as LCAI’s guesses, Cardano’s careful steps give a steady, low-risk choic͏e that attracts more cautious investors. Ethereum (ETH) Pushing the Boundaries Toward $5,000 Ethereum remains the leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols. Its transition to Proof of Stake has significantly improved energy efficiency, while Layer-2 solutions and The Merge upgrades are addressing network congestion and high fees. Ethereum’s dominance in the DeFi space ensures sustained demand for ETH, as it hosts the majority of these platforms. Additionally, its versatility—ranging from NFTs to enterprise solutions—continues to drive long-term growth. While reaching $5,000 would be a major milestone, Ethereum faces tough competition from newer, faster blockchains and must continue to innovate to maintain its position at the forefront of the industry. Lightchain AI (LCAI) AI-Driven Challenger Targeting 25,305% Returns Lightchain AI (LCAI) arrives on the scene with a bold vision integrating artificial intelligence directly into its blockchain architecture. Priced at just $0.003 in its presale, LCAI aims to revolutionize decentralized applications by enabling developers to deploy AI-powered dApps through the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Why LCAI’s Potential Is So Explosive Transparent AI Framework This framework ensures that all AI decision-making processes within the platform are fully transparent and auditable, fostering confidence among users and developers. Decentralized Governance Integration Lightchain AI incorporates decentralized governance with AI capabilities to enable more intelligent, community-driven decision-making. Scalability and Efficiency The platform’s architecture is built for high scalability, allowing it to efficiently handle large volumes of transactions and AI computations, making it adaptable to a wide range of industries. Privacy and Security Lightchain AI prioritizes data privacy and security, ensuring that AI computations and data handling adhere to stringent privacy standards, which is particularly vital for industries such as healthcare and finance. With projections of a 25,305% increase by 2025 (potentially turning $300 into over $75,000), LCAI caters to those seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Evaluating the Options Stability vs. Innovation vs. Exponential Growth Deciding which token to back depends on an investor’s risk tolerance, time horizon, and belief in emerging technologies. Cardano (ADA) is ideal for those who prefer a slow-and-steady approach, focusing on moderate but consistent returns and a commitment to technological rigor. Ethereum (ETH) provides broad exposure to the well-established core of DeFi and NFTs, offering significant yet comparatively measured growth potential. On the other hand, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, appealing to early adopters looking to invest in a transformative project at ground-floor prices. Race to 2025 As we look toward 2025, the crypto landscape will likely look very different. Cardano may have solidified its position among top-tier chains, Ethereum may have cemented its dominance with $5,000 in sight, and Lightchain AI could prove to be the dark horse that outpaces both in terms of raw returns. While predictions must always be taken with caution, the fundamental trends—Cardano’s consistent development, Ethereum’s vast ecosystem, and LCAI’s pioneering integration of AI—will shape their future trajectories. For investors willing to mix stability, established dominance, and wild potential gains, these three coins offer a snapshot of where the crypto world might be headed in the next bull run.

If approved, FLOKI would be the only meme token other than dogecoin (DOGE) with an institutional product in Europe.  “We've been actively working with a respected Asset Manager and an ETP Issuer to launch a Floki ETP (Exchange-Traded Product) for quite a while now, and after months of due diligence and painstaking effort, we've been told that the Floki ETP is on track to go live in early Q1, 2025,” lead developer B told CoinDesk in a Telegram message on Wednesday.   The developers as seeking approval from the Floki DAO community to provide early liquidity to the product when it goes live. The vote runs for 48 hours and will end at 11:00 UTC on Dec. 27.  They are seeking approval to allocate part of the FLOKI required for the ETP from a treasury wallet that holds 16 billion tokens, worth just over $2.8 million at current prices. Tokens in that wallet were purchased from the open market over three years after the passage of another community vote.  If the proposal is approved, the FLOKI tokens would provide liquidity for the ETP while remaining Floki's property and could be withdrawn if there is enough third-party liquidity in the ETP.  “The Floki ETP is currently in an advanced stage and will become tradable on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Switzerland and the third-largest in Europe,” B said. “When it goes live, the Floki ETP will allow institutional investors, regulated entities and retail investors to get exposure to FLOKI in a regulated way.”  B said the team could not disclose further specifics about the ETP due to non-disclosure agreements, such as opening prices, fund structure and institutional partners.

Do Kwon , founder of Terraform Labs , has lost his appeal in Montenegro’s Constitutional Court, which he had filed to reconsider its decision on his extradition, the Korea JoongAng Daily has learned . The ruling means that Kwon’s case will now be decided by Montenegro’s justice minister, who will determine whether Kwon will be sent to the United States or South Korea for trial. Kwon is wanted in both countries. In the U.S., he faces charges related to the crash of his failed algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD ( USTC ) and token Luna ( LUNA ), in May 2022. In South Korea, he is also facing legal issues. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023, when he was trying to board a private flight to the UAE with fake documents.

38096735,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322583,1735123656,Meme Coins Were the “Most Popular” Crypto Narrative in 2024: CoinGecko,"Meme coins dominated the crypto landscape in 2024, capturing nearly a third of investor interest, according to a recent CoinGecko report . The study, which analyzed site traffic from January 1 to December 21, revealed that 31% of crypto-related searches centered around these highly speculative tokens. “The most popular crypto narrative in 2024 was by far the meme coin narrative,” Lim Yu Qian, a research analyst at CoinGecko, wrote. Main Meme Coin Narrative Accounted for 15% of Interest Among the various trends, the “main meme coin narrative” alone accounted for 15% of interest, a notable increase of over six percentage points from 2023. Solana-based meme coins followed closely as the fourth-largest category, with an 8% share of interest. Additionally, other meme coin-related trends, such as those tied to Coinbase’s Base blockchain and AI-themed meme coins , ranked among the top narratives, further solidifying the sector’s prominence. Despite their speculative nature and frequent association with scams, meme coins have drawn both criticism and admiration. While some traders have capitalized on their volatile price movements, others highlight the fleeting nature of these tokens’ popularity. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to lead the market with respective market caps of $49.3 billion and $13.8 billion, contributing to a combined memecoin market valuation of $113.2 billion. Interestingly, artificial intelligence (AI) tokens emerged as the second-most popular crypto narrative of the year, securing nearly 13% of interest. According to CoinGecko statistics, Meme Coins have become the most popular mainstream narrative among crypto investors in 2024, attracting nearly 31% of investors and accounting for approximately 15% of market traffic. pic.twitter.com/3chHAMkVrZ — News (@BuddyLuminous) December 25, 2024 AI narratives gained traction, particularly around AI agents—autonomous systems designed to perform tasks—which captured 1.17% of visitor interest. The potential of AI in the crypto space was showcased when the AI-operated X account “Truth Terminal” promoted the obscure memecoin GOAT, driving its market cap to $1.3 billion . While AI-related tokens now represent a $44.8 billion market led by Near Protocol (NEAR) and Internet Computer (ICP), they trail meme coins in capturing investor enthusiasm. The rapid rise of meme tokens this year underscores their enduring appeal, even in a broader market rally that saw Bitcoin gain 123% year-to-date. Other Emerging Trends: Real-World Assets and Solana The Real-World Assets (RWA) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) narratives gained significant traction in 2024, surpassing their popularity in 2023. The RWA narrative increased its share of investor interest by 2.16 percentage points to 8.64%, rising from 6th to 3rd place in popularity. Similarly, DePIN saw a 1.56 percentage point increase, climbing from 13th to 8th place. In contrast, the GameFi narrative experienced a sharp decline, with its share of interest dropping from 10.49% in 2023 to just 3.72% in 2024. Solana-related narratives continued to captivate investors, capturing a combined 14.30% share of interest, placing it just behind AI-focused narratives. While Solana meme coins accounted for nearly half of this attention, the broader Solana ecosystem also gained momentum, ranking as the 5th most popular narrative with a 5.78% share. Base, another emerging blockchain ecosystem, saw its narratives enter the top 20 rankings, with Base ecosystem and Base meme coins together securing a 4.87% share of investor interest. Among the 67 blockchain ecosystems analyzed, five made it to the top 20 crypto narratives of 2024, which included Ethereum (1.82% share), Solana, Base, Sui (1.04%), and TON (0.85%).

38093805,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633120,1735123301,Bank of Russia cracks down on crypto OTC services with new platform,"The Bank of Russia is developing a new centralized platform to identify and restrict cryptocurrency over-the-counter (OTC) trading. According to Bogdan Shablya, head of the Financial Monitoring and Currency Control Service at the central bank, the system will specifically target individuals who lend their bank accounts and cards for crypto-related transactions, pirate sites, drug shops, and online casinos, known as “droppers” or “mules.” As per media outlet RBC , the platform is the first coordinated attempt by Russian authorities to systematically identify and block crypto OTC trading at the banking level. While previous efforts focused on monitoring suspicious transactions within individual banks, this new system will create a unified database accessible to all Russian financial institutions. The move comes as Russian authorities estimate that cryptocurrency exchanges represent one of the largest segments using these informal banking networks. Targeting crypto OTC infrastructure The Bank of Russia’s new monitoring platform is a sophisticated approach to disrupting cryptocurrency trading networks. At its core, the system will create a centralized database that tracks individuals suspected of operating as cryptocurrency transaction facilitators. These “droppers” typically manage multiple bank accounts across different institutions to process OTC crypto trades, making them difficult to identify through traditional bank monitoring systems. The platform’s primary tech lies in its ability to share real-time information across all Russian banking institutions. When an individual attempts to open a new bank account, the system will automatically cross-reference their information against the central database of known crypto facilitators. Banks will receive immediate alerts about suspicious applicants, allowing them to take preventive action before accounts can be used for these transactions. According to Shablya, the current system has identified approximately 700,000 individuals involved in facilitating unofficial transactions. The platform aims to address a key weakness in existing controls, where traders could simply open new accounts at different banks after being flagged by one institution. The scale of drop operations The extent of illicit banking operations in Russia appears larger than previously estimated. According to the central bank’s data, approximately 10 million Russian citizens have made transfers to accounts identified as “dropper” cards. This is happening even though many of these individuals may be unaware they were participating in unofficial crypto transactions. While traditional suspicious banking activities through business accounts decreased to 5 billion rubles in the first nine months of 2024, transactions through individual “dropper” accounts reached 39 billion rubles in the same period. The current figure is a major increase from previous years, with the volume growing from 37 billion rubles in 2022 to 44.9 billion rubles in 2023. Bank officials note that crypto exchanges represent one of the primary drivers of this activity, alongside online gambling and other digital services. Implications for the Russian crypto market The introduction of this centralized monitoring platform is a major shift in how Russians will be able to access cryptocurrency markets. By targeting the banking infrastructure that supports OTC trading, the central bank expects to reduce unofficial crypto transactions while channeling digital asset trading through approved channels. The immediate impact will likely force a migration away from traditional bank-based OTC trading methods. As the platform makes it increasingly difficult to use personal bank accounts for crypto transactions, traders may need to explore alternative methods or shift toward officially sanctioned platforms. Looking ahead, the platform’s implementation could accelerate the development of Russia’s regulated cryptocurrency infrastructure. However, the ccentral bank maintains its cautious stance toward crypto.

Here Are the Top Two Projects!,"The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has reached a major milestone as the combined net deposits of Aave and Lido surpassed $70 billion for the first time. Aave and Lido Lead the DeFi Ecosystem, Surpassing $70 Billion in Total Net Deposits The two platforms are currently ranked as the top DeFi apps, holding 45.5% of total net deposits among the top 20 decentralized applications (dApps). Aave leads the pack with $34.3 billion in total net deposits, cementing its position as the leading lending and borrowing protocol in the DeFi space. Popular liquid staking platform Lido follows closely with $33.4 billion in total net deposits, driven by increasing demand for its staking services tied to Ethereum and other proof-of-stake blockchains. Together, these two platforms dominate the DeFi landscape and underscore the growing maturity and adoption of decentralized financial services. DeFi’s Growing Momentum The $70 billion total milestone reflects broader momentum in the DeFi ecosystem as users and institutional participants seek alternatives to traditional finance. The market share of Aave and Lido highlights their important roles in the industry: Aave is the leader in providing liquidity for lending, and Lido is key in staking efficiency and yield generation. With nearly half of the total net deposits of the top 20 dApps concentrated in Aave and Lido, the DeFi ecosystem is showing signs of consolidation around its strongest players. This concentration could lead to further innovation as these platforms expand their offerings to maintain their competitive advantage. This milestone also demonstrates the continued trust in decentralized platforms despite broader market volatility and points to a strong and growing interest in DeFi applications. As the industry continues to evolve, all eyes will be on how Aave, Lido, and their competitors will capitalize on this growth and shape the future of decentralized finance. *This is not investment advice.

38093228,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397748,1735122529,"Montenegro’s Top Court Rejects Do Kwon’s Appeal on Extradition, Likely To Go U.S.","The post Montenegro’s Top Court Rejects Do Kwon’s Appeal on Extradition, Likely To Go U.S. appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Montenegro’s Constitutional Court has rejected an appeal by Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, against his extradition ruling. This ruling solidifies the authority of the country’s Minister of Justice to decide Kwon’s fate—whether Kwon will be extradited to South Korea or the United States to face charges. Montenegro Court Rejects Dokwon Appeal The Constitutional Court ruled unanimously against Kwon’s appeal, which questioned the legality of an earlier decision by Montenegro’s Supreme Court. That ruling had nullified his transfer to South Korea, assigning the extradition decision to the justice minister. Kwon’s legal team argued the process was procedurally unfair, but the Constitutional Court found no violation of his rights to a fair trial or family life. Now, the power to decide Kwon’s extradition lies with Bojan Božović, Montenegro’s Justice Minister. Many believe that Montenegro may choose to extradite him to the U.S. rather than South Korea, as national interests could play a role in the decision. Dokwon To Be Extradited To U.S. Meanwhile, the recent court decision gives Montenegro’s Minister of Justice, Bojan Božović, the authority to decide where Do Kwon will be extradited. Reports suggest that officials in Montenegro may prefer sending Kwon to the United States rather than South Korea. Analysts believe this choice could be influenced by national interests. Kwon’s lawyers are likely to take more action to prevent his extradition to the U.S., which means it’s still unclear when and where he will be transferred. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Singapore Issues 13 Crypto Licenses in 2024, Surpassing Hong Kong’s Efforts , Background of Kwon’s Legal Troubles He was arrested in Montenegro last year for using a fake passport. In August, Montenegro’s highest court delayed an earlier decision to extradite Kwon to South Korea. This followed a ruling from a lower court, which had rejected a U.S. request for extradition, favoring South Korea instead. However, the Supreme Court later announced that Kwon’s extradition to South Korea was postponed until prosecutors resolved a legal request. The delay adds more uncertainty to the case, as both countries continue to pursue him for his alleged crimes. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38103273,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106396,1735121844,TRX Analysis: Will Tron Break Out for a Massive 2025 Rally?,"Will Tron (TRX) break past the short-term resistance trendline for an explosive end to 2024? With a bullish recovery in the crypto market, Tron's price action showcases a potential breakout rally ahead. It has seen a price jump of 22% over the past 30 days and the short-term correction hints at a massive reversal rally. Will the potential momentum surge from the falling channel pattern breakout drive Tron to a new all-time high? Let's find out.TRX Price AnalysisThe TRX price trend in the 4-hour chart showcases a falling channel pattern. With two parallel trend lines dictating Tron prices, the ongoing recovery marks a positive cycle within the channel. As TRX recovers, buyers are on the verge of challenging the resistance trend line to give a breakout rally. The recovery run has broken above the 200 EMA line and the $0.25 mark. Currently, Tron is trading at $0.2568, with an intraday gain of 1.94%. Furthermore, the recovery run has limited the chances of a death cross between the 50 and 200 EMA lines. Meanwhile, the 4-hour RSI line has exceeded the halfway level, signaling improved bullish momentum. Tron Stablecoin Supply Hits $62BAdding to the ecosystem's bullish narrative, TRON's stablecoin supply , led by USDT, stabilized at $62 billion. This reflects a balanced market and ecosystem maturity. While USDT maintained a consistent supply with minimal fluctuations, other stablecoins like USDC, USDD, TUSD, and USDJ showed steady growth, highlighting the network's stability and diversity. This suggests a mature market with fewer disruptions and stronger investor confidence. Tron Price TargetsIn case of a bullish breakout of the falling channel pattern, the TRX price trend will likely re-challenge its recently-formed 52-week high at $0.45. This reveals an upside potential of 75%. Meanwhile, for 2025 targets, the trend-based Fibonacci levels paint $0.54 as an optimistic target in January 2025. On the flip side, a bearish reversal within the falling channel pattern could retest the $0.2251 support level.",POSITIVE,TRX | USDT,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TRX | USDT,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/25/trx-analysis-will-tron-break-out-for-a-massive-2025-rally/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=trx-analysis-will-tron-break-out-for-a-massive-2025-rally,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
38092850,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314081,1735121755,"Everything Setting Up for Crypto Bull Market Top in 2025, Says Pantera Capital’s CEO – Here’s His Timeline","The CEO of digital assets-focused investment firm Pantera Capital is predicting that the crypto market’s bull cycle will peak in 2025. In a new interview on the Bankless podcast, Dan Morehead says that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price patterns continue to be based on the four-year halving cycle. A Bitcoin halving event is when miners’ block rewards are cut in half and, as a result, the supply is crunched. In the past, Bitcoin’s price has rallied before and after the halving events. The last halving event was in April. Using historic precedence, Morehead predicts that Bitcoin will hit a cycle peak in about seven months. “August of 2025 would be the peak. And man, everything’s kind of setting up for that. We’ve had this conversation every four years for 12 [years], so I know it sounds ridiculous to say, but at least we always forecast it moderating that the previous halving cycles were way bigger in amplitude. This one is smaller, but I still think it’s pretty real. That’s just the halving thing, but everything in the political and macro thing is setting up for it to be great for crypto too. So it’s hard not to be pretty bullish on 2025.” Morehead says the price target for Bitcoin’s cycle peak is $117,000, a more than 18% increase from its current value. “Our data is that the halving starts about 400 days before the actual halving, the impact, the low in the markets, and then the high is 480 days after it. It has done that each time. Two years ago, when Bitcoin was at $17,000, we forecast that it would hit $28,000 at the halving, and then $117,000 next August at 480 days after the halving.” Bitcoin is trading for $98,713 at time of writing, up 3.8% in the last 24 hours.

This week, Qubetics, Monero, and AAVE emerged as top contenders. From empowering blockchain developers and defending privacy to bullish momentum in DeFi, these projects represent the top crypto coins today . Qubetics: Empowering Blockchain Development Qubetics is revolutionising the blockchain ecosystem with its advanced I ntegrated Development Environment (IDE) , offering tools designed to simplify blockchain application creation for developers. The IDE features include: Drag-and-Drop Components : Simplify development by integrating pre-built functionalities like user authentication, token management, and data storage. Form-Based Configuration : Eliminate complex coding with intuitive forms that define application logic and smart contract parameters. Code Snippet Library : Leverage a repository of pre-written snippets to incorporate complex blockchain functionalities easily. Currently in Presale Phase 14, Qubetics offers $TICS tokens at $0.037, with over $7.7 million raised, 374 million tokens sold, and a growing base of 11,700+ holders. The presale structure, with weekly 10% price hikes, is culminating in a final phase 20% increase, making early investment particularly rewarding. Analysts predict a post-presale price of $0.25, offering an ROI potential of 563.81%, with long-term projections as high as $10 to $15 per token. Qubetics’ partnership with SWFT Blockchain further enhances its ecosystem with a cutting-edge wallet supporting multi-asset management, cross-chain functionality, and robust security. This collaboration positions Qubetics as a transformative force in the blockchain landscape. Monero: Privacy-Centric Resilience Monero (XMR) has demonstrated remarkable resilience amid regulatory scrutiny and exchange delistings, proving its dominance as a privacy-focused cryptocurrency. Recently, Kraken delisted Monero in compliance with MiCA regulations, but this hasn’t deterred its supporters. Monero’s price surged 5% to $160, marking a 15% rebound from monthly lows. Advocates of privacy coins like Monero continue to back its potential, even as the broader market faces increasing oversight. Technically, Monero shows signs of recovery, supported by its strong use case in private and secure transactions. As regulatory pressures mount, Monero’s consistent performance highlights its relevance in the crypto market, making it an attractive option for investors valuing privacy and resilience. AAVE: Poised for a Bullish Breakout AAVE, one of the leading DeFi tokens, shows strong signs of a bullish resurgence. The token recently emerged from a long-term bullish pattern and accumulated strength near a major resistance level. In the short term, AAVE has surpassed the critical resistance of $400, driven by a breakout from the Adam & Eve pattern that triggered a 10% price rise. While the stochastic RSI indicates oversold conditions and the MACD approaches a bearish crossover, a minor retracement below $370 could provide a launchpad for a strong rebound. Analysts predict AAVE could climb beyond $400, reaching $420 in the near term, potentially marking a new all-time high in early 2025. AAVE offers significant upside potential for traders and long-term investors, particularly as the DeFi space grows. Conclusion This week’s crypto market highlights the diverse potential of Qubetics, Monero, and AAVE. Qubetics leads with its innovative tools for blockchain development and a successful presale, attracting significant attention from developers and investors. Monero defies regulatory challenges, proving its resilience as a top privacy-centric cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, AAVE shows strong bullish momentum, positioning itself for new highs as 2025 approaches. Each project represents a unique facet of the crypto market, making them the top crypto coins to watch for growth, resilience, and innovation. Whether you’re a developer, privacy advocate, or DeFi enthusiast, these tokens offer compelling opportunities to engage with the future of blockchain technology.

Investor Joshua Jarrett’s lawsuit challenges the IRS’s classification of staking rewards as taxable income. Ripple CTO David Schwartz has weighed in on the growing debate over crypto staking and taxation following the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruling that staking rewards are taxable upon receipt. Commenting under a tweet regarding the IRS’s decision that crypto staking is taxable, Schwartz distinguished staking from traditional income amid community debate. He emphasized that staking involves creating new assets rather than receiving property from others. Staking vs. Dividends: Key Differences Critics, including Nido, argue that staking rewards are akin to earning interest on deposits or stock dividends. However, Schwartz countered that interest or dividends involve existing value, and staking generates entirely new tokens, making it a fundamentally different process. “Staking is creating property, not receiving it from someone else … The post Ripple CTO Differentiates Crypto Staking from Traditional Income Amid IRS Tax Ruling appeared first on Coin Edition .",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coin Edition,https://coinedition.com/ripple-cto-differentiates-crypto-staking-from-traditional-income-amid-irs-tax-ruling/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png

Having such a wide use case, the ADA price was believed to closely follow Bitcoin or at least Ethereum. Unfortunately, the price could reach a maximum of $3 and now is struggling to reclaim $1 after facing a notable rejection from highs at $1.327. The market participants remained pessimistic about the Cardano price rally and shifted their focus away from the token. Meanwhile, the current pullback offers a good entry point, as in the wider perspective, the ADA price rally is expected to climb more heights. The recent rise in the ADA price has attracted huge social sentiment as well. As per a social intelligence platform, Lunar Crush, Cardano’s social activity across the crypto markets is charging higher. As the price witnessed a rise of over 5%, social activity also increased by over 2.35%. However, the price is juggling around a pivotal support of around $0.92 as a rise beyond the range may revive a bullish hope for above $1. What’s next for the ADA price rally? Will it mark a new ATH in 2025? The historical price action of ADA suggests the token is reciprocating the previous pattern. The ADA price had formed a double-top pattern followed by a significant pullback, marking interim lows. A similar pattern has been observed at the start of the year, followed by a notable upswing similar to the previous one, suggesting a 7x to 10x run throughout 2025, marking a new ATH somewhere around $10. Apart from the chart pattern, the RSI is also displaying a similar trend as it is about to reenter the overbought zone, displaying a bullish divergence. On the other hand, the Gaussian channel has just flipped into green, suggesting the start of a bullish trend. Therefore, the Cardano (ADA) price is believed to remain consolidated for a few weeks, followed by a massive breakout to the ascending trend line, completing a massive parabolic curve.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/cardano-price-prediction-for-2025-here-are-the-bullish-bearish-scenarios-for-the-ada-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

As Bitcoin's price resurfaces above the $98,000 mark, its market cap is closing in on the $2 trillion valuation once again. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has increased by 4.56%, signaling a bullish recovery. Amid the BTC price surge, the crypto market is witnessing dramatic rebounds in altcoins, driving liquidations from shorts to $149.46 million. However, the total liquidation has reached $252.67 million, including $103.22 million worth of long-side liquidation.With the tables turning to favor the bulls, will Bitcoin reclaim the $100,000 barrier before 2025? BTC Price AnalysisIn the 4-hour chart, BTC's price action showcases a double-bottom reversal from the crucial support of the $93,000 level. As predicted in our previous article , BTC bounced back to surpass the $97,000 level with a morning star pattern on the daily chart. Currently, the double-bottom reversal in the 4-hour chart is testing the neckline at the $99,000 level. The bullish recovery has resulted in a positive crossover between the 20 and 200 EMA lines. Meanwhile, the current price action ranges between 50 and 100 EMAs in the 4-hour chart. Furthermore, the 4-hour RSI line has crossed above the halfway level, signaling a boost in buying pressure. Hence, the technical indicators are gradually turning bullish, increasing the chances of a breakout rally. Bitcoin ETFs Continue to BleedMeanwhile, institutional support for Bitcoin is yet to resurface as the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs maintain a negative net flow for the fourth consecutive day.

The AI-driven venture capital DAO token ai16z, which operates on the Solana blockchain, has reached a significant milestone by achieving a $1 billion market valuation. Currently valued at $1.04 billion, the $AI6Z token has recorded a 24-hour gain of 46.93% at the time of writing and achieved an all-time high.

Rather than simply mimicking Marc Andreessen’s investment expertise, ai16z aims to develop an AI system that can surpass him in the areas where he excels, creating a more efficient and autonomous approach to venture capital. This collaborative and innovative model sets ai16z apart from traditional venture capital firms, pushing the boundaries of what an AI-driven fund can achieve. Earlier today, a whale took out 13,000 Solana ( SOL ) tokens, worth $2.58 million, from Coinbase to buy 2.86 million governance $AI16Z tokens at an average price of $0.90 per token. These kinds of governance tokens provide protocol participants the ability to vote, giving them a say in strategic choices.

The Abstract plugin allows users to utilize Eliza agents to carry out straightforward ETH and ERC20 token transfers on the Abstract testnet, which is a testing environment for blockchain transactions. By automating these token transfers through specific commands in configuration files, users can streamline and enhance the efficiency of their blockchain interactions. This integration not only boosts the functionality of Eliza but also plays a significant role in expanding the capabilities of the ai16z ecosystem, making it more versatile and user-friendly. Ok, the @AbstractChain plugin is now officially merged into @ai16zdao 's eliza! You can now ask eliza agents to do simple ETH or ERC20 token transfers on Abstract testnet.

38092343,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53096,1735119601,RLUSD Wins New Listing to Expand Ripple’s Presence In Asia,"Independent Reserve, a leading crypto exchange in Singapore, has become the first platform in Singapore to list RLUSD, Ripple’s newly launched stablecoin . This milestone further highlights the rapid international adoption of RLUSD and its potential to transform digital asset ecosystems. Ripple introduced RLUSD as a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. RLUSD is designed to provide fast, efficient, and low-cost transactions. It was launched on the Ethereum blockchain and XRP Ledger (XRPL) to allow for swift onboarding, and its integration into Independent Reserve marks a major step forward for the stablecoin in penetrating new markets and strengthening Ripple’s position in the digital asset and financial sectors. Global Excitement Around RLUSD RLUSD has generated substantial interest within the global crypto community since its launch. Crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) highlighted the significance of this development in a post on X, emphasizing the excitement surrounding the stablecoin’s expansion. This announcement aligns with Ripple’s broader strategy of leveraging RLUSD as a bridge between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional banking systems. A recent report from TimesTabloid explored this vision in detail, showing RLUSD as a tool designed to enhance interoperability between financial sectors and drive innovation in payments and liquidity management. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why RLUSD Matters RLUSD’s listing on Independent Reserve reflects the growing demand for the stablecoin in global financial markets. RLUSD benefits from the XRPL’s established reputation for scalability, security, and sustainability. In addition to its efficiency, RLUSD offers users and businesses a reliable digital asset for transactions, savings, and investments. Stablecoins like RLUSD are increasingly seen as essential tools for reducing volatility and providing liquidity in cryptocurrency markets, which can otherwise be subject to dramatic price fluctuations. For Ripple, RLUSD represents an opportunity to extend its influence and also support XRP, its flagship cryptocurrency. By offering a stablecoin, Ripple can address a broader range of financial use cases, and draw more attention to XRP and the ecosystem. XRP’s role as a bridge currency will also increase its adoption and potentially drive its price. Independent Reserve’s decision to list RLUSD signals Singapore’s continued embrace of cryptocurrency innovation. Known for its forward-thinking regulatory environment, Singapore has positioned itself as a global hub for blockchain and digital assets, and this listing expands Ripple’s presence in Asia . The listing also enhances Independent Reserve’s offerings, making it a more competitive platform for retail and institutional investors.

December Gains Wiped Out! Here Are the Details,"US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs suffered a significant pullback, experiencing outflows of approximately $1.2 billion in a three-day period. US Bitcoin ETFs Experience Their Longest Three-Day Gain Since Election That was the longest streak of outflows since the days before former President Donald Trump’s re-election bid in 2024. The three-day streak erased most of the inflow gains these ETFs made in early December. According to SoSoValue data, 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs operating in the US markets recorded an outflow of $1.18 billion between December 18 and December 23. With the falling price of Bitcoin during this period, the total value held in these funds fell by $10.7 billion, from $121.7 billion on Dec. 16 to just over $105 billion at the end of trading on Monday. Despite this decline, the value of the funds remains slightly above the $103.9 billion recorded at the beginning of December. The outflows were not evenly distributed across ETFs. Fidelity’s FBTC fund had the largest share of outflows with $426 million, but BlackRock’s IBIT fund saw outflows of just $41 million for the day, bucking the trend and remaining flat for another day. Signs of a Comeback? Bitcoin’s price showed signs of recovery on Tuesday, gaining about 6% in 24 hours, signaling a possible end to the outflow streak. However, updated ETF inflow data for Tuesday was not yet available at the time of reporting. Ethereum ETFs Remain Steady While Bitcoin ETFs faced significant challenges, spot Ethereum ETFs saw minimal activity. Total inflows and outflows were almost balanced, with outflows exceeding inflows by just $4.83 million. However, the total value of Ethereum ETFs decreased by $1.1 billion over the same period, largely due to price fluctuations. *This is not investment advice.

38094601,https://invezz.com/?p=2403957,1735118880,"LATAM crypto trends 2024: Brazil regulates stablecoins, Colombia ranks fifth in crypto adoption","In 2024, Latin America has shown surprising growth in the cryptocurrency sector. Colombia, for example, has risen to fifth place in the region of cryptocurrency adoption. However, the region’s diverse legal frameworks have created “grey areas” in the regulation and operation of cryptocurrencies throughout Latin America. This is the case of countries like El Salvador, Brazil, and Argentina which have been making advances to adjust their legal frame to the cryptocurrency adoption. Brazil’s regulatory efforts in cryptocurrency Brazil’s government has been working closely in 2024 with the central bank to address regulatory challenges related to cryptocurrency and meal vouchers. With Gabriel Galipolo’s upcoming appointment in 2025 as central bank president, the government aims to unify its regulatory approach, which has been fragmented in the past. Meanwhile, the stablecoin sector in Brazil is experiencing rapid growth and has begun to surpass Bitcoin in transaction volumes on local exchanges. Stablecoins are appealing to users seeking less volatility, positioning Brazil as a hub for B2B cross-border payments. A 2024 report from Chainalysis reveals Latin America as the second-fastest-growing region for stablecoin usage, with a growth rate exceeding 42%. Colombia ranked fifth in crypto usage in 2024 According to the recent Geography of Cryptocurrency Report 2024 by Chainalysis, the region has seen a remarkable 42.5% increase in cryptocurrency transactions year-over-year, solidifying its status as the second-fastest-growing market worldwide. The report highlighted that approximately 700 million people in Latin America engaged in crypto transactions, totaling a staggering 415 billion Pesos from July 2023 to June 2024. In comparison, Sub-Saharan Africa leads globally with a 45% rise in crypto activity. Colombia ranks fifth in cryptocurrency adoption, with an impressive influx of $25 billion in crypto transactions during the specified period. The country is also the sixth-fastest-growing in this sector, showcasing a notable 25% increase in the value of its crypto transactions, according to Chainalysis. Binance wallet outpaced popular messaging apps Binance’s digital wallet saw a meteoric rise in Venezuela in 2024, climbing to the 33rd spot on the list of the country’s most downloaded apps. This achievement placed it just above Snapchat and just below WhatsApp, two of the most widely used messaging platforms in the nation. The sudden surge in downloads highlighted the growing interest in cryptocurrencies as more Venezuelans turned to digital solutions for financial stability amid an ongoing economic crisis after the failed presidential elections. With inflation soaring and the local currency, the bolívar, rapidly losing value, the Binance wallet has become an essential tool for protecting assets and conducting transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Crypto.com launched Visa card Crypto.com made strides in Latin America in 2024 by launching its Visa card program , aiming to capitalize on the region’s increasing interest in cryptocurrencies. According to the company’s statement, the card offers an array of rewards and benefits that position it as an appealing option for consumers looking to use cryptocurrencies in practical ways. The Crypto.com Visa Card allows users to preload funds from both crypto wallets and fiat currency directly through the Crypto.com app, offering flexibility that appeals to both crypto enthusiasts and traditional users. This multi-currency feature is crucial for individuals hesitant to integrate digital assets into conventional financial systems. The card also offers seven distinct tiers and a range of perks, including up to 8% cash back on purchases. The app simplifies the application process, ensuring quick and easy access to the Visa card for eligible users across the region. Additionally, users can enjoy rebates on popular subscription services like Netflix and Spotify, adding tangible value to the card. Crypto.com has eliminated annual or monthly fees on certain tiers, distinguishing its card from traditional credit cards that often impose such costs. Cardano drives digital authentication in Argentina The Cardano Foundation is collaborating with the Argentine government, including the Ministry of Labor, the National Technological University, and the Province of Entre Ríos, to enhance digital authentication strategies within social security and educational tracking systems. As highlighted by Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, this partnership sets a significant precedent for institutional blockchain adoption, potentially inspiring similar initiatives throughout Latin America. The collaboration aims to implement several key initiatives, including the secure authentication of social security benefits for disabled workers and the validation of national labour union records. Furthermore, it seeks to establish a technological hub in Entre Ríos, fostering an ecosystem that supports the development of businesses and innovations in Cardano and Aiken. Additionally, the project will introduce a system to monitor student attendance and performance through digital identities, streamlining educational data management and improving fund allocation from development banks while enhancing the overall teaching and learning experience.

38090897,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397726,1735117802,Dogecoin Following the Bullish Pattern—Here’s When the DOGE Price May Hit a New ATH at $5,"The post Dogecoin Following the Bullish Pattern—Here’s When the DOGE Price May Hit a New ATH at $5 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the Bitcoin price gained strength, the markets also turned bullish. Most cryptos initiated a strong recovery from the latest pullback, which has kept up the momentum of most of the altcoins. While some altcoins experienced a major rise, Dogecoin experienced a minor upswing, but before entering the bullish zone, it faced a significant bearish action. Regardless of the bearish interference, the DOGE price remains primed for a huge upswing as a new ATH at $5 is pre-programmed. Dogecoin gained mainstream attention during the 2021 bull run. Moreover, the bull run started with the DOGE price rally that surged from the consolidation around $0.0045 to as high as $0.7376. A similar rise has been recorded since the start of the last quarter of this year, which is expected to trigger a 2021-like bullish trend. Here’s Why. DOGE price recently moved from a long consolidation in the accumulation phase that lasted from early November to mid-December, followed by a manipulation phase. Historically, a strong distribution is expected to follow, which is expected to push the DOGE price towards a new ATH. A popular analyst, Trader Tardigrade , discovered the similarities between the 2021 bull run and the current price action. The analyst highlighted the crypto repeating the same consolidation phase it underwent in 2021. DOGE price surged heavily in January 2021, followed by a minor consolidation that further resulted in a massive breakout to the ATH. Currently, the price is seeing the same consolidating patterns, suggesting the next price action in January could be the Big Bang month. Many analysts and veterans look forward to a strong bull run in 2025, which may further trigger an altseason. If the Dogecoin (DOGE) price rally repeats the previous pattern, the market participants may expect a new ATH much above the $1 milestone, somewhere close to $4.5 to $5. Once these levels are achieved, it would be very difficult for the bears to drag the levels back below $1 even in times of a strong bear market.",POSITIVE,DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/dogecoin-following-the-bullish-pattern-heres-when-the-doge-price-may-hit-a-new-ath-at-5/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

38090923,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633090,1735117622,"New whale wallets are accumulating Chainlink (LINK), raising suspicions about their goals","In the past five days, whales have been withdrawing Chainlink (LINK) from Binance and accumulating it in self-custodied wallets. The withdrawals were sent to newly created wallets, with a list of 30 addresses with whale holdings. Chainlink (LINK) has seen significant withdrawals from Binance, as the funds are sent to a list of 30 newly created wallets. The addresses now hold $34.1M in notional value, or 1.37M LINK. The biggest wallet holds more than 151K LINK, and the smallest withdrawal is for around 5K LINK. The rationale for the recent withdrawals remains unknown, as LINK is both used for speculative trading and as a utility token. LINK can also be staked for a small passive income. Holding LINK in a self-custodied wallet also allows for DeFi interactions. Some of the LINK whale activity may be targeted at buying price dips and making use of the short-term volatility. However, despite the loyal holding, LINK is yet to break out to its previous peak, still retaining the range-bound pattern of the bear market. Other use cases may include new forms of staking, including liquid staking with additional rewards. Some of the free LINK tokens have been deposited to the Stake.Link priority pool. LINK is no stranger to whale activity, and this accumulation is seen as a potential sign for positive price action. LINK has also seen recent whale activity where one closely watched an address used LINK for short-term trades to realize gains of over $200K. The whale, known as pleven.eth , uses LINK for buying the dip and selling higher, making use of the token’s deep liquidity. That whale’s approach is to use decentralized services to flip between LINK and USDT, realizing gains for price swings happening within a day or even hours. The whale activity uses spot trades, while total LINK open interest has diminished from its 2024 peak. Long positions are now above 75%, potentially attackable with a downward price move. LINK continues to trade and consolidate in its higher price range, after briefly getting closer to $30. For now, the asset has not broken above that level, returning to $24.20. LINK is also a bit harder to pump, since only 15% of all trading activity remains on Binance. LINK trades with a slight premium on Bithumb, as its Korean won pair has the equivalent of $25.39. However, not all international traders have a right to trade in South Korea , making this arbitrage more difficult. Chainlink focuses on financial services, cross-chain partnerships Chainlink continues to behave as a utility project, avoiding direct hyping of its token. The platform is ranked at position #6 based on GitHub updates, making it one of the most actively developed projects. In the past months, Chainlink started adding more partnerships to its CCIP cross-chain service. After replacing Ronin’s bridge, Chainlink also took over the bridging of Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO), as well as ApusCoin (APU). While those memes are relatively minor, they still mark a shift to more use cases for Chainlink. Chainlink still secures more than 53% of DeFi value, or over $36.79B. The oracle provider has partnered with 407 crypto projects, excluding experimental use cases in mainstream financial organizations. LINK is also found in the wallet of the Trump-backed DeFi lending protocol, World Liberty Financial , retaining more than 78K tokens since the initial purchase. The Chainlink platform also built up a cult of long-term loyal holders, which appear to support the token even during drawdowns. For that reason, whale accumulation has been noticed during previous bull markets, potentially signaling a price breakout. In the past few weeks, whales with more than 100K LINK in their wallets also shifted to more active accumulation. Small-scale retail users are selling , changing the token profile of the asset. LINK is 100% unlocked, and any shifts in the supply are happening on the open market. Around 50% of the supply is locked with node operators , limiting the freely available LINK for DEX activities and utility purposes. CCIP now offers cross-chain linking to 13 total blockchains, on track to replace other types of bridges and become a monopolist for cross-chain transfers.

38090614,https://finbold.com/?p=222828,1735117200,We asked ChatGPT what will be the Bitcoin price in 2025; Here’s what it said,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) has had a remarkable year, recently reaching an all-time high of $108,268. This surge was driven by optimism surrounding a more crypto-friendly stance under President-elect Donald Trump and speculation about the potential Bitcoin strategic reserve. However, the cryptocurrency market remains divided, with investors navigating a mix of bullish institutional interest and bearish macroeconomic signals. These mixed signals have sparked speculation across the market, leaving investors questioning where Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, could head in 2025. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $98,015, reflecting a 5% decline over the past week. On a monthly chart, Bitcoin has posted a modest gain of 0.05%, highlighting the market’s persistent volatility. Mixed market signals Institutional players like MARA Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA ) and Riot Platforms have continued to expand their Bitcoin reserves, signaling long-term confidence in the asset. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) marked its seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin acquisitions, purchasing 5,262 BTC at an average price of $106,662, an investment of $561 million. Adding to the optimism, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently described Bitcoin as a hedge against a looming “debt money problem,” further endorsing its potential as a global financial asset alongside gold. Despite these bullish developments, bearish pressures emerged following hawkish statements from the U.S. Federal Reserve after its December 17 decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments about Bitcoin reserves further dampened market enthusiasm, briefly pushing Bitcoin below the $100,000 mark. The Fed’s forecast of only two rate cuts in 2025, falling short of market expectations for three or four cuts, also raised concerns among investors. Institutional demand vs. miner production The imbalance between institutional demand and Bitcoin’s limited supply is becoming increasingly evident. Over the past week, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded inflows of $423.6 million, equivalent to 4,349 BTC. In contrast, miners produced just 2,250 BTC during the same period. This discrepancy highlights tightening liquidity, with miners struggling to meet growing institutional demand. December alone has seen $5.5 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows, reinforcing institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency. On the supply side, the squeeze is even more pronounced. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that the total amount of Bitcoin readily available for sale—across exchanges, miners, and over-the-counter desks—has plummeted to 3.397 million BTC, a decline of 678,000 BTC so far this year. This marks the lowest level since October 2020. Compounding the issue, the liquidity inventory ratio, which measures how many months of demand the current sell-side stock can sustain, has dropped dramatically to just 6.6 months, compared to 41 months at the beginning of October, with demand showing no signs of waning. ChatGPT’s Bitcoin price prediction ChatGPT predicts that Bitcoin could climb to $200,000 in 2025, supported by historical trends and current market dynamics. Key drivers of this forecast include increasing institutional adoption, tightening supply following the recent halving, and sustained inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. These factors are expected to fuel long-term demand despite potential market turbulence. ChatGPT outlook on Bitcoin. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold This projection aligns closely with Bitwise, which anticipates Bitcoin surpassing $200,000, and potentially reaching $500,000, tied to the possibility of a federal Bitcoin reserve. Standard Chartered similarly maintains a $200,000 target, highlighting robust institutional interest, while VanEck offers a slightly more conservative estimate of $180,000, warning of heightened volatility throughout the year. Despite differing specifics, the consensus points to a bullish outlook for Bitcoin in 2025, tempered by the likelihood of market swings.

38090548,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397701,1735117031,What Are Crypto Whales Buying? Top Altcoins in Watch,"The post What Are Crypto Whales Buying? Top Altcoins in Watch appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Altcoin Daily explores the recent crypto news and how they are going to change the crypto game in 2025. Recently, Donald Trump’s appointment of Bo Hines as Executive Director of the U.S. Crypto Council signaled a major crypto push. Hines will collaborate with David Sachs to foster innovation in the digital asset space, aiming to position the U.S. as a global leader. Analysts speculate this aligns with plans for a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve to tackle national debt and boost Bitcoin adoption. Let’s jump in. Top Altcoins Ready to Boom in 2025 The current political scenario is building the crypto momentum and 2025 will be the year of Bitcoin as suggested by many analysts. Among all Crypto coins analysts are more focused on Bitcoin and speculate a hike in its adoption as a strategic reserve asset could push the U.S. to a global crypto leader. Its capped supply of 21 million coins, growing institutional interest via ETFs, and potential regulatory tailwinds in 2025 make it a cornerstone for long-term investors. Next up is Ethereum though its ETF records are not impressive yet it is expected to jump the ladder and become a leader for the next altcoin season. Since DeFi and NFTs may see some actions in Trump’s leadership. Its transition to proof-of-stake enhances energy efficiency and scalability, attracting institutional and real-world adoption. Solana, known for its blazing speed and low costs, is gaining traction in gaming and NFTs despite occasional setbacks. Solana is also buzzing as analysts are expecting an ETF approval once Gary Gensler steps down . At present Solana is up 6% indicating that SOL has seen more capital increase than Bitcoin and Ethereum. With regulatory activity at ease, Cardano is also back in the game . Despite the recent drops due to the wide market crypto dump the coins are gaining investor’s interest. The market is bullish on Cardano after Trump’s win with expectations of a 4000% rise next year it is indeed a hot crypto asset. Last but the least is the memecoin sector which sees a potential breakout chance as investors may divert their assets to memes for quick gain. Trump’s favorite Dogecoin (DOGE) has broken the myth of meme failure with an impressive 350% surge in 2024 due to its robust community. It is also supported by Elon Musk making it even more popular. Is Altcoin Season Nearing? Well, that’s a question that is on everyone’s mind right now, Altcoin Daily believes an altcoin season will happen when there is wider crypto adoption in all sectors be it altcoins, stablecoins, or meme coins. Apart from other sectors, Stablecoins are gaining traction as a tool for global transactions, with companies like SpaceX leveraging them for seamless cross-border payments. This highlights how stablecoin growth could fuel capital inflows into altcoins. Plus, regulatory clarity expected in 2025, and rising institutional interest in digital assets like Bitcoin could create a domino effect, benefiting altcoins.",POSITIVE,SOL,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | SOL,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/what-are-crypto-whales-buying-top-altcoins-in-watch/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The attack started with a threat actor impersonating the CEO of a real crypto project and introducing themselves by mentioning people the receiver knew. The attacker suggested the next step should be scheduling a meeting to talk about project development via ZOOM; the link to the Zoom meeting was also shared. Believing the request, the victim tried to reinstall the Zoom app as the fake webpage demanded it. As a result, having downloaded and opened the link, they unleashed malware that was to capture wallet credentials and private keys. The victim only came to find out about the loss when their Twitter account had been hacked and their crypto wallet emptied. Even though the victim is a rather experienced DeFi user and miner, he confessed that the loss occurred due to a single moment of inattention .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Phishing Scams 2024: How Hackers Stole $500K in a Month , Rising Threat of Malware in Crypto The attack is not an isolated event but one of the many malware attacks focused on users of cryptocurrencies. Hackers like those who registered us04-zoom[.]us domain-level tricks to ensure that unsuspecting individuals install malware on their devices. Such phishing campaigns usually take advantage of familiar tactics like popular platforms Zoom to reduce guard. Security Measures That Crypto Users Should Undertake To mitigate the risk of such attacks, experts recommend the following precautions: Verify sources: It is always important to verify the authenticity of links and downloading sources in a particular common application such as Zoom or Twitter. Run security scans: Some malware sneaks into the computer through downloaded files, so make sure downloads are scanned before installation using a reliable antivirus. Enable 2FA: Increase account security by also implementing two-factor authentication for all accounts. Stay sceptical: Do not interact with spam texts or chats even from your ‘friends,’ or ‘followers.’ Let this serve as a stark reminder: the world of DeFi is no different, and being just once careless can lead to terrible outcomes.

At this point, BTC fell to $ 90,000 and then went on the offensive again yesterday. As Bitcoin reaches $98,000, a top analyst says BTC could reach a new record high in January of next year. Accordingly, Vetle Lunde, head of research at crypto research firm K33 Research, argued that Bitcoin could reach its new ATH and cyclical peak around mid-January next year, citing historical data. Lunde stated that he made this prediction based on BTC's previous cycles and said that he expects the price to reach a new peak on January 17, 2025 in this cycle. Lunde said that data from the last three cycles show that the average time between Bitcoin’s first and last all-time high in each cycle was 318 days. At this point, the analyst noted that since Bitcoin reached its first record high on March 5 during this current cycle, if history repeats itself, investors could see BTC reach a new, cyclical high on January 17, 2025, during this cycle. Lunde stated that Bitcoin could reach $146,000 this cycle based on previous cycle peak prices, while adding that it could potentially go up to $212,500 this cycle based on previous market capitalization. If Bitcoin reaches a new high in mid-January, it will coincide with Donald Trump’s inauguration as US president on January 20. *This is not investment advice.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-will-rally-14000-before-exchange-listing-while-dogecoin-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

According to the Bank of Korea, domestic asset investors augmented by 610,000 in November, bringing the total to 15.59 million. South Korea’s crypto investors drive market value to $79 billion Although November saw the highest increase in crypto investors in the country, in the preceding months, the number of investors grew steadily by approximately 100,000 people per month. In July, there were about 14.74 million domestic asset investors before rising to 14.82 million in August, 14.88 million in September, and 14.98 million at the end of October. The stark increase in investors in November, however, coincides with the impressive rise in Bitcoin prices which surged from around 100 million KRW at the end of October to over 135 million KRW by late November. Not to mention, the influx of domestic investors and Bitcoin prices in November, boosted the total crypto holdings, to 102.6 trillion KRW (approximately $79 billion), compared to 58 trillion KRW in October. Moreover, deposits in exchanges not yet invested added up to 8.8 trillion Korean won at the end of November. The average daily trading volume of domestic virtual asset exchanges also surpassed combined trading volumes on South Korea’s Kospi and Kosdaq stock exchanges reaching 14.9 trillion won in November. In the preceding months, however, the average daily transaction volumes oscillated around 2 and 3 trillion KRW, with October recording only 3.4 trillion KRW. Rep. Lim Gwang-hyun of the Democratic Party of Korea, a member of the National Assembly Planning and Finance Committee, commented on the growing virtual asset market saying: “The virtual asset transaction volume is rapidly increasing to a level comparable to that of the stock market.” He added that the government needs to prepare on how to ensure sound market transactions to promote stability in the crypto space and safeguard the rights and interests of digital asset users.

The latest figure shows an increase of 610,000 investors from the previous month, likely fueled by optimism following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. According to the data, the total value of crypto held by South Korean investors reached a record 102.6 trillion won (around $78 billion) in November, up from 58 trillion won in July.

Ethereum Breaches the $3,300 Support Level Due to Increased Sell-off Ethereum has experienced a significant drop in price as whale investors continuously relinquish their holdings. During the latest dip, the flagship altcoin breached the $3,300 support zone to the downside following recent transactions on Binance. According to Lookonchain, a blockchain activity tracker, an Ethereum whale transferred 31,968 ETH valued at $122.3 million to Binance in two days. Another whale unstaked and sent 49,910 ETH worth $170 million to the same exchange within eight hours. These transactions have sparked sell-off speculations, particularly because the tokens are a means to pay off debts incurred on the Aave and Spark platforms. In addition to these transfers, the Ethereum Foundation recently sold 100 ETH at an average price of $4,000, exchanging it for DAI.

Third Largest Meme Pepe Suffers From Short-Term Dip Pepe, emerging in 2024 as the third largest meme cryptocurrency, has faced a steep 25% decline amid a broader market downturn sparked by the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on crypto.

Still, Pepe’s cultural significance and strong community continue to underpin its resilience, solidifying Pepe’s position as a leader in the meme coin space. For instance, recent on-chain data highlights significant trading interest for Pepe. Combined with its history of dramatic comebacks and meme-driven appeal even during a bear market, Pepe is well-positioned to capitalize on a market rebound and regain momentum in tandem with most other meme coins.

In the UAE, a survey by trading platform eToro revealed growing interest in cryptocurrencies, with 37% of respondents planning to expand their crypto investments alongside traditional assets like stocks and real estate. Meanwhile, software giant MicroStrategy continues to double down on its Bitcoin strategy, seeking shareholder approval to significantly expand its equity-issuance plan to fund a $42 billion Bitcoin acquisition goal over the next three years. MicroStrategy Seeks Shareholder Approval to Expand Equity Plan and Accelerate Bitcoin Purchases Software company MicroStrategy is making a bold move to solidify its position as a leading institutional Bitcoin investor. The company announced a special shareholder meeting to seek approval for an expanded equity-issuance plan, allowing it to purchase more Bitcoin. This development comes as part of its ambitious ”21/21 Plan,” aimed at significantly increasing its Bitcoin holdings over the next three years. In a Dec. 23 proxy filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MicroStrategy outlined proposals to increase the number of authorized shares for both Class A common stock and preferred stock. If approved, these amendments will provide the company with greater flexibility to issue shares and raise capital. Class A Common Stock: The proposal seeks to increase authorized shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion. Preferred Stock: The proposal aims to expand authorized shares from 5 million to over 1 billion. According to the filing, these changes are critical to supporting the company’s strategic initiatives, particularly its 21/21 Plan, which was unveiled in October. The 21/21 Plan MicroStrategy's 21/21 Plan outlines an aggressive goal: to purchase an additional $42 billion worth of Bitcoin by 2027. The funding strategy is equally ambitious, involving $21 billion raised through equity sales and another $21 billion via fixed-income securities. The company stated in its filing, “Proposals 1 and 2 for this Special Meeting request an increase in the authorized shares of the capital stock of the Company to support further implementation of our 21/21 Plan and future capital markets activity more generally as well as other corporate purposes.” MicroStrategy’s focus on Bitcoin is not new; the company has been a consistent buyer since 2020. However, the pace of acquisitions has intensified since the announcement of the 21/21 Plan. In December alone, the company acquired 42,162 Bitcoin, valued at over $4 billion at current market prices. This surge in purchases has bolstered MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 444,262 BTC as of Dec. 22. The total cost of acquiring these coins stands at $27.7 billion, with an average purchase price of $62,257 per Bitcoin. At current market rates, the total value of the company’s Bitcoin holdings is approximately $43.53 billion. MicroStrategy has already raised substantial funds to fuel its Bitcoin acquisitions: Equity Sales: $13 billion raised through stock issuances. Debt Offerings: $3 billion raised via convertible bonds. The company has also reported strong yields on its Bitcoin holdings, achieving a BTC yield of 17.8% by the end of October. It aims to maintain an annual yield of 6% to 10% between 2025 and 2027. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy has been a boon for its stock performance. Shares on the Nasdaq have soared by over 422% year-to-date, largely driven by investor confidence in its cryptocurrency-focused strategy. The date for the special shareholder meeting has not been disclosed, but the outcome will play a pivotal role in shaping the company’s future. If shareholders approve the proposals, MicroStrategy will have the resources to accelerate its Bitcoin acquisitions further. The company’s next earnings report, scheduled for Feb. 2, 2025, will likely shed light on its progress and the impact of its Bitcoin holdings on its financial performance. A Bold Bet on Bitcoin MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, has consistently championed Bitcoin as a transformative asset. The company’s latest moves demonstrates its push to integrate Bitcoin into its corporate strategy. With over $43 billion worth of Bitcoin already on its balance sheet and plans to acquire billions more, MicroStrategy remains at the forefront of institutional Bitcoin adoption. While the approach has garnered praise from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, it has also raised questions about the risks associated with such an aggressive investment strategy. As the company continues to double down on Bitcoin , all eyes will be on its execution of the 21/21 Plan and its impact on shareholder value in the years to come. Survey Reveals UAE Retail Investors Plan to Expand Crypto Investments in 2025 In other news, a recent survey commissioned by trading platform eToro has shed light on the financial aspirations of retail investors in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for 2025, revealing a significant interest in increasing investments in cryptocurrencies. The survey, which involved 1,000 participants, highlighted a proactive approach to wealth building and self-improvement among UAE residents. According to the survey, 37% of respondents expressed plans to increase their crypto asset investments in the coming year. This aligns with broader financial goals shared by 54% of participants, who listed achieving financial stability and growth as their primary New Year’s resolutions. These goals ranged from investing in traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and commodities to diversifying portfolios with cryptocurrencies. While cryptocurrencies garnered significant attention, traditional asset classes remained a priority for UAE investors: 40% of participants aim to increase their exposure to stocks, bonds, and commodities. 38% plan to invest in real estate, reflecting a balanced approach to asset diversification. Participants also shared their strategies for meeting their financial aspirations. Notably, 51% of respondents indicated they would increase their overall savings or investment contributions. Other approaches included: Budget and Expense Management: 41% plan to implement comprehensive tracking of their expenses and budgeting to better manage their finances. Lifestyle Adjustments: 38% aim to adopt more frugal and mindful lifestyles, while 28% intend to cut down on shopping and dining out. In addition to savings and budgeting, many UAE investors are looking to boost their earnings through alternative means: Side Hustles: 32% of respondents plan to launch side businesses to generate additional income. Career Changes: 28% are considering career shifts in pursuit of higher salaries. This entrepreneurial spirit aligns with the UAE's broader economic landscape, where innovation and adaptability are highly valued. In a news release, George Naddaf, eToro’s regional manager, praised the proactive mindset of UAE investors, describing their resolutions as a blend of financial security and personal growth. Naddaf remarked, ”2025’s resolutions highlight a proactive approach to not just financial security but also a desire for self-improvement and adaptability.” He also emphasized the UAE’s forward-thinking culture, noting that the country continues to lead in financial resilience and personal development. Beyond financial goals, the survey revealed that UAE residents are equally focused on personal development: 41% of respondents prioritize personal growth, which includes enhancing skills, education, and professional advancement. 34% placed health and well-being at the top of their resolutions, with many planning to focus on fitness, mental health, and stronger social or family connections. The UAE’s Financial and Personal Growth Mindset The survey results reflect a unique blend of financial ambition and holistic self-improvement among UAE residents. The increasing interest in crypto investments sheds light on the nation’s openness to innovative financial strategies, while commitments to health and personal development suggest a balanced approach to life. As 2025 approaches, UAE retail investors are setting the stage for a year of growth and resilience. Whether through increased investments in cryptocurrencies, real estate, or traditional asset classes, or through personal and professional development, their goals demonstrate a forward-thinking and adaptive mindset.

38090562,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53094,1735115000,Here’s Amount of SHIB Needed For Early Retirement,"Shiba Inu has attracted widespread attention as an investment option, with many hoping it can make way to early retirement. This article examines the financial commitment required to achieve a $2 million retirement goal in the United States through SHIB investments. The amount necessary to retire early depends on several factors, including location and financial lifestyle. For individuals residing in areas with a lower cost of living, a retirement fund of $700,000 may be sufficient. Conversely, in high-cost areas like the United States, higher savings are required. A CNBC report highlighted that retiring in Hawaii, the most expensive U.S. state requires approximately $2 million to sustain a 25-year retirement period. On average, however, retirement in the U.S. typically demands a net worth of around $1 million. Using these benchmarks, we explore how much Shiba Inu investors would need to accumulate to meet the $2 million threshold. Required SHIB Holdings for Early Retirement For investors relying on Shiba Inu to build a retirement portfolio, achieving $2 million depends on their initial investment, the token’s purchase price, and potential future price increases. Below are three scenarios analyzing how different investment amounts could lead to reaching this retirement goal. At the current price of $0.0000219, an investment of $10,000 would buy approximately 454,545,454 tokens. To transform this portfolio into a $2 million valuation, the SHIB price would need to rise to $0.0044 per token. This price jump would represent a staggering 19,991% increase, pushing the token’s market capitalization to $2.59 trillion. For context, this valuation exceeds Bitcoin’s current market cap of $2.01 trillion. However, achieving such a massive price surge would require overcoming the challenge of Shiba Inu’s vast circulating supply of over 589 trillion tokens. With a larger initial investment of $50,000 at the current price, an investor could acquire approximately 2.27 billion tokens. In this case, the SHIB price would need to increase to $0.00088 for the portfolio to reach $2 million. This represents a 3,918% price surge, bringing the market capitalization to $518.54 billion. While this valuation is significantly lower than the first scenario’s projection, it would still position the token as one of the largest cryptocurrencies globally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investors contributing $100,000 to the asset at the current price of $0.0000219 would receive around 4.54 billion tokens. For this portfolio to achieve a $2 million valuation, the token would need to rise to $0.00044, representing a 1,909% increase. At this price, Shiba Inu’s market capitalization would reach approximately $259.27 billion, assuming the circulating supply remains stable. This scenario reflects a more modest growth requirement compared to the previous two, making it relatively more plausible under current market conditions. Considerations for Investors While these projections may seem appealing, it is important to recognize that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and there is no guarantee that the asset will reach any of the price targets mentioned above. Factors such as market demand, token supply, and broader economic conditions influence the asset’s price trajectory.

Furthermore, data shows Bitcoin exchange-traded funds’ net flows amounted to $338.4 million on Tuesday. That marked the fourth successive outflow from spot BTC ETFs, signaling negative sentiments within the market. However, experts remain confident about Bitcoin’s performance in the coming weeks and months, citing pro-crypto president Donald Trump. Some believe BTC will trade within the 100,000 – 150,000 range after Trump’s inauguration.

38089429,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376114,1735114843,Shibarium Hits Another Milestone: Is the SHIB Price Poised for a New Rally?,"TL;DR Shiba Inu’s Shibarium hit a fresh target, signaling strong user engagement. SHIB climbed by 4% to $0.00002305, with increased token burns and reduced exchange inflows signaling a further pump. Shibarium Keeps Advancing Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution – Shibarium – took center stage on Christmas Day, blasting through yet another major milestone. Data shows that the total transactions processed on the protocol exceeded 700 million. This can be viewed as a serious achievement, considering the fact that Shibarium officially saw the light of day last summer. Since then, it has undergone some important developments, such as launching a new user interface (UI) update that improves compatibility with popular self-custody wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. Shortly after, the team introduced an update through a hard fork to empower the community of developers and innovators and implement quicker block processing times. It also adopted a burning mechanism, which is a bit different from the original program but has the same purpose. Shibarium’s ultimate goal is to foster the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem by reducing transaction costs, improving speed, and enhancing scalability. As such, some market observers believe its further progress could be a vital factor fueling a rally for the meme coin’s price. How’s SHIB Doing? It is worth mentioning that Shibarium’s latest achievement coincides with the resurgence of SHIB’s price. It currently trades at around $0.00002305, representing a 4% rise on a daily scale. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Other elements suggesting that Shiba Inu has yet to experience a substantial rally are the burning program and the SHIB exchange netflow . The burn rate has jumped by 50% in the past 24 hours, resulting in over 7 million tokens destroyed . Converted in US dollars, the stash is insignificant , but continuous efforts in the field will reduce the circulating supply of the meme coin, making it more scarce and possibly more valuable (assuming demand doesn’t head south). For its part, the SHIB exchange netflow has been predominantly negative in the last week (according to CryptoQuant’s data), with outflows surpassing inflows during most days. This hints at a shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods and could be considered bullish since it diminishes the immediate selling pressure.

38089623,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=633073,1735114713,VC fund USV took profit on its 2020 investment in Uniswap (UNI),"USV, one of the early investors in Uniswap (UNI) sent another batch of tokens to Coinbase Prime. The early investor started sending UNI to the exchange since December 6. Union Square Ventures (USV) has sent more Uniswap (UNI) tokens to Coinbase Prime, potentially taking profits on its earlier investments. The fund is one of the early backers of Uniswap from 2020, which waited for a more favorable price range. USV is a Tier 2 fund, specializing in Series A financing. In the latest transaction, USV transferred 578,000 UNI, valued at $8.45M. In three weeks, USV moved 3.511M UNI, valued at $54.56M. The fund holds more than 10M UNI in its remaining share, valued at more than $156M. The involvement of USV is relatively small compared to other VC backers for Uniswap. The fund has a total of 43 early investments in the crypto space, and has achieved higher returns compared to other VC funds. USV was one of the early backers of Polygon, profiting from the platform’s growth during the boom of Web3 services. USV has achieved total returns of over 165,200% . The popular DEX project used its first-mover advantage to raise more than $188M in several rounds over the years. USV participated in a Series A round raising $11M, while Uniswap was still in its early stages and did not yet attract the biggest funds. Uniswap later received backing from A16Z and Polychain Capital, helping the DEX raise its $165M Series B round in 2022. Investors control a little over 18% of the UNI supply, with the biggest share left for governance and community activities. UNI has managed to hold onto a respectable price range, as most backers hold onto their tokens, expecting higher potential returns or governance rights. USV transferred the funds from two main wallets, address 1 and address 2 . The wallets were relatively inactive over the past months, mostly used to store the received UNI for a long-term investment. UNI has already completed its unlocking schedule, so it is up to early backers to decide on the movement and eventual selling of their tokens. UNI still waiting for a stronger breakout The average price for all transfers is $15.53, still far from previous bullish targets from UNI. For USV, however, the holding paid out, as the early market price was under $3.50. USV also held its tokens through the 2021 boom when UNI peaked above $42. After the transfers, UNI still traded at $14.12 . The exchange is increasingly influential, with presence on the tokenless Base blockchain. Despite this, UNI tokens have managed a relatively small rally in 2024. UNI started the year in the $7 range, still managing 100% net growth to date, though lagging behind more active earners. Over the years, UNI has shown patterns suggesting some selling from VC backers or early contributors. The price action of UNI also reflected the overall slowdown of DEX trading in 2022 and 2023. The Uniswap activity expanded in the past year, reaching a peak in November with $118M in fees. The DEX operates with a net loss, due to paying out incentives to its liquidity providers. It now holds more than $6B in total value locked (TVL), spread around 23 chains. Uniswap Labs is also busy promoting its native Unichain to builders, aiming to shift some of the DEX traffic. Uniswap V3 on Ethereum is still the most active version, with $961M in daily trading volumes. The Uniswap universal router smart contract still burns 5.75% of all gas on Ethereum, with busier days leading to even higher activity. In 2024, the profile of Uniswap activity shifted, as USDC became one of the most widely traded assets. More than $1T in trading volumes came from USDC swaps. The DEX has achieved $989.81M in fees for the year to date, potentially ending 2024 with more than $1B in total fees. Uniswap has surpassed Solana and is almost on par with Lido Finance.

Analyst Timothy Peterson Reveals,"Cryptocurrency analyst Timothy Peterson predicted a potential “Santa rally” for Bitcoin in a Twitter post, citing three key indicators. Peterson cited historical trends, market seasonality, and the performance of the US dollar as factors that point to a strong Bitcoin rally during the holiday season. Dollar’s Weakening Momentum: The analyst noted that the US Dollar Index (DXY) is approaching a recent high and there is an 85% chance it will reverse soon. Historically, a declining dollar has an inverse relationship with Bitcoin, as declining global demand for the USD often pushes investors toward alternatives like cryptocurrencies. “A weaker dollar is often associated with stronger Bitcoin performance,” Peterson said. Related News: Developers on Solana Revealed the Altcoins Developers Are Most Focused on - Here's the List Bitcoin Seasonal Resistance: The analyst said that Bitcoin has historically performed positively in the last week of December. Data shows that Bitcoin tends to perform well from December 25 to January 2, with exceptions being both rare and mild. Peterson also noted that since 2015, Bitcoin has gained in November 100% of the time, and has also gained in December. This trend could see Bitcoin perform an average of 10% in December, pushing its price to $106,000 by the end of the year. Historical Cycle Examples: Peterson drew parallels with the 2016 and 2020 bull market cycles, stating that Bitcoin’s current price trajectory closely mirrors those periods. He suggested that Bitcoin is poised for a significant upward move consistent with the “January effect,” where markets typically see renewed buying interest following year-end tax losses. *This is not investment advice.

Will the BTC price rise and form a new ATH before the end of 2024? The market participants remained vigilant over the crypto markets, specifically the Bitcoin price rally, as they tend to look out for these answers. While the market volatility varied, the star token had failed to gain the required buying pressure. However, the latest rise suggests the bulls tried hard to reclaim the $100K spot but the bears, who seem to have capitulated to these levels, prevented the token from doing so. Now that the token displayed a Christmas rally, the year-end rise is expected to revive a strong rise, marking new highs. While the BTC price displayed uncertainty, the spot ETFs witnessed a massive sell-off. BlackRock sold over $188 million worth of BTC, which is one of their biggest sell-offs since the start.Besdies, the total sell-offs also marked the peak of over $338 million but the price recovered from $94,000 to $99,000. Regardless of this, BlackRock and Fidelity collectively hold over $50 billion in Bitcoin, which could keep up the bullish hopes over the rally. The BTC price in the short term suggests the price may be subject to a small pullback as the stochastic RSI has reached the oversold levels. Hence, the levels are about to drop and after a bullish crossover, the DMI levels are close to undergoing a bearish crossover. Therefore, the Bitcoin price is expected to undergo a small pullback and drop below $96,000 in the next couple of days. However, this pullback could be an opportunity to accumulate at the lower range. The crypto markets are heading towards the end of the year, which usually attracts a good buying volume. However, the volume over the platform remains lower, which suggests the bullish participation remains restrictive at the moment. Hence, a rise in the volume is expected to trigger the volatility, which is much required for a healthy bullish close for the year, probably above $100K.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-almost-hits-100k-triggering-a-christmas-rally-will-it-close-the-yearly-trade-above-the-range/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

38088975,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314024,1735113873,Top Analyst Now Sees Window of Opportunity for Bitcoin and Altcoins To Pop – But There’s a Catch,"A top crypto strategist thinks the digital asset market is in a position to witness a bullish continuation even as Bitcoin ( BTC ) trades below $100,000. Pseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse tells his 251,400 followers on the social media platform X that he believes the doors are open for Bitcoin and altcoins to spark surges. “The window of opportunity is between now and the second week of January for things to pop.” The analyst’s outlook stems from the idea that traders believe the incoming Donald Trump presidential administration will be incredibly bullish for crypto. Trump has signaled that under his administration, the US government’s anti-crypto agenda would end, and he has even suggested a Bitcoin treasury to help get the country’s finances in order. But the analyst highlights that his predicted window for crypto rallies will close just days before Trump’s inauguration. He argues that traders will likely be in for a rude awakening after Trump takes over the White House on January 20th, 2025 “The market had to some degree priced in a most fairytale scenario – one where the United States establishes a Bitcoin reserve and Lummis’s bill passes smoothly. However, as reality sets in, that optimistic positioning will likely fade, especially as it becomes clear that Trump will encounter significant resistance in pushing many of his initiatives through. This is a good thing.” The analyst also warns that he thinks crypto will print a local top around the time Trump officially begins his second term as US president. “Like I see no one open to the idea that we are very close (weeks to a quarter) to a nice top. Just people under the impression that because of Trump the markets have to go up.” Looking at the macro landscape, The Flow Horse says capital is still expensive compared to the 2020 cycle when the Fed was forced to drop interest rates close to zero due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “If you believe this cycle will surpass the previous one wildly, you should have a clear thesis explaining how it achieves this without the support of the robust credit markets that helped the prior.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,455.

Meanwhile, Toncoin has attracted attention with positive recovery signs, and analysts are optimistic about Polkadot’s future price movements. This exciting momentum across major cryptocurrencies presents a prime opportunity for investors to engage with some of the most promising projects in the digital finance space today. Toncoin (TON) Holders Redirect Their Funds to Remittix Toncoin presents an exciting opportunity for savvy investors to buy low and position themselves for potential gains. Once celebrated as one of the year’s standout performers, Toncoin faced a dramatic decline following Pavel Durov’s arrest in August. However, the token shows early signs of a rebound, suggesting it could regain its footing. This has fueled optimism for Toncoin’s recovery. Even though the token’s value has fallen considerably, this downturn might be the time for investors to get in at a bargain price. Analysts think that Toncoin could be among the fastest cryptocurrencies to grow in 2025, making its low price an attractive entry point. Despite its promise, Toncoin faces challenges as investor sentiment has soured on platforms like CoinMarketCap. Over the past month, the token has shed 7.25% of its value. A closer look at the past week reveals an even steeper 21.52% decline. These numbers paint a grim picture, prompting many to reconsider their positions. Some investors, discouraged by Toncoin’s bearish trajectory, redirect their funds to promising prospects like Remittix. Polkadot (DOT) Teams Up With Velocity Labs to Establish Magic Ramp Polkadot has struggled this year; experts blame volatility for the poor price performance. However, the tide changed in the year’s final quarter, as DOT posted a 100% gain. A sharp correction then followed, cutting its value by over 30%. Despite this setback, Polkadot’s ecosystem remains alive and well-represented by the Polkadot Relay Chain, which processes 32 million monthly transactions. In a new development, Velocity Labs partnered with Harbors to provide “Magic Ramp,” a stablecoin payment method. This innovation links Polkadot’s blockchain to SEPA Instant payment rails, unlocking low-cost and efficient payment solutions. Magic Ramp allows seamless transactions between euros and USDC within 30 seconds, bridging traditional financial systems with Web3 technology. This collaboration also enables developers to connect the Polkadot Asset Hub to SEPA Instant payment rails in Europe. Remittix Focuses On Fiat & Crypto To Outperform Competitors Remittix (RTX) is a crypto protocol transforming global finance with its innovative PayFi protocol, offering seamless solutions for individuals and businesses. Unlike platforms like Stripe, Wise, or Coinbase, which focus solely on fiat or crypto, Remittix effortlessly bridges both worlds.

That’s according to data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. Kiyosaki warned on Sunday, however, that the economy could plunge into a depression next year. “Global crash has started. Europe, China. USA going down. Depression ahead?” he wrote in a post on X. “Please be smarter with your money. Hang on to your job and your money.” Global crash has started. Europe, China. USA going down . Depression ahead? Please be smarter with your money. Hang on to your job and your money. Biggest problem are our leaders and educators. As I have often asked “What did school teach you about money?” Regardless of… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 23, 2024 And by money, the bestselling “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” author means Bitcoin and gold. He’s not alone in fearing economic trouble ahead. Despite the strong GDP numbers this year, some analysts fear Trump’s aggressive trade policies could slow growth and lead to a recession. Peter Berezin, the chief global strategist for BCA Research, warned in November that Trump’s proposed import tariffs will leave the economy with a 75% chance of recession. Kiyosaki Boosts Bitcoin for Economic Meltdown Kiyosaki says all hope is not lost in a bad economy. “For many people, crashes are the best times to get rich,” he said. “I plan on getting richer. I want you to get richer and smarter, too. Take care.” Earlier this month, the financial author suggested that Bitcoin’s price could crash to $60,000 from its current levels of around $100,000. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is also worried about a massive pullback from these current highs. But Kiyosaki said he’s not selling because he expects the cryptocurrency to reach $250,000 in 2025. BITCOIN to CRASH Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. I predict Bitcoin will settle around $250 in 2025. At this stage of the BTC process… price is not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 1, 2024 “At this stage of the BTC process… price is not as important… as how many BTC you acquire,” he said. A Booming 2025 Could Wreck Fiats Like USD Despite some recession warnings, most economists expect business to boom in 2025. Apollo Global Management’s chief economist, Torsten Sløk, projects a 0% recession forecast for the U.S. in 2025. Either way, Bitcoin could be your most important savings vehicle. According to Kiyosaki, BTC holds its value whether the economy is slowing or growing. That’s because when the economy slows, investors rush to Bitcoin as a macro hedge on future uncertainty. When the economy booms, fiat inflation soars, and as a result, so does Bitcoin’s price. “Regardless of which way economy goes, gold, silver, and Bitcoin hold their value,” Kiyosaki said.

However, some technical indicators are now suggesting that the asset’s real breakthrough could be just around the corner. SHIBUSD. Source: TradingView Alongside the rest of the market, the second-largest meme coin was sluggish ahead of the US elections, with its price stuck in a range of between $0.000014 and $0.00002 for weeks. Once the dust settled and Trump emerged victorious, SHIB shot up as well, going to a muli-month peak of just over $0.0003. Following a minor retracement, the asset went on the offensive once again at the start of the current month, which culminated in a surge to $0.0000335 on December 8 – its highest level since March this year. However, SHIB was not only unable to keep the momentum up and going into uncharted territory, but it actually started retracing hard in the following weeks. The most substantial price slide came after the latest US FOMC meeting during the broader market’s crash when SHIB dumped to $0.0000185. This represented a 44% slump in less than two weeks. The asset has managed to recover some ground and now sits at around $0.000023. Moreover, data from popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shows that it has flashed a buy signal now. He envisioned a further rebound to $0.000029, which would represent a 25% increase from now and a 55% surge from the December 8 bottom.

Sensitive attendee data from crypto events is being sold online, fueling concerns about targeted phishing and social engineering attacks. Bait wallet schemes are also tricking greedy users into sending funds to multisignature wallets, ensuring scammers yield some impressive profits. Meanwhile, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies linked the $300 million theft from Japan’s DMM exchange to the North Korean TraderTraitor group, which it achieved by using very sophisticated social engineering techniques. Hackers Take Advantage of Meme Coin Hype A sophisticated phishing scam netted a threat actor close to $500,000 over the past month by targeting 15 compromised X accounts, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT . The attacker reportedly impersonated the X team, and sent fake copyright infringement notices to lure users into visiting phishing sites. These sites tricked victims into providing credentials to reset their X account passwords and disable two-factor authentication (2FA), which allowed the perpetrator to gain control of the accounts. Many of the compromised accounts were crypto-focused and included names like Kick, Cursor, The Arena, Brett , and Alex Blania, and they were used to promote meme coin scams. The phishing scheme involved six deployer addresses to launch various scams, with stolen funds being moved between the Solana and Ethereum networks in an attempt to obscure the source of the transactions. ZachXBT advised users to avoid reusing email addresses across services and to enable 2FA on critical accounts to boost security. The first incident was reported on Nov. 26 with RuneMine’s account, while the latest involved Kick on Dec. 24. Many of these accounts had large followings of more than 200,000 users, particularly in the meme coin community. Posts from compromised accounts often used captions like “Incoming Transmission” to announce fraudulent tokens and contract addresses. Some of the affected accounts, like the cross-chain scalability platform Neutron, have publicly acknowledged the attacks. This surge in phishing activity comes as crypto scammers seem to be trying to recover losses after phishing incidents dropped 53% month-on-month in November. However, 2024 has seen a rise in crypto theft, with blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reporting $2.2 billion stolen across 303 major incidents—a 21% increase from the previous year. Scammers Use Bait Wallets to Trap Greedy Crypto Thieves A new crypto scam also recently emerged where fraudsters pose as inexperienced users by sharing the seed phrase of a wallet supposedly filled with funds, luring people into a trap that is designed to steal their crypto instead. According to a Dec. 23 blog post by Kaspersky analyst Mikhail Sytnik, scammers are targeting finance-related YouTube videos by posting comments with seed phrases under the guise of asking for help transferring Tether (USDT) funds. (Source: Kaspersky ) One such wallet seen by Sytnik contained $8,000 in USDT on the Tron network as bait. To transfer the funds, potential thieves would need to send Tron (TRX), the blockchain's native token, to cover network fees. However, the bait wallet is set up as a multisignature wallet requiring multiple approvals for outgoing transactions. As soon as TRX is sent to the wallet, the funds are immediately transferred to another wallet controlled by the scammers. This setup ensures that even after paying the fees, the USDT cannot be transferred by the would-be thief. Sytnik compared the scammers to digital Robin Hoods, and he advised users never to try accessing others' wallets, even if provided with a seed phrase, and to remain cautious about claims from strangers online regarding cryptocurrency. This tactic is the latest in a series of scams that are designed to exploit greed in the crypto community. In July, Kaspersky uncovered an even more elaborate scheme involving Telegram links that led victims to legitimate-looking crypto exchanges, only to infect their devices with malware capable of stealing extensive data and assets. Crypto Event Data Leaks Spark Security Concerns Meanwhile, lists containing sensitive information about crypto industry event attendees are being sold online , and are posing serious risks for targeted scams and malicious activities. These lists are marketed as tools for “marketing and promoting and finding clients,” and include personal details like names, phone numbers, nationalities, job roles, companies, and social media profiles. Some even extend to ticket purchase data, operating systems used, follower counts, crypto wallet addresses, and messages sent to event organizers. The data seems to be gathered through event registration forms, particularly at conferences and side events using platforms like lu.ma, which often require social media account links. The events primarily took place in Southeast Asia and India during the fall of 2024, which suggests an organized international trade rather than isolated incidents. Sample of one list shared One sample included a list of 1,700 attendees from the AIBC conference in Malta, initially priced at $4,000 but later reduced to $650. The seller claimed the proceeds would be used to buy more lists from events like Coinfest and DevCon. Analysis suggests that the seller and data compiler may be Russian, based on certain language clues and AI assessments of their communication. While the seller argued that the data was not sensitive and that attendees might welcome marketing efforts, cybersecurity experts still warn that this information could facilitate social engineering scams and phishing attempts. AIBC founder Eman Pulis stated that the event has strict protocols against data breaches and pointed out that fraudulent databases are common in the industry. Although the source of the data is still unclear, it is evident that these lists are in demand among bad actors. FBI Links $300M Crypto Theft to TraderTraitor Group The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), along with the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) and Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA), recently shared details about how North Korean-linked hackers stole more than $300 million from the Japanese crypto exchange DMM in May. The theft involved 4,502.9 Bitcoin, valued at close to $305 million at the time of the hack. The FBI attributed the attack to the North Korean group TraderTraitor, which uses advanced social engineering techniques. In March, a North Korean hacker posed as a recruiter on LinkedIn, targeting an employee at Ginco, a Japan-based crypto wallet company. The hacker sent a malicious GitHub link disguised as a pre-employment test, which the employee copied to their personal GitHub account, compromising their access. After using the stolen credentials, the hackers infiltrated Ginco’s communications system in May and impersonated the compromised employee. They then manipulated a legitimate transaction request made by a DMM employee, which resulted in the theft of more than $300 million in Bitcoin. The stolen funds were transferred to wallets controlled by the TraderTraitor group.",NEGATIVE,USDT,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | USDT,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6713/phishing-attack-hijacks-15-x-accounts-and-nets-half-a-million-dollars,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

In just one month, it surged by 602%, reaching $0.03531, with a 13% rise in just the last 24 hours. This big jump follows the highly awaited airdrop of the Pudgy Penguins token, which has drawn lots of attention from traders and investors. Bithumb Listing Fuels PENGU’s Growth A key reason behind PENGU’s rise is its recent listing on Bithumb, one of South Korea’s top crypto exchanges. This has given the token even more exposure, helping its market cap grow to $2.2 billion . Perhaps the token’s 24-hour trading volume reached $1.54 billion, which is a 161% increase from the previous day. Although the token saw some early selling pressure, it quickly rebounded, hitting an all-time high of $0.06989 before settling around $0.03745. This surge is a clear reflection of growing investor confidence. Airdrop and Whale Activity Continues On December 24, 2024, PENGU saw another boost, rising 24% after Pudgy Penguins NFT sales jumped by 40%, reaching $1.38 million. Large whales have also been accumulating more PENGU tokens, helping to push the price higher. Recently, crypto analytics firm Lookonchain reported that one whale made a massive $8.4 million in profits in just 20 minutes by trading PENGU. Meanwhile, to keep the momentum going, Bithumb is planning an airdrop for PENGU t raders, offering 88,888,888 tokens to those who traded the tokens before December 25, 2024. The airdrop will be distributed on January 9, 2024. PENGU Price Analysis Despite its bullish movement, PENGU is facing some resistance, particularly with the continued selling pressure from early airdrop recipients. The token has dropped almost 44% from its all-time high but is still maintaining a positive trend. Key indicators show that PENGU is approaching critical resistance levels, and if it breaks through, it could see further gains, with analysts eyeing the psychological $0.04 level as the next milestone.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pengu-token-soars-602-in-just-one-month-fueled-by-upcoming-airdrop-news/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The analysis notes that Bitcoin’s recent correction following a 40% rally is in line with historical patterns observed in previous market cycles. Bitcoin is currently trading around 3% below its price from a month ago, with a recent high of $108,000. Corrections of 10% to 20% are common in a bull market, according to Matrixport, and often provide an ideal re-entry point for traders and investors. Related News: Developers on Solana Revealed the Altcoins Developers Are Most Focused on - Here's the List “If Bitcoin consolidates between $90,000 and $95,000, this range could represent an excellent correction zone,” Matrixport said. This range is within the -20% correction threshold, which the firm sees as a key indicator for resuming the bullish trend of the current market cycle. Matrixport predicts that maintaining the $90,000 to $95,000 consolidation range will provide a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s next phase of growth. If the price can stabilize in this range and sustain a broader uptrend, BTC could gain enough momentum for a renewed rally in 2025, the firm says. *This is not investment advice.

38088764,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53016,1735111818,"SUI Surges Past TON, but Rollblock Leads the Price Race in 2025","SUI and TON have been battling for dominance, with SUI briefly overtaking TON in market capitalization, hitting $13.58 billion. While these public chain tokens are making waves, Rollblock is carving its own path with explosive presale success. As a rising star in the crypto world, Rollblock’s innovative GambleFi platform is grabbing attention with its unique blend of gaming and blockchain. Rollblock is currently outshining other cryptocurrencies, leading the price jump race with its forward-thinking approach and unmatched growth potential. Rollblock offers steady increase Rollblock is emerging as a standout leader in the GambleFi space, targeting the $450 billion gambling industry with innovation and transparency. It supports over 7,000 games, live casinos, and sports betting markets, offering an unmatched experience for users. The platform’s weekly revenue-sharing model, powered by Ethereum-backed smart contracts, ensures secure and transparent transactions. During its presale, Rollblock secured $7.5 million , with RBLK tokens predicted to deliver 10x to 100x returns. Investors benefit from token burns and staking rewards, which reduce supply and promote long-term sustainability. Rewards are directly tied to the platform’s performance, making participation highly rewarding. Unlike SUI and TON , which focus on public chain applications, Rollblock brings real-world utility and unique earning opportunities. Its innovative approach and strong growth potential position Rollblock as a leader in the price jump race, making it a standout in the rapidly evolving crypto market. SUI briefly took the lead This crypto briefly surpassed TON in market cap , reaching $13.58 billion on December 21, 2024. It is currently trading at $5.50, reflecting an 2% gain in the last 24 hours. With $66.490 million in liquidity , SUI maintains strong trading activity. Known for its quick transactions and object-centric blockchain model, this crypto excels in NFT and digital asset management. Its partnership with Ant Digital aims to tokenize ESG-backed real-world assets, showcasing its potential for innovation. However, despite these gains, this crypto lacks Rollblock’s consistent investor rewards and practical use cases, which set Rollblock apart in the market. TON is resilient but lagging behind This cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $13.54 billion on December 21, 2024, is closely trailing SUI in valuation. Built on the Telegram Open Network, it focuses on secure, high-speed blockchain solutions for decentralized applications, making it a solid choice for developers. At the time of writing, TON has $23.992 million in liquidity , ensuring active trading. However, it struggled to reclaim the lead due to SUI ’s recent rise and the growing appeal. While TON offers a robust platform, it lacks Rollblock’s innovative approach and focus on the untapped potential of the gambling market, where Rollblock excels. Conclusion Each crypto brings unique strengths to the crypto market, catering to different investor needs. However, Rollblock sets itself apart with its explosive growth and tangible benefits for its community. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Rollblock delivers a blend of innovation and consistent rewards that make it a standout. With its fiery presale and forward-thinking approach, Rollblock leads the price jump race and positions itself as a top contender for success in the near future.

38087913,https://crypto.news/?p=14322102,1735111577,Russia’s central bank to combat illegal crypto OTC services with new surveillance platform: report,"Russia’s central bank is set to develop a new platform that would help it crack down on illegal crypto OTC services and suspicious financial activities. The central bank of Russia is reportedly planning to create a new platform aimed at making it more difficult for shadow businesses to misuse banking services for illegal activities, including crypto-to-fiat over-the-counter platforms that bypass KYC procedures. The Bank of Russia is collaborating with the country’s financial watchdog Rosfinmonitoring, banks, and local experts to create a system that would help identify and block customers involved in illegal financial transactions, Russia’s news outlet RBC reports , citing Bogdan Shablya, head of the financial monitoring and currency control service at the Bank of Russia. The platform will reportedly allow the central bank to share information about suspicious activities with financial lenders, helping them prevent illegal financial dealings. The focus is on individuals — also known as “droppers” — who offer their bank cards for money laundering or illegal activities, including transactions for drugs, online casinos, crypto exchanges/OTC services, or pirated websites. You might also like: Russia to impose regional controls over crypto mining starting Jan 2025 Centralized database Shablya explained that the central bank has already set up online monitoring systems with certain banks to track individual transactions. However, at the moment, it can only share information about “droppers” with the banks where these clients hold accounts. Since bad actors often open accounts in multiple banks, there is a need to centralize data and “share information with all credit institutions,” Shablya added. At the moment, banks do not have the authority to refuse a person an account based solely on information suggesting they may be involved in drop activities. The most a bank can currently do is open an account and block remote banking services for that account. However, these decisions are often made after suspicious transactions have already occurred, Shablya explained. The timeline for the platform’s launch is unclear, as Shablya mentioned that the issue “is still under development” and emphasized that the central bank aims to find an “acceptable solution” that addresses the problem without creating social tension or affecting honest citizens.

38087657,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397604,1735111099,Canadian Firm Matador Technologies Invests $4.5M in Bitcoin,"The post Canadian Firm Matador Technologies Invests $4.5M in Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Matador Technologies has decided to bring Bitcoin into its treasury. This isn’t some random gamble. The company is making a clear statement about where it sees the future heading. But why choose Bitcoin, and what does this mean for the broader financial world? Let’s unpack it. Matador’s New Treasury Strategy Last week, digital assets attracted a massive $308 million in investments. It’s no surprise that companies like Matador are paying attention. The Canadian firm, known for turning physical assets into digital ones, just announced its plan to add Bitcoin to its treasury. This isn’t just about jumping on a crypto trend. The company’s Board of Directors approved the move unanimously, seeing it as a way to protect their cash reserves. Why? Matador says Canada’s economy is too tied to oil exports, and the rising national debt makes the Canadian dollar less reliable. To address these risks, Matador plans to invest $4.5 million in Bitcoin by the end of 2024. They’re also shifting much of their cash reserves from Canadian dollars into US dollars. It’s all part of a bigger strategy to safeguard their financial future. Why Bitcoin? For Matador, Bitcoin isn’t just another asset. They see it as a way to stay ahead in a shaky global economy. Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it resistant to inflation. That’s a big deal when traditional currencies are losing their purchasing power. And Bitcoin’s role doesn’t stop there. Matador plans to use it for their upcoming digital gold platform. Set to launch in 2025, this blockchain-based platform will allow users to buy and trade tokenized gold, with reserves stored at the Royal Canadian Mint. Bitcoin’s security and trustworthiness make it the ideal foundation for the platform. Institutions are diving into Bitcoin don’t miss out! Read Bitcoin price prediction and stay ahead of the game! Sunny Ray, Matador’s President, sees Bitcoin as key to the company’s future. CEO Deven Soni agrees, saying it fits perfectly with Matador’s values of trust and permanence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Angel Investor Warn Against MicroStrategy Buying Too Much Bitcoin , What’s Next? Matador isn’t planning a one-time Bitcoin purchase. They’ll be buying more gradually over time. By early 2025, they’ll decide on the technology powering their digital gold platform. After that, the platform will launch, with a limited release at first. For shareholders, the company promises updates on how they’re handling their treasury and platform development. Matador’s shift isn’t just about Bitcoin—it’s about adapting to a new era in finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This Top Crypto Presale’s Limited 50% Festive Bonus Offers Your Next Big Shot at Wealth!,"In the world of cryptocurrencies, missed opportunities are the norm rather than the exception. Imagine getting in on Dogwifhat (WIF) when it debuted at mere pennies. Fast-forward to today, and early adopters are laughing their way to the bank. But while WIF’s ship may have sailed, there’s a new contender in town. This is BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a presale powerhouse promising explosive gains and unparalleled community-driven opportunities. If you missed the WIF wave, don’t make the same mistake twice—BTFD’s festive 50% discount is your second chance at riding the crypto success train. The Revolutionary Rise of BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin with Utility and Community BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement that embodies the mantra of seasoned investors: Buy The Dip . Built on Ethereum for top-tier security and scalability, BTFD is designed to turn market volatility into profit. Its presale, already in its 12th stage, offers the rare opportunity to snag tokens at a rollback price of $0.000064—a massive 50.77% discount thanks to the festive promotion. Use the bonus code BIG50, and you’re all set to join over 6,500 Bulls who’ve already seized the dip. A Wealth of Opportunities for Investors BTFD’s ecosystem isn’t just about holding tokens; it’s about active growth. With a 90% APY staking program that launched on December 2, investors are earning even before the token hits major exchanges. Add in the beta launch of its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which has seen a surge of community engagement, and it’s clear BTFD is poised to dominate the meme coin space. The game promises immersive challenges and in-game rewards, seamlessly connecting fun with financial growth. The Bulls Squad, an enthusiastic community of dip-chasers, adds a unique social layer to this coin. With referral rewards offering 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens for top leaderboard contributors, there’s even more incentive to spread the word. And analysts’ predictions? A jaw-dropping post-presale listing price of $0.0006, offering investors an ROI of 837.5%. Crunching the Numbers: A $3,000 Investment Example Let’s break it down. Invest $3,000 in BTFD at the Stage 12 price of $0.000064 per token, and you’ll own over 46.87 million tokens. By the presale’s end, with a projected listing price of $0.0006, your holdings could soar to $28,122. That’s the kind of return you don’t see every day. Simple Steps to Join the BTFD Movement at Huge Discount Visit the official BTFD presale page . Connect your wallet via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Enter the bonus code BIG50 to unlock the discounted price. Input your desired purchase amount. Confirm your transaction and join the Bulls Squad. If you’ve been waiting for a sign, this is it. BTFD’s presale isn’t just a chance—it’s a strategy to get ahead before the bull market roars back to life. Dogwifhat (WIF): The One That Got Away Dogwifhat made waves earlier this year with its quirky premise and community-driven approach. Born on the Solana blockchain, WIF’s popularity exploded following its November listing on Robinhood, sparking a rally that catapulted its price to $4.85 at its peak. From its roots as a light-hearted meme coin, Dogwifhat transformed into a serious contender in the crypto space, driven by its innovative marketing—remember the Las Vegas Sphere logo stunt? The Early Wealth Generators Those who bought WIF during its crowdfunding campaign—when it was priced below $1—saw astronomical gains. A $1,000 investment back then turned into tens of thousands within months. However, like many meme coins, WIF’s high volatility caught many latecomers off guard. Its current price of $1.98 reflects a more stabilised market, but it’s clear that the biggest profits were reserved for those who got in early. The Takeaway Dogwifhat’s story is a classic case of seizing opportunities when they arise. Those who hesitated missed out on life-changing returns. While WIF remains a significant player, its best days might be behind it. For new investors looking for the next breakout star, the search leads back to BTFD Coin—an opportunity to rewrite the narrative and make the most of a Top Crypto Presale. Why BTFD Coin Is Your Next Best Bet If WIF’s rise taught us anything, it’s that timing is everything. BTFD Coin, with its robust ecosystem, community-driven incentives, and potential for massive ROI, offers a second chance for those who missed the WIF boat. The presale is designed to empower early adopters with discounted prices, high staking rewards, and an engaged community ready to take on the bull market. Act now—before the presale ends and the window closes. The dip is here, and with BTFD, it’s yours to seize. Join the Top Crypto Presale right now and become part of a movement that’s turning market dips into stepping stones to wealth. Don’t miss out on the next big crypto story.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-fuks-santa-muskfsan-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The asset now remains below $3,500, which has turned into a key resistance line. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the price has entered a bullish phase since the beginning of November after rebounding from the $2,300 support level. However, the $4,000 resistance zone has rejected the market to the downside, with the $3,500 level also being lost. Currently, it is likely for the market to drop toward the $3,000 support zone and the 200-day moving average, located around the same price mark. As long as ETH trades above the 200-day moving average, the overall market trend can be considered bullish. Otherwise, a deeper drop toward the $2,000 area could be expected. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the market has failed to break above the $4,000 resistance level twice, forming a clear double-top pattern. With the neckline of the pattern, which is the $3,500 level, broken to the downside and the RSI showing bearish momentum, the market could correct more or even consolidate in the coming weeks before it is able to continue its upward trajectory. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio While Ethereum’s price has been struggling to continue its rally and create a new all-time high, analyzing the futures market sentiment could yield helpful insights about the potential reasons behind this correction and whether it will be over soon or not. This chart presents the Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric, which measures whether the buyers or the sellers are executing their positions more aggressively on aggregate, using market orders. As the chart suggests, the 100-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has been showing values below one for over a year now, with the metric currently experiencing a massive drop. This indicates that the recent correction might be due to the selling pressure coming from the futures market rather than the spot market, and as long as the metric is trending down, it will be difficult for the market to recover.

Having final tokens at a discounted presale price makes it suitable for traders or analysts seeking opportunities in financial markets.

In addition, yPredict is also one of the best options because of its original concept of AI combined with blockchain. For those seeking the next crypto to explode, yPredict offers promising potential during the next crypto bull run. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG offers a fundamentally new method of improving the scalability of a Blockchain system via its distributed network. By dispensing with traditional bottlenecks, BlockDAG allows for fast transactions with sound security. A presale token of $0.005 is a ready entry for anyone looking for an opportunity to create wealth with expandable blockchain solutions.

38086860,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/japanese-analyst-announced-these-three-will-drive-bitcoin-in-2025/,1735109466,Japanese Analyst Announced: These Three Will Drive Bitcoin in 2025,"As Bitcoin reaches $98,000, Yuya Hasegawa, an analyst at Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Bitbank, identified three main factors that could shape the crypto market in 2025: the Trump administration's cryptocurrency policy, the Fed's monetary policy, and the growing debt burden of the US government. Trump Administration's Cryptocurrency Policy The direction of cryptocurrency policy under the Trump administration is expected to dominate market sentiment in 2025. Proposals such as a strategic Bitcoin reserve plan and the appointment of pro-crypto officials are likely to have a direct impact on the price trends of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin. Market participants are closely following updates on these developments, which could determine whether the U.S. will take a more positive stance on crypto adoption. FED Monetary Policy The Fed’s monetary policy continues to be a major factor influencing Bitcoin prices. Historically, loose monetary policies have supported Bitcoin’s growth, while tighter policies have put downward pressure. Despite a 100 basis point rate cut this year, the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs of 10%-20% on imported goods and up to 60% on Chinese imports could increase inflationary pressures. This scenario could force the Fed to maintain higher interest rates, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s appeal as an inflation hedge. Related News: Developers on Solana Revealed the Altcoins Developers Are Most Focused on - Here's the List US Government Debt and the Safe Haven Appeal of Bitcoin The US government debt crisis is emerging as a new focal point for markets. Hasegawa notes that higher interest rates will significantly increase the government debt burden. If concerns about debt sustainability grow, especially if the strategic Bitcoin reserve plan is implemented, Bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold” could grow. Such a move could strengthen Bitcoin’s safe haven status and further boost its value. *This is not investment advice.

38086802,https://crypto.news/?p=14322104,1735109286,"Bitcoin rally signal: XRP, SOL, NEAR, DOGEN, and DOT poised to explode","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin’s recent surge hints at a market shift, raising speculation that altcoins like DOGEN, XRP, Solana, and Polkadot could see major gains. Table of Contents DOGEN: The meme token for alphas who play to win XRP: A borderless cryptocurrency changing seamless transactions Solana: A high-performance blockchain platform for scalable decentralized applications NEAR Protocol: A scalable platform for decentralized applications Polkadot: Enhancing blockchain communication and scalability Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent rise suggests a potential shift in the cryptocurrency market. Is this a sign that other digital coins like XRP, Solana, Near Protocol, DOGEN, and Polkadot are about to see significant gains? This article explores whether these altcoins are poised for explosive growth, following in Bitcoin’s footsteps. DOGEN: The meme token for alphas who play to win Imagine the life others can only fantasize about — sleek cars, overflowing bank accounts, and an aura that turns heads eveywhere. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle, a token that doesn’t just promise gains; it promises a movement for those who refuse to settle for mediocrity. DOGEN isn’t for the faint-hearted; it’s for true alphas who dominate every space they enter. For those ready to lead and not follow, this meme token is their chance to rewrite the rules. You might also like: ETH and FLOKI set for breakouts, DOGEN smashes records with $4M presale Unleash the beast: Hold, dominate, conquer This isn’t just another token — it’s the spark to ignite your empire. With a projected 700% surge even before the presale wraps up, DOGEN is on track to shatter records. Thousand-fold gains? That’s the terrain DOGEN is built for. The question isn’t whether someone will win; it’s whether they’ll claim their spot early enough to lead the charge. Forget regrets. This is the DOGEN era WIF, Popcat, Ponke — they had their moments, but DOGEN is the new apex predator on the Solana blockchain. As others bask in nostalgia, DOGEN is setting its sights on uncharted heights, ready to dominate the memetoken bull run like no other. Join the DOGEN army, win big, live legendary DOGEN isn’t just a token; it’s a movement. Flex a DOGEN spirit across socials, stack up during the presale, and recruit a squad with a powerful referral link. Every ally a user brings into the fold earns 20% of their Golden Points because alphas lift their pack while securing their throne. XRP: A borderless cryptocurrency changing seamless transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger, designed to offer fast, low-cost, and globally accessible transactions. With its ability to process secure and irreversible payments without the need for a central authority, XRP caters to a broad range of users, including those without access to traditional banking systems. This inclusivity positions XRP as a powerful tool for financial transactions across borders. Launched by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was introduced with a fixed supply of 100 billion units. Ripple, the company originally known as OpenCoin Inc., was allocated 80 billion XRP to foster ecosystem development and enhance network liquidity. To maintain supply control, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow, releasing portions periodically. The name XRP, derived from “ripple credits,” reflects its goal of facilitating seamless payment transfers between different currencies and financial systems. Solana: A high-performance blockchain platform for scalable decentralized applications Solana is a high-speed blockchain platform designed to support the development of scalable decentralized applications (dApps). Competing with networks like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana distinguishes itself through its unique architecture, which eliminates the need for sharding or second-layer solutions. This unique design enables Solana to achieve impressive throughput, allowing developers to create robust applications using various programming languages. The platform’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, plays a vital role within its ecosystem. SOL is used for transaction fees, running custom programs, and incentivizing participants in the network. Beyond its utility, SOL holds significant value as it underpins the Solana ecosystem, powering an array of projects ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to NFT marketplaces. NEAR Protocol: A scalable platform for decentralized applications NEAR Protocol is a blockchain designed to help developers create and launch decentralized applications. It uses a sharding technology called Nightshade to improve speed and scalability. NEAR operates on a distributed network similar to centralized data storage systems but is decentralized. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, it has raised over $20 million from major venture firms. It features the Rainbow Bridge, which allows token transfers with Ethereum, and Aurora, a Layer 2 solution that uses Ethereum’s technology for better performance and lower fees. NEAR’s focus on scalability and interoperability addresses key challenges in the blockchain industry. In the current market cycle, such technologies are drawing significant interest. Polkadot: Enhancing blockchain communication and scalability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that allows different blockchains to communicate and share data. It lets value and information move between blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Polkadot uses parachains to improve speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its token, DOT, is used for governance and staking, letting holders take part in network decisions and transaction verification. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-creator of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot aims to create a more connected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. Given its innovative approach, Polkadot’s technology has significant potential, which is noteworthy in the current market cycle. Conclusion While XRP, SOL, NEAR, and DOT show limited short-term growth, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN is poised for a 700% presale growth and possible thousand-fold returns. Following in the footsteps of BONK, WIF, and Popcat, it builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits with exclusive perks for early adopters.

The accounts were used to control meme coin scams by obtaining phishing email credentials. 1/3 A threat actor has stolen ~$500K over the past month by compromising 15+ X accounts (Kick, Cursor, Alex Blania, The Arena, Brett, etc) from sending targeted phishing emails which impersonated the X team to steal credentials and then launch meme coin scams. pic.twitter.com/HEWQdVICgJ — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) December 24, 2024 Phishing Scheme Unveiled In regards to this heist, the hackers mimicked the official emails of the X team and faked a copyright infringement to make sure the targets immediately rushed to buy the meme coins. People were enticed to go to fake pages where they were redirected to provide new passcodes for accounts, including two-factor authentication (2FA) . After the accounts were compromised, the attacker engaged in meme coin scams, correlating all 15 ATOs through a single shared deployer address. Funds stolen in these scams were then transferred across the Solana-Ethereum blockchain to make it harder for law enforcers to track down the assets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Hyperliquid Faces $500M Outflows Amidst Lazarus Group Hack Fears , Security Recommendations ZachXBT encouraged the users to rush with the account strengthening to minimise such risks. Key recommendations include: Avoid email reuse: Do not use one email address for different services. Implement strong 2FA: Use it instead of the SMS code 2FA for important accounts, resorting to a security key instead. Verify communications: Confirm the authenticity of all emails especially those in the name of official forums. It’s important that the crypto community stays on the watch and continues fighting to put an end to such activities from scammers. In particular, it aligns well with the current state of security affairs, a solid defense is the only effective means against ever-burgeoning cyber threats. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38086994,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52901,1735108221,Toncoin Challenges TRON’s Position as Crypto Investment Momentum Grows for Lunex,"While Lunex Network continues its rapidly gaining crypto pre-ICO phase, Toncoin ( TON ) and TRON (TRX) continue competing for the best crypto investment in December 2024. Lunex is available at $0.0048 in its presale phase and has already generated over $5.4 million, with 2 billion LNEX tokens sold. Read more about Lunex to understand why AI crypto investors are backing It for explosive growth. Lunex consolidates market position by breaking the $4 million revenue goal Lunex Network ($LNEX) has been making waves during its presale, attracting traders and investors from across the crypto space. But what makes this new protocol stand out? A hybrid DeFi crypto that maximizes the best features of decentralized and centralized, with $LNEX at its core, a token designed for stability and long-term growth. Its advanced smart contract system enables seamless swaps across over 50,000 assets, providing fast execution speeds and minimal gas fees.

Toncoin holders anticipate December new high Toncoin ( TON ) has been one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market in a week where large-cap assets have shown slow movement. After a sluggish start to November, TON has begun to show strong momentum, with impressive gains. Yet, investors remain unsure whether to go long, showing caution about TON’s sustainability. On-chain signals for Toncoin’s price are currently bullish, particularly the “90-day percent return,” a metric that tracks the price change over the last 90 days and offers insight into TON’s short-term trend and momentum. According to data from CryptoQuant, TON’s 90-day percent return recently turned positive, reflecting the upward movement in its price. Historically, when this metric shifts to positive territory, it’s often followed by solid momentum in price action. The recent shift in TON’s 90-day percent return signals growing investor confidence. More investors are willing to hold their $ TON, anticipating higher prices and continuing the bullish trend. Another key on-chain signal supporting this positive outlook for Toncoin price is the percentage change in open interest, which also positively flipped. Caution ahead for TRON (TRX) despite price surge The 180-day Sharpe ratio for TRON ( TRX ) recently spiked, signaling potential market volatility ahead. Historically, fluctuations in TRX’s Sharpe ratio have often indicated price tops for its TRX token, making it an essential tool for traders looking to understand market dynamics. The current high-risk alert suggests that while TRX’s price may continue to rise, the downside risks increase significantly at its current valuation levels. Despite the price surge, on-chain analytics for TRX show a significant decline in both whale and institutional transactions, coinciding with the recent price fluctuations. For example, large TRX holder inflows and outflows peaked in mid-November but have since decreased, signaling a reduction in interest from major investors. On November 27, the data revealed just 205.77 million TRX in inflows compared to 159.87 million TRX in outflows, indicating a shift in net demand that favors sellers. While TRX continues to face stiff competition from TON , Lunex’s growth in presale and generous offerings continue to attract investors and traders as the best crypto investment . Lunex is the best investment ahead of TON and TRX for investors looking to end the year with a bang.

Calacanis warned that Bitcoin’s core principle of decentralization could be compromised if a single entity holds too much of the digital asset. In the meantime, bitcoin price has recorded a 4% gain in the last 24 hours with the market cap hitting $1.94 trillion. MicroStrategy Bold Plan Buy ALL Bitcoin MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has been one of Bitcoin’s biggest supporters, steadily growing its holdings. The company recently bought 5,262 BTC for $561 million, paying an average price of $106,662 per Bitcoin. This brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 444,262 BTC. Despite holding about 2.2% of Bitcoin’s total supply , the firm’s recent statement about wanting the ability to issue enough shares to buy all the Bitcoin in circulation has sparked concerns. Saylor has made it clear that his ultimate goal is to own $3 trillion worth of Bitcoin. He also believes that MicroStrategy’s market cap could rise to $10 trillion. This strategy isn’t just about growing the company’s asset base. It’s also a calculated move to boost their investment in Bitcoin, Michael Saylor says he’s going to keep raising billions in cheap capital until MicroStrategy owns at least $3 trillion in Bitcoin and has a market cap of $10 trillion dollars.

He suggested that users might leave Bitcoin and look for another cryptocurrency that feels more fair and decentralized.

Toncoin: Rising Star in Blockchain Toncoin (TON), originally developed by Telegram, is carving out a significant niche in the blockchain space. Its focus on user-friendly decentralized applications and secure transactions has made it a favorite among developers and investors alike. Analysts are predicting a rally beyond $10 by 2025, and Toncoin’s consistent network upgrades suggest it’s well on its way. What sets Toncoin apart is its accessibility.

The recent integration of its Secure Value Relay (SVR) proposal has opened new doors for developers, enabling more secure and efficient smart contract execution. This move has already boosted LINK’s market performance, making it a top contender in the crypto space. Chainlink’s ability to provide reliable off-chain data for smart contracts has always been its strength. With SVR, it’s taking security and scalability to the next level, addressing some of the most pressing concerns in DeFi. If you’re looking for a project that combines cutting-edge technology with real-world applications, Chainlink should be at the top of your list.

38086993,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53087,1735106483,Cardano (ADA) Historical Pattern Hints At Massive Breakout. Here’s the Price Target,"Cardano is the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and has sparked renewed interest due to its recent price trends. A crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, has identified a pattern in ADA’s performance that mirrors a significant historical cycle. If this trend holds, ADA’s price could rise significantly, potentially reaching $6. Analyst Predicts $6 Price Target Ali highlighted that Cardano’s current correction phase closely resembles its market behavior during the early stages of its previous bull cycle in 2020. The analyst says if this historical pattern repeats, ADA could climb to $6, representing a substantial increase from its current levels. The asset is currently trading at $0.8968, reflecting a 3.8% increase over the past 24 hours and an 18.70% decline over the past week. This drop contributed to $246 million in total cryptocurrency liquidations. Recent Cardano (ADA) Price Movements After experiencing a four-day losing streak, Cardano saw a brief recovery on Friday, rebounding from a low of $0.762. However, this momentum stalled at $0.997 on Saturday before further declines pushed the price down to $0.869 on Sunday, nearing the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Holding above the $0.869 support level remains critical for ADA’s short-term outlook. A breakdown below this level could trigger further declines, with potential targets at $0.76, $0.69, or even $0.50. On the other hand, sustained recovery could position ADA to challenge the $1 resistance zone. Plomin Hard Fork In addition to price movements, the asset is advancing its ecosystem development with the upcoming Plomin hard fork. Intersect, a member-driven organization within the ecosystem, recently announced that the governance action for the Plomin upgrade has been submitted on-chain for approval by Input Output Global (IOG), Cardano’s stake pool operators (SPOs), and Intersect Constitutional Committee (ICC). The Plomin hard fork is a critical step in enabling full on-chain governance as outlined in Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP)-1694. This upgrade marks the conclusion of Cardano’s technical bootstrapping phase and the introduction of its final governance features. Once implemented, the system will allow for the submission of a community-endorsed Constitution on-chain for broader consideration. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Timeline for the Plomin Hard Fork Intersect has provided a timeline for when the hard fork could take effect if ratified by the SPOs and ICC. The proposed governance action was submitted in epoch 529, setting the earliest possible implementation date as January 4, 2025. Additional potential enactment dates include January 9, 14, 19, 24, and 29, depending on the time taken for ratification and other procedural requirements. The shortest possible period between submitting the governance action and its enactment is just over two epochs, although this is considered rare. By aligning with the epoch 529 timeline, the process maximizes the opportunities for SPOs and the ICC to vote on ratification. Cardano’s current market performance and its potential for significant price increases are complemented by its ongoing ecosystem upgrades, including the Plomin hard fork. While the $6 price target offers an optimistic outlook for ADA investors, it is important to remain cautious, as cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and outcomes are never guaranteed. The forthcoming governance developments could play a pivotal role in shaping the token’s long-term trajectory.

38085289,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397576,1735106194,XRP Price Prediction For November 25,"The post XRP Price Prediction For November 25 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s XRP has shown FAa slight upward reaction, responding to a micro support region defined between $2.24 and $2.21. While this price movement is positive, it does not appear impulsive. Nevertheless, XRP has been printing higher highs and higher lows since reacting to the support zone, signaling some bullish momentum. Fibonacci Targets and Ideal Price Move The current price action is part of an internal wave, and the ideal target for the C-wave of the D-wave is around $2.59. Although it’s uncertain whether the price will reach this level, this Fibonacci extension represents a reasonable milestone target. If this ABC structure plays out, we should see the price move towards this level before completing the larger wave pattern. Following this, an E-wave could set a higher low, paving the way for a potential breakout. Possible Triangle Pattern and Confirmation Needed The current price action could unfold into a triangle pattern, which is another potential scenario. If this is the case, the D-wave may eventually break out to the upside. However, to confirm this, the price must break above the previous A-wave high at $2.38-$2.39. If XRP fails to surpass this level, there is a possibility that the market is developing a different structure, such as the B-wave. Bullish and Alternative Wave Counts In the bullish triangle scenario, the pattern would involve waves A, B, C, D, and E, with no lower lows—just lower highs and higher lows before an upward move. Alternatively, in the blue wave count, we could be seeing a larger correction with a WX-Y structure, where the Y-wave could evolve into a triangle pattern. This scenario remains speculative at this stage, but it’s essential to consider as a potential market development. Key Levels to Watch: Support and Invalidation Points So far, support is holding strong. To invalidate the current bullish outlook, XRP would need to break below $2.24, followed by a drop below the swing low at $1.94, which occurred on December 20th. If these levels are breached, the blue wave count could become more likely, potentially leading to further downside and a move towards the Fibonacci target area between $1.80 and $1.39. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CTO David Schwartz Shares Insights on Crypto Staking Amid Tax Debate , Larger Time Frame: Long-Term Outlook On the larger time frame, if XRP continues its sideways movement or forms a wave four correction as outlined earlier, the overall pattern still suggests at least one more high, and potentially two, before completing the current wave structure.

XRP: A fast and borderless cryptocurrency for seamless transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and accessible worldwide. XRP enables secure and irreversible transactions without a central authority. Users do not need a bank account for settlements, making it inclusive. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion units. Ripple, initially called OpenCoin Inc., received 80 billion XRP to develop the ecosystem and improve network liquidity. They placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control the supply release. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” reflecting its goal to facilitate smooth payment transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP’s features may make it an attractive option. Conclusion Although XRP and similar coins show less short-term potential, DOGEN distinguishes itself for those pursuing luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale’s end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN is creating a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

38093131,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322566,1735105233,Montenegro’s Constitutional Court Rejects Do Kwon’s Appeal Against Extradition Verdict,"Montenegro’s Constitutional Court has rejected an appeal by Kwon Do-hyeong, widely known as Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs and a central figure in the collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin and its linked token, Luna. The court’s decision, reported on December 24 by local outlet Vijesti , upheld the authority of the country’s Minister of Justice to oversee extradition matters, dealing a blow to Kwon’s efforts to challenge the proceedings. Kwon’s appeal targeted a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated his transfer to South Korea, delegating the decision on extradition to Justice Minister Bojan Božović. Kwon’s Legal Team Said the Ruling Violated Procedural Fairness His legal team argued the ruling violated procedural fairness and his rights to a fair trial and family life. However, the Constitutional Court found no merit in these claims, clearing the path for the Justice Minister to determine Kwon’s fate. Local reports indicate that Montenegro’s authorities may lean toward extraditing him to the United States rather than South Korea, with analysts suggesting national interests could play a decisive role. Kwon, accused of causing financial losses exceeding $34 billion in the Terra-Luna crash, has been under scrutiny since fleeing South Korea in 2022. After traveling through Singapore, the UAE, and Serbia, he was arrested in Montenegro for using a forged passport. Montenegrin court rejects Do Kwon's constitutional appeal, faces extradition to the US The constitutional complaint filed by Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon in Montenegro has been rejected. Do Kwon's side claimed that the extradition procedure was unfair and that there were err… — Bpay News (@bpaynews) December 25, 2024 Despite the ruling, Kwon’s legal team is expected to continue efforts to block his extradition to the U.S., where he faces multiple charges. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities have urged Montenegro to expedite the process, expressing concerns about potential human rights violations if the proceedings are prolonged. The timeline for Kwon’s extradition remains uncertain, but the court’s decision has significantly narrowed his legal options. Judge Signs Off on $4.5B Terraform, Do Kwon Settlement with SEC In June, U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) approved a settlement that will require Terraform Labs and Kwon to pay a staggering $4.5 billion in disgorgement and civil penalties. Additionally, they will be permanently banned from engaging in any transactions involving “crypto asset securities,” which includes tokens within the Terra ecosystem. The settlement came after initial proposals from the SEC suggested a $5.3 billion penalty, which Terraform Labs contested by advocating for a maximum fine of $1 million. Ultimately, on June 6, the legal representatives for both Kwon and Terraform Labs agreed to the SEC’s revised settlement offer of $4.5 billion. It is important to note that Kwon, who is currently in custody in Montenegro awaiting a decision on his extradition, did not attend the trial where the settlement was reached. Terraform Labs, currently operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, faces the challenge of how to fulfill the substantial financial obligations imposed by the settlement. According to the trial testimony of the company’s current CEO, Chris Amani, Terraform Labs has approximately $150 million in assets. However, it remains uncertain how the company will manage to pay the substantial fines imposed by the settlement.

RCO Finance set to disrupt DeFi landscape with AI-Powered tools Making institutional investment accessible for everyone Conclusion As the year draws to an end, the XRP price is making news, approaching its all-time high of $3.40, a mark it attained nearly seven years ago. Analysts are now hopeful about the token’s prospects, with an almost 300% rise year-to-date that positions the fourth-largest cryptocurrency for new records. XRP to reach $5 on Christmas Day? After a recent major decline of 9% in the last two weeks, the XRP price has increased by 3.4% to $2.25 within just 24 hours, ending the week above essential support levels. This recovery sets the XRP price to maintain its remarkable upward trend, having increased more than 100% since November 5, aligning with the political changes in the United States. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez emphasized the significance of the $2.20 support level, stating that as long as the XRP price holds above this mark, it could consolidate prior to aiming for the $2.70 resistance. The analyst thinks that if the XRP price falls below $2.20, it might lead to a drop to $1.96. Martinez also observed an increase in whale activity, with major acquisitions of 80 million tokens since December 17, indicating positive sentiment for XRP. Notably, in a recent poll conducted by market analyst CryptoinsightUK on social media site X (formerly Twitter), a majority of respondents anticipated the XRP price would reclaim the $3.30 level by Christmas day. However, the analyst projected a possible new all-time high of $5 for the XRP price by December 24, with bold expectations of hitting $10 and more from January to March 2025. In the midst of these optimistic predictions for the XRP price, a new contender is rising in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space: RCO Finance. Scheduled for launch in 2025, the platform’s native token RCOF will introduce a range of cutting-edge products and tools, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technology to present investors with distinct chances to grow their portfolios and improve capital returns. RCO Finance set to disrupt DeFi landscape with AI-Powered tools In contrast to XRP, which fulfills particular use cases like cross-border payments and gas fee transactions on the XRP Ledger, RCO Finance seeks to make advanced investment strategies accessible to everyone. The platform provides tailored investment strategies, extensive asset availability, a KYC-free financial environment, AI-driven market modifications, and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). RCO Finance’s no-code automated tool allows users, irrespective of their financial expertise, to improve their investments without depending on brokers or intermediaries. This convenient accessibility particularly appeals to new investors looking to capitalize on market trends, which amid the current bullish cycle, provides a crucial opportunity for further portfolio growth. Interestingly, the platform also provides access to an extensive selection of more than 120,000 assets spanning 12,500 categories, featuring conventional investments such as stocks and bonds, alongside digital assets and tokenized real-world items. Making institutional investment accessible for everyone A notable aspect of RCO Finance is its know-you-customer (KYC)-free environment, which emphasizes user privacy and removes lengthy identity verification procedures. This aspect is especially appealing to investors who prioritize anonymity and want to participate in decentralized finance without the usual onboarding challenges. The platform’s AI technology also offers immediate portfolio modifications in response to market changes and user activity, allowing traders to take advantage of new trends without needing to monitor constantly, a vital benefit during unstable market situations. Yet, one of the most appealing tools for investors is the platform’s capacity to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), enabling users to invest in products such as real estate and commodities via blockchain tokens. This fractional ownership model opens up markets that were previously inaccessible to regular traders and reserved for institutions, enabling investors to participate without needing a large amount of capital. Conclusion Overall, RCO Finance is poised to tap into several growth trends intersecting crypto and AI, offering a comprehensive suite of tools that present a unique opportunity for investors. While the XRP price is forecasted to surge, RCO Finance distinguishes itself with its innovative offerings. Currently, the RCOF token is valued at $0.077 in its fourth presale stage, with predictions suggesting it could rise to $0.214 in the next bonus round, representing a nearly 200% return for early investors to capitalize on this once in a lifetime opportunity.

38093130,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322529,1735103598,Japanese Giant Metaplanet Snaps Up 60 Million Bitcoin – Could This Trigger a Bull Run?,"Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has recently completed its largest-ever Bitcoin purchase, acquiring 619.7 BTC for ¥9.5 billion ($60.5 million). This move marks a significant step in Metaplanet’s growing BTC treasury strategy, following its decision to issue debt and buy more BTC. This brings the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,761.98 BTC, valued at over $164 million at current prices. Metaplanet’s strategy closely mirrors that of MicroStrategy, the U.S.-based software company that has made BTC a key asset on its balance sheet. *Metaplanet purchases additional 619.70 BTC* pic.twitter.com/5npflMJ3kW — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) December 23, 2024 MicroStrategy began buying BTC in 2020, following a similar strategy aimed at boosting shareholder value. Today, MicroStrategy holds 444,262 BTC, worth over $41 billion. A Bold Strategy to Boost Value Metaplanet’s decision to increase its Bitcoin purchases has drawn attention, especially in light of its plans to secure its BTC holdings and position itself as a leading player in Japan’s Bitcoin ecosystem. While the move has been praised by some, the firm faced pushback from investors, with its stock price dropping significantly last week. This reaction was partly triggered by concerns over the firm becoming a “Bitcoin treasury,” similar to MicroStrategy’s model. Despite the mixed reception, Metaplanet’s strategy indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. By amassing significant Bitcoin reserves, Metaplanet aims to leverage the digital asset as a store of value. This bold move is likely to influence other firms in Japan, as the country’s cryptocurrency market continues to evolve. Bitcoin’s Market Outlook: Can It Break $99,350? As for Bitcoin itself, the market remains in a period of consolidation. Currently trading around $98,180, Bitcoin has seen a slight rebound after dipping below the $92,000 mark. The immediate resistance is at $99,350, followed by more significant levels at $102,470 and $106,450. If Bitcoin can break through these barriers, there is potential for a strong rally toward the $100,000 level. On the downside, key support levels lie at $96,210 and $92,710, with $90,870 serving as a crucial lower support zone. The recent upward pressure indicated by the RSI of 60.20 suggests that bullish momentum may continue, but Bitcoin’s volatility remains high. A break above $99,350 could trigger further upward movement, while failure to hold above $96,210 may lead to further retracement. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key Insights: Metaplanet buys $60.5 million worth of Bitcoin, growing its treasury. Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $99,350; a breakthrough could trigger gains. RSI reading of 60.20 suggests bullish momentum, but volatility remains. Metaplanet’s strategy to accumulate Bitcoin could have a significant impact on market sentiment, especially if other companies follow suit. As Bitcoin continues to experience fluctuations, its path forward remains uncertain, but these recent developments could play a pivotal role in shaping its near-term future. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 BEST Wallet Raises Over $5.43M: A Limited-Time Crypto Opportunity Best Wallet is reshaping the Web3 landscape, supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Discover why Solana, Dogecoin, and Lightchain AI are top picks for 2025, with LCAI predicted to rally by 30,000%. Table of Contents Solana powerhouse in blockchain and DeFi Dogecoin still relevant in the meme coin arena New contender Lightchain AI The future of altcoins and why Lightchain AI may lead the pack As the cryptocurrency market approaches 2025, Solana (SOL) , Dogecoin (DOGE) , and the rising altcoin Lightchain AI (LCAI) are drawing serious attention from investors. While Solana continues to dominate the blockchain space and Dogecoin holds its ground in the meme coin market, Lightchain AI is emerging as a potential game-changer. Investors are buzzing about its explosive growth potential, particularly with the Lightchain AI presale , which is creating a unique opportunity to get in early on this promising token. Analysts are even predicting a jaw-dropping 30,000% rally for LCAI, which could surpass both Solana and Dogecoin in the coming months. Let’s dive into what makes these three coins stand out and why Lightchain AI might just steal the spotlight. You might also like: Cardano and Toncoin take a backseat as Lightchain AI presale shines Solana powerhouse in blockchain and DeFi Solana has emerged as a leading blockchain platform, renowned for its high-speed transactions and low fees, making it a preferred choice for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its unique combination of proof-of-history and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms enables the network to process thousands of transactions per second, significantly outpacing many competitors. As of December 23, 2024, Solana’s price is approximately $180.80, reflecting a slight increase of 0.31% over the previous close. The platform has experienced substantial growth, with its market capitalization reaching over $86 billion. Recent developments include the introduction of Solana Pay, a payment processing system that allows merchants to accept payments in SOL, further expanding its ecosystem. Analysts remain optimistic about Solana’s future, with some predicting significant price increases by 2025, driven by its technological advancements and growing adoption in the DeFi and NFT sectors. Dogecoin still relevant in the meme coin arena Dogecoin, the original meme cryptocurrency, continues to maintain its relevance in the crypto market. As of December 23, 2024, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.31, reflecting a slight decrease of 1.91% from the previous close. The intraday high reached $0.32, with a low of $0.31. Recent developments have significantly impacted Dogecoin’s market performance. Notably, President-elect Donald Trump’s announcement of the “Department of Government Efficiency”, to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, resulted in a substantial surge in DOGE’s value. Following the announcement, Dogecoin’s price increased by nearly 20%, trading at $0.42 and achieving a market capitalization of nearly $60 billion. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s future, with some predicting a potential rise to $0.50 by 2025, driven by its growing acceptance and community support. New contender Lightchain AI Lightchain AI , a new token in the meme coin space, is gaining attention for its potential 30,000% rally. Combining elements of meme coin culture with blockchain technology, LCAI offers a unique opportunity for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward assets. The coin’s unique tokenomics provide unique incentives for holders, including rewards tied to staking and community participation. Lightchain AI also benefits from viral marketing, much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, with growing community enthusiasm driving interest. Strategic partnerships and upcoming DeFi integrations further add to its appeal. If LCAI continues on its current trajectory, it could achieve 30,000% gains, potentially reaching a price of $3 by the end of 2025, outperforming both Solana and Dogecoin. The future of altcoins and why Lightchain AI may lead the pack As we approach 2025, cryptocurrencies like Solana, Dogecoin, and Dogen are poised to benefit from the increasing interest in altcoins. While Solana continues to dominate the blockchain space and Dogecoin remains a popular meme coin, Lightchain AI is emerging as a major contender with its immense growth potential and unique features. Lightchain AI combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, addressing critical challenges in scalability, privacy, and governance. With its low presale price of $0.003, LCAI offers a unique opportunity for early investors to gain exposure to its anticipated growth. As the 2025 altcoin season kicks off, Lightchain AI stands out as a potential leader, poised to deliver life-changing returns for those who get in early. Keep a close watch on LCAI as it prepares to change the crypto space. To learn more about Lightchain AI, visit the website , whitepaper, X , and Telegram.

DeFi Platforms Show Better Security Mechanisms In its annual “Web3 Security Report,” Hacken outlined the general trends in the cryptocurrency industry with regard to scams and security infrastructure. The report notes that total losses arising from security failure in 2024 stood at $2.91 billion. Related Reading: WazirX Exchange Releases Post-Mortem Report: Was North Korea Behind The $235M Exploit? DeFi protocols accounted for $474 million in losses this year, a 40% decline from $787 million in 2023. This sharp drop reflects the growing adoption of advanced security techniques, such as zero-knowledge cryptography and multi-party computation, across the DeFi ecosystem. One key factor contributing to the reduction in DeFi exploits was the sharp decline in cross-chain bridge hacks. Losses from these attacks have consistently fallen – from $1.89 billion in 2022 to $338 million in 2023, and finally to $114 million in 2024. In contrast, CeFi platforms, including cryptocurrency exchanges, reported $694 million in losses in 2024, more than double the $339 million recorded in 2023. CeFi accounted for nearly one-third of all crypto-related incidents, highlighting persistent vulnerabilities in centralized systems. Gaming and metaverse projects were another major target in 2024, responsible for nearly 20% of all crypto-related hacks, with $389 million in losses. The largest gaming/metaverse breach of the year was the PlayDapp exploit in Q1 2024, which resulted in a $290 million loss. Phishing scams also remained a significant concern, causing more than $600 million in losses this year. These scams highlight increasingly sophisticated social engineering tactics in the Web3 space. In November, the sector faced a $129 million address poisoning attack. For context, address poisoning phishing involves attackers sending small transactions from an address that closely resembles one the victim has interacted with, tricking them into mistakenly sending funds to the fraudulent address in future transactions. Memecoins And Rugpulls Continue To Prey On Users While memecoins were all the rage for the majority of 2024 – particularly on the Solana (SOL) blockchain due to its low transaction costs – a significant proportion of them preyed on investors through presale scams and celebrity-endorsed rug pulls. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins No Longer Grabbing Social Media Attention: Santiment One notable example is the Hawk Tuah memecoin, launched by viral influencer Hailey Welch, popularly known as “Hawk Tuah Girl”. The coin’s value plummeted 95% shortly after launch, sparking severe backlash from the wider Web3 community. The rise in memecoin-related scams also underscores the need for greater investor education, particularly when engaging with such speculative assets.

38093129,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322553,1735102656,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs Shed $1.5 Billion in Four-Day Outflow Streak, Largest Since Trump Win","U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a sharp reversal in inflows, shedding more than $1.5 billion over a four-day outflow streak. This marks the longest outflow streak since Donald Trump’s re-election, which provided a much-needed boost for the market. On December 24, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total daily net outflow of $338 million, according to data from SoSoValue . BlackRock’s IBIT Lead in Terms of Outflows Among the 12 funds, BlackRock’s IBIT led the day’s losses at -$188 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at -$83.16 million and ARK Invest’s ARKB at -$75.02 million. Bitwise’s BITB was the sole fund to record a positive daily inflow of $8.50 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and WisdomTree’s BTCW remained flat with no notable inflows or outflows. Source: SoSo Value Despite the net outflows, total assets held across all Bitcoin ETFs stood at $107.53 billion, supported by a day of strong price performance, with funds reporting daily gains of up to +6.48%. The four-day streak has dragged cumulative net inflows down to $35.68 billion as of December 24. The total net assets held by spot Bitcoin ETFs dropped to $107.53 billion, retreating from their December 16 peak of $121.7 billion. Over this period, the funds saw their highest-ever single-day outflow of $680 million on December 19. It is worth noting that spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of $130.76 million on December 23, bringing the cumulative total net inflows to $2.46 billion. Total net assets across Ethereum ETFs reached $12.05 billion, representing 2.94% of Ethereum’s market cap. The total value traded for the day stood at $494.25 million. Among the notable performances, BlackRock’s ETHA led the market with a daily net inflow of $89.51 million, pushing its total net assets to $3.51 billion. Fidelity’s FETH also recorded a strong inflow of $46.37 million, raising its total net assets to $1.46 billion. Conversely, Grayscale’s ETH faced a daily outflow of $6.09 million, though its total net assets remained at $1.61 billion. The data for spot Ethereum ETF flows on December 24 is not yet available. Digital Asset Investment Products Saw $308M Inflows Last Week Digital asset investment products experienced net inflows of $308 million last week, though this figure conceals a significant single-day outflow of $576 million on December 19. The week ended with a total outflow of $1 billion over its final two days, triggered largely by market reactions to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish dot plot announcement. These movements led to a $17.7 billion reduction in total assets under management (AuM) for digital asset ETPs, marking a 0.37% decline in AuM, according to a report from CoinShares . While concerning, this outflow is modest compared to the largest single-day outflow of 2.3% in mid-2022, which followed an FOMC interest rate hike. Bitcoin saw resilience with net inflows of $375 million for the week, while multi-asset investment products bore the brunt of the losses, shedding $121 million. Ethereum continued its streak with $51 million in inflows, offset by Solana’s $8.7 million outflows. Altcoins such as XRP, Horizen, and Polkadot saw smaller but notable inflows.

38083243,https://coinpedia.org/?p=397558,1735102071,Top 10 Most Influential Figures in Crypto Industry : 2024,"The post Top 10 Most Influential Figures in Crypto Industry : 2024 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As 2024 is about to conclude, cryptocurrency investors are celebrating significant gains, with Bitcoin outperforming traditional investments like stocks, bonds, and gold, just as it did in 2023. Remarkably, Bitcoin was the best-performing investment of 2024, rising by 140% in just 12 months. Bitcoin skyrocketed to a record high of $108,000 in December. Notably, several events led to Bitcoin’s growth. The first BTC ETF was approved in January which turned out to be very successful attracting huge inflows. Further, Trump’s pro-crypto stance and his very anticipated November win in the US Presidential elections further fueled Bitcoin’s price. Besides, Trump’s pick of Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair has further boosted the expectations of favorable regulations in the crypto community. The Impact Of Influential Figures The crypto world is largely shaped by influential figures with their actions and views largely impacting the market dynamics. Prominent personalities like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Brad Garlinghouse, among others, are contributing to a more favorable setting for innovation and growth in the crypto space. Let us dive deeper to know who were the 10 most influential figures in crypto this year. 1. Donald Trump – Former President of the United States, crypto advocate. The President-elect Donald Trump endorsed pro-crypto policies during his presidential campaign and enabled fundraising for his inauguration via cryptocurrency donations. He also promised to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve in his second term. The Trump campaign also accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he appeared at industry events, promising to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet”. He also promised to create a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council. He has boosted the market confidence by signaling a pro-crypto regulatory stance, which led to increased adoption and investments. 2. Elon Musk – CEO of SpaceX, Tesla Elon Musk has frequently backed cryptocurrencies through his X posts. In 2021, Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and also planned to accept the coin as payment for its product and services. According to Bloomberg reports , the tech billionaire was also the largest political donor in the country, as he spent at least $270 million to support Donald Trump’s bid for the US presidency. Trump has also selected Musk to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While Musk occasionally speaks on other altcoins, but he generally speaks of Bitcoin and dogecoin in his public commentaries. Musk’s influence on crypto remains beyond comparison which also reflects how a person can ignite global discussions and shift market dynamics. 3. Brad Garlinghouse – Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple has been an influential voice in the cryptocurrency space. He has oftentimes stressed the importance of clear and fair regulation for cryptocurrencies and has been vocal about the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. SEC. He also expressed excitement when Trump chose Paul Atkins to be the next SEC Chair stating that he will bring common sense back to the agency. Besides, Garlinghouse has described the recent US election as a turning point for the crypto industry noting the impact of President-elect Donald Trump’s surprising shift toward a pro-crypto stance during the campaign. “I think it’s clear that Donald Trump embraced crypto and crypto embraced Donald Trump,” he stated. 4. Michael Saylor – Microstrategy’s Chairman Recently, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor has emerged as one of the biggest supporters of the crypto realm. Saylor is known for his vocal support of Bitcoin and his company’s substantial Bitcoin holdings. He has expressed strong backing for Trump’s proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor recently presented a three-minute pitch to Microsoft’s board of directors, urging them to consider buying Bitcoin. He told Microsoft’s board of directors that Bitcoin could be a force multiplier for the company’s balance sheet, and its valuation.“Microsoft has a choice to make: Cling to the past or embrace the future,” he said. However, Microsoft shareholders voted against the proposal for the company to possibly buy Bitcoin. 5. Cynthia Lummis – US Senator US Senator Cynthia Lummis had proposed the idea of creating a Bitcoin national reserve. She had also suggested that the US government could sell some Federal Reserve’s Gold to fund the Bitcoin purchase. She has called 2025 a critical year for Bitcoin and crypto, as major government positions and proposed policies are expected to line up and bring about significant changes in the sector. She has also remarked that with David Sacks as Crypto Czar, this will be the most pro-digital asset administration ever. 5. Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO Back in 2017, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink had said that Bitcoin was “an index of money laundering,” arguing that the cryptocurrency primarily reflects how much money is being made from criminal activity, he now believes that Bitcoin is an asset class in itself and is an alternative to other commodities like gold. While Fink admitted to being a proud Bitcoin skeptic earlier, after exploring more about it, he concluded that his previous opinion held for five years, was wrong. Remarkably, Fink’s BlackRock has turned out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the post election surge in Bitcoin. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT) has swelled by $13 billion since Trump’s win on Nov. 5, pushing iShares Bitcoin Trust past $40 billion in assets just 10 months following its launch. 7. Shayne Coplan, Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan is an entrepreneur and innovator in the blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Shayne is the CEO of Polymarket, which is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can trade on the outcomes of world events using blockchain. This year, Polymarket arosef the most fascinating and potentially valuable use cases in the growing crypto industry. As the 2024 U.S. presidential race developed, it attracted many new users who successfully predicted important events, like Biden’s withdrawal and Trump’s win. 8. Vivekramaswamy – American Biotech Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate, has been selected by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency alongside Elon Musk. Musk and Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, aimed to improve governance and cut down on wasteful expenditures. Ramaswamy, an active advisor in former President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, has consistently voiced strong support for Bitcoin. He views it as a robust alternative to the US dollar, highlighting its role in holding the Federal Reserve accountable and preventing currency manipulation. He spoke at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville earlier this year, where Trump promised to turn America into a “Bitcoin superpower.” Prior to that, he had noted that he would implement a “comprehensive crypto policy framework” if elected commander-in-chief. 9. John Deaton – Legal Advocate John Deaton, a renowned crypto lawyer and legal advocate, has been widely praised for his role in the Ripple (XRP) case. He has been skeptical about Gary Gensler as well who he belives to be stifling innovation in crypto and has endorsed Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair. In a recent YouTube interview with the Good Morning Crypto podcast Deaton had noted that the SEC’s handling of cryptocurrency regulation in the Ripple lawsuit led to nearly $15 billion in losses for small crypto investors. Founder of the law firm Deaton Law Firm, he has become a well-known figure within the crypto community for his efforts to protect the rights of retail investors and push back against regulatory actions he believes could harm the industry. 10. Paul Atkins – Former SEC Commissioner President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to run the SEC, Paul Atkins, is the leader the crypto industry wanted. Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a “proven leader for common sense regulations.” In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. Conclusion These prominent figures are creating a unique collaboration between politics, business, and technology which could entirely transform the crypto landscape. With the incoming pro-crypto administration, with Paul Atkins all set to be the next SEC Chair, and advocates like John Deaton raising their voices for clearer crypto regulations, the crypto industry is all set to witness a whole new era of growth and innovation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/top-10/top-10-most-influential-figures-in-crypto-industry-2024/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
38082903,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=114217,1735101425,Cross-border Payments Using Crypto? How Remittix (RTX) Is Transforming Finance With PayFi,"The demand for flawless and quick cross-border payment solutions has never been more evident in a time when financial institutions are becoming ever more digital. With its creative PayFi technology, Remittix (RTX) is leading the way in enhancing this industry and closing the gap between cryptocurrencies and conventional fiat systems. This innovative method lets individuals and companies transmit crypto-to-fiat payments all around the globe, therefore releasing the full potential of digital currencies in regular financial operations. Remittix has been identified as the best crypto investment of the year because of how it is revolutionizing cross-border payments with its safe, reasonably priced, transparent platform, providing a smarter substitute for conventional banking institutions. The Need for Practical Payment Solutions Cryptocurrencies have become more and more popular as the world’s economy fast turns toward digitization. Though the creative uses of cryptos are great, their capacity to interact with conventional monetary systems still lags greatly, therefore restricting the potential of cryptos for regular people and companies. Here Remittix finds value in providing innovative infrastructure meant to close the distance between digital currencies and the conventional banking system. As a result, investors seeking long-term returns are accumulating RTX, the utility token for the Remittix ecosystem and one of the best cryptos to buy now . Given the over $3.2 trillion worth of cryptocurrencies today, the need for sensible, safe, quick payment methods has never been stronger. Particularly in cross-border payments, cryptocurrencies are considered a quick substitute for conventional banking systems. Still, their interaction with fiat systems presents a difficulty, sometimes keeping users from fully appreciating the advantages of embracing cryptocurrencies. Remittix exists to correct that. The Crypto-to-Fiat On/Off-Ramp Market: A Crucial Bridge Bridging the distance between the cryptocurrency ecosystem and conventional financial institutions depends on the crypto-to-fiat on/off-ramp market. While off-ramps let users cash out their crypto holdings into fiat, on-ramps let them turn fiat money into cryptocurrencies. As acceptance of cryptocurrencies worldwide quickens, demand for these services is rising. The market for crypto payment gateways is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 15% from 2024 to 2032; it was valued at $1.2 billion in 2023 . Remittix is the best crypto investment now as it is set to take a sizable portion of this expanding market while cryptocurrencies get more included in regular corporate activities. Remittix is establishing itself as a pioneer in cross-border payments by providing a safe and quick way to turn more than forty cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies. Transforming the Cross-Border Payments Sector The global economy depends much on cross-border payments. They assist trade, investment, and the flow of capital and people by allowing money to be internationally exchanged. From about $150 trillion in 2017 to over $250 trillion by 2027 , cross-border payments’ value is predicted to rise, hence underlining the need for reliable and safe payment systems. But especially in underdeveloped areas, conventional cross-border payment systems may suffer from exorbitant costs, poor processing times, and limited access to financial services. Remittix provides a more affordable, quick, and safe substitute to meet these difficulties. Remittix lets users rapidly convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies using blockchain technology and local payment networks, therefore avoiding hidden fees or difficult processes. Remittix guarantees that users get a better deal by offering flat, clear rates unlike conventional banks, who charge hefty foreign exchange (FX) fees and wire transfer costs. What you send is exactly what the recipient receives. Remittix’s strategy is based on simplicity and openness, which makes it the perfect answer for companies and people wishing to transmit cross-border payments free from the complexity of conventional banking systems. Remittix: Empowering Businesses and Consumers Remittix is transforming cross-border personal payments as well as enabling companies that want to take crypto payments. Companies can now take crypto payments via the Remittix Pay API and settle them in fiat straight to a selected bank account. This creates fresh chances for businesses to use the expanding crypto market while avoiding the complexity and volatility sometimes linked with crypto transactions. Using Remittix, businesses may also create a merchant account, granting them complete control over how they pay their cryptocurrency. Remittix offers the flexibility and simplicity required to easily handle payments whether one wants to turn their assets into any of over 30 fiat currencies or more than 50 different cryptocurrencies. Remittix is a must-have tool for companies trying to keep ahead of the curve in a fast-changing financial scene since crypto payments fit well into the conventional financial ecosystem. The Remittix Presale: A Golden Opportunity for Investors Remittix is one of the best cryptos to buy now as it promises huge ROIs for investors while it keeps extending its products and offerings. Right now in presale is the RTX token, which runs the Remittix ecosystem. At approximately $0.0156 , each RTX token is an appealing investment choice for individuals wishing to profit from the expansion of the crypto-to-fiat transfers sector. RTX is one of the best cryptos to invest in because of the rapidly increasing demand for fast and efficient cross-border payment solutions. Just a few weeks have seen more than 20 million RTX tokens sold, proving the great investor demand. Analysts estimate that before the presale concludes, RTX token value could rise by 500% given the limited presale token supply and fast escalating investor demand. Hence, RTX is one of the best cryptos to invest in while the presale is still ongoing. Some analysts project a possible 50x surge in the value of the RTX token during the ongoing bull run following the debut next year. Meanwhile, over $375,000 has been raised already in a matter of days and analysts expect this value to hit $500,000 by the end of the week. Remittix has also passed a SOLIDProof audit without any problems, therefore confirming the platform’s dedication to client confidence, openness, and security.

38082680,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375952,1735100969,Interpol Issues Red Notice to Hex Founder Richard Heart,"Richard Schueler, widely known as Richard Heart, the founder of Hex cryptocurrency, has been placed on Interpol’s global wanted list through a Red Notice. Issued at the request of Finnish authorities, it follows allegations of tax fraud and assault in the country. Tax Fraud and Assault Charges The Red Notice is a formal request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal actions. However, it does not constitute an international arrest warrant. Earlier this year, Heart was also featured on the European Union’s Most Wanted List for the same charges. Finnish authorities allege that he committed tax fraud between 2020 and 2024, with a remand order first issued against him on September 13, 2024. “For the purpose of avoiding tax, Schueler failed to observe a statutory duty pertaining to taxation that is of significance in the assessment of tax,” read the tax fraud allegation. The authorities claim that the 45-year-old failed to file business tax returns for multiple years and omitted information about his income in pre-filled personal returns. They allege that he received income from business activities that should have been declared to the tax administration for assessment, with the total amount of dues avoided reaching hundreds of millions of euros. In a separate case, Schueler is also wanted in Finland for allegedly assaulting a minor. Schueler Defends Legacy Amid Interpol Notice While the accused has not directly addressed the Red Notice, in a December 22 post on X, he seemed to reference the situation indirectly, challenging his ‘haters’ and highlighting his philanthropic efforts. “Why settle for being wanted when you can be the most wanted?” read the post, referencing his claimed $27 million contributions to medical research, self-help books, and P2P publishing software. He emphasized his belief in his positive impact, expressing that he strives to ‘make the world a better place’ despite feeling that those who make a difference often face unkindness. Meanwhile, the Hex creator is also involved in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2023, the regulator sued him, accusing him of unregistered securities sales and fraudulent activities. The agency alleges that Heart conducted an unsanctioned sale of cryptocurrency securities that raised over $1 billion. He is accused of promoting Hex as a “blockchain certificate of deposit” between December 2019 and November 2020. Further, he is said to have promised high returns and attracted $678 million in investments, but the token’s value later dropped by 98.4% from its peak. The SEC also claims Heart raised $354 million for PulseChain, supposedly for development, but used the funds for personal luxuries. In January 2024, he filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the financial watchdog opposed, arguing it failed to address the allegations or meet legal standards.

This surge coincides with heightened market activity following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policy announcements . According to figures submitted by the Bank of Korea to Rep. Lim Gwang-hyun of the Democratic Party, 15.59 million South Koreans held accounts on the nation’s top five cryptocurrency exchanges—Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and GOPAX—by the end of November. This marks a significant increase of 610,000 new investors from October’s 14.98 million. 30% of South Korea’s Population Engages With Crypto The Bank of Korea’s report, compiled under the Virtual Asset User Protection Act enacted in July, shows that cryptocurrency now engages over 30% of the country’s 51.23 million population. Market activity has surged, with Bitcoin prices rising from 105 million won at the end of October to 135.8 million won by November’s close. Investor holdings also saw a dramatic increase. Total market valuation reached 102.6 trillion won (70.3B USD), in November, doubling from October’s 58 trillion won (39.7B USD). Meanwhile, the average holdings per person climbed from 3.87 million won (2655 USD) in October to 6.58 million won (4777 USD) in November. Deposits in crypto exchanges also doubled, rising from 4.7 trillion won (3.2 billion USD) in October to 8.8 trillion won (6.03 billion USD) in November, signaling heightened investor interest. The average daily trading volume in November hit 10.2 billion USD, rivaling the combined activity of the KOSPI (6.8 billion USD) and KOSDAQ (4.7 billion USD) markets. This is a notable jump from October’s 3.4 trillion won (2.3 billion USD) daily average. “The rapid growth of virtual asset trading necessitates government-level measures to ensure market stability and safeguard investors,” said Rep.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-will-rally-14000-before-exchange-listing-as-dogecoin-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

If finalized, this would mark MoonPay’s largest acquisition to date, according to FOX journalist Eleanor Terrett. MoonPay, often dubbed the “PayPal for crypto,” provides a wide range of crypto payment solutions. The acquisition of Helio Pay would significantly enhance its merchant services. Helio Enables Merchants to Receive Payments in Bitcoin Helio, a self-service platform similar to Coinbase Commerce, enables over 6,000 merchants and content creators to receive payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins like USD Coin, and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. One of Helio’s standout features is its integration with Solana Pay on Shopify, an e-commerce platform with more than 138 million monthly users. The partnership underscores the potential synergy between Helio and MoonPay in expanding their market reach and user engagement. MoonPay’s existing user base spans over 20 million users across 160 countries, and the addition of Helio’s services could further strengthen its foothold in the crypto payments sector.

Meanwhile, its integration of fiat PayPal on-ramps in the European Union, the UK, and the US earlier this year has bolstered its accessibility. As reported, users in 24 EU member states and the UK can now buy cryptocurrency using their PayPal account thanks to the MoonPay integration. Founded in 2018 by Victor Faramond and Ivan Soto-Wright, MoonPay aims to simplify the adoption of digital assets. MoonPay Expands Operations with More Partnerships In October last year, MoonPay announced a partnership with Mastercard to advance Web3 integrations, build connections, and boost marketing tools. That same month, it unveiled its new Swaps feature in the app, which enables users to swap one cryptocurrency for another. Then, in November, amid increased regulatory scrutiny, MoonPay appointed Mike Lempres , a former executive from Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), to its board of directors. In May this year, the company donated $1 million to the digital advocacy group Stand With Crypto ahead of the 2024 US elections. Meanwhile, MoonPay saw significant investor support in November 2021 when it raised $555 million in a Series A funding round led by Tiger Global Management and Coatue, with a valuation of $3.4 billion. As for PayPal, at the end of May, it said it’s expanding PYUSD to the Solana blockchain . It was also revealed that the stablecoin includes a feature called “confidential transfers” to provide privacy for users and transparency for regulators.

The United States Department of Justice announced that the pair face charges including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and stalking. According to prosecutors, Hay and Mayo promoted various NFT and digital asset projects, providing misleading roadmaps and making “materially false and misleading statements” about their intentions to fulfill project promises. One such project, Vault of Gems, was marketed as the first NFT project “pegged to a hard asset.” However, prosecutors claim the duo abandoned the initiative after collecting millions from investors. Principal Deputy Attorney General Nicole Argentieri stated: “Gabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo allegedly defrauded investors in digital asset projects of tens of millions of dollars and threatened an individual who attempted to expose their roles in these fraudulent schemes.” When a project manager revealed their involvement in another NFT project, Faceless, Hay and Mayo allegedly resorted to harassment and intimidation, targeting the individual and their family. The Justice Department revealed that the duo used similar tactics across multiple projects, including Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Dirty Dogs, MoonPortal, and Squiggles. To obscure their involvement, they reportedly misrepresented others as the project owners. Argentieri emphasized the Justice Department’s commitment to combating digital asset fraud, saying: “Fraudsters take advantage of new technologies and financial products to steal investors’ hard-earned money.” Officials vowed to work with law enforcement to uproot crypto fraud schemes and protect investors.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/california-duo-charged-in-22-million-nft-fraud/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38081592,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53085,1735098743,Nearly Half of Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Face Losses,"Shiba Inu , once a standout in the cryptocurrency market, is now facing challenges as data reveals that 43% of its investors are experiencing losses. Currently, only 53% of SHIB holders are reporting profitable positions, reflecting broader concerns about the asset’s performance and market dynamics. Declining Investor Activity and Profitability Profitability metrics highlight SHIB’s struggles in maintaining investor confidence. A significant factor in its recent downturn is the reduced activity among large investors. Over the past week, the number of substantial transactions has dropped by 60.9%, signaling reduced participation from whales and institutions—key players that often drive significant price movements. The asset’s reliance on a concentrated group of holders exacerbates its vulnerability to market fluctuations. Notably, 73% of SHIB’s total supply remains under the control of major players, further amplifying its susceptibility to large price swings. Key Support and Resistance Levels The token’s price has declined significantly from its previous highs and is now trading near its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a critical support zone. A breach of this level could lead to further declines, potentially testing the 200-day EMA. On the upside, the $0.000023 resistance level remains a crucial benchmark for any potential recovery. However, given the current market sentiment, a breakout above this resistance appears unlikely in the short term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Network Growth and Community Engagement A concerning trend for SHIB is the slowdown in its network growth, with fewer new wallet activations observed. This decline suggests diminishing interest from new investors, a critical factor for sustaining momentum in a speculative market like SHIB. Additionally, metrics from the asset’s Telegram community indicate reduced engagement, pointing to waning enthusiasm among existing supporters. A shift in market sentiment is essential for the asset to regain its footing. This could come in the form of renewed whale activity, a substantial increase in network growth, or a successful breach of critical resistance levels. Until these conditions materialize, cautious optimism may be the best approach for current investors. Key price levels to monitor include the $0.000020 support and the $0.000023 resistance. These zones will likely play a significant role in determining the token’s near-term trajectory. Investors should remain vigilant and assess broader market conditions before making important decisions. The token’s ability to recover will depend on reversing the negative trends in investor activity, community engagement, and network expansion. Without these improvements, the asset’s challenges may persist, limiting its potential for a significant rebound.

Its value being greater than 53 means the investors as a whole are showing greed, while it being under 47 implies the presence of fear in the market. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral sentiment.

This greed sentiment is also a particularly strong one, so strong in fact that it’s sitting very close to a special region called the extreme greed. The extreme greed occurs when the index reaches a value of 75 or higher. A similar zone also exists for the fear side, known as the extreme fear, and is situated at 25 or under. Historically, the extreme sentiments have proven to be important for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as tops and bottoms have tended to occur while the market has been inside these zones. The relationship between price and sentiment has generally been an inverse one, meaning extreme greed leads to tops and extreme fear to bottoms. The BTC top earlier in the month occurred when the index was at a value of 87. With the price decline that has occurred since then, market sentiment has cooled off a bit. The question is: has it cooled enough? While other phases of the market usually require dips into fear or extreme fear for bottoms to take place, bull markets generally don’t see pullbacks that deep.

That said, the recent sentiment has still been quite close to extreme greed, so it may need a bit more before a real turnaround is reached. The Fear & Greed Index calculates its value using multiple factors, one of which is social media sentiment. While the overall sentiment has still been positive, it seems social media users have started to show fear, as the analytics firm Santiment has pointed out in an X post. BTC Price Bitcoin has shown a sharp 6% rebound during the last 24 hours, a potential indication that the dip into the greed sentiment may have been enough for the rally to restart after all.

Yep, it’s BTFD Coin, an exciting newcomer that’s out to shake up the meme coin space! Alongside familiar faces like Baby Doge and SPX6900, BTFD Coin is gaining attention with its buzzworthy presale success and juicy 50% festive discount. If you’re looking to cash in on the best new meme coins for massive return potential, you’ve come to the right place. Let’s get this party started, shall we? Now, let’s talk numbers, because what we’re really after is serious gains—and the numbers behind BTFD Coin are looking pretty darn spectacular. We’re in Stage 12 of the presale, with over $4.44 million raised in record time (seriously, under 14 days to hit $2.5 million? That’s impressive). And if you’re looking for a deal, hold onto your hats: BIG50 is the code that unlocks a 50% discount on your BTFD purchase. Take a moment to absorb that: a 50% festive discount on an already hot presale. Did someone say “opportunity”? Yes, yes they did. Let’s dive into the features of BTFD Coin and how it’s designed to bring in massive returns. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves First things first—why is BTFD Coin so special? Well, if you’re in the crypto space, you’ve probably heard of the BTFD mindset, which stands for “Buy The Dip.” If you’re wondering what this has to do with anything, it’s the core philosophy of the BTFD Coin community. Inspired by the chaos of the 1973 market crash, BTFD Coin offers a unique proposition: seize opportunities during market downturns just like smart investors did back then, cashing in some huge gains. As a result, Stage 7 is the perfect moment to get more $BTFD at a reduced price, giving investors a big edge. Now, let’s talk about the big picture: BTFD Coin’s presale success isn’t just about hype—it’s a combination of powerful tokenomics, a high-APY staking program , and a P2E game that’s ready to blow up. With Stage 12 currently in play, the BTFD Coin presale is over halfway to its final goal, and over 58 billion $BTFD coins have already been sold. If that doesn’t scream massive return potential, I don’t know what does. So, what does that actually mean in terms of gains? Let’s say you dropped $57,000 into BTFD Coin at today’s price of $0.000064 per coin. Here’s the math: at that price, you’d be picking up 890,625,000 $BTFD coins. If the price increases to the presale target of $0.0006 per coin, that $57,000 investment could potentially balloon into $534,375—talk about serious gains! With the BIG50 festive discount, this scenario isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem! Baby Doge: A Meme Coin with Heart Now, let’s shift gears a bit and talk about Baby Doge. This little pupper is making waves on the BNB chain, and it’s hard to ignore the adorable face of the coin. Originally created as a joke (hey, aren’t all the best things born this way?), Baby Doge has evolved into a community powerhouse that spreads awareness for animal adoption. But beyond being a cute mascot, Baby Doge is a meme coin with some real utility—like its AI image generator and NFT capabilities, which let users create their own Baby Doge characters and images. In addition to its community-driven mission, Baby Doge is also helping real animals. The coin’s record-breaking donations have provided over 81,000 pounds of dog food to pups in need. If you’re into coins with a cause, Baby Doge definitely checks that box. As for the investment potential, Baby Doge has a large circulating supply of 161,680,749,827,200,480 BABYDOGE coins, with a market cap hovering around $583 million. SPX6900: The Blockchain Token That’s All About Innovation And then we have SPX6900—a meme coin bringing a fresh approach to the blockchain space. Unlike the others, SPX6900 isn’t just focused on memes—it’s leveraging advanced cryptography and promising limitless applications. As the name suggests, SPX6900 is all about going big or going home. With its powerful blockchain capabilities, SPX6900 is eyeing scientific and technological fields for its future growth. The token’s price has been rising steadily, currently sitting at $0.771778 with a 24-hour trading volume of $47 million. Ranked at #127 on CoinMarketCap, SPX6900’s market cap of $718 million suggests there’s room for growth, especially if the project’s innovative blockchain solutions gain traction. The circulating supply stands at 930,993,090 SPX tokens, with a total max supply of 1 billion tokens. How to Claim Your BTFD Coins and Unlock the BIG50 Code Start by going to the Presale Page , then follow these simple steps: Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Enter the Bonus Code: Locate the Bonus code field, enter BIG50 , and click “Apply”. Enter Purchase Details: Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price. Confirm and Buy: Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Conclusion: Ready to Ride the Meme Coin Wave? There you have it—BTFD Coin, Baby Doge, and SPX6900 are all vying for your attention, each with its unique features and growth potential. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins for massive return potential, the 50% festive discount with BIG50 makes BTFD Coin the clear frontrunner.

Izvestia reported that the claims came from Alexander Ilyukhin, the First Secretary of the Russian Embassy in Nicaragua and the head of the Russian office in El Salvador. Ilyukhin said that officials in Russia and El Salvador are “working to organize a visit from Bukele to Moscow.” Bukele Russia Trip Will Depend on Trump, Diplomat Says However, the diplomat admitted that the visit may not take place without the blessing of US President-elect Donald Trump .

They added that the Bukele government had not imposed any sanctions on Russia. Nor, they added, “has it condemned the Special Military Operation [the war in Ukraine].” The media outlet suggested that “some Russian companies” want to move their production “away from Europe” and relocate to Latin America.

38079907,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631379,1735095600,Could This Groundbreaking Digital Currency Become the Next Market Leader in 2025,"In a world where innovation drives the cryptocurrency market, investors are constantly on the lookout for the next market leader. With its presale priced at $0.003, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is rapidly gaining recognition as a potential game-changer. Offering a seamless fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI has positioned itself as a frontrunner in the race to revolutionize decentralized applications. But does it have what it takes to lead the market in 2025? Rise of Lightchain AI More Than Just a Cryptocurrency Unlike a lot of digital coins that depend only on buzz or limited uses, Lightchain AI mi͏xes new tech to give real value. Its Smart Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Smarts (PoI) make it different from others, giving place for growing, smart-led apps. The AIVM acts as a new level where makers can use AI-based answers for fields such as money, health care, and supply chain work. At the same time, the PoI way keeps that the network stays power-saving and useful rewarding users for fixing AI jobs instead of old mining or betting. Can Lightchain AI Outpace Market Giants? The cryptocurrency market is dominated by heavyweights like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP). However, Lightchain AI’s unique combination of AI integration and blockchain scalability positions it to compete with and possibly surpass these established players. Ethereum (ETH) While Ethereum is the go-to platform for decentralized applications, its scalability issues and high transaction fees remain persistent challenges. Lightchain AI’s advanced infrastructure could address these pain points, making it a viable alternative. Solana (SOL) Known for its speed, Solana faces concerns about decentralization and network stability. Lightchain AI, with its robust technology and sustainable consensus model, offers a more balanced solution. Ripple (XRP) Ripple focuses on cross-border payments, but Lightchain AI’s broader applications give it an edge in market diversification. Key Factors That Could Propel Lightchain AI to Market Leadership Innovative Technology Driving Adoption The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) empowers developers to create advanced dApps, enabling industries to leverage blockchain technology in ways never seen before. This focus on utility ensures widespread adoption across sectors. Deflationary Tokenomics With its deflationary model, where a portion of transaction fees is burned, Lightchain AI ensures long-term scarcity. This mechanism incentivizes holding and increases demand, creating upward pressure on the token’s value over time. Early Investor Opportunity Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, Lightchain AI provides a rare ground-floor investment opportunity. Analysts project the token could reach $20 by 2025, representing a staggering ROI of over 600,000% for early backers. Why 2025 Could Be the Year of Lightchain AI As the blockchain and AI industries continue to expand, Lightchain AI’s positioning at the intersection of these technologies gives it a significant advantage. With a strong roadmap that includes the mainnet launch and strategic partnerships, the project is well-equipped to capture market share. Moreover, the growing demand for decentralized, AI-powered solutions across industries could catapult Lightchain AI into the spotlight, making it a household name in the cryptocurrency space. Plus, with the global push towards sustainability and energy efficiency, Lightchain AI’s unique Proof of Intelligence consensus mechanism could attract environmentally-conscious investors and further drive adoption.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-fuks-santa-muskfsan-memecoin-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38079883,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-vechain-this-breakthrough-presale-might-be-what-youre-looking-for/,1735094711,Missed VeChain? This Breakthrough Presale Might Be What You’re Looking For,"Cryptocurrency markets have been buzzing with innovation lately. It seems like there’s always something new on the horizon, and the possibilities seem endless. If you’ve been keeping an eye on VeChain (VET), you’re likely aware of its success in integrating blockchain technology into supply chain management and logistics. With its impressive real-world use cases, VeChain has carved out a solid niche for itself. But what if you missed out on it? What if you could invest in something that’s offering even more potential for growth? Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain that’s grabbing attention for its forward-thinking approach to scalability, decentralisation, and cross-chain interoperability. The presale for Qubetics is on fire right now—having raised over $7.7 million with more than 374 million tokens sold. The price per token is set to increase by 10% as it moves into the 15th stage. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio with one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week , Qubetics could be the perfect opportunity. But why should you consider Qubetics over a well-established project like VeChain? Let’s take a deeper dive and compare the two. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Interoperability Now, let’s talk about Qubetics ($TICS). This emerging Layer 1 blockchain offers a fresh take on decentralisation, scalability, and cross-chain interoperability. Unlike VeChain, which is focused primarily on supply chain applications, Qubetics provides a blockchain solution that aims to connect different ecosystems, facilitating seamless interaction between them. The project is in its 14th presale stage, with over $7.7 million raised, and it’s set to grow even more as it enters the 15th stage, which will see a 10% price increase. Qubetics is a multi-functional blockchain, offering far more than just supply chain solutions. It’s designed to provide high scalability and low-cost transactions, all while supporting decentralisation and interoperability with other blockchain networks. This means that Qubetics isn’t limited to one industry or use case—its potential spans across multiple sectors, from DeFi to NFTs and beyond. The project’s innovative cross-chain interoperability allows developers to seamlessly integrate their dApps and other projects across different blockchain ecosystems. For example, a business in India could use Qubetics to transfer assets between Ethereum and Solana, opening up a world of possibilities for cross-chain projects, which VeChain doesn’t offer at the same scale. Additionally, Qubetics’ Web3 aggregator technology provides a unified platform for users to interact with different blockchain networks, making it much easier to manage assets and applications in a decentralised manner. Qubetics also stands out for its Cross-Border Transactions, which open new doors for businesses looking to operate securely across borders. Imagine a company in Sri Lanka that needs to securely send payments and data to partners in Europe and the US without worrying about intermediaries or high fees. Qubetics’ infrastructure allows businesses to securely interact on a global scale, without the same limitations that traditional financial systems have. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Qubetics is redefining blockchain potential with its scalable, decentralised, and cross-chain interoperable infrastructure. Its ability to offer Cross-Border Transactions securely and affordably makes it one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week , especially for investors seeking growth beyond a niche market like VeChain. 2. VeChain (VET): The Supply Chain Solution VeChain (VET) has long been considered a major player in the blockchain space due to its focus on improving supply chain management. Priced at around $0.4381, VeChain’s innovative technology uses blockchain to track products across the entire supply chain, improving transparency, reducing fraud, and increasing efficiency. This use case has made it one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week for those seeking exposure to supply chain and logistics industries. VeChain’s blockchain is primarily used to provide transparency for supply chain data, allowing businesses to track products from origin to consumer. Its blockchain solution has been implemented by companies in various industries, including automotive, pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods. In recent years, VeChain has expanded its reach with high-profile partnerships, including collaborations with big companies like Walmart China and BMW, further establishing its position in the supply chain space. While VeChain continues to grow and gain adoption, its reliance on a centralised model means it faces limitations in terms of decentralisation and scalability. The focus on improving supply chains is powerful, but VeChain is somewhat limited to its niche, and it doesn’t have the same level of flexibility as some other projects when it comes to integrating with multiple blockchain ecosystems. Why did VeChain make it to this list? VeChain has established itself as a leader in supply chain solutions, and its blockchain technology is being adopted by several large enterprises. For those looking to invest in a solid blockchain project with proven use cases, VeChain remains one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week, though its scope is somewhat narrow when compared to more flexible Layer 1 solutions like Qubetics. Qubetics vs. VeChain Let’s compare how an investment of $5,000 would look in both Qubetics and VeChain. With Qubetics, the price of $TICS tokens is $0.0377 at the 14th presale stage. If you invest $5,000, you would get about 132,017 tokens. Analysts predict that at the end of the presale, $TICS could reach $0.25, offering a 564% ROI. That would mean your $5,000 investment could grow to around $32,084.25. If $TICS reaches $1 after the presale, your investment would be worth $132,017, yielding a 2,555% ROI. More optimistically, if $TICS hits $5 after the presale, your $5,000 investment could reach $660,085, giving you a 13,176% ROI. The potential for high returns with Qubetics is clear, especially with its unique approach to blockchain scalability and cross-chain transactions. On the other hand, if you were to invest $5,000 in VeChain at its current price of $0.4381, you would receive about 11,418 VET tokens. While VeChain has seen solid growth, analysts are projecting more modest price increases. If VET rises to $0.50 over the next year, your $5,000 investment would grow to about $5,719, offering a 14% ROI. While VeChain is a stable investment, its price growth is expected to be slower compared to the explosive potential of Qubetics. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? The explosive growth potential of Qubetics during its presale, combined with its innovative technology and real-world applications like Cross-Border Transactions , positions it as one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week. The returns from $TICS could far outpace VeChain, making it the more attractive option for investors seeking high growth. What Are The Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week? Based on our analysis, Qubetics ($TICS) is a far more versatile and high-potential investment compared to VeChain (VET). While VeChain has proven itself in the supply chain sector, Qubetics offers a much broader range of applications, from cross-chain interoperability to secure cross-border transactions, positioning it for significant growth. The ongoing presale, which has already raised over $7.7 million, provides a unique opportunity to invest in the future of blockchain technology. If you’re looking for a Top Altcoin to Invest in This Week with the potential for massive returns, Qubetics is the clear winner. With its disruptive technology and promising presale success, now is the perfect time to secure your $TICS tokens before the price increases further. Don’t miss out—join the future of blockchain and watch your investment grow.

However, a rising star, ETFSwap (ETFS) , is quietly capturing attention, positioned to outshine DOGE with an extraordinary 65,000% gain trajectory to $10. As the Dogecoin price forecast garners headlines, could ETFSwap (ETFS) prove to be the real game-changer? Dogecoin Price Forecast: Aiming For $3, But ETFSwap (ETFS) Is The Bigger Story Dogecoin price forecasts remain bullish, with DOGE rallying on growing investor optimism and increased whale accumulation. This meme-based cryptocurrency has a proven ability to captivate the market, spurred by social media trends and high-profile endorsements. DOGE’s potential to reach $3 is bolstered by improved blockchain utility and the ongoing rise in crypto adoption. While the Dogecoin price forecast holds promise for DOGE investors, it is common knowledge that DOGE relies heavily on community-driven momentum and social media buzz; ETFSwap (ETFS), however, offers a fundamentally different value proposition. Its focus on utility, tokenized ETFs, and long-term growth places it in a league of its own, making it a standout contender as the broader market evolves beyond meme coins.

ETFSwap’s (ETFS) revolutionary ecosystem goes beyond the hype, positioning it as a serious contender in the crypto ETF space.

This forward-thinking approach positions ETFSwap (ETFS) as a long-term contender in the cryptocurrency ETF space, especially as the demand for tokenized assets continues to surge.

38077587,https://nulltx.com/?p=136538,1735092022,PEPE Price Drops by 30% While NEAR Is Poised for a Breakout – Crypto Titans Rally Behind BlockDAG’s $1 Prediction,"The cryptocurrency arena is renowned for its swings, and the latest market movements are no exception. PEPE recently witnessed a dramatic 30% price drop after soaring to record highs, stirring questions about its future prospects. Concurrently, the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 points to a potential $10 value, sparking debates over the viability of its environmentally friendly blockchain to achieve sustained growth. Amid these fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as a top crypto of 2024. Attracting significant attention, this project has amassed over $172 million in presale contributions and achieved an impressive 2,240% ROI since its inception. With its advanced hybrid blockchain and directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology, industry insiders are bullish about BDAG’s prospects to hit the $1 mark, positioning it as the prime crypto to get your hands on. PEPE Suffers a Sharp 30% Decline Post-Peak PEPE’s journey took a downturn recently, with a sharp 30% fall from its peak price of $0.0000293 on December 9. This significant dip has triggered skepticism regarding the sustainability of its initial explosive growth, suggesting it might have hit its peak. Technical analysis shows bearish trends, hinting at a possible further drop to $0.0000105 if crucial support levels fail. While there’s hope among some circles for a bounce back, others are bracing for a possible extended decline, advising caution among followers. Near Protocol’s 2025 Forecast: Climbing to $10 The outlook for Near Protocol has garnered mixed reviews from experts, some are optimistic about its future, while others caution against potential obstacles. Current predictions place its price at around $10.01 by 2025, fueled by its scalable and energy-efficient technology. Despite notable advancements in decentralized apps and its green tech credentials, Near Protocol contends with uncertainties from market dynamics and regulatory environments. Currently priced at $5.74, the pathway to the anticipated $10 remains fraught with unpredictability. As the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 suggests potential growth, savvy crypto watchers are advised to stay informed and assess the evolving market domain to pinpoint the most promising long-term investments. BlockDAG’s Sprint to $1: Is a 4200% ROI on the Horizon? BlockDAG has quickly become a powerhouse in the crypto sphere, amassing an impressive $172 million through its presale in mere months. A staggering 17.5 billion BDAG coins have been purchased, with early participants already reaping a 2,240% ROI as the price catapulted from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0234 in the latest Batch 26. This explosive growth has catapulted BlockDAG into the spotlight as the most buzzworthy crypto project currently. Enthusiasts and major players alike are drawn to its potential, especially with anticipated exchange listings that could push its value to the coveted $1 mark. Should BDAG reach this milestone, those holding Batch 26 could see a staggering 4200% ROI. Crypto analysts point to BlockDAG’s cutting-edge hybrid technology—merging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) efficiency with blockchain’s robust security—as a key driver of its presale success. This tech innovation enables faster transactions, greater scalability, and increased security, captivating a global audience and spurring a surge in demand for BDAG coins. Moreover, BlockDAG’s mining operations are thriving, generating over $6 million from the sales of more than 15,000 mining units. These units, known for their efficiency, are quickly being snapped up by those eager to maximize their BDAG earnings. As demand continues to rise, the current crypto presale for Batch 26 is poised to sell out soon, potentially driving prices higher. This presents a golden opportunity to get involved with BDAG at a still accessible price of $0.0234 per coin. Today’s Top Crypto Investment Opportunities In contrast, the PEPE price has recently fallen by 30%, stirring doubts about its future performance, while the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 anticipates a steady rise to $10, buoyed by its sustainable technology. Yet, it’s BlockDAG that’s leading the pack in the altcoin market with its remarkable achievements and substantial presale earnings. With breakthrough DAG technology and booming mining sales, BlockDAG is on a fast track to potentially hit the $1 threshold soon, which could unlock a 4200% ROI for current Batch 26 holders. For those scouting for the best crypto to buy, seizing BDAG coins now might be the smartest move in today’s volatile market.

38077543,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666908,1735092010,Toncoin Signals Accumulation Phase as Open Interest Hits Nine-Month Low – What’s Next?,"Toncoin (TON) appears to have now entered a notable phase in its market cycle, presenting potential opportunities for investors. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson highlights that TON has moved into a favorable risk zone for accumulation, as indicated by the Normalized Risk Metric (NMR). This metric evaluates an asset’s price risk relative to historical data, providing a clearer picture of whether the current price levels are suitable for investment or if caution is warranted. Related Reading: Toncoin Consolidates: Could A Breakout Push TON Higher? Toncoin Current Market Outlook The NMR uses moving averages such as the 50-day and 374-day simple moving averages (SMA) along with logarithmic differences in price data to determine risk exposure. A normalized score ranging between 0 and 1 indicates the level of risk, with values closer to zero suggesting a lower chance of price decline. According to Wedson, TON’s current placement in the green zone signals reduced risk, making it an appealing opportunity for investors seeking long-term exposure to the asset. The analysis further suggests that while the medium and long-term risk profiles appear favorable, there remains a possibility for TON’s price to revisit historically significant support zones, often referred to as the “blue zone” on price heatmaps. Historically, these levels have served as price floors and accumulation points for investors expecting future price appreciation. Open Interest Decline and Market Volatility Trends Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, has added further context to Toncoin’s current market stance. According to his observations, TON’s Open Interest (OI) in the futures market has decreased to $141 million, marking the lowest level observed in the past nine months. Open Interest refers to the total value of outstanding futures contracts and is a key indicator of market sentiment and participation. A decline in Open Interest generally signals reduced market activity and lower volatility. While this trend is specific to TON, it reflects a broader pattern across the cryptocurrency market as the year comes to a close. Historically, periods of low Open Interest are often followed by significant price movements, either upward or downward, once liquidity returns to the market.

38077163,https://coinpaper.com/6711/whales-rush-to-accumulate-xrp-amid-rlusd-s-debut-on-major-exchange,1735091350,Whales Rush to Accumulate XRP Amid RLUSD’s Debut on Major Exchange,"After establishing itself as a top performer in this bull cycle, XRP price has been moving sideways for the last week, trading within the $2.12-$2.32 range. Although the critical support above $2.10 has remained intact, indicating a strong buyer interest at below levels, the lack of any positive news that had the market in a state of euphoria in the first weeks after Trump’s election appears to be cooling down inflated expectations. The on-chain data, however, paints a different picture for XRP. According to Santiment data shared by Twitter/X crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales have accumulated 40 million XRP over the last 24 hours, suggesting that seasoned market participants are closely watching for the new breakout. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has added 3.08%, which may be a sign that the market is starting to react to renewed whale activity. Should the momentum continue, XRP may reclaim the recent highs at the $2.7 level. Currently, the main potential catalysts for the XRP price to watch for are RLUSD stablecoin listings, XRP spot ETF approval, and progress in the Ripple vs SEC case. RLUSD stablecoin went live on December 17 on XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, with initial listings on several exchanges and crypto platforms, including Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA. Although it’s reasonable to assume that any attempt to corner the saturated stablecoin market will be met with fierce competition from established issuers Tether ($140 billion worth of USDT) and Circe ($43 billion worth of USDC), the use cases and utility brought by RLUSD are expected to drive demand for XRP as well. Considering that Ripple’s stablecoin is yet to be listed on Binance or Coinbase, any upcoming listings are likely to be treated by the investors as “buy the rumor, sell the news” events. After the successful debut of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, the crypto industry is anticipating approval for other Layer 1 cryptocurrencies, including XRP and SOL. Major players like WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have already filed for XRP ETFs and the leadership change at the SEC brought by Trump’s win makes the approval a much more likely thing than one would expect under Gary Gensler’s reign. Finally, the resolution of the ongoing SEC vs Ripple case also seems like a plausible outcome after Gensler’s resignation effective on Inauguration Day. With crypto-friendly Chair Paul Atkins at the helm, the new SEC is likely to drop non-fraud lawsuits, experts forecast. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.30, positioned at the level of the 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) but holding above the 21-day EMA at $2.24. These indicators suggest a potential short-term bullish momentum, as the price is consolidating near its faster EMA and maintaining support above its medium-term trendline. Should the price successfully move away from its 9-day EMA, this would reliably signify the start of an upward trend. Conversely, a fall below the 21-day EMA would mean the inability to sustain momentum, leading XRP to potentially retest a $2.10 support. For context, the exponential moving average is a type of a moving average indicator that assigns more weight to the recent prices, making it more sensitive to the latest price changes when compared to a simple moving average. The 9 and 21-day EMAs are commonly used by traders to identify short-term trends. RLUSD gets listed on Bullish On Tuesday, Bullish, an institutional crypto exchange backed by tech mogul Peter Thiel, officially listed Ripple’s much-anticipated stablecoin. The exchange users will be able to trade it across seven pairs, namely RLUSD/USDC, BTC/RLUSD, XRP/RLUSD, ETH/RLUSD, USD/RLUSD, EUR/RLUSD and SOL/RLUSD. Before Bullish, RLUSD also went live on Bitso, Independent Reserve, and Mercado Bitcoin. The stablecoin became available to the general public shortly after Ripple managed to secure approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement. According to CoinMarketCap , RLUSD currently has a market cap of $53 million, which places the stablecoin at the 2,978th place ranked by market capitalization. Over the past 24 hours, it generated a trading volume of $8.6 million, a 719% increase from the day before. RLUSD will be initially available in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, UK, and Middle East regions, CoinDesk reported, quoting Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoin at Ripple.

38077264,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53047,1735091149,Qubetics Partners with SWFT Blockchain as Celestia Drives Web3 Growth and EOS Prepares for a Comeback,"The crypto market in December 2024 is buzzing with activity, and some names are making serious waves. Celestia, for instance, is turning heads with its innovative Web3Bay project, promising to be the next big thing in decentralized e-commerce. Meanwhile, EOS is mounting a comeback, thanks to updates that enhance scalability and functionality, reigniting investor interest. Both projects are gaining traction, making them standout options in the hunt for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , quietly but confidently taking the crypto world by storm. Its presale has already sold over 374 million tokens, raising $7.7 million from more than 11,700 holders. But what sets Qubetics apart isn’t just the numbers—it’s the utility. With its game-changing wallet developed in partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is tackling real-world crypto problems head-on. Let’s dive into how these projects are shaping up. Qubetics: The Wallet That Changes Everything Qubetics isn’t just about selling tokens; it’s about delivering real value. Its non-custodial multi chain wallet , created in partnership with SWFT Blockchain, is all about simplicity and security. Whether you’re paying for groceries or managing a diverse crypto portfolio, this wallet turns complex blockchain transactions into everyday ease. Let’s break it down: Say you’re a business owner. A customer pays you in Ethereum, but you need cash. No problem—Qubetics’ smart contract conversion mechanism automatically swaps crypto into fiat at the point of sale. This means you’re shielded from crypto’s notorious volatility while still enjoying the benefits of digital payments. The presale numbers tell a story of trust. With over 374 million tokens sold and $7.7 million raised, Qubetics is clearly striking a chord with investors. At $0.0377 per token, the window to join is closing fast before the 10% price hike in the 15th stage this weekend. If you’re scouting the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Qubetics deserves a spot on your shortlist. Celestia: Building the Future of Web3 Celestia is on a mission to revolutionize the blockchain world with its modular approach. By separating consensus and data availability, Celestia allows developers to create highly customizable blockchains, which could pave the way for the next wave of Web3 applications. But here’s where it gets exciting: Web3Bay. Dubbed the “eBay of Web3,” this platform aims to transform decentralized e-commerce. Imagine buying and selling goods online with total transparency and no intermediaries skimming off the top. Celestia’s role in this project positions it as a leader in the Web3 revolution. Of course, no project is without risks. Celestia’s success hinges on developer adoption and the broader market’s appetite for Web3 solutions. But with its innovative tech and growing ecosystem, it’s a strong contender for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. EOS: A Comeback in the Making EOS has been through its fair share of ups and downs, but 2024 might just be its redemption arc. Known for its high-speed transactions and low fees, EOS is making a comeback with updates aimed at improving scalability and interoperability. These enhancements are designed to attract both developers and investors, positioning EOS as a viable alternative to Ethereum. Recent developments have included partnerships with several dApps and initiatives to improve community governance. The EOS Network Foundation has also ramped up efforts to increase adoption, focusing on sectors like gaming and DeFi. But can EOS reclaim its former glory? While the project shows promise, its path forward isn’t without challenges. That said, for those willing to bet on a comeback story, EOS remains one of the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. Conclusion In a market as dynamic as crypto, diversification is key. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking wallet and strong presale performance, offers practical solutions that set it apart. Celestia is redefining what’s possible with Web3 applications, and EOS is showing that comebacks are very much a thing. If you’re looking for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, these three projects are worth a closer look. Qubetics stands out for its innovation and investor confidence, while Celestia and EOS bring unique strengths to the table. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Celestia (TIA), and EOS (EOS) as the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 .

38077645,https://thecoinrise.com/skipped-xrp-this-revolutionary-layer-1-presale-is-redefining-blockchain-potential/,1735091101,Skipped XRP? This Revolutionary Layer 1 Presale is Redefining Blockchain Potential,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with opportunities, and for those of us who’ve been watching for the next big thing, it’s clear: the blockchain space is evolving faster than ever. If you’ve skipped out on Ripple’s XRP, one of the industry’s well-known players, don’t worry – there’s a new project that’s capturing attention with its revolutionary technology and groundbreaking potential: Qubetics ($TICS) . In a landscape dominated by projects like XRP, which have brought significant changes to the world of cross-border payments, Qubetics is a fresh contender that’s setting out to redefine what a Layer 1 blockchain can do. With its presale already raising over $7.7 million and more than 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics ($TICS) is on track to offer some of the most promising returns in the space. But what makes Qubetics stand out against established players like Ripple? Let’s dive into the features, recent developments, and price predictions to find out why Qubetics might just be one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today . 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Scalability and Interoperability Qubetics is an emerging Layer 1 blockchain that is already capturing attention for its innovative approach to scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability. Currently in its 14th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $7.7 million and sold more than 374 million tokens, with prices set to surge by 10% as it enters the 15th stage. At just $0.0377 per token, Qubetics represents a potential goldmine for early investors. Qubetics is unique in that it focuses not only on blockchain scalability but also on cross-chain interoperability, allowing seamless communication and transactions between various blockchain ecosystems. This is an area where Ripple and other established projects have had limitations. While Ripple focuses on payments, Qubetics is looking to create an all-encompassing Layer 1 blockchain solution that connects multiple blockchains , making it easier for developers and users to access various ecosystems without friction. Recently, Qubetics has been integrating with top blockchain players, laying the groundwork for a robust and interconnected ecosystem. This opens up possibilities for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise solutions that benefit from its speed, low fees, and high scalability. The ongoing presale has generated immense interest, and analysts are predicting that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, providing investors with a 564% ROI. Decentralised VPN: Real-World Use Cases One of Qubetics’ standout applications is its Decentralised VPN . This feature offers a unique solution to individuals and businesses in Southeast Asia, where internet privacy and access restrictions are common concerns. Imagine a business in Indonesia wanting to protect its online operations from surveillance or a professional in Vietnam needing to access global websites without restrictions. With Qubetics’ Decentralised VPN, they can do so securely, bypassing local network restrictions and ensuring that their online presence remains anonymous. For businesses looking to securely engage with clients across borders, a Decentralised VPN built on Qubetics could offer peace of mind, knowing that their communications are encrypted and decentralised, free from the reach of central authorities or government interference. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Qubetics’ innovative approach to scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability sets it apart from other Layer 1 blockchains like Ripple. Its real-world applications, such as the Decentralised VPN, and its ongoing presale success make $TICS a Top Altcoin to Buy Today for anyone looking to secure long-term returns in the blockchain space. 2. Ripple (XRP): The Giant of Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s XRP has been a dominant player in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space for years, particularly in the realm of cross-border payments. Its focus on providing a fast, secure, and low-cost alternative to traditional banking systems has earned it a strong reputation. Priced at around $0.438, XRP remains one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for anyone seeking exposure to the payments industry. Ripple has seen significant adoption in the financial services industry, with a growing list of banks and financial institutions integrating its technology to streamline cross-border transactions. XRP’s real-time settlement system, known as RippleNet, continues to expand, providing a faster alternative to traditional SWIFT transfers. However, despite its success in the financial sector, Ripple has faced regulatory challenges, particularly in the United States. The ongoing lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cast a shadow over XRP’s future. The outcome of this legal battle could have long-term implications on XRP’s price and regulatory status, potentially affecting its ability to continue growing as a global payments solution. Despite these challenges, XRP remains a Top Altcoin to Buy Today for those looking for a solid investment in the payments sector. Its strong partnerships, established use cases, and solid network make it a reliable choice, though investors must be mindful of the regulatory uncertainties. Why did Ripple (XRP) make it to this list? XRP’s continued dominance in the cross-border payments space and its solid market performance make it one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today, especially for those seeking a trusted and well-established asset in the crypto market. However, potential regulatory risks mean that investors should keep a watchful eye on its future developments. Qubetics vs. Ripple for Short-Term and Long-Term Gains Let’s take a closer look at how an investment of $8,000 would perform in both Qubetics and Ripple. With Qubetics, the current price per $TICS token is $0.0377. If you were to invest $8,000 in Qubetics at the current presale price, you would receive approximately 212,870 tokens. Analysts predict that $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, giving you a 564% ROI, making your $8,000 investment worth around $51,435. If $TICS continues to rise after the presale and reaches $1, your $8,000 investment would grow to $212,870, representing a 2,555% ROI. Even more optimistic projections suggest that $TICS could hit $5 after the mainnet launch, making your $8,000 investment worth $1.06 million—a 13,176% ROI. The explosive potential of Qubetics is hard to ignore. On the other hand, if you were to invest $8,000 in Ripple at the current price of $0.438 per token, you would be able to purchase approximately 18,270 XRP tokens. While XRP has shown steady growth, analysts predict more moderate returns, with a potential rise to $0.50 over the short term. This would offer a 14% ROI, making your $8,000 investment worth around $9,120. Ripple’s price growth tends to be more stable, but its future is tied to regulatory outcomes, which could impact its short-term and long-term growth prospects . Why did Qubetics make it to this list? The potential for exponential returns from Qubetics in the presale phase makes it one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for investors looking for high-growth opportunities. While Ripple remains a solid and reliable asset, Qubetics’ innovative features and rapid growth make it the more compelling option for short-term and long-term gains. What Are The Top Altcoins to Buy Today Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as a revolutionary blockchain project that offers greater potential for growth compared to Ripple (XRP). While XRP continues to dominate the cross-border payments space, Qubetics provides a broader vision with its focus on scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability. The Qubetics presale has already raised over $7.7 million, and with a unique application like the Decentralised VPN, it has positioned itself as one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for investors seeking high returns . If you missed the boat on XRP, now is the time to consider Qubetics. With explosive potential, an innovative approach, and a presale that’s already showing incredible growth, $TICS is the Top Altcoin to Buy Today for anyone looking to capitalise on the future of blockchain technology. Don’t wait—secure your $TICS tokens today and watch your investment grow as this revolutionary project continues to unfold!

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/donald-saves-crypto-donalcry-solana-memecoin-will-rally-18000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-pepe-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

This partnership marks an important shift for TeraWulf, placing the company at the crossroads of two fast-growing industries: AI computing and Bitcoin mining. By leasing its data center space to Core42, TeraWulf is diversifying its sources of income and increasing its long-term earnings potential. The company has mainly focused on Bitcoin mining with sustainable operations and is now expanding into AI as a new business model. The increasing demand for efficient, scalable computing infrastructure in both AI and cryptocurrency sectors gives TeraWulf a great opportunity to benefit from these growing markets. TeraWulf’s CEO, Paul Prager , stressed how important this partnership is. He said it helps the company expand beyond Bitcoin mining and positions it as a leader in AI-driven computing. He pointed out that moving into AI will be a key factor for future growth, especially as the company continues to use mostly zero-carbon-powered infrastructure. This fits with TeraWulf’s larger goal of offering energy-efficient and scalable solutions to meet the growing demand for digital infrastructure. The data center lease agreement will provide TeraWulf with a steady and profitable income over time. The leases have two five-year renewal options and the chance to add 135 MW of power, which shows there is a lot of potential for growth. TeraWulf’s ability to quickly set up customized data centers also puts it in a good position to meet growing demand in both the AI and cryptocurrency sectors. TeraWulf’s move into AI comes at a time when Bitcoin mining is facing challenges. The cost of Bitcoin mining increases depending on several factors, such as electricity prices, hardware efficiency, and the mining space. Increase in Bitcoin Mining rates A recent report by CoinShares showed that the cost to mine a Bitcoin increased by 13%, reaching $55,950 in Q3 2024. This rise in costs has caused Bitcoin miners, including TeraWulf, to lose market share. Many are cutting back on mining to focus on AI projects, with some even buying Bitcoin directly instead of expanding their mining operations. TeraWulf’s move into AI-driven computing is part of a wider trend in the cryptocurrency mining industry, where companies are seeking new revenue sources due to rising costs. The company’s stock was affected by these challenges, with its price dropping 12.1% on December 23, reflecting broader market trends. However, TeraWulf has had a strong performance in 2024, with its stock price up by 152.6%, partly due to Bitcoin’s rise in value. As businesses and governments continue to seek AI solutions currently, the demand for this type of computing is expected to rise. TeraWulf’s focus on providing AI infrastructure powered mostly by zero-carbon energy gives it an edge in this market. TeraWulf’s partnership with Core42 is a smart move that sets the company up for long-term success in both AI and cryptocurrency. While it faces challenges in Bitcoin mining, its shift to AI-driven computing could help the company grow. With its focus on energy-efficient infrastructure, TeraWulf is well-placed to take advantage of the increasing demand for both AI and cryptocurrency services.

38075412,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313957,1735088436,"Here’s a Potential Downside Price Target for Cardano If ADA Sees New Correction, According to Benjamin Cowen","A widely followed crypto analyst is identifying the downside price target for smart contract platform Cardano ( ADA ) if it undergoes another correction. In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 849,000 YouTube subscribers that if the Federal Reserve doesn’t bring back quantitative easing (QE), then ADA could continue to slip. “There’s also a chance [ADA] could go lower, especially if it follows what it did last cycle… If it were to drop 56%, that would actually put you below $0.60, which is right where it went last time… There’s always a chance that it comes back down to [the $0.357 price level], because [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell just says ‘no QE, continue on playing in the sandbox and the cryptoverse and we’ll give you QE sometime later.’ There’s a chance that happens.” Quantitative easing is when a government’s central bank purchases financial assets to increase the money supply and stimulate economic activity. Cowen goes on to say that ADA’s technical indicators, such as its 20-week simple moving average (SMA) and 21-week exponential moving average (EMA), are lining up with the theory that the crypto asset could see another sizeable dip. “The other thing to look at is the bull market support band. The bull market support band for ADA to Bitcoin – you can see that first of all, it wicked below it [in mid 2023] but it had a weekly close right around the 20-week SMA. [Earlier this year] it was just above the 21-week EMA, so I would also keep an eye on that. The 20-week SMA for ADA is around $0.56 [and] the 21-week EMA is around $0.67, so that would also correspond to [a price tag of around $0.53].” ADA is trading for $0.89 at time of writing, a 3% increase during the last day. On December 2nd, it was valued at $1.21.

38074479,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666975,1735086656,Analyst Forecast ‘Highly Bullish’ 2025 For Ethereum: Is The Bleeding Over?,"Ethereum (ETH) has started to climb some levels after it fell to the $3,100 support zone last week. The second-largest cryptocurrency is attempting to break from its downtrend, with some market watchers suggesting it is poised for a massive run in 2025. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 Ethereum Key Levels To Reclaim With only a week left in 2024, several market watchers have started forecasting the crypto market’s potential performance for next year. Despite the recent pullbacks, several analysts have predicted a remarkable performance for Ethereum in 2025. The King of Altcoins has struggled to turn the $4,000 level into support. After breaking past this level earlier this month, ETH has been rejected from this price range three times. Its latest attempt occurred a week ago when Ethereum soared to $4,100 before retracing 7.3%. As Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $92,000, the second-largest crypto continued its freefall to the $3,100 support zone, reaching its lowest price in a month. Since then, Ethereum has hovered between $3,200 and $3,550 but failed to break past the price range’s higher zone for the past four days. However, the cryptocurrency has broken out of its downtrend line and is attempting to reclaim the $3,500 support. A crypto analyst noted that ETH appears to have broken and retested its one-week downtrend after reclaiming the $3,400 support. According to the post, a “clean breakout” of this downtrend could lead the cryptocurrency to a retest of higher levels. Ali Martinez highlighted that ETH’s next big support zone was between the $3,032 and $3,132 price range, with 4.85 million ETH bought by 3.69 million addresses. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s next big resistance wall is between $3,640 and $3,740, where over 2 million addresses bought around 4.3 million ETH. To Martinez, “a sustained close outside this no-trade zone will determine the direction of ETH’s trend.” Will ETH Follow 2021’s Performance? Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that “the first four months after U.S. elections are often highly bullish for ETH.” Per the chart, Ethereum registered massive gains in the first third of the year after the 2016 and 2020 US elections. In 2017, Ethereum started the year with a 31.92% increase in the first month, while it recorded a 78.51% surge in January 2021. In both years, ETH hit its peak monthly performances between March and April, seeing 214% and 44% returns in 2017 and 2021, respectively. If Ethereum repeats this historical performance, its price could surge above its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 in January and continue to climb during the rest of Q1. Crypto trader Immortal noted that Ethereum’s recent performance resembles its 2020-2021 price action. According to the chart, ETH saw a significant rise in early 2021 before consolidating in its new range. This was followed by a breakout and a massive drop to retest consolidation zone. Related Reading: Solana Recovery Momentum Set The Stage For $194 Resistance Breakout However, when ETH reclaimed its breakout levels in 2021, the cryptocurrency continued rallying toward its previous ATH of $4,300, eventually hitting its current ATH at the end of the year. The trader notes that ETH is retesting the consolidation range after last week’s dip, which signals that the cryptocurrency could soar in the coming weeks if it follows a similar path. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,501, a 6.3% increase in the last 24 hours.

However, the same cannot be said for centralized finance protocols, whose losses have more than doubled in the past year. Hacken’s report shows that DeFi losses represented 20.4% of the total crypto hacks losses, while CeFi accounted for 30% in 2024. However, compared to last year, DeFi losses lessened by 40%, dropping from $787 million in losses to only $474 million in losses this year. CeFi losses skyrocket to $694M in 2024 CeFi losses grew dramatically, rising to $694 million from $339 million in 2023. The DMM Bitcoin hack in May 2024 stood out as the largest CeFi breach, with losses reaching approximately $305 million. About 4502.9 BTC was transferred to an unknown wallet, before being redistributed to other addresses. Another major CeFi hack, the WazirX hack, accounted for 42.8% of Q3 crypto losses, with nearly $240 million siphoned. An attacker breached their system, acquiring signatures from three WazirX signers and one from Liminal, enabling them to upgrade the wallet to a malicious contract and drain the funds. Despite the DeFi sector achievements, some protocols were still heavily affected by hackers’ exploits including Radiant Capital. The DeFi firm lost over $55 million after a hacker gained access to their system using some malware, manipulating legitimate transaction approvals, and bypassing the protections of hardware wallets. Over $1.7 billion was lost to access control exploits in 2024 Over $2.3 billion has been drained by hackers from the crypto space in 2024. Both the DeFi and CeFi sectors were heavily hit by access control vulnerabilities. Access control exploits accounted for 75% of all crypto hack losses and nearly half of all DeFi losses, draining more than $1.7 billion. In addition, phishing scams drained over $600 million in 2024. Most of them were a combination of inclusive celebrity-endorsed rug pulls and presale scams. Hacken’s report even highlights that hacks and breaches across crypto and metaverse platforms persisted into 2024, due to weaknesses in private key management systems, poor security measures, single-signature vulnerabilities, and insecure private key backups.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-musk-the-manipulator-muskmani-will-rally-14000-before-exchange-listing-as-dogecoin-and-bonk-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Don’t Sleep on This Top Crypto Presale That’s Turning Dips Into Gold with its BIG50 Discount!,"If you’ve been around the cryptocurrency space for a while, you’ve probably heard stories of those who turned small investments into life-changing wealth by getting in on the right coin at the right time. Popcat (POPCAT) is one such example. Those who jumped on the train early witnessed exponential growth, while others watched from the sidelines, regretting their hesitation. Now, a new opportunity is knocking on the door— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With its presale featuring a limited-time rollback to Stage 7 pricing, the potential to secure incredible gains is here again. Don’t miss out this time. BTFD Coin: Seize the Dip and Soar BTFD Coin isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a rallying cry for savvy investors who understand the value of buying low and holding for the moonshot. Its presale has become a hot topic, thanks to its strategic rollback to Stage 7 pricing of $0.000064—a massive 50.77% discount from its current stage price. For those ready to dive in, the opportunity to make 837.5% gains when the coin lists at $0.0006 is simply too good to pass up. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out BTFD isn’t just banking on hype; it’s building an ecosystem that rewards its holders. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards offering an eye-popping 90% APY, and a referral programme incentivising community growth, the project is designed for long-term success. The beta version of the P2E game is already live, showcasing the team’s commitment to delivering value even before the presale ends. While no rewards are earned in the beta version, the final game promises to integrate BTFD tokens, allowing players to earn while they play. Additionally, BTFD’s Bulls Squad—a vibrant community of investors—adds a layer of resilience and collective power to the project. As part of this squad, you’re not just investing in a coin; you’re joining a movement dedicated to seizing opportunities during market dips and riding the wave to financial success. Presale Success and Investment Example The BTFD presale has already raised over $4.44 million, selling more than 58 billion tokens to over 6,500 holders. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, scarcity is engineered into tokenomics. Let’s put the potential gains into perspective. If you invest $3,000 at the current Stage 7 price of $0.000064, you’ll secure approximately 46,875,000 BTFD tokens. When the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $28,125—an astounding return on investment. Join the BTFD Presale Before the BIG50 Deal Ends Getting in on the action is straightforward: Go to the Presale site and connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code “ BIG50 ” in the designated field to claim the discounted Stage 7 price. Input the amount of BTFD tokens you wish to purchase. Review the discounted price and confirm your purchase. This limited-time offer ends on January 5, 2025, so don’t wait too long. The next bull market could be your gateway to financial independence, and BTFD Coin is your ticket. Popcat: The Missed Opportunity Popcat ($POPCAT) burst onto the scene with a quirky yet captivating backstory tied to the viral Popcat meme. It was a community-driven project that leveraged the power of Internet culture to gain massive traction. Early investors who recognised the potential of this unique meme coin reaped the rewards as the token’s value skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of $1.67 in October 2024. Popcat’s Meteoric Rise and Fall POPCAT’s initial success was fuelled by a robust marketing strategy, high-profile exchange listings, and a dedicated community. Its listing on Binance and KuCoin added legitimacy and liquidity, attracting a wave of new investors. The token’s market cap surged as it climbed the crypto rankings, making headlines and creating overnight millionaires. However, like many meme coins, POPCAT’s journey hasn’t been without challenges. After hitting its peak, the token experienced a significant correction, losing over 65% of its value in the following months. This downturn highlighted the volatile nature of meme coins and the importance of timing in the crypto market. Those who missed out during the early stages of POPCAT’s rise often look back with regret, wondering what could have been. Why BTFD is the Best Bet Right Now The story of POPCAT serves as a cautionary tale and a source of inspiration. It underscores the potential of meme coins to deliver astronomical gains but also the necessity of getting in early. With BTFD Coin currently in its presale stage, history is offering a second chance. Don’t be the person who looks back and says, “I should have invested.” Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Next Big Thing The world of cryptocurrency moves fast, and opportunities don’t wait. Popcat’s meteoric rise and subsequent correction are reminders of the potential rewards and risks in this space. While many missed the chance to turn POPCAT into a financial windfall, BTFD Coin presents a fresh opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a promising project. With its limited-time rollback to Stage 7 pricing and an ecosystem designed for long-term growth, BTFD Coin is undoubtedly the top crypto presale of the moment. Act now, claim your discount with the code “ BIG50 ,” and secure your stake in BTFD Coin before the presale ends. Don’t let this chance slip through your fingers—join the Bulls Squad today and make 2025 the year you seize the dip and soar to new heights.

He still holds a lot of ETH and believes in its future. Experts are hopeful that Ethereum’s price will rise again. Justin Sun sold ETH, The rumor Justin Sun, the founder of Tron (TRX), rumors about him claiming that he sold a large amount of his Ethereum (ETH). These rumors have started after data showed huge transfers from wallets linked to him. The timing of these transfers also combined with Ethereum’s recent drop in price which made people think Sun was selling his ETH. The issue started when Justin Sun was said to have moved about $143 million worth of Ethereum which is 39,999 ETH to HTX. These transfers happened soon after Ethereum’s drop below $4,000 and that dropped to $3,127. However, Sun explained on X post that he did not sell his Ethereum. He said that the transfers were just internal wallet movements and also confirmed that he still believes in Ethereum’s long-term potential, despite the price drop. Despite the transfers he still holds about 42,904 ETH which is worth around $139 million.

Analyst Javon Marks identified “Adam & Eve Double Bottom Pattern,” which could push Ethereum above $4,000 and possibly up to $4,800 in the near future. Despite recent price changes, Ethereum is still a major player in the blockchain world. Its strong role as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and ongoing technological improvements make it an important part of the crypto ecosystem. Sun’s renewed support for Ethereum reflects the overall optimism about its future growth and success. Justin Sun’s clarification has been important in restoring confidence among investors during a time of uncertainty. By addressing the rumors directly and repeating his support for Ethereum, Sun has helped calm the market. His response shows how important clear communication.

Currently trading around $0.30, the Dogecoin price has seen a sharp drop of 25% over the past week, worrying traders and investors as it struggles to hold onto important support levels. This drop raises concerns about a possible further decline. Crypto trader Kevin predicted on November 13 that the Dogecoin price would fall to between $0.26 and $0.28, and this prediction has now come true. Despite facing criticism, he believes that tjw Dogecoin price will eventually recover and aim for new highs, but it may have to go through a significant drop first. Kevin noted that the Dogecoin price is experiencing a typical pullback in a bull market after a “golden cross,” which usually signals future price increases. He highlighted that previous drops have been about 50%, and a 45% pullback could establish key support, keeping the uptrend intact. However, the Dogecoin price closing below $0.26 could signal serious market issues, while the current decline is viewed as normal.
