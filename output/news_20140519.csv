42377233,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703Av,1400536841,"Chicago Sun-Times to Let Readers Buy Jay-Z, Beyonce Tickets With Bitcoin","The Chicago Sun-Times is launching a new type of advertisement that will allow its readers to buy products with bitcoin directly from printed material.  As reported by The Wall Street Journal, the Sun-Times will run product ads featuring QR codes. Readers will then be able to scan the codes and conduct transactions in bitcoin to make a purchase.  The first deployment of bitcoin QR code-enhanced ads is coming soon and will let readers buy tickets to an upcoming concert featuring Jay-Z and Beyonce at Chicago’s Soldier Field via a local ticket exchange.  According to Josh Metnick, chief technology officer for the Sun-Times’ parent company, Wrapports, the initiative will reshape the way that advertisers and consumers interact within a media setting.  He told the WSJ:  ""It will allow newspapers or any printed media, for the first time we are aware of, the ability to transact directly with customers, to allow newspaper advertisers the ability to sell directly to consumers reading the paper.""  The news is the latest in what has become a broader bitcoin experiment for the newspaper, and has notable similarities to an initiative unveiled by mobile app provider Pounce and Lord & Taylor this March.  Pushing media support  The Sun-Times adopted bitcoin payments in April, at the time citing the move as a way to ""stay digitally focused"".  The decision to accept bitcoin as a form of payment for subscriptions paid off, the company said later. During the week following the launch, the newspaper reported that roughly 11% of new subscriptions were paid for with BTC.  The media outlet's decision to partner with Coinbase followed its 24-hour micropayments trial with BitWall. That partnership found the newspaper collecting more than 700 donations for non-profit group the Taproot Foundation, and was one of the first major tests for BitWall, the California-based bitcoin micropayments provider.  Experimenting with altcoins  The Sun-Times is also planning to accept altcoin payments, according to Metnick. He remarked that the newspaper would accept litecoin, dogecoin and peer coin, adding:  “We are not stopping at bitcoin.”  Additionally, the newspaper is launching an initiative that would allow readers to tip writers and editors in dogecoin. This concept is one of the dogecoin community’s most well-known characteristics.  However, Metnick told the Journal that the dogecoin tipping initiative is not quite ready for launch.  He cited ethical considerations as a potential roadblock, but stated that the idea of dogecoin tipping is ""the new like"", and that it could reshape how newspapers run as businesses and generate revenue.

42377242,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703MF,1400535022,BitPay CTO: Visa and MasterCard Will 'Leverage' Bitcoin,"US-based bitcoin merchant processor BitPay is in direct competition with major credit card providers, and as such, the company expects these market players to one day begin using bitcoin.  BitPay  's CTO, Stephen Pair, recently discussed this stance with CNBC in a broadcast interview that centered on his company's place in the payments space.  Pair said that the technology behind companies such Visa and MasterCard is antiquated, and that as a result, these financial giants will turn to digital currency, telling CNBC:  ""When we were first contemplating this business, we looked at what it would take to solve the payment fraud problem with credit cards, which were designed in the 1950s. Our conclusion was that you would end up reinventing bitcoin"".  Consumer adoption  Pair told CNBC that BitPay believes big companies in the payments world will have no choice but to implement bitcoin, saying:  ""That gave us a lot of confidence going forward that, if and when MasterCard and Visa get into the space, that they would actually leverage the bitcoin technology rather than directly compete with it.""  Of course, the issue of low consumer adoption weighs on the mind of many in the bitcoin industry.  The problem can be attributed to poor public perception, banking issues and a lack of easy ways getting started with bitcoin. Credit card companies could make using bitcoin easier, although BitPay, Coinbase and Circle may prefer to do it first.  The next big thing  BitPay has been able to score some major brands that now accept bitcoin using its payment system. Both Wordpress and TigerDirect are prime examples of major brands willing to accept digital currency.  Pair hinted that there would be more to come, and said major organizations continue to examine the benefits of digital currencies for consumers.  Further, he added that major companies are always looking several years down the road for what the next big thing will be. Pair believes that widespread bitcoin acceptance could come faster than most people think:  ""I think [bitcoin will arrive] a lot sooner than people imagine today. I think many of them are looking at it already.""  The TV appearance follows BitPay's 30m Series-A funding round, which was formally announced on 13th May and included Richard Branson and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, among others.

42377243,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703NV,1400531740,Brock Pierce to Bitcoin Foundation: I Will Not Step Down,"Recently elected Bitcoin Foundation director Brock Pierce has dismissed allegations made by detractors in a new letter addressed to the other members of the organization's board of directors.  He wrote in the letter, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, that he regretted the furore created following his election, but stated that he would not step down from the Bitcoin Foundation board.  Brock said further that resigning in the wake of ""hateful and uninformed chatter on bitcoin forums"" would not be ""rational, prudent or warranted"".  Brock added that such an act would be detrimental to the future of the Bitcoin Foundation, saying:    ""It would set a bad precedent for the Foundation, rewarding those who make scurrilous accusations and engage in character assassination, often anonymously.”      ""A resignation also could be perceived as an admission of guilt and I am guilty of nothing and have never been convicted, or even charged, with a crime.""    Brock's removal from the board would impair his and his team's efforts to rehabilitate Mt. Gox and fully compensate its customers, he said, and suggested that those behind the campaign to remove him had ulterior motives to oppose such rehabilitation or promote their own plans.  Brock denies allegations  In the letter, Brock reiterated previous denials of accusations levied against him. He wrote that related matters had been looked into by federal authorities but that nothing had come of them.  He wrote:  ""Despite a full investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s office, the FBI and the State of California into the allegations, I was never charged with anything whatsoever by anyone and was cleared of any wrongdoing.""  Brock pointed out in the letter that litigation brought against him was dismissed or settled. Additionally, new lawsuits filed against old business partners do not involve him, he said.  Brock addresses resignations  In the letter, Brock also touched on the wave of membership cancellations following his election. Notably, he referenced the fact that fewer than a dozen of the foundation's 1,500 members decided to leave the organization.  Of greater concern, Brock said, is that similar reactions were not seen following the resignations of Charlie Shrem or Mark Karpeles, writing:  ""I am at a loss to explain why they would do so now and not after Mr. Karpeles allowed Mt. Gox to implode or Mr. Shrem was indicted. I am saddened and angered by this.”  Pierce joined the foundation’s board of directors earlier this month. Brock’s election proved controversial due to a number of allegations dating back to 2000.  At the time, Brock and two of his associates were facing lawsuits alleging sexual abuse, but he was eventually exonerated. The allegations resurfaced after a new lawsuit was filed by one of the plaintiffs in the original lawsuits, Michael Egan.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/19/brock-pierce-to-bitcoin-foundation-i-will-not-step-down,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33e5d3a1c8cfba54c6af8242449c2b67b8925c90-937x676.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377234,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703CB,1400523912,Dutch Court Declares Bitcoin Isn't Money in Civil Trial,"A court in the Netherlands, has issued a ruling in a civil lawsuit that has potential implications for how bitcoin will be treated under Dutch law.  Notably, the court in Overijssel found that bitcoin does not meet the definitions of ""common money"", ""legal tender"" or ""electronic money"", ultimately ruling that bitcoin is a medium of exchange akin to gold.  The case could set a precedent in the Netherlands for similar lawsuits, as the ruling answers the question of what damages need to be assessed when an agreement to trade bitcoin is not fulfilled as promised.  The court case centered on a 2012 bitcoin transaction between two unnamed parties that was never completed. Party A (the buyer) had sought to buy 2,750 BTC from party B (the seller), but only received 990 BTC.  1,760 BTC never delivered  At the time of the sale, the buyer paid the full sum of €22,000 for all of the BTC, or roughly €8 per bitcoin. After continued delays in the delivery of the remaining bitcoins, the buyer sued the seller.  The Overijssel court ruled in favor of the buyer, and ordered the defendant to pay back the original value of the missing 1,760 BTC (roughly €14,000 at the time) in addition to interest and legal costs.  However, the buyer was not awarded the €130,000 in damages he claimed as the result of lost profits he would have reaped during bitcoin's rapid price surge last year.  Court assessment  The court elaborated on the nature of bitcoin in its ruling, suggesting that the digital currency is not legal tender in the Netherlands. This definition, the court ruled, is limited to euros and other coins issued by the European Central Bank (ECB).  The court reportedly cited statements made by the Dutch Minister of Finance when ruling that bitcoin does not meet the definition of electronic money. The official had previously issued this guidance in response to parliamentary questions.  Ultimately, the judge concluded that none of the definitions of common money under the Dutch civil code apply to bitcoin, though it noted that the digital currency can be accepted as a form of payment in the Netherlands.  Appeal possible  Speaking to CoinDesk, bitcoin investor Paul Buitink said that he would like to see the case progress further.  Buitink, an active member of the Dutch and Belgian bitcoin communities – who notably runs bitcoin information website deBitcoin.org – said that the buyer can still appeal the ruling, and such an action could have benefits for bitcoin.    ""I think he should do that as we need courts to confirm bitcoin is indeed money in order to boost acceptance in the Netherlands and worldwide.      The importance should not be underestimated, as this should put pressure on the legislators to change the definition of money in Dutch law, and hopefully widen its scope.""    Had bitcoin been deemed money, Buitink said, the transaction would have been considered a foreign exchange, and thus the buyer could have been entitled to exchange rate loss.

42377252,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX703V3,1400517456,OKCoin and Huobi Discuss Bitcoin in China and Plans for Survival,"The interviews in this article are part of CoinDesk's wider coverage of the Global Bitcoin Summit in Beijing, which took place 10th-11th May 2014.  As part of a clampdown on bitcoin in China, the nation's bitcoin exchanges were forced by the authorities to pull out of any official involvement with Beijing's Global Bitcoin Summit earlier this month.  However, CoinDesk was still able to meet with the CEOs of two of the largest exchanges, OKCoin and Huobi, at an off-conference event where they discussed the regulatory climate, bitcoin in China, and their plans going forward.  Both OKCoin's Star Xu and Huobi's Leon Li are optimistic about bitcoin's future in China, they said, and see the current regulatory environment as a real, but temporary problem that can be overcome.  The CEOs also addressed the Chinese central bank's concerns regarding excessive price speculation and investor risk, hinting that this may be driving the government's recent actions and agreeing that exchanges could do more to curb such activity.  Star Xu, OKCoin  Xu first got into bitcoin at the beginning of 2012, he said, after seeing the digital currency mentioned on an episode of TV drama series The Good Wife, he said. After falling in love with the concept and researching the topic further, he began trading on Mt. Gox and BTC China later that year. He founded OKCoin early in 2013.  ""I felt that they could do better,"" he said. ""So I wanted to found a new exchange.""  OKCoin soon found investors, including the $10m it received in Series A funding from local VC firm Ceyuan, followed by investment from Mandra Capital and VenturesLab in January this year.  Finding investors that also believed in digital currency was the key, he said:  ""The most important thing is, your investors should believe you, trust you, and support your business. My investors also believed in bitcoin, he bought a lot of bitcoin himself, and he thought I was the right person to run the business. We made the deal in 10 minutes.""  Xu advises other startup owners to be prepared to run their business for two years as they looked for investors.  ""It's really important to get the right investors for the right startup,"" he said. ""They should match beautifully.""  Bitcoin startups need to move more slowly, he continued, because they needed to help their customers better understand bitcoin and the risks associated with its use.  Banks and regulation  Despite the recent regulatory environment in China, Xu said that he still thought his native country was less restrictive than others, which have also seen bank account closures and even arrests of bitcoin exchange operators:  ""Actually it's easy to run a bitcoin exchange in China. There are only two exchanges in the US, but in China we have 10 or 20 bitcoin exchanges.""  The People's Bank of China's policies would ""bring a period of hardship"", but, in the long term, the situation would improve, he predicted, since the government has shown some interest in communicating with bitcoin companies.  Overseas plans  Xu's ultimate goal is to take OKCoin international in some form, either directly or by licensing the company's technology to other companies:  ""From the beginning I thought bitcoin is international, this is the reason I love bitcoin. I think the Chinese bitcoin companies will cooperate with overseas startups. I think we need more cooperation than competition.""  ""We can make more and more customers love bitcoin, and use bitcoin,: he added. ""The important thing for all of us, is that bitcoin has no nationality.""  Mt. Gox revival?  OKCoin's name has recently been associated with an alternative plan to rescue the defunct Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, challenging the SaveGox campaign launched by Sunlot Holdings Ltd.  Under the plan, the exchange would not launch a direct takeover, but assemble a new team leveraging OKCoin's technology and experience, and make an application to the Japanese bankruptcy court overseeing the case.  Xu became interested in reviving Mt. Gox after one of his friends suggested OKCoin could help out with its technology and experience, he said. Trying to resurrect the business and return funds to its customers was important for the whole bitcoin community, he added.  Only the court could decide in the end, he pointed out, so his team would have to apply to the Japanese bankruptcy court and await its reply:  ""It's very complicated and hard work. It needs maybe one or two years.""  Leon Li, Huobi  Like Xu, Huobi CEO Leon Li is positive about the future of bitcoin in China, in several sectors. There is a lot of trading and mining activity in China, he told CoinDesk, but the surrounding services, like apps and APIs, need improvement.  Speculation on bitcoin price had been ""too hot"" in the past year, and China's exchanges needed to calm things down, he argued. Many investors were looking to make short-term gains, he said, and that kind of activity needed to be kept in check ""for the good of the country"".  Future plans  As for the near future in the wake of new central bank restrictions, Huobi said it had a two-stage plan to continue business.  The first step will be to move away from direct interaction with the banks and instead interact with a ""peer-to-peer network"", in which Huobi would function as a platform for users to trade fiat currency for bitcoins directly with each other.  The second step will be to investigate opportunities overseas, although Li did not specify at this stage what those opportunities might be.

42397624,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDajK,1400514043,Federal Reserve: Bitcoin Potential 'Boon' for Global Commerce,"The Federal Advisory Council (FAC), a group that consults with the Federal Reserve on all matters under the US central bank's jurisdiction, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors recently discussed bitcoin and its potential benefits at a quarterly meeting.  Held on 9th May, the FAC and the Board of Governors debated whether bitcoin posed a threat to the traditional banking system, economic activity or financial stability, ultimately issuing a surprisingly positive two-and-a-half-page assessment of the technology.  Perhaps most notably, the meeting focused on how bitcoin could empower a new wave of commerce innovation – opening new markets to merchants, driving capital flows to the developing world and increasing global economic consumption.  Meeting minutes stated:  ""Bitcoin does not present a threat to economic activity by disrupting traditional channels of commerce; rather, it could serve as a boon.""  Further, despite its highly publicized use in illicit transactions, the minutes suggest that the FAC believes bitcoin has ""room to improve"", and that its price volatility is ""likely to diminish over time"".  The meeting minutes are a notable contrast to recent statements from other international central banks taking a less progressive, and arguably hostile, view of the technology.  More curiosity than threat  The meeting minutes suggest that the two groups believe bitcoin does not present ""a near-term threat"" to banking by way of disintermediation, noting that ""bitcoin transactions correspond to only a fraction of today's global fund flows"".  The minutes went on to detail how security and volatility concerns are likely to limit bitcoin adoption, stating:  ""Extreme price volatility is similar to other speculative forms of stored value, undermining Bitcoin’s credibility. [...] Susceptibility to theft increases uncertainty for users seeking alternatives to traditional institution-based deposits.""  Payment processors may be forced to react  The meeting minutes suggested that the FAC and the Board of Governors believe the most likely impact bitcoin will have on the traditional financial world relates to payment processing.  By enabling lower transaction fees, facilitating cost-effective micropayments and extending financial services easily to the developing world, the report suggests bitcoin could provide powerful incentives to consumers and win customers away from more established service providers.    Still, the FAC believes there is opportunity in the space for banks, as well, noting:    ""Should adoption accelerate, banking could participate increasingly in bitcoin fund flows, especially as multi-currency accounts proliferate and reputational concerns subside.""  Regulation advised  The FAC concluded that regulating the industry could have many benefits, including addressing illicit use and providing consumer protection. Overall, the FAC advocates for a middle-ground approach to regulation.  The minutes read:  ""Bitcoin advocates may argue that increased regulation minimizes one of its greatest advantages, namely decentralization. Recent events suggest that some flexibility should be sacrificed to address obvious problems.""  For example, the FAC suggested that bitcoin's susceptibility to theft could be addressed by regulation for bitcoin exchanges, and that likewise, bitcoin wallet providers could benefit from rules that govern how bitcoins are stored.  Know-your-customer (KYC) regulations were also advised as a way to reduce the use of bitcoin in criminal transactions.  Limitations  While seemingly positive, the FAC reiterated past criticisms of the bitcoin network, such as the potential for the network to be compromised by miners, and limited money supply provided by the technology, which could in turn prevent the application of traditional monetary policy tools. The document also noted the risk of shadow transactions between banks using bitcoin.  The meeting minutes, while positive, do not necessarily indicate that the Federal Reserve will alter its current stance regarding bitcoin.  This February, Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen stated that the US central bank does not have the authority to regulate bitcoin.  The statement was issued during an address to the Senate Banking Committee, and prompted by US Senator Joe Manchin, who had previously lobbied for the US government to take a harsh stance against the technology.

Glasgow, Scotland  The country that gave the world liberal economics now is now furthering that cause with a Lamassu ATM, and charging a more than reasonable 0% fee on transactions.  CeX  , a tech retailer, is promoting its machine as a way to encourage the general public into using bitcoin via a simple way to buy the digital currency at its bricks-and-mortar location in Glasgow.  China  Last weekend's Global Bitcoin Summit in Beijing wasn't just about central bank regulations and mining hardware. Startup BitOcean also demonstrated a pair of active ATMs it has developed in partnership with major exchange OKCoin.  Vancouver, Canada  Vancouver has been the spiritual home of bitcoin ATMs since it installed the world's first machine back in October last year. Now it has another, a Lamassu kiosk owned by Yuri Yerofeyev, a local bitcoin entrepreneur, trader and Director of The Bitcoin Co-op.  The new ATM can be found at 1195 Robson Street, Vancouver, and, going forwards, customers will be able to purchase their bitcoin at an exchange rate of Virtex +5%.

42397620,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDafO,1400504635,Intuit Labs Testing Bitcoin Payments Service for Merchants,"Accounting software developer Intuit has announced that it is testing a bitcoin payments service aimed at small businesses.  The company describes QuickBooks Bitcoin Payments as a service that enables small businesses to take bitcoin payments without having to bother with bitcoin wallets or even deal with bitcoin at all. The service is being developed by Intuit Labs, the experimental branch of Intuit Inc.  It is a familiar concept, already used by existing payments service providers such as Coinbase, BitPay and Mollie, designed to ease the on-ramp to acceptance of the digital currency.  Keeping costs and risks low  Intuit Labs argues that checks, cash and credit cards have a number of inherent deficiencies that can be addressed by digital currencies: cash is hard to keep track of, checks have a lot of transaction friction, and credit card fees are high.  “We came up with an innovative way to enable small businesses to accept bitcoin payments without any risk or a bitcoin wallet,” Inuit Labs claims.  The developers identified two major barriers to bitcoin adoption by small businesses.  Firstly, businesses need a bitcoin wallet and trust in third-party wallets is not currently very high. On top of that, they cannot afford to deal with price volatility. With QuickBooks Bitcoin Payments, however, merchants will only see dollars in their account when they accept bitcoins.  Extensive user base  What sets Intuit apart from some competing bitcoin payments services is its background, since it specialises in accounting software and point-of-sale (POS) software solutions.  POS units powered by Intuit software are common in the US and some other countries, while lot of small businesses in the US already use QuickBooks. This means the company already has an extensive user base, so it will essentially be offering its new bitcoin service to existing users and does not have to start from scratch like BitPay or Coinbase.  Last week Dutch payments provider Mollie entered the bitcoin payments space, with more than 10,000 clients in tow. Intuit is taking a similar approach, albeit potentially on a much bigger scale, since Mollie is limited to the Benelux region.  The service is still being tested, however, and it is unclear when QuickBooks will actually launch.  While Intuit is not giving much away right now, the company is currently looking for beta testers. Interested parties can sign up on the beta waiting list here.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/19/intuit-labs-testing-bitcoin-payments-service-for-merchants,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7db324f02ca82c7c6cf16285037e53528e428c6c-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397631,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDamH,1400500797,Do Patent Filings from eBay and Western Union Pose a Threat to Bitcoin?,"In recent months, there has been no shortage of potentially alarming headlines detailing how mainstream financial and tech giants such as eBay, IBM and JPMorgan may be looking to enter or impact the bitcoin space with strategic patent filings.  The most recent company to enter these ranks was Colorado-based remittance giant Western Union, which received a patent on 1st April that reports have suggested would give the company a claim to a key aspect of the bitcoin industry – the exchange of alternative currencies.  Despite the sensational headlines, however, it has remained unclear as to what potential effect, if any, such a patent would have on the ability of bitcoin businesses to provide similar services or offerings.  The question remained, how worried should bitcoiners be about these high-profile patent filings?  Community concern  One patent analyst and bitcoin enthusiast believes the threat of such actions is not only real, but that it's one that the bitcoin industry needs to actively defend against.  To this end, Reed Jessen, founder of the Cryptocurrency Defense Foundation (CDF), is seeking to protect the bitcoin space from such intrusion through the strategic filing of patents.  ""Our goal will be to protect the fledgling cryptocurrencies of the world from the repressive pressures of the patent system and allow them to compete based on the merits of their use, not on government-granted monopolies,"" said Jessen in the CDF's launch statement.  The service would be offered royalty-free to companies that agree not to assert their patents against others in the industry.  More broadly, the CDF would seek to build a patent portfolio to promote and defend the community's interests and business ambitions, especially given that its research suggests 65 patents related to cryptography have been filed by companies such as QUALCOMM and Visa.  With this in mind, CoinDesk asked Jessen to analyze three recent digital currency related patents – filed by eBay, Gemalto and Western Union – to illustrate their potential impact on the bitcoin space.  Though he notes his assessments represent his opinion and not any legal judgement or advice, Jessen provides a look at how the claims – both those pending and those approved – could impact digital currency businesses.  Western Union  In Jessen's view, the Western Union patent does give the company exclusive rights to an exchange that allows users to trade digital currency for fiat currency, though the actual system to which Western Union is entitled these rights is far more narrow.  For example, the system protected by Western Union's patent would provide users with a list of people looking to sell fiat for digital currency and allow these individuals to select the person with whom they would like to trade.  Western Union's patent also notably calls for an ""assessor"" that would analyze the offer and score them based on their value. The assessor would then award both individuals proposed trade scores, and both parties would decide whether to execute the trade based on such information.  Jessen concluded that due to these specifications, any effect on the bitcoin space as a result of the patent is likely to be limited, explaining:  ""This patent only grants Western Union the right to stop someone from using the 'assessor' functionality for 20 years, not the right to exclude people from using exchanges to trade money. If your exchange does not have an 'assessor', it does not apply to you.""  Western Union provided comment on its filing to CoinDesk, though the statement did not provide clarity as to its goal for the patent:  ""Western Union generally does not comment on specific intellectual property assets. That said, we have, and will continue to explore opportunities that build on our experience and expertise in the various facets of the money transfer market.""  eBay  Unlike Western Union's filing, which was recently granted, eBay's patent for a ""System and method for managing transactions in a digital marketplace"" is currently pending approval. However, it has grabbed headlines due to eBay's past statements about its active interest in the digital currency space.  This patent, filed in December 2011, describes a system that determines whether a customer is buying unique digital goods and makes adjustments to avoid this overlap.  According to Jessen, the process would work like this:  ""If you are attempting to buy the album 'Abbey Road' by the Beatles on iTunes (or some other music service), but have previously purchased 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer', this program will identify that you already own the song and instead sell you 'Abbey Road' minus 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' at a reduced costs.""  Bitcoin, however, could still be affected by the system, he said:  ""This patent relates to cryptocurrencies only tangentially in that [it describes] doing this process with a privately issued currency like airline miles or bitcoin.""  Gemalto  Of the three patents, the implications of software developer Gemalto's pending patent application for a ""Transaction method between two entities providing anonymity revocation for tree-based schemes without trusted party"" may be perhaps the most related to digital currency.  Filed in April 2008, Jessen described the patent application as ""very closely related to the concept of the block chain"". He noted it uses public key encryption, but adds additional anonymity features.  Overall, Jessen suggests the patent could have implications for alternate uses of the block chain, saying:  ""They are proposing a cryptocurrency scheme without the need for access to the Internet.""  As with eBay's filing, however, the patent has not been approve and may never be granted.

42397626,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDaiL,1400496750,Server Hardware Issues Cause More Problems for LocalBitcoins,"Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins is currently experiencing a lengthy outage brought about by server hardware issues. However, the exchange has reassured its users that all bitcoins are safe and sound.  LocalBitcoins confirmed the outage in a blog posthttp://localbitcoins.blogspot.com/2014/05/unexcepted-downtime.html on Sunday with a brief statement:  “Our server had gone down yesterday. The reason might be hardware failure. We are researching the issue and trying to get the site back up.”  The company also tweeted that no bitcoins or data had been lost in the outage:    Trying to get service back up. Can't provide ETA yet. All btc is safe, all data is safe, this is not a security breach but a server problem.      — LocalBitcoins.com (@LocalBitcoins) May 18, 2014    A LocalBitcoins team member confirmed that no data has been lost, but he pointed out that the exchange needs to make some “serious improvements” to its server infrastructure.  The exchange later tweeted that the problem has been identified early this morning and that it is hardware related. The exchange estimated that it would take 2 to 4 hours to restore services, but five hours later no progress has been reported and the site was still down.  Community reaction  LocalBitcoins has suffered numerous outages in the past, but this time the issue is taking longer to resolve than on previous occasions.  The exchange suffered a server breach two weeks ago, which was quickly resolved. However, although no data was compromised, LocalBitcoins described the attack as “very dangerous”.  Thanks to past issues with failed exchanges, the bitcoin community tends to be edgy when it comes to outages and downtime. Hence, the reaction to the the exchanges latest problem has been swift and negative.  A few threads have popped up on reddit and bitcoin forums since the site went down. Many users used them to vent their frustrations, but they also used them to look for alternative services.  As the outage goes on, speculation mounts and so do calls to switch to competing services such as Mycelium.  As of noon Central European Time, the site is still down with no clear estimate for a return to normal services. If the issue is not resolved soon, the outage will shortly enter its second day.
