42407730,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2DHN,1724714355,This 'Degenerate' Crypto-Culture Publication is Betting on Print,"SALT LAKE CITY — Crypto's got a demographic problem: too many men. The scene's newest culture magazine wants to leverage that imbalance harder than a memecoin trader's credit line.  Superbasedd, a month-old wannabe lifestyle rag with deep LA roots, is planning to stand up a print publication that appeals to the crypto space's baser instincts. On the front page: a cover girl. On the back: an authoritative-looking male startup founder. And in between: tales from crypto's trader trenches.  ""We're all dudes, we're all degenerates, and if there's one thing I know about degenerate dudes, they love women. And that's a really good way to start a brand,"" said Superbasedd founder Steve McHugh.  Women are the ""bait"" for what McHugh and his co-founders described as an authoritative but edgy magazine that brings web3 culture to male audiences over the world. Lure in readers with alluring photos and then smack 'em with ""really good culture and profile pieces highlighting this industry.""  Whether sex+culture can still sell magazines is an open question. Playboy is only just plotting its return to newstands with an annual glossy edition. That once-vaunted dude institution published articles that had appeal for pretty much anyone up on the culture. Meanwhile, Superbasedd's content will tap a far-smaller pool of younger guys who like crypto, though McHugh said its female-forward marketing targets ""guys"" at large.  Superbasedd's ""dangerous"" content strategy complements its staff. McHugh's lanky business partner Jake Hillhouse was slated for an undercard bout at the upcoming Karate Kombat fight night in Singapore in a few weeks. Then he blew up his elbow in a dune buggy accident; Hillhouse showed up to our impromptu interview in an arm sling and a hospital wristband barely 48 hours old.  Still, the publication has some capital to burn. Earlier this month Superbasedd generated almost $1.1 million by selling NFTs that come with a three year subscription, which hasn't yet launched. Another subscription option will offer one year of access for $99.  McHugh plans to feature a part of crypto that the established media brands are either missing or have abandoned. Of the major crypto-focused publications, only Decrypt has reporters dedicated to documenting the often zany ways this industry's participants express themselves.  Those stories often veer toward the insane, and even obscene. Seemingly every week the memecoin factory Pump.Fun sees another ridiculous stunt of token creators embarrassing, or injuring themselves to make the token's price climb higher, like that time a guy smoked crack and had his head shaved by a stripper on a livestream.  ""Our edginess is going to start with the girls and then end with crackhead dev,"" said Hillhouse.  Superbasedd plans to tell those tales alongside in-depth features of the leading male figures in crypto. During our interview McHugh toyed with getting Solana's founders Raj Gokal and Anatoly Yakovenko for the first edition, coming in October.  There's something deeply strange about a crypto-focused publication betting on print for distribution. It's a critically endangered medium within the twenty-first century's fast-dying institution, journalism.  Superbasedd's team thinks tactile formats will nonetheless work when paired with the lessons of the Instagram age. First, use pictures of sexy women to capture guys' attention. Then, hold that attention with snappy articles that tell stories in digestible ways, perhaps by outlining them like a thread on X.  McHugh harbors visions of elevating Superbasedd into ""high snobciety"" with enough caché to sit atop any moneyed coffee table in the Hollywood Hills. he's betting that America's trickle-down celebrity culture should make the magazine broadly relevant.  For now, though, Superbasedd is leaning hard into overtures that would only mean something to the most dedicated NFT swapper on Solana, the chain for which this magazine's publishers seem most aligned.  Superbasedd recently bought the intellectual property for Catalina Whale Mixer – a once-popular NFT collection with a $2.5 million market cap – for less than $50,000, according to McHugh. It is planning to take over the Thug Birdz NFT collection next.  The publication's three-man team came to mtnDAO to work on outreach to other crypto founders, said McHugh, a two-time attendee. In-person crypto workspaces can help startups move faster on the strange business propositions of this industry, like standing up a token.  Their background diverges from the norm at this twice-a-year hacker house, now in its sixth edition. Every August and February a growing flock of Solana developers decamp to Salt Lake City for one month of collaborating on projects, which often tilt toward new financial primitives.  ""We're not devs, we're not builders, we're startup, content guys,"" McHugh said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/26/upstart-degenerate-crypto-culture-publication-bets-on-print,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87cb0c3e06d51bc52fa18698b6079d96361a7b52-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After dropping to $2,116 just 20 days ago, ETH experienced a significant price surge, recovering to higher levels, suggesting bullish momentum was building. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Gains: Another Increase on the Horizon? This accumulation phase has drawn the attention of analysts and investors alike, who are now closely monitoring Ethereum’s price action for signs of a more significant move to the upside. The recovery from recent lows has sparked renewed optimism, with some market experts predicting that ETH could reach $3,000 in the coming days. This potential rally is a critical milestone in Ethereum’s ongoing market cycle, reflecting its strength and investors’ confidence in its long-term value. As Ethereum continues to accumulate and consolidate, the market is bracing for what could be a major breakout, setting the stage for new highs shortly. Ethereum Price Structure Suggests A Coming Breakout After a relatively long period of consolidation, Ethereum appears poised for a move toward higher prices. Analyst and trader Castillo Trader shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting a potential ETH trajectory shift. According to Castillo, ETH will likely retest lower demand at $2,611 before targeting the significant $3,000 mark. The 4-hour chart suggests that this period of consolidation has reached a tipping point, an important move could be imminent. The $3,000 level is not just a psychological barrier; it has also acted as a support in recent months before breaking down at the start of this month, making it a crucial resistance to break. If Ethereum successfully breaks above this level and consolidates, it could pave the way for a sustained uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Metrics Turn Positive: Can This Drive A New ATH Above $5,000? This anticipated breakout could begin a new bullish phase for Ethereum as the market looks to move past the recent period of stagnation and push toward new highs. Investors and traders are closely watching these developments, as the next few days could be critical in determining Ethereum’s direction. ETH Technical Analysis Ethereum is trading at $2,743; its next move could go either way. ETH might retest lower demand around $2,500 before attempting to push toward the $3,000 mark. This retest would allow the market to establish a stronger foundation for a sustained uptrend. However, given recent volatility, there’s also a chance that Ethereum could bypass the retest and push to $3,000. Volatility has shown that anything can happen, and the rapid price movements are a testament to this unpredictability. A crucial technical level to watch is the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $3,026. This EMA acts as a resistance point, and breaking above it would strongly indicate a bullish continuation for Ethereum. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst: Bulls Must Hold $2,500, Spot ETF To Catalyze Demand It would confirm strength if Ethereum breaks through the $3,000 psychological level and closes above the 200 EMA.

42407728,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2DNz,1724707354,It’s Time to Build a Sustainable Blockchain Ecosystem,"Even in the midst of what many consider a bull run — Bitcoin up 126% and Ethereum up 53% year-over-year — retail investors are feeling a sense of stagnation in the token markets. Earlier in the year, memecoins stole the spotlight, but as the dust settles, it's clear that only a small fraction of investors actually profited. Now, with even the most hyped infrastructure projects showing declining charts, the question looms: where should retail investors put their money next?  The answer lies in identifying blockchain ecosystems that offer builders the tools to build, launch, and scale real companies with sustainable valuations — opportunities with genuine long-term potential, rather than just another meme-driven gamble. One that will start to resemble an actual stock market of sorts.  In the current Web3 landscape, the consensus is clear: people are growing weary of yet another infrastructure company raising funds; instead, they're eagerly awaiting the next big consumer application. While defining what a ""consumer application"" entails could be an article in itself, it's crucial first to understand why venture capitalists (VCs) continue to pour money into infrastructure. The reality is that venture capital is driven by the pursuit of a 100x return — like finding the next Solana. Many large VCs hedge their bets by diversifying their portfolios, hoping that one big win will offset the losses from those that didn't pan out. However, even among VCs, there's a growing recognition that infrastructure investments won't yield returns if there's no surge in applications building on them.  Read more: Azeem Khan - What Does It Actually Take to Build a Blockchain?  A common criticism of venture capitalists is that they aren't willing to invest in consumer applications, but that’s not entirely accurate. If we look back to 2021, after Axie Infinity’s success, nearly every VC funneled billions into the GameFi industry, hoping to replicate that success. While it’s likely that little of that money will ever be returned to investors as profits, it's clear those investments were aimed at consumer applications — or at least, attempts at them. Even if most of these GameFi projects were essentially DeFi applications disguised as games with Ponzi-style tokenomics, they were still consumer-facing efforts.  VCs will invest in consumer applications once they spot a winner. For instance, we've seen 40 replicas of Polymarket (my estimate) since its recent success. The main takeaway here is that, despite the expectation that VCs should have contrarian views to generate returns for their investors, they often resort to being copycat investors, playing a financial version of ""follow the leader.” Who those leaders are tends to coincide with who has the most money.  There's recognition that infrastructure investments won't yield returns if there's no surge in applications building on them  This brings us to the concept of actual applications being built on a robust blockchain infrastructure within a healthy ecosystem of apps and users. While some envision a future with a billion users, others argue that the technology isn’t ready to scale, and skeptics dismiss the entire space as a bubble waiting to burst. Rather than getting caught up in speculation, it’s more productive to consider what a truly thriving community of blockchain applications might look like. The specific blockchain isn’t the key factor here — no single chain has emerged as the clear leader. Much like how telecom companies have found regional success worldwide, we’ll likely see multiple blockchains thriving in parallel.  What a healthy ecosystem looks like  So, assuming the ideal blockchain infrastructure is in place, what would it mean for tens or even hundreds of millions of users to seamlessly interact on-chain in the future? And, crucially, how does this scenario create opportunities for retail investors and even VCs to achieve returns on their investments?  In a market like this, builders from around the world would have the freedom to choose their preferred blockchain based on their specific needs and the resources those blockchains offer. From there, these builders would ideate on the companies they want to launch, start building, and eventually bring their products to market. Ideally, they would then raise venture capital to scale their operations once they gain traction. After proving their model, they might launch a token on exchanges to grow their treasury, using those funds to fuel further growth according to their tokenomics.  Importantly, these companies would likely be raising money at more realistic valuations, as they would need to demonstrate they are building genuine businesses with sustainable revenue models. In this model, the blockchain would generate revenue from the blockspace used by these products, builders would profit as the value of the tokens they own increases, venture capitalists would see returns through token unlocks, and centralized exchanges would earn from the buying and selling of tokens by users. Or, perhaps, larger companies would acquire these projects in a way that is financially beneficial for everyone involved.  If this model sounds familiar, that's because it's similar to Web2. Then, a common path for companies is to build a minimum viable product, gain traction, raise venture capital to scale, and eventually either get acquired or go public through an IPO. These companies raise funds at realistic valuations and focus on creating sustainable businesses, with investors who believe in their long-term potential.  For retail investors, this model presents an exciting opportunity. Instead of pouring money into infrastructure projects with already inflated valuations or gambling on memecoins with near-zero chances of success, investors could back companies launching on different chains at smaller, more reasonable valuations with real growth potential. Savvy investors in this space might invest in a company whose token initially launches at a $10 million valuation and watch it grow to something like $100 million, based on their confidence in the company’s ability to deliver value to users over time.  We'd likely find ourselves in a scenario with multiple iterations of projects across DeFi, SocialFi, GameFi, and various consumer applications. Each project on different chains would require a fresh set of metrics to determine which ones are primed for success. This dynamic environment would be particularly exciting for savvy investors eager to explore innovative methods for evaluating and capitalizing on on-chain companies.  There would undoubtedly be missteps in valuing and investing in these companies. However, over time, the market would stabilize, shifting away from gambling for returns and toward more strategic investments. Investors would begin to identify the diamonds in the rough through solid investment strategies, and the ecosystem would gradually mature into a more sustainable market. This isn’t to downplay the inherent risks that always accompany investing, especially when valuing companies at the cutting edge of innovation. Web3 is already rife with scams, so it's likely that a more sophisticated investing landscape could also give rise to more elaborate schemes. But, despite these risks, the potential upside in such a market could be enormous.  As the blockchain industry matures, it needs to shift from pure speculation to investments that resemble a traditional stock market. For years, the industry has created and lost value without establishing real business models. However, as we enter the next phase — where blockchain is taken seriously by regulators and major businesses worldwide — it’s crucial to demonstrate that we’re on the path to turning blockchains and the applications built on them into real, sustainable businesses. By doing so, builders, users, and investors can finally reap rewards in a way that fosters a healthy and lasting blockchain ecosystem.

32872122,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637805,1724704205,"Crypto Pundit Predicts Ethereum Price Rise To $3,000, But A Crash Could Happen First","Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has provided deep insights into what to expect from the Ethereum price action going forward. The analyst predict that the second largest crypto token by market cap will still rise to $3,000 but noted that a crash will happen first. Ethereum To Rise To $3,000 Soon Enough In an X (formerly Twitter) post, CrediBULL Crypto shared a chart that showed that Ethereum would rise to $3,000 sometime in September. However, the analyst’s chart also showed that Ethereum will drop below $2,500 before it enjoys this move to the upside. CrediBULL Crypto did well to explain why he believes that ETH’s price will follow such a trajectory. Related Reading: Cardano Investors React To 14% ADA Price Surge To $0.37 According to the analyst, Bitcoin will likely pull back soon, giving altcoins like Ethereum a “nice reset.” He stated that Ethereum’s first downside target is around $2,300 and $2,500. CrediBULL Crypto added that Ethereum will target range lows if it loses that range. However, the crypto analyst remarked that the ideal move is for Ethereum to drop to this first downside target and then bounce from there for another leg up, pushing it into the higher timeframe resistance at $3,000 before the “final” crash. Meanwhile, CrediBULL Crypto again noted that this projected move depends on Bitcoin’s price action. As such, he warned that if Bitcoin “melts harder,” then ETH will likely lose the range between $2,300 and $2,500 and drop lower. On the other hand, if Bitcoin simply corrects “midway,” then Ethereum will see a bounce in that range and enjoy another higher high, which he highlighted on the chart. Based on this chart setup, CrediBULL Crypto warned that opening fresh longs on altcoins like Ethereum at their current price level is a bad idea. There is no doubt that crypto bulls may be tempted to make such a move, seeing as Bitcoin achieved a successful breakout above $60,000 over the weekend and looks ready for another massive rally to the upside. The Real Fun Hasn’t Began For ETH Crypto analyst Cousin Crypto suggested that the “fun” is yet to start for Ethereum and that a massive rally is still on the horizon for the crypto token. Based on the chart he shared, Ethereum is still set to rise above $5,000 in this bull run and could begin the rally to this price level next month. Related Reading: The Shiba Inu Shibarium Suffers 97.6% Crash In Active Accounts, What’s Going On? Crypto analyst Poseidon echoed a similar sentiment, remarking that the “expansion” will begin once Ethereum flips $3,000. This expansion will take Ethereum as high as $5,200, a price level the analyst predicted the crypto token could reach by October. Such a price rally will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for EtheETHreum, whose ATH is currently at $4,800. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,7030, down almost 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42407737,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2Dl8,1724702486,"Ether ETFs Have Bled Money, but That's Not the Whole Story","At first glance, spot ether ETFs appear to have bled money, but it's more complicated than that.  BlackRock's ETHA was the seventh-most-successful ETF launch this year with over a billion dollars worth of inflows. Other ether funds have seen brisk demand as well.  Grayscale's ETHE product lost billions, offsetting the overall success of the funds.  The headline could easily be this: Recently launched ether exchange-traded funds have been a dud.  After all, investors have removed $465 million of assets in total from the nine funds that began trading in the U.S. a month ago.  Dig a little deeper and you'll find success, however.  BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) just passed $1 billion of net inflows, making it the seventh-most-successful ETF launch this year, according to Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund and the Bitwise Ethereum ETF have taken in $390 million and $312 million, respectively, according to data from Farside Investors.  But back to the overall removal of money, which stems from the billions of dollars yanked from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). That product was first sold to investors in 2017 and began trading publicly in 2019 – albeit in a less-appealing trust format. It was turned into an ETF in July as new funds from the likes of BlackRock sprung into existence.  The Grayscale product features a much higher fee for investors, meaning many might want to shift to a cheaper fund. Exclude the massive Grayscale outflows and investors have allocated over $2 billion to the other funds in the first five weeks.  “The fact that over $2 billion has been purposefully allocated to the other spot ether ETFs is a good sign as it shows that investors want ether exposure,” Geraci said. “While not the dazzling debut we saw from spot bitcoin ETFs, I think spot ether ETFs have clearly had a successful first month and I expect this to continue.”  In regards to Grayscale, Geraci believes that the outflows muddy the waters and make it difficult to get a clear picture of how much demand there is for the funds. “We simply don’t know all of the underlying motivations of ETHE sellers, which is why I think it’s important to look beyond that product.”  Demand is likely to continue and grow over the next few months, said Sui Chung, CEO of index provider CF Benchmarks. He predicts that more wealth managers will offer the products to their clients.  “We anticipate flows into ETH ETFs will continue to climb once wealth managers and financial advisors complete the education process for what ETH is, its utility and why they should hold it alongside their BTC ETF,” he said. “The educational process will expose investors to the Ethereum economy and highlight its key differences to Bitcoin, making it abundantly clear that the allocation drivers are different and both belong in a balanced investment portfolio.”  Spot bitcoin ETFs, which began trading in January, have seen nearly $18 billion in inflows. Investors have allocated roughly $20 billion into BlackRock’s product, which is mostly offset by $17 billion worth of outflows out of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), another Grayscale fund that existed for years as a trust before converting to an ETF this year.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/26/ether-etfs-have-bled-money-but-thats-not-the-whole-story,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0ed7970eeb40ba03473f338170bcc94c92d2821b-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The settlement focused on its Abra Earn product, which the agency said had amassed as much as $500 million at one point.  Abra has agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over accusations the platform, owned by Plutus Lending, inappropriately pushed Abra Earn to customers when the product qualified as a security that should have been registered, the agency said Monday.  Starting in 2020, the crypto investment platform and lender began offering Abra Earn to customers, promising high levels of returns for letting the firm use their assets, the SEC said in its complaint. At one point, the program had about $600 million, and almost $500 million was from U.S. investors. Also, for at least two years, Abra operated as an investment company without registering, the SEC said.  The company, which accepted the sanction without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to a prohibition from violating the U.S. securities-registration rules and whatever civil penalties a court deems appropriate. The company had already similarly settled with 25 states for operating without licenses and agreed to return as much as $82 million to customers in the U.S.  Read More: Abra Settles With 25 States for Operating Without Licenses, Will Return Up to $82M to U.S. Customers  ""Abra sold nearly half a billion dollars of securities to U.S. investors without complying with registration laws designed to ensure that investors have sufficient, accurate information to make informed decisions before they invest,” said Stacy Bogert, associate director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, in a statement. She added that the agency is governed by ""economic realities, not cosmetic labels.""  In a statement sent after this article was published, an Abra spokesperson said, ""no consumers were harmed at all by the settlement or wind down of Abra Earn. All assets for US Earn customers including accrued interest were transferred to their Abra Trade accounts in 2023.""  Monday's action is Abra's second SEC settlement, after it agreed to pay $150,000 each to it and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2020 to end an investigation into its swaps product.

In 24 hours, the price rose 23% to $0.740. But equally impressive is this: the token registered a 96% gain in the last seven days. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: NEAR: Network Upgrade Gives Token 23% Price Boost – Details This surge has been sufficient to attract the attention of traders and investors due to its magnitude. A total of $127 million worth of transactions took place over the course of the previous day, indicating an increase in the trading activity. Meme Culture Driving Popularity First entering the digital currency scene in October 2020, the meme coin is famous for the funny “pop” motion done by the feline and has been used in a series of video clips across social media and even in video games. The meme coin community is mostly responsible for its success. The virtual market has many investors who profit from trends. Popcat has distinguished itself from other meme coins by doing this. Popcat: Strong Buy Opportunity The recent analysis has shown Popcat holding very well on the bullish side. One of the predictions from CoinCodex sees a rise as high as 226% to $2.44 by September 25, 2024. Basically, this prediction is driven by a reading of 55 for the Fear & Greed Index. Over the last 30 days, Popcat was 43% in the green and with 22.86% volatility, positive feelings are certainly ones to be excited about. Some analysts agree that now could be an ideal moment to buy Popcat based on these signals since the numbers are at an all-time high. After all, the projection suggests ongoing expansion, thus this is quite a suitable starting position for any investor hoping to profit on the rising upward trend of this token. Related Reading: FET Explodes 60% After New Project Announcement – Details Market Performance And Future Prospects With an all-time peak of $0.993 registered July 21, 2024, Popcat’s performance has been nothing short of spectacular. At the time of writing, the token was trading 25.3% below such a peak. However, going by the recent price action, a recovery could be just around the corner. Market observers peg key support and resistance levels as low as $0.23 for the price floor and $0.95 for peak resistance. Memes, community support, and market optimism—these are what drives Popcat up. It attracts cryptoverse participants with a $725 million market cap and rising trading volume. So, as this token breaks into the crypto spotlight, so should investors be on their toes regarding growth.

42407720,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2D0q,1724697982,"SEC’s Case Against Kraken Will Proceed to Trial, California Judge Rules","A federal judge ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission had brought plausible allegations against crypto exchange Kraken, meaning its lawsuit will proceed to trial.  The SEC sued Kraken last year, alleging the exchange failed to register as a broker, exchange or clearinghouse.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Kraken will proceed to trial, a California judge ruled Friday.  The SEC sued Kraken in the Northern District of California last November, alleging that the crypto exchange had violated federal securities laws by failing to register with the agency as a broker, clearinghouse or exchange. The complaint requested that Kraken be permanently enjoined from further securities violations, as well as disgorgement of its “ill-gotten gains” and other civil penalties.  Kraken is just one of the major crypto exchanges currently caught up in the SEC’s legal dragnet. Similar lawsuits were filed against Binance and Coinbase last year, alleging that both exchanges also violated securities laws by failing to register as brokers, clearinghouses and exchanges with the SEC. Both Coinbase and Binance attempted to get the cases against them thrown out – and both failed, with the judges overseeing each case ruling that the bulk of the cases against them can move forward to trial.  Now, Kraken’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s case has also been denied. In his Aug. 23 ruling, U.S. District Court Judge William H. Orrick of the Northern District of California wrote that the SEC has “plausibly alleged that at least some of the cryptocurrency transactions that Kraken facilitates on its network constitute investment contracts, and therefore securities, and are accordingly subject to securities laws.”  Kraken’s ill-fated motion to dismiss, filed in February, argued that the SEC had failed to state a claim – essentially, that the facts in the case, even if true, did not constitute a violation of the law – arguing that cryptocurrencies do not meet the definition of a security as defined by the Howey Test.  Orrick agreed with Kraken in part, ruling that the cryptocurrencies named by the SEC in its lawsuit were “not themselves investment contracts"" – an argument that SEC attorneys have distanced themselves from in hearings in some of these cases.  “Numerous courts have distinguished between the digital assets and the offers to sell them before engaging in an analysis of whether cryptocurrency transactions constitute investment contracts. The distinction is valuable,” Orrick wrote. “Although the way the SEC labels the crypto assets at issue – as ‘crypto asset securities’ – is unclear at best and confusing at worst, I do not understand the SEC to be alleging that the individual cryptocurrency tokens in which Kraken enables transactions are themselves securities.""  ""The meat of the SEC’s pleadings alleges that during their initial offerings and throughout subsequent transactions on Kraken, those assets were offered as, or sold as, investment contracts. This is an acceptable framing, and one that the SEC has repeatedly advanced in other cases,"" the judge added.  Kraken’s Chief Legal Officer Marco Santori celebrated this section of Orrick’s ruling on X (formerly Twitter) writing:  “Today, the Federal Court for the Northern District of California ruled, as a matter of law, that none of the tokens trading on Kraken are securities. This is a significant win for Kraken, for the principle of clarity and for crypto users everywhere. It also confirms Kraken’s long-standing position that it does not list securities.”  A representative for Kraken declined to comment beyond Santori’s X post.  But just because Orrick ruled that the cryptocurrencies themselves were not securities, it does not mean that the purchase and sale of them cannot plausibly be considered an investment contract.  “Orange groves are no more securities than cryptocurrency tokens are,” Orrick wrote. “But the contracts surrounding the sale of both may form an investment contract, bringing them within the purview of the [Exchange] Act.”  Kraken’s motion to dismiss also argued that the case should be tossed out under the Major Questions Doctrine – a legal principle established by the Supreme Court that holds that agencies should not expand their regulatory powers without clear authorization from Congress.  But like other judges asked to weigh in on the doctrine, Orrick disagreed with Kraken, stating that the $3 trillion cryptocurrency industry is simply not big or important enough in the U.S. economy or political sphere to invoke the Major Questions Doctrine.  “Other courts have already considered whether similar claims brought by the SEC violate the major questions doctrine and found that they do not,” Orrick wrote. “The same is true here…while cryptocurrency itself is a relatively novel financial instrument, the principles driving the SEC’s attempt to assert regulatory authority over it are not new.”  Both parties are required to submit a Joint Statement by Oct. 8, which will include a proposed case schedule and trial date.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/26/secs-case-against-kraken-will-proceed-to-trial-california-judge-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ad59bffb092794a0848e9f175623668aed872ed-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The stablecoin benefited from its expansion to the bustling Solana ecosystem, with its supply on the network already surpassing that on the Ethereum blockchain.  Yield incentives on DeFi protocols played a ""huge role"" in the growth, 21.co's Tom Wan said.  Payments giant PayPal's (PYPL) stablecoin PYUSD surpassed the $1 billion mark in market capitalization last week, CoinMarketCap shows.  Issued in conjunction with fintech company Paxos, PYUSD achieved this milestone as it more than doubled its supply since June.  Despite the broader crypto markets cooling off during the summer doldrums, PYUSD user activity also surged. Monthly active wallet addresses topped 25,000 in July, up from 9,400 in May, according to Visa's stablecoin dashboard created with Alluvium.  PayPal's entrance to stablecoins was touted as a ""watershed"" moment for the broader crypto industry last year, as observers envisioned the token to eventually compete with stablecoin giants Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT. However, early enthusiasm faded as the token's growth fizzled out on the Ethereum {{ETH}} network. Then came PYUSD's expansion to the Solana {{SOL}} network at the end of May.  The token's supply on Solana went to $650 million from zero in three months, and is already larger than on Ethereum. Over the past month, PYUSD supply on Solana grew by 171% and is rapidly closing in on Tether's USDT on the network, DefiLlama data shows.  ""Incentives play a huge role"" in PYUSD's recent growth, said Tom Wan, business development and strategy associate at digital asset investment product firm 21.co. Integrations with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols also helped, he added.  Solana-based protocols Kamino, Drift and Marginfi all introduced boosted rewards for PYUSD deposits, offering double-digit annualized yields for token holders. Most recently, crypto custody firm Anchorage Digital also introduced rewards for PYUSD deposits to institutions last week.  However, concerns linger about how sustainable PYUSD's growth will be if incentives phase out.  ""My sense is that these incentives are not sustainable, but they are not designed to be permanent,"" David Shuttleworth, partner at research firm Anagram, told CoinDesk. ""Part of the idea here is to get more PYUSD into circulation and get users, especially new ones, on-chain and active on the Solana ecosystem.""",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL | USDT | PYUSD,ETH | MARKET | SOL | USDT | PYUSD,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/26/paypals-stablecoin-hits-1b-market-cap-as-incentives-boost-activity-on-solana,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b896847dbc47d52c9c66a26584fa0d990db0949-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This comes only five months after the funds hit the $1 billion milestone in March.  Less than five months after hitting $1 billion in market capitalization, tokenized Treasury notes have doubled in size again, crossing the $2 billion level on Saturday, according to data from RWA.xyz.  Tokenized Treasuries are digital representations of U.S. government bonds that can be traded as tokens on blockchains such as Ethereum, Stellar, Solana, Mantle and others. While $2 billion is an impressive milestone for the recently launched funds, there is far more potential given the Treasury market's massive size of $27 trillion.  The largest one, BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), is a big factor in this year's soaring market cap. ust six weeks after its late March launch, BUIDL became the largest tokenized Treasury fund at $375 million in market cap. Assets now stand at $503 million. Competitors include Franklin Templeton’s OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) and Ondo’s U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY), both of which have also seen explosive growth.  Most of the recent growth, however, came from smaller issuers, rwa.xyz data shows. Hashnote's offering mushroomed nearly 50% to hit $218 million over the past month. Meanwhile, OpenEden's and Superstate's products grew 37% and 18%, respectively, during the same period, both nearing $100 million market cap.  Tokenized Treasury funds have become a popular investment vehicle for crypto traders looking to diversify their holdings and take advantage of the rapid rise in Treasury yields over the past few years while also being able to settle transactions at any time.  The 10 year U.S. yield currently stands at 3.81% versus 1.5% four years ago. Similarly, the 2 year yield has risen to 3.92% up from near zero levels in 2020 and 2021.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL,"Helene Braun, Krisztian Sandor",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/26/tokenized-treasury-funds-pass-2b-market-cap-amid-blackrocks-explosive-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e0f1e0cb337051b9b0a9f308e3a5f8e383fa577-1482x706.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32868495,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637931,1724696065,Husky Inu or Mpeppe: Which Meme Coin Offers Better Long-Term Investment Potential?,"The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with meme coins continuing to attract investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Among the latest contenders are Husky Inu (HINU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), both of which have generated significant buzz. But which of these meme coins offers better long-term investment potential? Let’s delve into the details. Husky Inu (HINU): A Rising Star with Community-Driven Features Husky Inu (HINU), a Solana-based token, has quickly made a name for itself in the crypto world. The project has already raised over 375,000 in its presale, currently in its third round, demonstrating strong investor interest. Husky Inu (HINU) aims to carve out its niche in the meme coin market by positioning itself as a close ally to established coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). The appeal of Husky Inu (HINU) lies in its innovative approach to community engagement and reward mechanisms. The project has outlined several features designed to add value to its holders: Capped Token Supply: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, HINU ensures scarcity, which could help maintain its value over time. Deflationary Mechanism: 50% of all platform fees will be used to buy back and burn HINU tokens, gradually reducing the circulating supply. Charity Voting: The project allocates 5% of its total supply to community rewards and charity, allowing users to vote on charitable causes. Speedy Transactions: Built on the Solana blockchain, Husky Inu (HINU) promises quick, low-cost transactions, making it an attractive option for users. Future Developments: Husky Inu (HINU) plans to launch an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange (DEX), which could further enhance its utility and value. The combination of these features positions Husky Inu (HINU) as a strong contender in the meme coin space, especially for investors interested in projects with a clear roadmap and community-centric initiatives. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Kid on the Block with Sports Enthusiast Appeal On the other side of the spectrum, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is another exciting project that seeks to unite the worlds of sports fandom and blockchain technology. Inspired by the legendary Pepecoin and the talents of professional soccer player Kylian Mbappé, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to cater to a global audience of sports enthusiasts. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has gained attention for its unique blend of sports-related memes, gaming, and sports betting, all underpinned by the robust infrastructure of the Ethereum blockchain. Some key features of Mpeppe (MPEPE) include: Viral Marketing Potential: Leveraging the popularity of sports and internet memes, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has the potential to rapidly grow its community and user base. Mpeppe (MPEPE) Online Casino: The project’s gambling platform is designed to capitalize on the intersection of meme culture and online gaming, offering players exciting opportunities for rewards. NFT Integration: Mpeppe (MPEPE) plans to introduce Player Card NFTs inspired by sports legends, adding another layer of engagement for its community. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Synergy: Mpeppe (MPEPE) users can stake their tokens in DeFi liquidity pools to earn rewards, adding utility and value to the ecosystem. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s unique focus on sports, combined with its meme coin appeal, positions it as a distinctive project in the crypto space. Its innovative use of NFTs and DeFi elements could attract a diverse range of investors, particularly those with an interest in sports and gaming. Which Coin Has Better Long-Term Potential? When comparing Husky Inu (HINU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), both coins offer intriguing opportunities for investors, but they cater to slightly different audiences. Husky Inu is an excellent choice for those looking for a meme coin with a strong community focus and a clear roadmap for future development. Its deflationary mechanism and plans for a DEX and Earn App suggest a commitment to long-term growth and value retention. Mpeppe, on the other hand, stands out for its unique integration of sports fandom with meme culture. If the project successfully taps into the global sports audience, it could see significant growth, especially with its planned NFT and DeFi initiatives. Ultimately, the better long-term investment will depend on your interests and risk tolerance. If you’re drawn to the rapidly growing intersection of sports and crypto, Mpeppe (MPEPE) might be the better choice. However, if you prefer a more traditional meme coin with a strong community and clear utility, Husky Inu (HINU) offers a compelling case. Both projects are still in their early stages, making this an opportune moment for investors to get involved. As always, due diligence and careful consideration of your investment strategy are crucial when navigating the volatile world of meme coins.

32868403,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637929,1724695861,Mpeppe’s Rise Challenges Dogecoin’s Dominance: Can the OG Hold On?,"The world of meme coins is witnessing a dramatic shift as new contenders emerge to challenge the dominance of established players. Among these, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly gaining momentum, posing a significant challenge to Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin that has long held a dominant position in the market. With Mpeppe’s presale success and Dogecoin’s recent recovery, investors are now questioning whether Dogecoin can maintain its lead or if Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to take the throne. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A New Challenger with Meteoric Rise Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become one of the most talked-about meme coins, thanks to its innovative blend of sports fandom, meme culture, and blockchain technology. The project, inspired by the legendary Pepecoin and soccer superstar Kylian Mbappé, is in its third presale phase, having already raised over $1.29 million. With 80.46% of its tokens sold and the next phase price set to rise, Mpeppe is capturing the attention of both seasoned and new crypto investors. Presale Success: Mpeppe’s presale has been nothing short of impressive, with over 1.24 billion tokens sold at a price of 0.001777 USDT each. The remaining tokens are selling out quickly, reflecting strong demand and investor confidence in the project. Community and Incentives: Mpeppe’s community is rapidly expanding, fueled by the project’s unique offerings such as Player Card NFTs and an online casino. Additionally, Mpeppe is incentivizing early investors with a 20% bonus on token purchases using the promo code “MPEPE20,” further driving participation in the presale. Future Prospects: Mpeppe’s integration of NFTs and DeFi features, along with its focus on sports-related content, positions it as a versatile and innovative project with the potential to disrupt the meme coin market. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain traction, it is increasingly seen as a viable contender to Dogecoin’s longstanding dominance. But can it truly dethrone the OG of meme coins? Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Faces New Challenges Dogecoin (DOGE), the meme coin that started it all, has recently shown signs of a potential resurgence. After a period of decline, DOGE has recovered, trading around 0.083 USD, with on-chain data suggesting a bullish trend. The MVRV Z-Score, a key indicator of whether a cryptocurrency is under or overvalued, has dipped into the negative, signaling that Dogecoin (DOGE) might be poised for a new upward move. Bullish Signals: On-chain data indicates that Dogecoin (DOGE) is seeing more bullish than bearish activity, suggesting that the coin could rise to 0.16 USD or even 0.22 USD in the near future. This is supported by the Fibonacci retracement levels, which indicate that Dogecoin (DOGE) is nearing a potential breakout. Market Position: Despite facing new competitors, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a strong player in the meme coin space. Its large and dedicated community, coupled with high-profile endorsements, continue to bolster its market position. Risks Ahead: However, the broader market conditions could pose a risk. If the crypto market enters a bearish phase, Dogecoin (DOGE)’s price could fall as low as 0.049 USD, highlighting the volatility that still surrounds the coin. Mpeppe vs. Dogecoin: The Battle for Meme Coin Supremacy As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to rise, the battle between the new challenger and the original meme coin intensifies. Here’s how they stack up: Innovation vs. Legacy: Mpeppe (MPEPE) brings fresh ideas to the table, with its focus on sports, NFTs, and DeFi integration, attracting a new generation of investors. Dogecoin (DOGE), on the other hand, has the advantage of being the first and most recognized meme coin, with a strong community and brand. Growth Potential: Mpeppe’s ongoing presale success and innovative features suggest that it has significant growth potential, especially as it taps into niche markets like sports and gaming. Dogecoin (DOGE), while still popular, may face challenges in sustaining its momentum without new developments or use cases. Market Dynamics: The broader market conditions will play a crucial role in determining the future of both coins. While Dogecoin (DOGE)’s recent recovery is promising, Mpeppe’s ability to capture market share and attract a dedicated community could pose a real challenge to Dogecoin (DOGE)’s dominance. Conclusion: Can Dogecoin Hold On? Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the leader in the meme coin space, but Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) rapid rise and innovative approach suggest that the landscape could be changing. Mpeppe’s strong presale performance, coupled with its focus on sports and blockchain innovation, positions it as a formidable competitor. For Dogecoin (DOGE) to maintain its dominance, it will need to leverage its strong community and market presence while potentially exploring new avenues for growth. On the other hand, Mpeppe’s continued success could see it emerge as a major player, challenging Dogecoin (DOGE)’s position at the top. As the battle for meme coin supremacy unfolds, investors will need to carefully consider the potential of each project, keeping an eye on market trends and the ongoing developments within each community. Whether Mpeppe (MPEPE) will rise to the top or Dogecoin (DOGE) will hold its ground remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the meme coin market is more competitive than ever.

32868231,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637926,1724695411,Ethereum’s ICO Legacy vs. Mpeppe’s 150x Innovation: Which Will Prevail?,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, innovation is the key to survival and success. Two giants stand at the crossroads of this industry, each representing different eras and strategies: Ethereum (ETH), the pioneer of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), and Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new player promising up to 150x returns through its innovative approach. As the crypto market matures, the question arises: which will prevail in the long run Ethereum’s established legacy or Mpeppe’s groundbreaking potential? Ethereum (ETH): A Legacy of Innovation and Influence Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and it revolutionized the blockchain space with its introduction of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). However, recent activities by the Ethereum Foundation have sparked both curiosity and concern within the community. In August 2024, the Ethereum Foundation transferred nearly 100 million USD worth of Ether to the Kraken exchange, raising questions about the possible implications for Ethereum’s (ETH) price. The foundation clarified that this move was not indicative of a sale but rather part of their financial management activities, particularly to cover expenses like grants and salaries. This isn’t the first time such a transfer has caused speculation; similar actions in the past have been followed by significant price movements, either upward or downward. For instance, the Ethereum Foundation sold Ether at peak prices in May and November 2021, but also sold 100,000 ETH in 2020 right before the price surged sixfold. As of now, the foundation still holds approximately 750 million USD in Ether, making it a powerful player in the market. The timing of these transfers, especially in the context of upcoming events like the potential approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs in the U.S., could significantly influence Ethereum’s (ETH) price trajectory. Despite these movements, Ethereum (ETH) remains a cornerstone of the blockchain ecosystem, underpinned by a vast network of developers, projects, and institutional interest. However, as Ethereum continues to navigate regulatory and financial complexities, the market’s attention is also being drawn to newer, more aggressive players like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Contender with 150x Potential Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly risen to prominence in the meme coin space, captivating investors with its promise of substantial returns. Unlike Ethereum (ETH), which built its reputation on pioneering technology, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is leveraging the viral nature of meme culture combined with strategic innovations in NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi). Mpeppe’s presale has been a massive success, raising over 1.29 million USD with more than 80.46% of its tokens sold. The project’s unique value proposition lies in its ability to merge entertainment with utility, creating a robust ecosystem that appeals to both crypto enthusiasts and sports fans. This innovative approach is what has investors eyeing Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a potential 150x opportunity, far exceeding the returns currently seen in more established projects like Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum (ETH) vs. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Battle of Generations The competition between Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents more than just a clash of two cryptocurrencies; it’s a reflection of the broader evolution within the crypto space. Ethereum (ETH) symbolizes the foundational technology that has enabled countless other projects to flourish. Its upcoming developments, like the potential approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, suggest that Ethereum (ETH) is far from reaching its peak. These ETFs could bring in massive institutional investment, further solidifying Ethereum’s (ETH) position in the market. However, Mpeppe (MPEPE) embodies the new wave of innovation that focuses on high-risk, high-reward opportunities. While Ethereum (ETH) offers stability and a proven track record, Mpeppe (MPEPE) appeals to those looking for the next big thing a project with the potential for exponential growth in a short period. Which Will Prevail? The answer to whether Ethereum’s (ETH) legacy will continue to dominate or if Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) innovation will prevail depends on various factors. Ethereum (ETH) benefits from its established infrastructure, regulatory advancements, and wide adoption, but it also faces challenges related to scalability, regulation, and market manipulation concerns. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in its early stages, but its innovative approach and potential for massive returns make it an attractive alternative for risk-tolerant investors. For those who prioritize long-term growth and stability, Ethereum (ETH) remains a strong choice. Its influence on the market is undeniable, and upcoming developments like the Ethereum Spot ETFs could drive significant price increases. However, for investors looking for higher returns, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique opportunity that could potentially outperform even the most optimistic projections for Ethereum (ETH). In the end, both Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) represent different facets of the crypto market. Whether you’re a believer in the enduring power of Ethereum’s (ETH) technology or intrigued by the explosive potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE), one thing is clear: the crypto market is more dynamic than ever, and the next few years will be crucial in determining which of these titans will come out on top.

32868050,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637922,1724695005,ETH Whale Accumulates Base Dawgz and Mpeppe For 1000x Returns,"Fortunes can be made or lost in a matter of moments, and some seasoned investors known as “whales” are strategically positioning themselves for the next big crypto breakout. Recently, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has been making waves by accumulating large amounts of Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), betting on the potential for 1000x returns. But what makes these two tokens so appealing, and how do they stack up against the established powerhouse of Ethereum (ETH)? Ethereum (ETH): The Whale’s Backbone Ethereum (ETH) remains the cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, with its blockchain serving as the foundation for countless projects. This whale’s choice to continue holding a significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) alongside newer tokens like Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the enduring importance of Ethereum (ETH) in the crypto space. Recently, the Ethereum Foundation made headlines by transferring nearly $100 million worth of ETH to the Kraken exchange. This move has sparked speculation about the potential impact on Ethereum’s (ETH) price, especially since the Foundation has a history of influencing the market with similar transactions. Despite these concerns, Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a dominant force, with its value bolstered by institutional interest and the potential approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs in the U.S. However, while Ethereum (ETH) remains a stable and influential asset, the allure of massive returns from emerging tokens like Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) cannot be ignored. Base Dawgz (DAWGZ): The Next Big Meme Coin on Base Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about meme coins in the crypto community. Having raised over $3 million during its presale, Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is positioning itself as the “Shiba Inu of Base,” offering investors the chance to get in early on what could be the next big thing. The token’s appeal is heightened by its interoperability across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana, Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This cross-chain capability, powered by technologies like Wormhole and Portal Bridge, allows Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) to tap into liquidity across various networks, setting it apart from other meme coins that are limited to a single chain. With the presale ending on August 28th, investors are racing against time to secure Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) at the current price of $0.008173. Given the token’s potential to replicate or even exceed the returns of Brett, another successful meme coin on the Base chain, the excitement surrounding Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is palpable. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Meme Coin with 1000x Potential While Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is making headlines, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is also gaining significant traction as a meme coin with massive potential. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already raised over $1.29 million in its presale, capturing the attention of investors who are eager to get in on the ground floor of a project that promises to merge the viral appeal of meme culture with the excitement of sports and decentralized finance (DeFi). Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a meme coin; it’s a comprehensive ecosystem that includes NFTs, an online casino, and a strong community of supporters. The token’s innovative approach and the potential for exponential growth make it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios with high-risk, high-reward investments. Why This ETH Whale Is Betting Big on Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) For a seasoned Ethereum (ETH) whale, the decision to accumulate large positions in Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a calculated risk. While Ethereum (ETH) provides stability and long-term growth, the potential for 1000x returns with Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is simply too enticing to pass up. Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) offers the unique advantage of cross-chain interoperability, allowing it to access liquidity and users across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum (ETH). This versatility, combined with the momentum it’s gaining as the “Shiba Inu of Base,” makes it a prime candidate for explosive growth. Similarly, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capitalizing on the viral nature of meme coins while offering real utility through its diverse ecosystem. The potential for 1000x returns with Mpeppe (MPEPE) is drawing in investors who believe in its long-term viability as more than just a meme coin. Conclusion: The Best of Both Worlds? The accumulation of Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) by an Ethereum (ETH) whale highlights a strategic approach to crypto investing—combining the stability of Ethereum (ETH) with the high-risk, high-reward potential of emerging meme coins. As the presale for Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) comes to a close, and Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to attract attention, the stage is set for these tokens to potentially deliver the massive returns that investors are hoping for. For those looking to maximize their returns in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, the decision to follow this whale’s lead and invest in Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be a game-changer. As always, the crypto market is unpredictable, but with the right strategy, the potential for life-changing gains is always on the horizon.

32867961,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637918,1724694869,Base Dawgz Investors Seek Higher Profits From New 100X Rival,"Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) has recently captured the attention of the crypto community, raising over $3 million in its presale, making it one of the most promising new meme coins on the Base blockchain. However, as the presale comes to a close, some investors are beginning to look beyond Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) for their next big opportunity. A new contender has emerged in the meme coin space: Mpeppe (MPEPE), which is being touted as a potential 100X rival to Base Dawgz (DAWGZ). Base Dawgz (DAWGZ): A Strong Start with Multi-Chain Potential Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) has quickly established itself as a serious contender in the meme coin market, thanks to its innovative use of multi-chain technology. Unlike many other meme coins, Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) operates across several major blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain. This interoperability allows Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) to access greater liquidity and appeal to a broader audience of investors, significantly enhancing its growth potential. The presale success of Base Dawgz (DAWGZ), which raised over $3 million, reflects the growing interest in meme coins on the Base blockchain. The final presale price was set at $0.008173, offering early investors a potentially lucrative entry point before the token hits major exchanges. With the listing of Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) imminent, and possibly even on platforms like Binance in the future, the token’s value could see a significant increase post-launch. Investors are also attracted to Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) because of its staking opportunities. By staking their tokens, investors can earn an impressive annual return of up to 791.7%, which not only helps stabilize the token’s price but also encourages long-term holding. This staking feature, combined with a clever social media campaign that rewards users for promoting the token, has helped build a strong and active community around Base Dawgz (DAWGZ). The Rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE): A 100X Rival While Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) has undoubtedly made a strong start, some investors are already looking towards Mpeppe (MPEPE) as their next high-profit opportunity. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly gaining traction as a gambling-focused meme coin that promises significant returns. Its unique approach, which blends meme culture with the excitement of decentralized gambling platforms, sets it apart from other meme coins in the market. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already raised over $1.29 million in its presale, attracting a diverse group of investors who are eager to capitalize on the next potential 100X token. The project’s ecosystem includes not only the meme coin but also NFTs, an online casino, and a strong focus on community-driven initiatives. These features make Mpeppe (MPEPE) more than just another meme coin; it’s a comprehensive platform designed to engage users and create value beyond mere speculation. The excitement around Mpeppe (MPEPE) is palpable, with many seeing it as the next big thing in the meme coin market. Investors who missed out on the early success of Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) are particularly drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE), hoping to replicate the significant gains that early Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) investors have enjoyed. A New Era for Meme Coins? The success of Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and the rapid rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) signal a new era for meme coins. These projects are no longer just about internet humor; they are becoming sophisticated financial instruments with real utility and strong community backing. For investors, the choice between Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a decision between a proven performer and a high-reward opportunity. As both tokens prepare for their respective launches on major exchanges, the competition between Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) will likely intensify. Investors will be watching closely to see which token delivers the biggest returns, but one thing is clear: the meme coin market is evolving rapidly, and those who can navigate it successfully stand to reap significant rewards. In conclusion, while Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) has established itself as a top contender, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a formidable rival with the potential for 100X returns. Investors looking for the next big opportunity in the meme coin space would do well to keep an eye on both of these exciting projects as they continue to develop and capture market share.

42407729,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2DUb,1724694639,‘My Living Nightmare’: Detained Binance Exec’s Wife Begs for His Immediate Release,"The wife of Tigran Gambaryan, the American Binance employee detained in Nigeria, released a new video statement on Monday pleading for his immediate release from prison.  ""It has been six months since I last saw my husband, since our children last held their father’s hand,"" Yuki Gambaryan said in the video. ""His health is deteriorating to the point where he can no longer walk. Between bouts of malaria pneumonia and the unimaginable mental toll of his detention, he is now reaching the point of no return.""  Gambaryan, a former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent and Binance’s current head of financial crime compliance, was detained in Abuja in February, shortly after voluntarily traveling to Nigeria’s capital city at the government’s invitation. At first, Gambaryan and another Binance executive, British-Kenyan national Nadeem Anjarwalla, were held under house arrest without explanation. But when Anjarwalla escaped in March, Gambaryan was transferred to the notoriously dangerous Kuje prison, where he has spent the last five months.  After being transferred to Kuje, Gambaryan was charged with tax evasion and money laundering – seemingly as a scapegoat for his employer, which Nigerian officials have accused, without evidence, of tanking the value of the naira. The tax evasion charges against Gambaryan were later dropped, but he is currently being prosecuted for money laundering in a trial that began in June, but was suspended in July after the judiciary went on vacation. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.  In the harsh conditions of Kuje prison – which also holds members of the Boko Haram terrorist group – Gambaryan’s health has rapidly declined. In May, he collapsed in court due to malaria and in June was seen being pushed into court in a wheelchair. According to his family, complications from a herniated disc in his back has left him in excruciating pain and unable to walk. Gambaryan has also been prevented from accessing his lawyers, his family has said, and prison officials have refused to release his medical records or provide him with adequate health care despite a court order to do so.  Now, his wife says Gambaryan needs immediate medical treatment or ""risks permanent damage.""  Gambaryan’s plight has attracted attention from some members of Congress, including Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Penn.) who visited Gambaryan in prison in June and called for his immediate humanitarian release. The same month, a group of lawmakers wrote to U.S. President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger D. Carstens urging them to treat Gambaryan’s case as a hostage situation and bring him back to the U.S.  So far, the U.S. Government has failed to make any public statement about Gambaryan’s situation. The State Department said it was ""aware of reports"" of his detention in March, but did not mention Gambaryan by name. A White House spokesperson referred CoinDesk to the State Department two months later, after multiple requests for comment.  ""For six months, my life – my living nightmare – has been filed with pleas. Pleas to the Nigerian government. Pleas to the U.S. government. Pleas to the media. Pleas to anyone who will listen. I have been pleading for their mercy, for their understanding, for their humanity,"" Yuki Gambaryan said in the video statement.  ""Please help me bring my husband home.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/26/my-living-nightmare-detained-binance-execs-wife-begs-for-his-immediate-release,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfc57591dccc20c0231b7ea90c3d26a42bf6bdc4-4454x2506.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407722,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2D49,1724694112,Accelerating Innovation in the DePIN Sector,"It takes a founder that’s a special kind of crazy to launch a DePIN. Many have said that DePIN is the most multidisciplinary sector in crypto and to me, that’s spot on. While working in crypto broadly might require a fairly diverse skill set, DePIN is on another level entirely. In addition to having to deal with (design, manufacture, ship, and sell) hardware, DePIN founders have to create businesses that can effectively compete with established Web2 players in some of the largest industries in the world like telecom, energy, and mobility. While I truly enjoy the intellectual stimulation offered by working at a company dedicated to serving DePIN founders, I do not envy them!  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  While I’ve been in DePIN long enough to be called an “OG” (~4 years), some of the companies I mentioned previously have been around since before the sector even had a name (2017)! As such, we all have a unique perspective on the industry, what has worked and what hasn’t, and most importantly, the parts of the tech stack that every DePIN founder will need to build to be successful. Today, we’ll dive into one of the most important - the map explorer.  Every single DePIN project needs an explorer that shows the number and location of their devices, their token price and trading volume, their on-chain revenue, and other important metrics. Historically, each DePIN has had to create this for themselves which involves smart contract, backend, and frontend work and can take months. This is incredibly inefficient as this piece of the stack is basically the same across every DePIN project. Luckily, Hotspotty, EV3, IoTeX, and DePIN Pulse are here to help.  Read more: Jasper De Maere: Why DePIN Is Taking Off Now  Hotspotty’s DePIN Hub provides DePINs with a profile page with a high-level description of their project with a focus on social sentiment and community growth. It also includes recent third-party media coverage on podcasts and information on token price and trading volume. DePIN Hub helps founders tell the story of how they started and grew their projects.  EV3’s DePIN.Ninja serves as the industry’s default on-chain revenue tracker for DePINs. It also provides project profile pages that include links to their socials, recent podcast episodes, and total capital raised. DePIN.Ninja helps founders easily show their financial metrics to investors and the world.  Read more: Connor Lovely - DePIN 2.0: What the Next Generation of DePINs Is Doing Differently  IoTeX’s DePINscan is the go-to-explorer for the DePIN space. It includes both sector-wide metrics like total market cap, trading volume, and devices as well as free project profile pages with number and physical location of devices. It also includes miner-relevant metrics like device cost, earnings, and payback period. DePINscan helps tell the story of what DePIN (and specific projects within it) have accomplished so far and provides a snapshot of the industry today.  Unleashing DePIN’s DePIN Pulse isn’t quite live yet, but promises to provide DePIN projects with a place to highlight their miner earning opportunities as well as facilitate lead generation for supply-side contributors as well. DePIN Pulse helps founders directly communicate and capitalize on their value proposition with potential contributors.  Because of these tools, life for a DePIN founder is much simpler now. They can easily submit their projects for inclusion, integrate their backends, and suddenly have profile pages they can call home, display their data on, and point investors and contributors to. Aggregating and publishing data in this way is great for the entire DePIN sector too. These tools have meaningfully decreased the go-to-market time for DePIN founders and increased their discoverability across the sector and across crypto more broadly.  DePIN represents one of crypto’s best chances to meaningfully impact the world in a positive way. It represents a novel method of capital formation and a new, more equitable way to build physical infrastructure. If (any of) these ideas work, the fabric of society will be changed forever. While the sector has come a long way since last cycle and there is a palpable excitement in the air given the number and quality of projects being funded and launched, there is still much work to be done. Commoditizing the map explorer part of the DePIN tech stack increases the pace and ease with which DePINs can be created because, after all, the more experimentation we can encourage here, the more innovation will undoubtedly occur.

32867354,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637820,1724693437,Here’s When Bitcoin Is Predicted To Break Its All-Time High If History Repeats,"Following the Bitcoin price surge back to $64,000, crypto analyst Rekt Capital is predicting a major breakout move in the coming weeks. In a new video analysis, the analyst forecasts a significant market movement around October 2024, based on historical precedents and current chart patterns. Will October Be Bullish For Bitcoin Again? Looking at the weekly chart, Rekt Capital identifies a downtrending channel. Over the past four weeks, BTC has been deviating below this channel, searching for support that would enable a price expansion above the channel’s bottom. This movement has been met with a “fantastic recovery,” signaling potential for a return to the channel top at around $67,000 in the coming weeks. “The channel bottom rebound is crucial as it has historically taken price from the channel bottom to the top in approximately two weeks on average,” Rekt Capital explained. He highlighted the importance of weekly candle closes above specific levels, particularly at $67,500 and eventually at $71,500, which would mark a break from the reaccumulation range high established post-halving. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Alarm: Here’s Why It’s Your ‘Last Chance To Buy Bitcoin’ “The consistent pattern of bouncing from the channel bottom to the top typically spans an average of two weeks, but in the current context, we are observing a potentially elongated consolidation phase at these lower levels,” explained Rekt Capital. This observation suggests that while the rebound trajectory follows historical patterns, the consolidation at lower prices could afford investors bargain buying opportunities. Focusing on the technical thresholds, Rekt Capital emphasized the criticality of several weekly candle closes above pivotal price points. Firstly, a close above $66,000 would reconfirm the reaccumulation range’s lower boundary as a newfound support, setting the stage for further upward movement. More importantly, a decisive weekly close above $67,500 would signify a breach of the persistent lower highs trend that has dominated since March of this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Long-Term Holders Locking Consistent Gains: A Sign Of Stability? “The weekly close above these specific levels is not merely a technical achievement but a psychological victory for market participants, indicating a weakening of sell-side pressure and a regain of bullish momentum,” noted Rekt Capital. Historically, Bitcoin shows a tendency to initiate major rallies approximately 150 to 160 days following a halving event. Drawing parallels from the post-halving periods of 2016 and 2020, the analyst suggested that similar conditions are currently forming, with Bitcoin being around 133 days post the latest halving. “This cyclical observation aligns well with the current market dynamics, where Bitcoin is methodically testing and, in some cases, breaching important technical barriers,” he remarked. This comparison is not only based on temporal patterns but also on the qualitative nature of market behavior during these periods. A significant point of analysis was the 21-week EMA, a key indicator often regarded as the bull market barometer. Rekt Capital highlighted its historical significance, noting, “Deviations below the 21-week EMA in bull markets typically offer lucrative buying opportunities, as seen in the 2021 cycle. Currently, Bitcoin is oscillating around this EMA, providing mixed signals that require vigilant interpretation.” Looking ahead, the analyst projects that for Bitcoin to embark on a new parabolic phase leading to price discovery and potentially new all-time highs, it must first consolidate above the $71,500 level—representing the reaccumulation range high. This level has previously acted as a formidable resistance, and a weekly close above it would likely catalyze a major bullish phase. “In the coming weeks, the market’s ability to uphold these critical supports and break through resistance levels with conviction will be paramount. This will determine the feasibility of a breakout aligning with historical patterns observed post-halving,” Rekt Capital concluded, suggesting that October could be pivotal for Bitcoin’s trajectory. At press time, BTC traded at $63,956.

32866811,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637912,1724692305,"Bitcoin Market Update: Analyst Sees 65% Chance Of Retest Before Surge To $68,000","Bitcoin (BTC) has regained significant momentum over the past week, breaking free from the $49,000 lows it reached during the broader market crash on August 5. Since the past seven days, the flagship cryptocurrency has surged over 8%, climbing above the critical $63,000 level and reaching as high as $65,000 on Sunday. This latest rally has crypto analysts optimistic about Bitcoin’s prospects for further upside, with some eyeing a potential move towards $68,000 soon. However, not all technical experts are convinced the path forward will be completely smooth sailing. Two Paths To $68,000 Bitcoin Crypto analyst Doctor Profit, who has a notable track record of accurately predicting price movements dating back to BTC’s $50,000 territory during the August 5 crash, is now targeting $68,000. A detailed report outlines that the key lies in Bitcoin’s interaction with the $63,900 line on the 6-hour chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Gains: Another Increase on the Horizon? According to Doctor Profit, there are two different paths for Bitcoin’s journey to $68,000. The first is for Bitcoin to maintain its position above the $63,900 level, paving the way for a quick rise to the projected $68,000 price. The second scenario involves a temporary dip below $63,900 followed by a retest of the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $61,900 before rising above $64,000 and moving towards $68,000. This latter scenario is seen as the more likely outcome, with Doctor Profit assigning a 65% probability to a retest of the $61,900 EMA support level before a push towards $68,000. What Open Interest Heatmap Suggests Lending credence to the possibility of a short-term pullback, technical analyst Ali Martinez observes that Bitcoin appears to be trading within a parallel channel on lower time frames. Martinez suggests a break below the $63,500 support could see BTC drop as low as $62,800 before potentially bouncing. Adding another layer to the analysis, the trading platform Hyblock highlights the importance of the Open Interest (OI) Heatmap in gauging market sentiment. The current open interest of $61,000 suggests a possible correction on the horizon, as the platform pointed out that BTC usually chases these zones, and this possibility increases after Bitcoin’s 8% surge last week. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Cardano (ADA) Is Set For 1,000% Rally To $4.29, Here’s Why While this may indicate a short-term pullback, a successful retest of lower support levels could set the stage for a strong recovery and a retest of higher resistance levels, assuming demand remains consistent. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $63,450, recording losses of over 1% in the 24-hour time frame after hitting the $65,000 mark late Sunday for the first time since August 1.

The project is backed by some big-name VCs like Dragonfly and Variant.  Rumpel Labs, a startup that builds tokenization infrastructure for loyalty points, distributed by many decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 projects, has emerged from stealth with backing from some big-names in the venture capital arena, like Dragonfly and Variant.  Dishing out loyalty points to incentivize user behavior and reward early adopters, often with a promise of airdropped tokens, has become a go-to strategy in the crypto space in recent years. Close to 50% of recent airdrops were distributed to point holders, with notable examples of the power of points programs demonstrated by the rapid proliferation of projects like NFT marketplace Blur, or Ethena’s USDe stablecoin.  Airdrops, for crypto, refers to distributing free tokens or coins to users who participate in a particular blockchain network. The strategy is often used by crypto companies to incentivize users to engage with the project, attract new users and grow community engagement.  While various projects have seen real value brought by the accelerated growth from leveraging points programs, there have been issues around unmet promises and users getting airdrops and payouts from their point programs that are much less than they were expecting, said Rumpel Labs CEO Kenton Prescott - a former developer of MakerDAO. Meanwhile, there are users out there who want to get extra exposure to these projects, but have no way of getting that, Prescott added.  However, more formalized secondary marketplaces need to be created, with better capital efficiency, deeper liquidity and price discovery, while learning lessons from some of the existing attempts to trade point exposure, says Prescott.  “These issues are just caused by not having the ability to effectively transfer and trade points,” Prescott said in an interview. “A secondary marketplace with capital efficiency, deep liquidity and price discovery, solves these problems simultaneously.”  Rumpel will have its own points program and go live in mid-September.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | AIRDROP,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/08/26/crypto-startup-backed-by-likes-of-dragonfly-aims-to-create-market-to-trade-airdrop-related-points,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1f94b5788df01e612fdffcde43e708fa96dc7ef-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407735,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2Dhp,1724688028,Did RFK Jr. Really 'Drop Out'? Polymarket Bettors Argue Over Contract Resolution,"This week in prediction markets…  Did RFK Jr. really drop out?  How long will Telegram's Pavel Durov be in detention?  Mpox won't be a pandemic this year, bettors say  As last week came to a close, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was putting his presidential campaign on pause and endorsed Donald Trump, arguing that there was no realistic path to victory given the ""systematic censorship and media control"" he was up against.  But did he really drop out?  That's the subject of the latest argument Polymarket bettors are having on the site's comment section and Discord server, with one faction trying to overrule UMA, a decentralized oracle service that mediates disputes.  Candidates at all levels rarely terminate their campaigns. Instead, they suspend them. This is a practice as old as time. Why? Because they can still receive donations.  A suspended campaign can still receive donations because, under Federal Election Commission (FEC) rules, suspending a campaign doesn't mean it's legally terminated. Often, candidates will need to pay down debts, like Rick Santorum in 2012, who suspended his campaign because of exhausted funds but kept the infrastructure in place to fundraise to pay off the debt.  It should be noted that Kennedy's campaign is also flirting with insolvency after it paid back $1 million to his running mate, who was a steady financier of the whole operation.  And, of course, suspension doesn't mean the campaign is over. There are 23 states where Kennedy is still on the ballot. Remember when John McCain suspended his 2008 campaign to address the financial crisis but later revived it to continue running for president?  Kennedy doing that is a long shot, but at one time so was the possibility of Joe Biden dropping out.  The real issue here is the wording of the Polymarket contract, which asked about a ""withdrawal"" instead of a suspension.  Telegram's Pavel Durov will probably not be released this month  Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France over the weekend. The reason given for the arrest is Telegram's moderation policy. Authorities in the country say that the messaging platform's soft touch on moderation makes it, and the CEO, legally complicit in all kinds of nasty stuff that was planned or published on it.  Telegram, for its part, says its moderation practices were in line with industry norms.  Durov will be looking at the inside of a jail cell for the immediate future, bettors on Polymarket say. On Monday morning in New York, ""yes"" shares for the contract asking if he'll be released by Aug. 31 were trading at 37 cents, meaning the market sees only a 37% chance of it happening.  Each share pays out $1 in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that usually trades 1:1 for dollars, if the prediction comes true, and zero if not. The bets are written into smart contracts, or software programs, on the Polygon blockchain.  Bettors are likely factoring in the possibility that Durov, an immensely wealthy man, would have plenty of means to escape French territory and make his way back to the United Arab Emirates, of which he is a citizen.  The UAE does not extradite its own citizens, as the country's law strictly forbids it (non-citizens are up for grabs, as the UAE recently sent an Italian businessman home after Rome requested it).  Binance's Changpeng Zhao, a citizen of the UAE and Canada, was called a flight risk for this very reason even though he appeared in the U.S. voluntarily.  It might be that Durov is set for an extended stay.  No mpox pandemic  Mpox, the virus formerly known as monkeypox, was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization on Aug. 14. Bettors on Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated prediction market platform, are confident it will end there.  For those who don't remember the terminology that defined the first few months of 2020: the WHO defines a health emergency as a situation that poses a significant risk to public health and requires immediate action, while a pandemic is a global outbreak of a disease affecting a large number of people across multiple countries or continents.  Bettors on Kalshi are pricing in just a 13% chance that the health emergency moves to be a pandemic by the end of the year.  Meanwhile, on Polymarket, bettors are skeptical that a confirmed case will hit U.S. shores by Sept. 30, giving it only a 38% chance of happening.  The market could be digesting the medical consensus that mpox is not Covid. While a new variant is spreading through Africa, experts say it is less of a concern because it spreads slowly through close physical contact, making widespread transmission unlikely, unlike the airborne Covid.  Plus, there's already a vaccine available for ""at-risk"" populations in the U.S., and it's being rolled out across Europe.  Bettors have also ruled out a lab leak as the cause of the latest mpox outbreak, giving it only a 5% chance of this explanation being confirmed by officials.  For most of the early days of the Covid pandemic, the lab leak hypothesis of that virus' origin was dismissed as a fringe conspiracy theory. But the Overton window widened and now even the New York Times entertains op-eds that say Covid probably escaped from a lab.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | MATIC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/26/did-rfk-jr-really-drop-out-polymarket-bettors-argue-over-contract-resolution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c92d059f98ebecfe5dcb20625ea1dd3699f1023-4811x2706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
32864861,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637797,1724688010,"Crypto Analyst Says Cardano (ADA) Is Set For 1,000% Rally To $4.29, Here’s Why","Cardano (ADA) has been stuck in a challenging position for the past few years, struggling with stagnant price growth despite being one of the most popular altcoins in the space. A crypto analyst has offered insights into why Cardano has underperformed while also maintaining an optimistic outlook and predicting a 1,000% rally to new highs this cycle. Cardano On The Verge Of A 10X Rally Crypto analyst Max Maher recently released a YouTube video predicting that Cardano could witness a 3X, 5X or 10X surge soon. The analyst highlighted several reasons why he believes the underperforming altcoin could witness such a significant price increase. Related Reading: Bullish XRP Analyst Eyes $7.50 If Crypto Breaks Resistance Maher disclosed that during the last crypto bull run in 2021, Cardano was one of the top bullish altcoins, skyrocketing to an all time high of $3.10 at the time. Following this substantial price leap, the cryptocurrency and other major coins slumped drastically. However, unlike other coins that have witnessed steady price gains in 2024, Cardano still struggles to recover from bearish sentiment. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, Ethereum (ETH) has risen by an impressive 65.58% since the beginning of the year, currently trading at $2,735. Solana (SOL) has witnessed an even more dramatic increase this year, jumping 682.08% to trade at $159.20. In contrast, Cardano has recorded a modest year-to-date increase of just 45.54%, trading at $0.37 amidst bearish trends. Maher has revealed that for Cardano to break out of the bearish territory and see a 1,000% rally to new all-time highs of $4.29, the cryptocurrency’s community sentiment will need to undergo a major change. He asserted that positivity fuels success, indicating that if the community’s sentiment towards Cardano becomes more favorable, the cryptocurrency could experience a rise in adoption, potentially triggering a substantial price increase. As an example, the analyst observed a significant shift within the Cardano ecosystem following a post he released on X (formerly Twitter) in May, which underscored the impacts of negative comments on the price of ADA. The analyst revealed that the positive change in sentiment has continued to this day. From this observation, the analyst suggested that Cardano needs an improved perception of its narrative and brand to drive a price increase. He highlighted that the cryptocurrency already has a rock-solid foundation and is supported by a highly secure and efficient network. Key Factors Behind Cardano’s Persistent Slump While sharing his optimistic outlook for Cardano’s future price, Maher also offered key insights on why the cryptocurrency has experienced such a severe and prolonged price slump. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Alarm: Here’s Why It’s Your ‘Last Chance To Buy Bitcoin’ He highlighted three major reasons for Cardano’s underperformance. Firstly, Maher disclosed that, unlike Ethereum and Solana, Cardano lacked a compelling “core narrative.” This means that beyond its high level of security and reputation as an efficient blockchain network, Cardano lacked a strong, distinctive selling proposition that set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. While Ethereum has Spot ETFs, and Solana has meme coins to drive its price, Cardano only had its core functionalities. Additionally, Maher revealed that Cardano’s sophisticated values and fundamentals were difficult for investors to fully comprehend. Finally, he emphasized that Cardano lacked robust and positive community engagement, which is essential for driving its price higher.

42407740,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2Dv3,1724683218,The Fed’s Rate Cut Cushion Is Good News for Crypto,"The Federal Reserve has plenty of room to start cutting interest rates.  Most investors don’t understand the real dynamic behind central bank interest-rate policies. But these drivers are key for setting the price of risk assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks higher and lower.  The consensus view of Wall Street is that the Federal Reserve will lower overnight borrowing costs from 5.33% today to 3.33% over the next 18 months. That means, it will cost less for households, businesses, and asset managers to borrow as money becomes more plentiful and readily available, and there will be more of it to invest.  The change will drive the value of assets priced in dollars, like bitcoin and ethereum higher. Let me explain.  Over the last few weeks, we’re seeing encouraging signs that our central bank can start lowering interest rates once more. The most important of these signals came out in mid-August, when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its consumer price index (“CPI”) data for July. The numbers showed that inflation growth fell back below the 3% threshold for the first time since early 2021.  The shift was confirmed last week by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. He said it’s time to start lowering interest rates, during a speech at the Kansas City Fed’s Annual EconomicSymposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He noted inflation growth has slowed enough to allow for the change. He stated the return of supply chain normalcy and a rebound in labor supply have eased price pressures.  However, there’s a bigger factor at work. The real rate of interest has rebounded to levels not seen in almost two decades. The change tells our central bank it has a downside cushion to start cutting now. In other words, it can lower rates, still slow inflation, and support steady economic growth.  If you’re unfamiliar, the real rate of interest is a key gauge the Fed watches to see whether monetary policy is driving inflation higher or lower. Officials can see this by comparing the effective federal funds rate (the rate banks charge one another to borrow overnight) compared to CPI. If the difference is negative, policy is stimulating too much growth. And, if the spread is positive, it means rates are weighing on prices. Take a look here:  The chart above compares the effective fed funds rate (blue line) to CPI (orange line) since the year 2000. You’ll notice that during periods prior to rate cuts, the fed funds rate is typically above CPI. And, in periods prior to rate hikes, interest rates are below the pace of inflation growth.  Now, to make it a little easier on the eye, I did the math on the two for you. I laid them out in the chart below.  The red line is the difference in the spread we discussed above. Notice to the far right, in June 2022, the real rate of interest was -8.3%. In other words, policy was so weak, it had no effect on prices. At the time, the effective fed funds rate was close to zero while inflation growth peaked at 9.1%. So, shortly thereafter, the Fed started a series of aggressive rate hikes to get price growth back under control.  If we look out to the far right of the above chart, we’ll notice the situation has greatly changed. After raising interest rates from 0% to a range of 5.3%, our central bank has changed the course of price growth. Since the peak made in June 2022 through this past July, CPI has dropped from 9.1% to 2.9%. In the process, the real rate of interest has jumped all the way back up to 2.4%. In other words, policy is weighing on prices.  Now, the real rate of interest hasn’t been this high since July 2007. That happened to be right before the Fed started cutting interest rates once more.  But how can we be sure that it can lower interest rates without stoking inflation growth once more?  Well, we can look at the average pace of CPI growth over the last six months, which happens to be 0.2%. We can then forecast what annualized growth will look like over the coming year based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics index data. Lastly, we can compare that to Wall Street’s implied federal funds rate for the coming year to see what the real rate of interest will look like.  As I mentioned at the start, money managers expect the Fed will cut rates rapidly. They’re anticipating the effective fed funds rate will fall from 5.3% today to as low as 3.7% by April 2025. That’s a massive shift in less than a year’s time.  However, inflation growth could also see a sharp drop over that same time frame. Based on the 0.2% average over the last six months, the annualized CPI rate could be at 1.9% when the April 2025 data is released. That would be the first time it’s below the Fed’s 2% target since February 2021.  More importantly, the changes mean the Fed could cut rates by 175 basis points over the next nine months, and still have a real interest rate of 1.8%. That tells us that despite a potential flurry of easing in a short period of time, monetary policy would still be weighing on price growth.  The change would be huge for economic sentiment. Purchases of houses and real estate made at high rates over the last couple of years could be refinanced, reducing the rate of interest payments for individuals and businesses; the cost of items like houses and cars would drop, making them more affordable; the burden of paying down items like credit cards would ease. The changes would provide institutions and individuals with more money to spend.  As all of this played out, it would change the mood from one of an economy on the brink of collapse to one that can sustain steady growth. The shift will support solid earnings growth for corporate America. And, the Fed would still have room to cut rates even more, if it felt the adjustment was necessary.  At the end of the day, steady economic growth, and improved consumer and corporate sentiment will encourage more investment in risk assets by both retail and institutional investors. In other words, the change will drive the prices of bitcoin and ETH higher.

32862416,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637829,1724682627,"Toncoin Tumbles To $4.6 As Bears Eye Further Decline, Will Support Hold?","Toncoin is in a precarious position as it tumbles to $4.6, with bears eager to push prices even lower. With key support levels hanging by a thread, the big question on everyone’s mind is whether the bulls can muster enough strength to defend it or if a further drop is on the horizon. As uncertainty looms, the battle for $4.6 could determine whether Toncoin stabilizes or faces a deeper descent. This article aims to analyze Toncoin’s recent drop to $4.6 and evaluate whether the current support level can hold against growing bearish pressure. It will explore potential scenarios, offering insights into what could happen next for TON’s price trajectory. In the past 24 hours, TON was trading near $5.64, marking a 4.67% increase. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization has climbed above $14 billion, while trading volume exceeded $1.2 billion. The market cap saw a 5% boost during this period, whereas trading volume declined by 37.02%. Market Sentiment: Are Bears Gaining Full Control Of Toncoin? Toncoin’s price, following a successful drop below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, recently experienced a brief pullback. It is now poised for another bearish move. This price action indicates that bearish momentum remains dominant, potentially pushing the price toward the next critical support level at $4.6. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 32%, following a failed attempt to rise above 50%. The RSI’s failure to breach the 50% threshold highlights the ongoing bearish sentiment, which could drive the price even lower in the near term. On the daily chart, Toncoin shows significant bearish movement below the 100-day SMA following the failure to break above it. This bearish surge reflects strong selling pressure and negative market sentiment, increasing the likelihood that the $4.6 target could soon be attainable. Finally, the 1-day RSI indicates that TON’s bearish momentum is strengthening, with the signal line recently crossing below the 50% mark and sitting at 37%, which suggests intensifying selling pressure and growing bearish sentiment for the digital asset. Looking Ahead: Can The Bulls Stage A Comeback? Exploring TON’s long-term outlook reveals that if the price reaches $4.6 and breaks below, the price will continue to move downward toward the $3.3 support mark. When the price reaches this level and breaks below, it may move lower to test the $2 support mark and probably move on to test other lower support marks. However, should Toncoin reach the $4.6 support range and the bulls trigger a comeback, it could move upward toward the $7.6 resistance mark. If the price breaks through this resistance, TON may continue to rise, testing its all-time high of $8.3 and potentially establishing a new all-time high when this mark is surpassed.

These two cryptocurrencies are making waves for different reasons, but both are attracting significant attention from investors looking to capitalize on their growth potential. Here’s why these tokens are hot right now and how you can get involved. Internet Computer (ICP): Pioneering the Future of Decentralization Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is rapidly establishing itself as a powerhouse in the crypto space, particularly for its innovative approach to decentralization. Unlike traditional blockchain platforms, Computer Protocol (ICP) extends the functionality of the internet by allowing developers to build and deploy software without relying on centralized servers. This opens up a world of possibilities, from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to more secure and scalable online services. One of the key reasons Computer Protocol (ICP) is gaining traction is its alignment with the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence (AI). With AI applications becoming more integral to various industries, ICP’s decentralized network provides a robust and secure foundation for AI-driven projects. This unique positioning has made Computer Protocol (ICP) a favorite among investors looking for long-term growth in the blockchain and AI sectors.

32861998,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637876,1724681735,Base Dawgz or Mpeppe: Which Cryptocurrency Will Create Future Millionaires?,"The race to find the next big crypto thing is always on. Two meme coins, Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), are currently capturing the attention of investors, each with its own unique potential to create future millionaires. But which of these tokens is truly poised to deliver explosive gains? Base Dawgz (DAWGZ): The Shiba Inu of Base Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) has made a significant impact in the crypto community, particularly on the Base blockchain. Modeled after the success of other meme coins like Shiba Inu ($SHIB), Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is being touted as the Shiba Inu of the Base ecosystem. Since its presale began just two months ago, Base Dawgz has raised over $3 million, a clear indication of the strong investor interest in this new token. The success of Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is closely linked to the overall growth of the Base blockchain, which has seen a meteoric rise in active users and transaction volume. Base, a Layer-2 solution built on Ethereum, has been rapidly gaining traction due to its ability to offer faster and cheaper transactions. This has made it an attractive platform for a variety of projects, including meme coins like DAWGZ. With its interoperable design, Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) can operate across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This cross-chain functionality increases its liquidity and broadens its market reach, making it a strong contender in the meme coin space. As the presale for Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) comes to a close on August 28, 2024, investors are eager to secure their tokens at the lowest price before the anticipated listing on major exchanges. With its potential to replicate or even surpass the gains seen by other successful meme coins on Base, Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is definitely one to watch. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Meme Coin with 100x Potential While Base Dawgz is making waves within the Base ecosystem, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as a formidable rival. Priced at just $0.001777 during its current presale stage, Mpeppe has already raised over $1.2 million, with more than 80% of its tokens sold. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique opportunity for early investors to capitalize on its explosive growth potential. With predictions of a 100x return, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is being hailed as the next big meme coin, particularly for those who missed out on early investments in other successful projects like Shiba Inu or Dogecoin. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its innovative approach to the meme coin market. The token is designed to tap into the growing demand for high-risk, high-reward investments, offering significant bonuses for early adopters. For instance, investors who use the promo code “MPEPE20” can receive a 20% bonus on their purchases, further enhancing the value of their investment. Moreover, Mpeppe’s developers have laid out a clear roadmap that includes plans for gaming incentives, community rewards, and partnerships that will integrate the token into various sectors of the crypto market. This strategic approach ensures that Mpeppe is not just another meme coin but a project with real utility and growth potential. Which One Will Create Future Millionaires? The decision between Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) ultimately comes down to an investor’s risk tolerance and belief in the long-term potential of each project. Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) is a safer bet for those who prefer a project with proven success and a strong foundation within the rapidly growing Base ecosystem. Its interoperability across multiple blockchains and the backing of the Base community make it a compelling choice for investors looking for steady growth. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the thrill of high-risk, high-reward investing. With its low entry price and 100x potential, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is an attractive option for those willing to take a chance on a new and innovative project. The substantial bonuses available during the presale add an extra layer of appeal for early investors. Conclusion: The Choice Is Yours Both Base Dawgz (DAWGZ) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have the potential to create future millionaires. Whether you choose the stability and established presence of DAWGZ or the explosive growth potential of Mpeppe, both tokens offer unique opportunities in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies. For those looking to maximize their profits, diversifying investments across both tokens could be the perfect strategy. This way, investors can capitalize on the strengths of each project, securing their place in the next wave of crypto success.

32859934,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637808,1724677223,XRP Set To Explode? Top Analyst Predicts $33 Rally,"It’s a surprising performance for XRP in the crypto market today, alone spiking over 7% during the weekend rally led by Bitcoin’s attempt to breach the $65,000 mark. XRP made a high of $0.6304 but closed a bit lower at $0.6131. Even the slightest drop in this asset seemed to not deter its upward momentum, which continues to gain much attention. Related Reading: FET Explodes 60% After New Project Announcement – Details Analysts are highly positive about the future of the altcoin, estimating a price increase of 25% in the next three months. The top analyst, Bobby A, believes that the value of XRP could go as high as $33. The reason for this projection by experts includes such technical bullish signs and strong momentum in the market. According to Bobby A, the formation of this breakout pattern on the monthly chart may be what XRP needs to drive a substantial price surge once it finally breaks above current resistance levels. An explosive charge ready to go high order. #XRP ⚒️ pic.twitter.com/93zeWYKgSh — Bobby A (@Bobby_1111888) August 24, 2024 His initial target is $0.8722, which was a 45% increase from its current price of $0.6014. Achieving this target would confirm a transition from a long-term bearish trend into a bullish one, setting the stage for further gains. This far-reaching milestone would not stop Bobby A from surmising that the cryptocurrency will surely aim for higher targets, including $1.34 and $1.72, once it picks up momentum. Short-Term And Medium-Term Outlook Projections for Bobby A go beyond the short term. After the coin has broken above $0.8722, it is projected to gun for targets of $1.34 and $1.72, respectively. These are both key resistance areas that XRP has to break for it to establish a new bullish trend. The path to these targets is not going to be smooth, though. Several resistance levels, all the way up to the previous all-time high above $3, were identified that XRP will have to break before ever reaching those targets. To add to the positive view, another crypto analyst with the alias DustyBC pointed out that XRP was forming a symmetrical triangle in its chart. A consolidation pattern would slope the upper trendline downwards and the lower trendline upwards. According to DustyBC, if XRP manages to break out of this symmetrical triangle above the upper trendline, it could be interpreted to mean that the price is due for a major surge. This breakout might be needed to drive XRP up higher. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rally: Over 70% Of Holders Enjoy Profit As Memecoin Climbs 9% XRP Long-Term Projections Looking forward further, the prospects of XRP are still decent in the long run. In another three months, it could appreciate by 24.97%, as CoinCheckup projects, driven by technical indicators that reflect strong momentum. Its six-month forecast is simply explosive, provided that it stays consistent at 160% growth, reflecting robust bullish sentiment among traders. The one-year projection comes in at almost double, at 99%. These long-term projections set the stage for possible large upward movements of XRP. When considering the long-term gains, it looks like XRP will be one of the most promising investments with large potential growth. The recent performance and analysis by key experts do present promising prospects for XRP. Forecasting bullish and indicating enormous potential gains with technical indicators, XRP is bound to make some notable advances over the coming months. Key resistance levels will be important to monitor, with preparation in place for potential breakouts as XRP makes its strides in the dynamic crypto market.

42407736,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2DoR,1724675086,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Consolidates at $64K Before Next Push Higher,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,077 +0.3%  Bitcoin (BTC): $63,982 −0.0%  Ether (ETH): $2,745 −0.5%  S&P 500: 5,634.61 +1.1%  Gold: $2,557 +1.9%  Nikkei 225: 38,110 -0.7%  Top Stories  Bitcoin {{BTC}} traded near $64,000 early Monday, briefly hitting $65,000 over the weekend boosted by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium. On Friday, Powell signaled that an interest rate cut might be coming in September. Solana {{SOL}} showed relative strength among crypto majors, up 3% over the past 24 hours, shrugging off diminishing odds of a SOL-based spot ETF in the U.S. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 advanced 0.6% during the same period. The recovery of crypto prices was supported by a strong stablecoin expansion, with $1 billion of tokens minted at a 7-day average, 10x Research founder's Markus Thielen noted. ""Technically speaking, it’s looking more and more like we are in a bullish consolidation ahead of the next big push higher,"" Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX group said in a Monday report. ""This would translate to bitcoin making fresh record highs and ETH breaking out to another yearly high on its way to challenge its own record high from 2021.""  Toncoin plummeted following the weekend arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov. Durov's arrest stems from a warrant issued by France's OFIM, an office that works to prevent violence against minors, as part of a complaint into Telegram's lack of moderation and cooperation with law enforcement. Telegram said in a statement that it is compliant with all EU laws. TON was trading $5.6 early Monday, nearly 17% down since Durov's arrest. The network was originally started by Telegram before spinning out due to regulatory pressure.  Spot bitcoin ETFs booked $250 million inflows on Friday amid Powell's remarks. The inflows happened amid strong trading activity, with the eleven products notching over $3 billion in trading volume, the highest in more than a month. BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC led in inflows, while Grayscale's GBTC experienced outflows.  Chart of the Day  Digital asset exchange-traded products saw $533 million of inflows last week, CoinShares' James Butterfill reported.  That was the largest inflow in five weeks, underpinning the recovering investor sentiment since the August 5 crash.  Bitcoin was the primary focus, seeing US$543m of inflows, with the majority of those inflows recorded on Friday, while Ethereum funds saw $36 million in net outflows during the week.  - Krisztian Sandor  Trending Posts  Protocol Village: Radix Plans $37M Endowment Fund, Fetch.ai Starts San Francisco Innovation Lab  Hong Kong Regulator Finds 'Unsatisfactory Practices' at Some Crypto Entities Seeking Full License: Report  India's CBDC Has 5M Users, Can be Phased in Gradually: Central Bank Governor",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | TON,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | TON,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/26/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-consolidates-at-64k-before-next-push-higher,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/628a9fa4aeafcd9729cc5a85e48ae156dbe8345e-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This announcement led to a decline in the US dollar and boosted the equity markets, with the S&P 500 approaching its all-time high. Bitcoin, which had been lagging behind equities, saw a sharp 6.06 percent increase in one day, marking its second-largest daily move since May. The rally occurred amidst a backdrop of increasing positive correlation between Bitcoin and US equities . Until now, Bitcoin has shown relative weakness compared to equities since hitting its early August low. Friday’s price surge also saw a sharp increase in correlation, which we believe indicates a return of risk appetite to the market. Added to this are the significant short liquidations seen on August 23rd , with $40 million in BTC perpetual futures liquidations and $140 million across all pairs. This comes as there has been a substantial drop in open interest, suggesting reduced leverage in the market. As interest in delta-neutral and funding arbitrage trades rises, the directional open interest in the market has decreased, potentially allowing more room for price appreciation in Bitcoin and altcoins. The current funding rates , significantly lower than earlier this year, also indicate a shift in market dynamics, highlighting a more cautious approach among leveraged traders despite the overall bullish sentiment. The market bullishness has been fuelled by recent developments in the US economy which have led to a significant shift in monetary policy expectations, labour market dynamics, and business activity, underscoring the evolving challenges faced by the Federal Reserve and broader economic conditions.In a highly anticipated speech at the Kansas City Fed symposium in Jackson Hole, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated a forthcoming adjustment in monetary policy, signalling the potential for interest rate cuts. The labour market data has contributed significantly to this change in stance, with data showing that the US labour market added fewer jobs than initially reported over the past year. This downward revision, combined with weaker-than-expected payroll data for July, has raised alarms about the health of the labour market. The unemployment rate reached a post-pandemic high of 4.3 percent, which has triggered worries that the Federal Reserve may have delayed too long in reducing interest rates. However, more recent data, including weekly jobless claims, suggest that the labour market is undergoing a more controlled slowdown. Meanwhile the noose continues to tighten on bad actors in the crypto markets. In a first, China successfully won extradition from Thailand of an individual named Zhang, who is accused of orchestrating a $14 billion cryptocurrency pyramid scheme . His extradition marks the first financial crime suspect handed over under the China-Thailand agreement reached in 2019, and highlights the increasing international cooperation to combat cryptocurrency-related crimes. On a more positive note in the industry, Franklin Templeton has made strides in expanding its on-chain money market fund (FOBXX) by integrating it into the Avalanche network. This move allows investors to purchase tokenised shares, further solidifying the fund’s position in the blockchain space. Already established on Stellar and Polygon, the fund primarily invests in low-risk US government securities and aims to leverage Avalanche’s technology for continued growth.In another significant development, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has emerged as a leader in the Ethereum ETF space, becoming the first Ethereum ETF to surpass $1 billion in net inflows . This achievement is particularly noteworthy given that Ethereum ETFs have generally seen lower inflows compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. In contrast, Grayscale’s ETHE has faced significant outflows since its conversion to a public product, underscoring the competitive landscape within Ethereum investment vehicles.

32857514,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637798,1724671811,"BONK About To Enter 3rd Wave, Analyst Reveals Next Target","Crypto analyst Man of Bitcoin recently provided insights into Bonk’s (BONK) trajectory using the Elliot Wave Theory. As part of his analysis, the analyst revealed how high the Solana meme coin could rise on its next leg up. BONK To Rise To $0.000027 On Next Leg Up In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Man Of Bitcoin predicted that BONK would reach $0.000027 in the third wave of his Elliot Wave analysis. The analyst noted that BONK already broke above the first wave of $0.000022, which confirms that it can indeed make such an impulsive move to that price level. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Alarm: Here’s Why It’s Your ‘Last Chance To Buy Bitcoin’ BONK looks to have already completed the corrective Wave 2 move, seeing how it has recovered from the $0.0000167 price level, which the analyst highlighted as the bottom during this price correction. Moreover, from the chart that Man of Bitcoin shared, BONK’s rise to $0.000027 is expected to happen sometime in September. Once that impulsive move to $0.000027 is over, BONK is expected to experience another price correction, dropping to $0.000023 this time around. Meanwhile, Man Of Bitcoin offered a much more bullish prediction for BONK, with his chart showing that the fifth largest meme coin by market cap will rise to $0.000029 on its fifth wave. A rise to that price level is still well below its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.000047, reached in March earlier this year. However, there is no doubt that it could reach price level again and even rise higher, especially with crypto analysts like Quinten François suggesting that the bull run has yet to begin. It is worth mentioning that BONK hit its ATH around the time Bitcoin hit its ATH of $73,000. As such, BONK could hit a new ATH as the flagship crypto reaches a new ATH. Other Bullish Predictions For The Meme Coin Crypto analyst Jacob Canfield has also provided a bullish prediction for BONK, stating that the meme coin’s market cap could reach between $5 billion and $10 billion. He made this statement based on his bullish outlook for Solana, which he believes can reach a minimum target of $600 and a maximum target of $1,700 in this bull run. Related Reading: Bullish XRP Analyst Eyes $7.50 If Crypto Breaks Resistance Crypto analyst Sleek Crypto noted that BONK still has plenty of room to run in this market cycle and predicted that the meme coin could delete two zeros and rise to as high as $0.0011.

The senior most official of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was speaking at at a conference in Bengaluru on Monday.  India's plans for a retail and wholesale CBDC were announced as part of the Finance Minister's budget speech in 2022. By 2022-end, the RBI launched pilots for both CBDCs. By 2023-end, the retail CBDC hit a million transactions, at least on one day, with a little help from its friends, the banks.  On Monday, Das said as many as 16 banks are currently participating in the retail CBDC pilot but did not reveal a number for the daily transactions.  The RBI has previously said it isn’t in a hurry to implement a full-scale, retail CBDC and has not shared any timeline. But on this occasion Das hinted at the possibility of avoiding a full-scale implementation.  ""Actual introduction of CBDC can be phased in gradually,"" Das said. ""It is important to emphasize that there should not be in any rush to roll out system-wide CBDC before one acquires a comprehensive understanding of its impact on users, on monetary policy, on the financial system and on the economy.""  Since the start of 2023, the RBI has been exploring offline payments and programmability and Das said this was being tested.  ""The programmability feature of CBDC could serve as a key enabler for financial inclusion by ensuring delivery of funds to the targeted user,"" Das said while pointing to two use cases involving farmers launched as part of their pilot recently; Programming the end use for purchase of agricultural inputs to comfort banks and establish the farmer's identity; farmers getting purpose bound money for generation of carbon credits.  Das also said other ""new use cases aimed at testing features such as anonymity and offline availability are proposed to be rolled out gradually.""

32855393,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637777,1724666417,Top Crypto Analyst Goes ‘All In’ On These 3 Altcoins,"Leading crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, boasting a substantial following of over 500,000 on X, spotlights the Tron ecosystem as the next significant opportunity for crypto investors. In his latest video analysis, Deutscher delves into the detailed metrics and developmental strides within Tron, highlighting the best altcoins to invest in. Crypto’s New Shiny Thing Deutscher’s video opens with an extensive review of the Tron blockchain, a platform that has recently outpaced many of its competitors in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) and transaction volume. “Tron has now become the second-largest blockchain in terms of TVL, overtaking stalwarts like Solana and Base, and is second only to Ethereum,” he explains, pointing to an impressive $8 billion in TVL that underscores Tron’s robust market adoption. Tron’s high throughput and stable network performance have made it a preferred choice for stablecoin transactions, which have seen more than $60 billion transferred through the Tron network since 2021. The platform’s efficiency is highlighted by Deutscher with its capacity to handle transactions faster and more reliably than competitors, even during peak congestion periods that have affected other blockchains like Solana. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Alarm: Here’s Why It’s Your ‘Last Chance To Buy Bitcoin’ Over the last quarter, Tron has generated over $440 million in transaction fees, marking it as one of the highest revenue-generating blockchains in the market. This metric not only reflects the high volume of activity on the chain but also its growing importance as a financial backbone in the digital asset space. A significant portion of Tron’s recent success can be attributed to the launch of SunPump, a platform that facilitates the creation and trading of memecoins. “This development has initiated a memecoin revolution within Tron’s ecosystem, contributing to a dramatic increase in both the chain’s mindshare and liquidity,” Deutscher notes. This has been instrumental in drawing new speculators and investors into the ecosystem, fostering a vibrant market for these digital assets. Deutscher elaborates on the psychological and market dynamics at play, explaining how meme coins create a ‘flywheel effect’—whereby increased activity and visibility attract more participants, thereby boosting the overall ecosystem’s growth and valuation. “Crypto is an attention economy and Tron is becoming a major player in this arena,” he states, suggesting a self-reinforcing cycle of growth driven by increased visibility and speculative interest. Best Altcoins To Buy Now Delving into specific investment opportunities, Deutscher identifies three segments within the Tron segments that present significant upside potential: memecoins, the native token TRX and SUN. Among the memecoin, Deutscher is focusing on Sundog, FoFar (FOFAR), and Suncat (SUNCAT). He describes these as the leading meme coins that not only represent the most dynamic elements of the Tron market but also offer substantial risk-adjusted returns. Related Reading: Cardano Price Poised To Hit $2.88, Following Solana’s Fractal: Crypto Analyst “But my primary focus is on the leaders and specifically Sundog because it is the major leader now. If you want to look at a comparison to other chains you can see Ethereum has DOGE which hit $90 bill, as well as Pepe which hit $7 bill. Solana has WIF which hit $5 Bill. BRETT hit $2bill which is the leading meme coin on Base right now. Sundog is actually sitting at around $190 million which at least compared to the all-time highs of the leaders on other chains is still comparatively cheap and in my opinion if the Tron ecosystem continues to gain traction if Justin Sun continues to push the ecosystem,” Deutscher explains. For those seeking more conservative investment avenues, Deutscher recommends the Tron token (TRX) itself. With the token currently on a strong upward trajectory within its price channel, he anticipates a breakout moment should it surpass its previous high of 18 cents, with potential rapid price expansion to over 30 cents. Beyond meme coins and the native token, Deutscher points to Sun (SUN) as a critical utility token within the Tron ecosystem. SUN benefits directly from the activities on SunPump, with transaction fees being used to buy back and burn SUN tokens, thereby decreasing supply and potentially increasing value. “100% of SunPump’s Revenue that goes to buy back and burn of SUN which has got me interested. So you don’t have to gamble on which memecoin will win on Tron. SUN will win regardless. So this is a very interesting point. If you pick the wrong memecoins even if the ecosystem explodes your bags can go to zero but something like SUN is acre value from the entire memecoin run irrespective of what mem coins perform well,” Deutscher concludes. At press time, TRX traded at $0.1660.

A big chunk of this upward momentum is hailed directly from Fetch.ai’s new announcements, including a brand-new global Innovation Lab being opened in San Francisco, California, which is going to really push at the boundaries of AI technology. Investors’ excitement has been driven by their ability to become a lab innovation driver, so FET is seen to gain by another 14% and most likely hit $1.537 on September 25, 2024. The Innovation Lab is where early-stage startups could emerge with developing AI agent solutions, and Fetch.ai has earmarked $10 million yearly in support of these projects. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rally: Over 70% Of Holders Enjoy Profit As Memecoin Climbs 9% With probably up to $1 million spending on each project, the lab is sure to be one of the most critical drivers for Fetch.ai’s exponential growth.

FET Recovery And Market Sentiment After suffering from intense selling pressure, FET was able to see a bounce with incredible strength. In the past 24 hours alone, FET has added an extra 7% to its gain, setting among the top AI cryptocurrencies. The good thing gets to stand out fully when it comes to the nature of this recovery, all things considered. Other focus projects on AI, such as Near Protocol and Internet Computer, have had it in the red in recent times, having shed 14% in the last 30 days. On the other hand, FET showed resilience in this period by being in the green 43% of the days. Market sentiment towards Fetch.ai is cautiously optimistic. Currently, the Fear and Greed index is 55, which is a Greed sentimentᅳnot too overboard.

42417336,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYC0j,1724657568,"AI Tokens Lead Crypto Market Ahead of Nvidia Earnings, Bitcoin Under $64K","Major cryptocurrencies like Ether, Solana, and XRP showed slight losses over the past 24 hours, despite a general uptick over the weekend.  AI-related tokens like Artificial Superintelligence Alliance's FET and Bittensor's TAO led the market gains, rising 8.8% and 4.7% respectively, ahead of Nvidia's anticipated earnings report.  The broader market, represented by the CoinDesk 20, remained flat, with expectations of continued market improvement due to potential rate cuts and economic stabilization.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} slid under the $64,000 level in Asian trading hours Monday, after a 5% bump on Friday following favorable comments from Jackson Hole.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that a monetary easing cycle will begin next month - easing headwinds around risk assets as the lure of cheap money helped buoy prices.  Major tokens jumped through Saturday, but registered slight losses in the past 24 hours. Ether {{ETH}} traded just over $2,700, while Solana’s SOL and xrp (XRP) were changing hands at $158 and 58 cents, respectively. Meanwhile, while Tron’s TRX jumped 3% as an ongoing memecoin frenzy continues to add demand for the token.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the largest tokens by market capitalization, was lower by 0.44%.  Traders said they expect the current rally to continue in the next few months.  “As inflation is more or less under control now, the market focus will shift to the labor market and on whether Fed will successfully deliver a soft landing for US economy,” Lucy Hu, senior analyst at Metalpha, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message Monday. “We expect the market sentiment will continue to improve in the next few months as rate cuts are on the way while the economy stabilizes and potential crypto-friendly policies if Trump gets elected.”  AI tokens charge ahead of Nvidia earnings  Artificial Intelligence tokens led the market on Monday, as traders in Asia poured money into FET, the token of the 'Artificial Superintelligence Alliance', as well as Bittensor (TAO). The move in to AI tokens comes ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) widely anticipated earnings on August 28.  FET is up 8.8% as of early afternoon Hong Kong time while (TAO) is up 4.7%.  Historically, Nvidia has been a bellweather for the growing AI token space with tokens edging up in anticipation of its earnings.  Analysts polled by FactSet expect this quarter's earnings per share to be a blockbuster event with earnings of 65 cents per share, a 141% increase from the previous year, with revenue expected to reach $28.72 billion, up 113%.  This would be Nvidia's fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth, with the tech sector expected to perform strongly throughout the rest of the year given that the Fed will likely cut rates in September.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SOL,BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BITTENSOR,"Shaurya Malwa, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/26/ai-tokens-lead-crypto-market-ahead-of-nvidia-earnings-bitcoin-under-64k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47bb0bde92988ab37796390c8dca66887ec564b1-3999x2249.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If this results in the cancellation of some temporary licenses handed out to the 11 applicants for full licenses, it may throw a spanner in the works of Hong Kong's pursuit of trying to become a global hub for crypto.  Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has found ""unsatisfactory practices"" at ""some"" of the cryptocurrency exchanges seeking a full license from it after conducting on-site inspections, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the situation.  ""Some of the crypto firms are overly reliant on a handful of executives to oversee the custody of client assets, while others aren’t properly guarding against cybercrime risks,"" the report cited.  An SFC spokesperson told Bloomberg that while it had conducted some inspections which were still ongoing and subject to change, it doesn't comment on specific cases.  For platforms that are unable to remedy “critical deficiencies identified during on-site inspections, the SFC may opt to remove their deemed-to-be-licensed status or refuse their license applications,” the spokesperson added.  The SFC declined to add any more details to the statement given to Bloomberg.  The SFC has not named which entities had ""critical deficiencies."" As many as 11 entities have applied for a full license with the SFC, including Crypto.com, HKbitEX, PantherTrade and Bullish, the Bloomberg report said.  The applicants named did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. Bullish is the owner of CoinDesk.  In late May, the SFC said it would conduct such on-site inspections of those crypto trading platforms which were interested in continuing to pursue their licensing applications. As many as 12 entities including OKX and ByBit withdrew their applications. OSL and HashKey are the only two fully licensed exchanges in Hong Kong.  The latest development may throw a spanner in the works of Hong Kong's pursuit of trying to become a global hub for crypto which saw it approve spot-crypto products earlier this year.

32851219,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637761,1724655656,Crypto Analyst Sounds Alarm: Here’s Why It’s Your ‘Last Chance To Buy Bitcoin’,"Trying to time the Bitcoin bottom as the perfect time to buy is a pursuit for many cryptocurrency traders. As a result, crypto analysts have used various indicators in the quest to predict the best time to buy Bitcoin. This pursuit has not waned even with the BTC price hitting a new all-time high earlier this year, as crypto analyst R.N. Elliot has sounded the alarm for what he believes is the best time to buy the leading cryptocurrency. Time To Buy Bitcoin The analyst’s chart points to a “Double Zigzag” pattern that has formed for Bitcoin. As the name implies, it includes two different zigzags, both of which are likely to play out the same way. Since the first pattern has already been completed, which the crypto analyst places with the BTC all-time high above $73,000. Related Reading: Bullish XRP Analyst Eyes $7.50 If Crypto Breaks Resistance Since the analyst believes that the second zigzag pattern could form the same way, it’s likely it has already playing out following a crash from $70,000 to below $50,000. If this analysis is right, then it could mean that the Bitcoin price is ready to recover from here. From here, a Bitcoin recovery could put the price above $74,000, which would mean a bran-new all-time high for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Additionally, such a surge would have a market-wide impact, triggering another possible bull run for altcoins alike. Using The Elliot Wave To Time The Bottom Elliot’s analysis focuses on the popular Elliot Wave tool as a way to predict when would be the best time to start buying Bitcoin. This tool uses a series of waves in an attempt to predict when the price might rise and fall, suggesting periods of bearish and bullish momentum. By applying this tool, the crypto analyst believes he has been able to pinpoint an end to the bearish trend. Going by the crypto analyst’s predictions, the time to start buying Bitcoin is now as the zigzag pattern is still in progress. As for the Elliot Wave theory, the crypto analyst explains that Bitcoin is in the third wave. However, this isn’t a standalone wave with a prediction that it will consist of five subwaves. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 2,200% Explosion Will Send Cardano To $8, Here’s When As this wave progresses, Elliot expects that an “Expanding Diagonal” pattern could be formed. According to the analyst, this pattern usually arises in an unstable market. However, with the formation continuing, he believes that the price will rise. The targets for the Bitcoin price rally are placed at $84,331.6 for a short wave and $106,219.6 in the event of a longer wave. Regardless of the length of the wave, either of these price points would guarantee a brand-new peak for the pioneer cryptocurrency.

""Telegram's CEO Pavel Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe.""  The statement comes a day after its CEO was arrested at a French airport by local authorities. Durov's arrest comes as a result of a criminal complaint focused on the platform's moderation practices, which French law enforcement deems to be insufficient.  Read More: Telegram Is Crypto’s Adoption Machine  While a formal charge sheet has yet to be published by prosecutors, early media reports indicate that prosecutors are assigning culpability to Durov and Telegram for criminal acts that were organized or published on Telegram.  ""It is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform,"" Telegram said in a published statement.  ""After news appeared in the media about the detention of P.V. Durov, we immediately requested clarification from the French authorities regarding the reasons and demanded the protection of his rights and the provision of consular access. As of today, the French side has so far avoided cooperation on this issue,"" the Russian embassy in France said in a statement.  In its statement, Telegram linked to a March 2024 post from Durov, which predicted that the company would face some sort of challenge in its growth because of moderation practices.  ""All large social media apps are easy targets for criticism due to the content they host. I can’t recall any major social platform whose moderation has been consistently praised by traditional media,"" he wrote at the time.

There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.6020 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.6050 resistance zone. XRP Price Aims Higher XRP price attempted another increase above the $0.6150 level. The price was able to clear the $0.6180 and $0.6220 resistance levels. However, upsides were limited above $0.630 unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price traded as high as $0.6306 and trimmed most gains. It traded as low as $0.5925 and is currently consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $0.5950 level. However, the price is now trading below $0.600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh increase, the price might face resistance near the $0.60 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.6020 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6306 swing high to the $0.5925 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.6050 level. The next key resistance could be $0.6160 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6306 swing high to the $0.5925 low. A clear move above the $0.6160 resistance might send the price toward the $0.630 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.6350 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6550 resistance or even $0.6880 in the near term. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $0.6050 resistance zone, it could another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5920 level. The next major support is at $0.5880. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5880 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5650 support in the near term. The next major support sits at $0.5550. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.
