42423853,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hNNh,1642721596,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin, Altcoins Rise and Then Sink","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization falls under $41,000; ether and other major altcoins also drop.  Technician's take: Oversold conditions are attracting short-term bitcoin buyers.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $40,882 -2.2%  Ether (ETH): $3,024 -2.8%  Top gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM +4.7% Smart Contract Platform`  Top losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC −6.5% Smart Contract Platform Filecoin FIL −4.8% Computing Stellar XLM −3.7% Smart Contract Platform`  Sector classifications are provided via the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), developed by CoinDesk Indices to provide a reliable, comprehensive, and standardized classification system for digital assets. The CoinDesk 20 is a ranking of the largest digital assets by volume on trusted exchanges.  Markets  S&P 500: $4,482 -1.1%  DJIA: $34,715 -0.8%  Nasdaq: $14,154 -1.3%  Gold: $1,839 +.05%  Market moves  After jumping over $43,000 for a short time, bitcoin plummeted below where it started 24 hours ago. Ether and the largest altcoins by market capitalization also rose promisingly before falling back.  At the time of publication, bitcoin was trading under $41,000, ether had dropped below $3,100, and 19 of the 20 largest major altcoins by market cap were in the red.  The moves downward reflected ongoing pessimism about the economy and rising interest rates, and mirrored bearish sentiment about once, high-flying tech stocks. After a late sell-off of stocks, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 1.1% in U.S. trading hours. The S&P 500 fell similarly.  Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of the crypto fund BitBull Capital, said investors were initially upbeat about a study by the U.S. Federal Reserve on a digital dollar. ""Any news that comes from such an official sources lends crypto credibility, and that credibility leads to increased demand,"" DiPasquale said.  He attributed crypto markets' recent down trend ""to lower demand and some seasonability. ""January is historically a soft month,"" he said. ""So I'm hopeful as we lead into the next few weeks that there will be increased activity and demand.""  Technician's take  Bitcoin Returns Above $43K; Resistance Near $45K-$48K  Bitcoin (BTC) buyers are attempting to reverse a short-term downtrend on the charts.  Over the past two weeks, price action has been anchored around the $40,000 support level, which is where buyers previously stepped in ahead of the October price rally.  Still, the cryptocurrency could face resistance around $45,000-$48,000 as intraday signals approach overbought territory.  The 100-day moving average on the four-hour chart is sloping downwards, indicating a declining price trend over the past month. A decisive break above $43,000 could signal a positive trend shift on intraday charts.  On the daily chart, bitcoin appears to be oversold, albeit within a downtrend that began in November. That means upside could be limited given the decline in long-term momentum.

42423855,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hNPh,1642713104,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rises Despite Russia's Proposed Crypto Ban,"Bitcoin returned above $43,000 on Thursday and was up about 3%, indicating renewed buying interest after a relatively quiet week. Despite the recent decline in trading activity, analysts are still monitoring macroeconomic and regulatory risks that could trigger a rise in volatility.  On Thursday, Russia's central bank suggested that lawmakers need to implement regulations to effectively ban domestic crypto-related activities. The bank made it clear, however, that is not suggesting banning ownership of crypto by private citizens. Instead, the proposal targets Russian institutional investors, financial infrastructure providers and other organizations that could facilitate crypto transactions.  The proposal comes after Binance, a crypto exchange, announced earlier this month that it hired former government officials from Russia and Ukraine to help develop its business in those countries.  Some traders appeared to be unfazed by Russia's proposed crypto ban, evidenced by the price gain on Thursday.  However, some analysts remain cautious despite the stabilization in bitcoin's price. ""Buying on declines below $41K BTC is not yet a cause for optimism, as a downtrend with lower highs has been underway for more than a week,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, analyst at FxPro wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $42615, +2.26%    ●Ether (ETH): $3189, +2.43%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4483, −1.10%    ●Gold: $1839 per troy ounce, −0.24%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.83%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Volatility compression  Volatility in the crypto market has been declining over the past month, especially as bitcoin continues to trade in a tight range between $40,000 and $45,000.  QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm, described volatility conditions as ""frustrating"" in a Telegram announcement. ""There is clearly some downside nervousness with risk reversals back to very negative levels (puts more expensive than calls),"" QCP wrote.  The chart below shows bitcoin's realized volatilities approaching lows around 30% and 40%, which makes it difficult for some option traders who rely on frequent price swings. QCP stated that it has neutralized some of its volatility positions.  For now, some traders have been monitoring the close relationship between bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 Index. Increased volatility in tech stocks could dictate movements in crypto prices over the short term.

42411556,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOoNu,1642712816,Simpin' Ain't Easy: The Business Sense Behind IreneDAO,"Simplicity. Integrity. Meaning. Purpose.  Apart, these are empty buzzwords. But together, they’re something more: S.I.M.P., an online commandment, and the meme at the heart of a new NFT project called IreneDAO, which has become a case study in how crypto is monetizing a certain kind of obsessive relationship between fans and content creators.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Structurally, IreneDAO resembles most other pricey NFT collections: a limited set of pictures tied to tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, all sort of the same, but sort of different. DAO is short for “decentralized autonomous organization,” an online investment club based around cryptocurrency; the tokens grant buyers access to the DAO.  Each IreneDAO NFT features an image of the Singapore-based influencer Yuqing Irene Zhao, pasted onto a minty green background and flanked by popular crypto slogans. “Damp it,” reads one, referring to a meme about the late Bogdanoff brothers. “Have fun staying poor,” proclaims another.  This one, in which Zhao holds up the word “simp” on a sign, recently sold for 4 ETH, or over $12,000:  Simp, of course, isn’t just an invented acronym. Merriam-Webster defines it (sorry) as “a stupid or foolish person,” sort of like a “simpleton.” But for a more precise definition of “simp” as it’s used in this context, we’re better off turning to Urban Dictionary, an online compendium of slang terms, which frames it as an explicitly gendered concept.  Online, it refers to a certain kind of hardcore fan (usually a man) who goes out of their way to lavish attention on the object of their fandom (usually a woman). It was originally used as an insult, since the psychology of “simping” can border on the obsessive, though simps have since attempted to reclaim the term.  That’s essentially what’s happening with IreneDAO, and one of the reasons the lowest listed price for any of these NFTs is now 1.35 ETH, or around $4,400. Logan Paul, the YouTuber turned amateur boxer, is among the investors as is the billionaire Mike Novogratz.  The images began as a sticker pack on the messenger app Telegram, as a way for Zhao and her business partner Benjamin Tang to generate buzz around the online “Irene” persona. SO-COL, short for “social collectibles,” is the formal name for Zhao and Tang’s business.  When the sticker pack took off, SO-COL decided to turn the images into an NFT collection.  Like so many other NFT projects and online get-rich-quick schemes, IreneDAO managed to capture lightning in a bottle. The rise of so-called meme stocks like GameStop and AMC set the stage for this sort of thing at the dawn of the 2020s, putting real value behind viral jokes. For Zhao and Tang, the self-conscious “simp” mentality is part of the brand.  See also: GameStop Stock Surges Following NFT Marketplace Report  Simp psychology has already proved lucrative for other influencers: a streamer named Belle Delphine famously sold her bath water to fans for $30 a jar, and Stephanie Matto recently caused a stir with her “fart-in-a-jar” NFTs, which she’s said can be redeemed for actual farts in actual jars. On the streaming platform Twitch, subscribers regularly tip their favorite gamers and commentators in the hope of getting an on-air shout-out.  Those four words – simplicity, integrity, meaning, purpose – now a crucial part of SO-COL messaging, are meant to emphasize the absurdity of it all.  But even if the success of IreneDAO is absurd, it’s indicative of crypto’s ability to quickly capitalize on hype and turn fandom into cash. Belle Delphine announced her bath water sale in 2019, well before NFTs hit the mainstream; would she have done things differently in the NFT era?  “Stan culture” has normalized parasocial relationships between fans and celebrities, with a financial component crypto seems poised to magnify. Of course, fandoms could be exploited with or without an individual influencer’s permission, as this reasoned piece from Vice explains.  In the case of IreneDAO, though, things appear to have worked out. In a recent Q&A session on YouTube, Zhao explained that SO-COL could mark the beginning of a sort of “social finance,” or SocialFi, application. It could work a little like a social token, where fans purchase creator coins as a form of investment in a star’s popularity.  “Irene DAO is just a proof of concept for SO-COL,"" she said, ""because people [are] really skeptical about this fan economy, and whether it’s really gonna be bullish in the Web 3 ecosystem.”  It may collapse, as NFT projects often do. But as long as simps exist, and fans continue to shovel money toward influencers for a little attention, crypto will remain a tantalizing cash grab.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/20/simpin-aint-easy-the-business-sense-behind-irenedao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95ca3174c377f308248eceabf69b248920936095-1958x926.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The public token sale, which took place on Dec. 29, 2021, added to a private sale that garnered some $32 million, announced at the time the Agoric proof-of-stake base layer went live in November 2021. Combined with an earlier seed round, the project has thus far raised over $85 million. The public sale of BLD staking tokens has also brought another 40,000 or so new account holders to the Agoric blockchain.  Read more: Smart Contract Platform Agoric Launches Public Chain  Agoric started out back in 2018 as a JavaScript-based smart contract coding language, designed to access the popular developer language while bringing a degree of battle-tested security to smart contracts.  Since then, it’s morphed into a proof-of-stake blockchain, linked to the Cosmos ecosystem, looking to create a safer decentralized finance (DeFi) realm than currently exists elsewhere.  Dev crunch  There are over 10 million developers who use JavaScript, which turns out to be easily made more secure than most other scripting languages. This is thanks to the clearly defined way to manage the authority a JavaScript program has, explained Agoric CEO Dean Tribble.  “We set out to build a platform where millions of developers could program this stuff, and so you’ve got to meet developers where they’re at,” Tribble said in an interview with CoinDesk. “And millions of developers on an everyday basis build software that controls trillions of dollars using JavaScript.”  Now that the Agoric consensus layer has been built with the Cosmos SDK blockchain framework, the next phase, which will go live in the next quarter or so, is fleshing out the economic applications layer, which will also include a “stable token” called Run, said Tribble.  This first phase of the application layer is just to get the economy deployed, stabilized and integrated with the whole Cosmos Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, he said.  “Over time, there will be more phases,” Tribble said. “After the first launch, it will go into a permission phase, where people can propose, say, a core contract for NFTs that’s all written in JavaScript, and the community can vote on whether to deploy it. And that will run as we continue more security testing and running bug bounty programs, to eventually become permissionless. Then the gates are opened and anyone can deploy anything.”",POSITIVE,없음,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/20/agoric-raises-50m-in-coinlist-token-sale-to-bring-javascript-developers-into-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf40011d9fe35b6ab24532a60ad965392149252d-9504x6336.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423871,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hVPh,1642707436,"In Long-Awaited CBDC White Paper, Fed Flags Privacy, Financial Stability Risks","The U.S. central bank believes the current financial system might be bolstered by the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), but only one that works within the current network of private banks, rather than a CBDC that the Federal Reserve issues directly to consumers.  The Fed released its long-awaited white paper on CBDCs Thursday. It did not commit to creating (or not creating) a digital dollar, but did explain its questions in approaching the issue and ask for public feedback on questions of privacy, financial stability and just how a digital dollar might be used.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell alluded to this during a recent nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, telling lawmakers that the report was ""ready to go"" after several delays.  ""And by the way, it’s more going to be an exercise in asking questions and seeking input from the public rather than taking a lot of positions on various issues, although we do take some positions,"" he said at the time.  Officials haven’t yet committed to issuing, or even developing a digital dollar, and the document underscored how far away such decisions remain. Still, it shed considerable light into what would make a hypothetical CBDC successful for the U.S.  “The Federal Reserve’s initial analysis suggests that a potential U.S. CBDC, if one were created, would best serve the needs of the United States by being privacy-protected, intermediated, widely transferable and identity-verified,” the paper says.  The intermediaries could be commercial banks or other nonbank payment entities. In other words, the Fed does not want consumers setting up personal accounts at central bank locations to access these CBDCs, but rather, would prefer that existing banks and similar financial firms maintain their role.  Cybersecurity, the prevention of financial crimes and meeting future needs are also all considerations that the Fed must look at before it can begin to issue a CBDC.  ""Any CBDC would need to strike an appropriate balance between safeguarding consumer privacy rights and affording the transparency necessary to deter criminal activity,"" the paper says.  Moreover, the Fed wants ""clear support"" from both the executive branch of the federal government and Congress before it will issue a CBDC, ""ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law.""  Maintaining dollar hegemony could be one benefit of a U.S. CBDC, the paper said, especially in a future where more countries tout their own digital cash.  The report noted that the dollar is currently the most widely used payment and investment tool in the world, as well as being the global reserve currency. This ubiquity gives the U.S. the ability to influence ""standards for the global monetary system,"" the report said.  ""It is important, however, to consider the implications of a potential future state in which many foreign countries and currency unions may have introduced CBDCs. Some have suggested that, if these new CBDCs were more attractive than existing forms of the U.S. dollar, global use of the dollar could decrease – and a U.S. CBDC might help preserve the international role of the dollar,"" the paper said.  Public comments are open for the next 120 days, the Federal Reserve said.  In a statement following the report's publication, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement that he looked forward to working with the Fed and executive branch on CBDC that ""ensures workers, small business, community banks and credit unions can continue to participate in our digital economy.""  “The Federal Reserve’s report is a good first step toward designing a central bank digital currency that will bring more Americans into our banking system and help maintain the United States’ leadership in the global economy,” he said.  Senator Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Brown's Banking Committee counterpart across the aisle, said he was ""encouraged"" by the report's noting it needs Congressional support before the Fed would issue a CBDC, as well as the Fed's note that it would not directly offer retail accounts. The lawmaker did raise concerns about the privacy aspect of the Fed's CBDC proposal however.  “While the report mentions the importance of CBDC privacy, I’m concerned the Fed does not clearly explain how it would protect consumer transaction data. There’s also a question in my mind whether the Fed’s report implies that a CBDC would not allow for direct peer-to-peer transactions. This characteristic is fundamental,"" Toomey said.

Though it must be mentioned that their value isn&apos;t actually fixed, any depreciation or appreciation in fiat carry over to them by nature. These coins can be minted on many blockchains, but the Ethereum chain has been the most popular option for it since years now.

42423875,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hVVh,1642702815,Twitter Launches NFT Profile Picture Verification,"For as long as crypto believers have been using NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as profile pictures on Twitter, there’s been skepticism about the durability of “ownership” over these digital assets.  Sure, you might “own” that cartoon monkey in your profile picture, in the sense that the token is affixed to your Ethereum address on an immutable, append-only ledger – but what’s stopping someone from just right-clicking the image and setting it as their profile picture, too?  Now, after months of anticipation, Twitter has released an official verification mechanism for NFT profile pictures.  Link your Ethereum wallet to your Twitter account, and you'll be presented with a list of NFTs you own (verification is available only for Ethereum-based NFTs, at the moment, though a representative for the company clarified that this is only the “first iteration” of a feature that may go on to support other blockchains).  Choose an NFT, and your profile picture – typically enclosed within a circle – will get a nifty new hexagonal border. If a pesky right-clicker tries to use your NFT as their profile picture without first buying the token, they will still be able to use the image, but they will be stuck with the classic circle frame.  Of course, a truly committed right-clicker might simply re-upload that same image to an NFT platform, mint a visually identical NFT and use that as their profile picture instead, complete with a hexagonal frame signifying ownership on the blockchain. No word yet on whether Twitter will offer protections against that sort of thievery, which has grown rampant as the market for NFTs has exploded over the past year.  And because Twitter fetches users’ NFTs with application programming interfaces (APIs) from the online marketplace OpenSea, it’s effectively built a third party into its verification process, as opposed to just interacting directly with the blockchain. If OpenSea goes down, Twitter may have trouble loading those images. (These particular APIs were recently criticized at length in an essay by the cryptographer Moxie Marlinspike.)  Read more: NFT Forgeries Aren’t Going Away  Twitter’s NFT verification process is both a bid to keep crypto enthusiasts on the platform and an explicit rejection of former CEO Jack Dorsey’s “Bitcoin-only” philosophy.  Though Dorsey is one of the most prominent critics of what’s known as Web 3 – a new iteration of the internet, running on blockchains as opposed to cloud computing infrastructure and private servers – he’s a big fan of Bitcoin, which he’s said could “bring about world peace.”  NFTs and Bitcoin don’t tend to mix, at least not yet. Most of the action in the NFT sector has happened in and around the Ethereum blockchain.  For now, NFT verification is available only for users with Twitter Blue, the company’s $2.99-a-month subscription service, which offers a streamlined user experience and an “undo” button, among other mostly cosmetic features.  For NFT fans, it may be a price worth paying; that’s like, what – 0.001 ETH?

42423874,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hVZh,1642696215,LIVE BLOG: Congressional Hearing Puts Crypto Energy Use in the Crosshairs,"Crypto mining's energy use will be in the crosshairs Thursday as the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee discusses its environmental impact. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will question five witnesses about proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, how crypto networks are powered and what tools or solutions exist to mitigate environmental impacts.  The hearing comes one day after E&E News, a Politico subsidiary, revealed that the Environmental Protection Agency blocked two coal-powered power plants primarily focused on bitcoin mining from continuing to operate coal ash ponds, which create a ""toxic slurry produced from coal power.""  “The profitability of mining and the increase of the value of [proof-of-work] cryptocurrencies over time supports massive investments in mining facilities, which require ever-increasing amounts of energy to power and cool machines,” a hearing memo said.  The witnesses – Cornell Tech Professor Ari Juels, Soluna Computing CEO John Belizaire, BitFury CEO Brian Brooks, former Chelan County Public Utility District General Manager Steven Wright and Jordan Ramis shareholder Gregory Zerzan – will share a range of thoughts in prepared testimony, including endorsements of proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms and questions about the mix of energy sources used to power cryptocurrencies.     1:45 (ND) And with that, today's hearing has ended.  1:43 (EG) Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) asked Prof. Juels about how data oracles, which connect blockchain data with off-chain systems, can help improve mining’s efficiency.  ""The thing about blockchains is that for various technical reasons they lack direct internet connections. It's not possible for one of these little programs, smart contracts, to reach out and query websites the way that you or I [could]. The purpose of an oracle is to feed data to smart contracts so that they do have access to web data. And in essence, the role of an oracle is to connect blockchains to off-chain systems, web servers, other blockchains and so on and so forth. So you can think of oracles as the eyes and ears of smart contracts or blockchains,"" Juels said.  1:40 (ND) This hearing started off with questions about basics but it has evolved into a pretty substantive back-and-forth between lawmakers and the witnesses on specific issues of policy.  1:35 (ND) Soluna Computing's Belizaire said he couldn't speak to whether there was a 300% increase in jobs in crypto at large but did say a lot of the data centers his company runs are large and require sophisticated operators.  1:32 (EG) Witness Steve Wright, formerly from the Chelan County Public Utility District and Bonneville Power Administration in Washington state, said that big data center operators like Microsoft and Google were more interested than crypto mine operators in learning about the impact on local utility systems and customers.  1:26 (EG) Responding to a question from Rep. Lori Trahan (D-Mass.) about the viability of proof-of-stake mining, Professor Juels said that both proof-of-stake and PoW are viable options for crypto, and that centralization is a systemic issue that has to do with the dynamics of the network that can affect both types of systems. He conceded that PoS brings issues of the “rich getting richer.”  1:23 (EG) Witness Ari Juels said that consumers don’t care about terahashes, a measure of computing power of the Bitcoin network, but the number of transactions that the network is processing. Using this as a reference point, the network is less efficient than before because, while the energy consumed by the bitcoin network overall has grown, the number of transactions has remained “fairly steady” at about five per second, he said.  1:15 (EG) BitFury’s Brooks argued that more efficient machines actually do make the whole system more efficient overall, in that less energy is consumed per block mined.  1:12 (ND) Professor Juels pushed back on a claim that crypto mining machines are becoming more efficient: ""That is absolutely the case but also an extremely deceptive claim. Mining rigs are not like the light bulbs in our house for efficiency. More efficiency means less electricity. So to be clear, individual mining rigs are growing more energy-efficient. Crypto mining as a whole is becoming less energy-efficient. And that's because rewards and therefore profits aren't determined by absolute mining power, but by mining power relative to money groups are more energy-efficient. One can see this with reference to the data on overall energy consumption. crypto mining has been growing over time, particularly over the past year.""  1:09 (AA) Pulse check: Markets are holding their earlier gains but bitcoin seems to have dipped a little, falling briefly below $43,000 levels. As expected, shares of the miners and other crypto-linked stocks seem to have mostly followed the crypto prices.  1:03 (AA) The “China unplugging,” as John Belizaire stated, is a reference to when China banned all crypto-linked activities in the country last year and miners started to relocate to other regions of the world, mainly in North America.  In fact, the shift was widely publicized last year, when a new report from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) stated that the U.S. accounted for 35.4% of the global hashrate at the end of August, after China’s ban, more than doubling from the end of April in 2021. The number has likely been amplified since then.  Here is that chart from CCAF's report:  12.55 (EG) Rep. Neal Dunn (R-Fla.) said the best way to clean up mining’s environmental impact is to bring it to the U.S., away from countries like China and Kazakhstan.  12:52 (EG) Rep. Ann McLane Kuster (D-N.H.), said that while there are bad actors who utilize carbon-intensive mining efforts, there are also industry leaders who are committed to reducing carbon emissions and are publicly traded. She asked what innovations are coming out of mining that have applications outside the space.  12:45 (ND) In response to a question from Rep. Rodgers, Wright said he believes Chelan County saw an immature part of the crypto industry when miners set up shop as far back as 2014 and 2015.  ""The key thing is we had a lot of folks come to town highly capitalized, and none of them really hung around and that created a fair amount of frustration for this community,"" he said.  Chelan County's board of commissioners voted in 2018 to institute a moratorium on new miners due to concerns about energy usage, public safety and energy costs.  Wright went further in his remarks Thursday, saying, ""I think there was a lot of concern candidly about the potential for decentralized and unregulated currency and what could be done and a lot of reports in the press about various activities associated with cryptocurrency.""  12:41 (EG) Rep. Cathy Rodgers (R-Wa.) quoted a survey that said blockchain jobs grew 395% from 2020 to 2021 along with $30 billion in investment, asking what is the longterm utility of blockchain talent.  12:39 (CL) Witness Gregory Zerzan, responding to a question from Rep. David McKinley (R-W.Va.) about using stranded energy to mine bitcoin, said crypto miners often utilize energy that would otherwise be wasted.  “We've heard testimony today that points out accurately that the wind doesn't always blow. We don't always have sunshine,” Zerzan said, adding:  “Sometimes when those things happen, it happens too much. And so that energy would otherwise be wasted. And one of the great things about cryptocurrency technology and processing is that it utilizes energy in many cases that would otherwise be discarded.”  12:36 (ND) Josh Olszewicz, head of research at Valkyrie Funds, tweeted the chart below in response to Juels' claim that just four miners could control 51% of the Bitcoin blockchain:  In other words, assuming this data stands up, the claim isn't that totally wild. Some four-firm combination of Foundry (note: Foundry is a subsidiary of CoinDesk owner DCG), Poolin, AntPool, F2Pool, Binance Pool and/or ViaBTC could theoretically take control of the network.  12:28 (CL) Rep. DeGette asks Brian Brooks: “Do you agree that proof-of-work can be wasteful and also, very briefly, why do you think that bitcoin and these other cryptocurrencies cannot shift to the proof-of-stake method?”  Brooks responded with: ""It's clearly not wasted. It's an asset that large numbers of people are willing to pay for, for a variety of reasons.""  When Brooks tried to explain why bitcoin mining could not shift to proof-of-stake, DeGette cut him off, informing him her time for questions was up.  (Note: Lawmakers usually have a set amount of time to ask questions, often five minutes.)  12:24 (ND) Lot of ""blockchain not bitcoin"" vibes in this hearing so far. On the one hand, that makes sense to me – the hearing is about the energy needed to power blockchain networks and where that energy comes from. On the other, getting too deep into distinctions might just muddle the overall focus of this hearing.  Still, a lot of this hearing so far has focused on the basics of blockchain, establishing what things are and how they work.  12:17 (CL) Steve Wright, former CEO of the Chelan County Public Utility District, discussed his experience working with miners in Washington state. Miners have historically sought out renewable energy to power their operations because it’s cheap – but Wright thinks economic forces might change that.  “Clean energy resources are gaining value in electricity markets while carbon-emitting generation is losing value,” Wright said. “This appears likely to push crypto production toward fossil-fired resources for at least the near term.”  12:13 (AA) Here is a chart from Bitcoin Mining Council's presentation that gives a better picture of Brooks' sustainable energy mix numbers.  12:12 (ND) BitFury CEO Brian Brooks is arguing that bitcoin mining uses more renewable power sources than the overall U.S. electric grid does on a relative basis, citing figures from the Bitcoin Mining Council and the Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index.  ""But what is clear is that the 188 terawatt hours used by bitcoin last year out of about 155,000 terawatt hours consumed globally for all uses, was sourced more sustainably than other uses on average. So, for example, the energy mix used by bitcoin mining was about 58% sustainably sourced last year sustainable under the International Energy Agency definition including wind hydro, solar, nuclear, and carbon offsets, compared to 31% for the US economy as a whole,"" he said.  12:08 (EG) “Computing can be a catalyst for clean energy development, which will reduce pollution and create local jobs,” Belizaire said. He argued that mines can soak up renewable electricity that is stranded or would otherwise be wasted.  12:05 (AA) “What I want you to remember from my testimony today is that crypto's energy consumption is a feature, not a bug,” said John Belizaire, CEO at Soluna Computing.  A great way to start the energy consumption discussion of crypto currencies.  12:04 (CL) Juels concludes by saying: ""The Bitcoin community deserves our deep gratitude for introducing blockchains to the world. But we have far more energy-efficient alternatives than proof-of-stake. For the sake of the environment and our energy infrastructure in the United States, I believe that we need to embrace these new options.""  12:00 (ND) Cornell Tech Professor Ari Juels is the first witness to speak, opening his remarks by noting that bitcoin is not blockchain. The rest of his oral testimony has been focused on defining different types of blockchain systems, how they're powered and what their uses cases might be, differentiating between smart contracts on Ethereum vs. payments on Bitcoin as one example.  11:57 (ND) The first three lawmakers to speak addressed crypto and the potential benefits and concerns of blockchain. The fourth went on about U.S. President Joe Biden, his COVID-19 policies, his international policies, inflation and a host of other topics. Hopefully, not a sign of what's to come.  11:53 (AA) A quick market check while the hearing continues. Bitcoin is holding its gains, rising more than 3%, above $43,000 levels. Ether, the native token for Ethereum, gained more than 5%. Meanwhile, the shares of most crypto miners, which are highly levered to the movements of crypto currency prices, are up 5% or more on Thursday.  11:46 (ND) Rep. Howard Griffith (R-Va.) opened his remarks with a quick definition of what a blockchain is and comments on how blockchain networks might interact with power grids.  ""The question is, can our current political infrastructure support this level of consumption? Grid operators may need to update their infrastructure to accommodate the energy uses of some matters, which can be expensive and time consuming,"" he said.  11:44 (CL) Rep. DeGette also gave an overview of proof-of-work mining and expressed concern about the influx of miners taking over former coal and aluminum plants in areas with cheap electricity.  “One company in upstate New York upgraded a previously closed coal-fired power plant to run on natural gas … another company restarted two coal-fired plants in Pennsylvania in order to generate power for its crypto mining operations,” DeGette said.  “Now, given our current climate objections, objectives, examples like this are deeply concerning,” DeGette said. “New and innovative uses of blockchain technology are being explored every day, and we should continue to try to encourage them,” she added.  11:42 (ND) Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) kicked off the hearing by discussing both potential use cases for blockchain (energy management, health records) and what some of the environmental concerns are.  ""Our focus now needs to be reducing carbon emissions overall and increasing the share of green energy on the grid. The unique energy demands of the crypto mining industry do present potential benefits, although how these will play out in practice remains to be seen,"" she said in her opening remarks.  11:30 a.m. ET (ND) Good morning folks, and welcome to CoinDesk's live coverage of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on cryptocurrencies and their environmental impact.

42423866,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hVHh,1642694764,Jefferies Sees the NFT Market Reaching More Than $80B in Value by 2025,"The convergence of the digital and physical worlds is taking shape, with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) allowing brands to expand their reach into “digitally-enabled experiential tie-ins,” investment bank Jefferies said in an analyst note.  The bank raised its NFT market-cap forecast to more than $35 billion for 2022 and to over $80 billion for 2025, analysts led by Stephanie Wissink wrote in the report published Tuesday.  The bank notes that companies and celebrities are buying plots of virtual “land” in The Sandbox and Decentraland, allowing them to digitally market, raise awareness and extend their brands. In November, there was a rush into digital real estate purchases, for which NFTs are the “digital building blocks,” the note says.  Jefferies views digital assets as an emerging technology, and recommends that clients build a basket of investment exposure across video game, toy and game, and social media companies.  For consumer exposure, the bank mentions: Hasbro, Mattel, Funko and GameStop. For metaverse exposure, they include: Meta, Snap, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive Software, Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group and Roblox.  Jefferies says that while the Ethereum blockchain is still the most popular choice for minting NFTs and building so-called metaverses, the network’s high gas, or transaction, fees have pushed brands to consider alternative networks.  Rival investment bank JPMorgan also highlighted this trend in a report last week. It said that Ethereum’s dominance in NFTs was shrinking due to congestion and high gas fees.

The project will allow fans to contribute their own designs.  Prada and Adidas Originals said they will auction a collection of NFTs designed by the digital artist Zach Lieberman on SuperRare between Jan. 28–31. The proceeds from the NFT sale will be donated to a charity supporting artists and creators.  This Prada-Adidas tie-up is another sign of clothing brands – from both haute couture and fast fashion – aggressively entering the space in an attempt to give customers a more digital experience.  Morgan Stanley predicts the total NFT market is expected to grow to $300 billion by 2030. The report identifies luxury brands such as Gucci, Balenciaga and Kering as in the best position to profit from digital collaborations in the metaverse.  From Jan. 24, fans will be able to register with a digital wallet to create and mint NFTs by submitting a photograph, using a filter designed by the digital artist Lieberman. The project will then choose 3,000 contributors who will also own IP rights to their individual NFTs and be able to take part in the drop later that week.  Luxury metaverse  Prada and Adidas said they will also launch their third collaboration, dubbed the “Adidas for Prada Re-Nylon collection,” in the metaverse. A press release didn’t specify which metaverse but Adidas has worked with The Sandbox in the past.  “Prada sees the emergent metaverse as a new space for the brand to re-define luxury for the next generation and cultivate shared experiences that honor the brands’ spirit of experimentation and creativity,” Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s marketing director and head of corporate social responsibility, told CoinDesk in a statement.

42411540,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOnqq,1642689919,"IPFS, Filecoin and the Long-Term Risks of Storing NFTs","As NFTs continue their march into the mainstream, it’s important to know how these supposedly permanent digital assets stay that way – or not. IPFS (or the InterPlanetary File System) is a protocol that many NFTs (or non-fungible tokens) point to as their underlying asset. It’s part of the backbone of this new digital economy.  NFTs are sold on the idea that a blockchain token that corresponds to another digital file – be they MP3s audio files, JPEGs of digital art or PDFs of mortgage certificates – can have monetary value if it is provably unique. But that non-fungible token, which will live as long as Ethereum or Solana or some such platform exist, isn’t the data it’s pegged to. To make these other files last, many NFT minters have turned to distributed file-sharing systems developed by Protocol Labs – one of the industry’s blue chips.  Chris Dupres is the editor of the Chia Plot, where a version of this article first published, and experienced IT professional.  Most people feel that this means every part of an NFT is hosted on a blockchain and immutable. Nothing could be farther from the truth.  IPFS architecture  I don’t want to get too deep into how IPFS works, but it needs an overview. IPFS is a distributed file system similar to a BitTorrent swarm but with no central tracker, just a distributed hash table (DHT) hosted by nodes that maintains a sort of data ledger. Git, the open-source software management tool, also uses Merkle trees to form blocks that identify the files, which might be where the confusion with traditional blockchains comes from, but it is not a blockchain. Git uses Merkle trees to organize releases and ensure that different versions don’t accidentally get switched and to maintain integrity up and down the tree.  To get onto the IPFS network you can put up a node, using instructions here, and begin hosting files. When you put a file onto IPFS you create its content ID, or CID, which is a complicated set of hashes based on where the file is located and related metadata. That file can then stay hosted on your node alone, or it can be distributed among many nodes. This is where it is like BitTorrent. Just because a file is available “on BitTorrent” doesn’t mean there are any seeders or that it’s there forever. IPFS is like this. The address/CID is permanent, to a degree as it gets passed around the DHT, but the underlying asset, or file, that the IPFS address points to can be lost as easily as any file on any random web server. CoinDesk could run an IPFS node to store its article archive, and it wouldn’t make them any more permanent than they are now.  Filecoin, or IPFS on the blockchain  Filecoin, a sister project, picks up where IPFS left off. It purports to use “blockchain technology” to ensure persistence of data, by actually writing and distributing files across a cryptocurrency network and incentivizing participants to host that data on IPFS for as long as possible by paying out FIL tokens.  This is probably more robust than a random web server run by some random software project hosted in AWS, but it is by no means permanent. Lots of blockchains have gone defunct in the past, and there is no reason to think that Filecoin is an exception.  Many NFT projects use Filecoin to give their buyers the feeling of permanence. Even more use IPFS addresses to give the sense of reliability, as IPFS has won accolades by some of tech’s biggest names.  Read more: IPFS' Juan Benet: From Idea to Action  However, using IPFS broadly obfuscates the real permanence of NFT-secured assets. It’s an open secret that many NFT projects simply use random web file storage to host their images, and that those could go away at any time. The solution for “savvy” NFTs buyers is to only consider projects where the “art” is hosted on IPFS.  But often an IPFS link just points to that same website you didn’t trust the project creators to maintain. Filecoin hosted storage might be an easier way to provide some reliability for NFT storage, but it is far from perfect.  Problems with IPFS as permanent storage  Honestly, IPFS might as well be a .torrent file that points to a reliable IP address hosting the DHT table for the files you want to host. It’s a little bit more elegant than that, but it really does boil down to the same thing.  No matter what you do with the storage, someone has to host it physically somewhere. There might be layers of incentives provided to ensure that the storage stays up, but it still needs to be on a hard drive somewhere connected to the internet.  Even when a file is hosted on Filecoin you are reliant on the Filecoin nodes it’s hosted on not to go dark during a bear market for the Filecoin team to not introduce a catastrophic error ever. and for the IPFS gateways that are used to access your files stay up.  There are a lot of centralized points of failure here for a decentralized file storage system.  How you can avoid being fooled  From what I can tell, there is no easy way to determine how a file on IPFS is being hosted without running your own IPFS node and using that software to do a lookup of the hash.  Once you have a node up you can use the following code to find who has certain chunks stored:  ipfs dht findprovs $CHUNK_HASH  It is not foolproof as it will only list what nodes are hosting the file that your node can find. However, these files do not distribute automatically and hosting a file is an active process as is pushing it to new nodes. To do this you need to know exactly what file you are looking for and its hash.  Each NFT marketplace should show you the address where an NFT is located. To see where it is on OpenSea, the biggest NFT marketplace right now, you can follow this guide. Amusingly, if you follow this process for the current top NFT project, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, you will find it doesn’t even use IPFS but a centralized web server relying on centralized DNS and a centralized TLS certificate.  Read more: It's an NFT Boom. Do You Know Where Your Digital Art Lives?  Even if you are storing your data on Filecoin you aren’t really accessing it from there when reading the NFT. While a file might be “backed” on Filecoin, transacting with that network requires fees and apparently unsealing a file to read can take hours. To get around this, Protocol Labs developed the FileCoin Pinning Services that hosts files like IPFS. It’s basically just IPFS nodes that grab stuff off Filecoin and host it for a price.  This is all starting to feel like centralized storage with extra expensive and complicated steps. The worst part is that people are putting huge amounts of money into NFTs thinking they’ll last a lifetime, when they are simply files on a file server somewhere that someone (not you) ultimately controls. NFT marketplaces sometimes even have a business incentive to remove your file from the directory.  So what does this all mean?  Basically, NFTs are no more permanent than any other part of the web. They use fancy, useful technology to obfuscate the fact that unless you are hosting the file that your NFT represents yourself you are beholden to others.  Right now, an NFT hosted using Filecoin has as good a chance as anything of sticking around. But, like everything else in this world, it comes down to trust. Do you trust that the entity that created your NFT has put the effort in to ensure reliable access? Do you trust that Filecoin won’t shut down?  These are questions you need to ask yourself when buying into an NFT project. The space is new right now, and don’t be fooled by an IPFS address into thinking that means your asset is permanently ensconced in an immutable blockchain.",NEUTRAL,FIL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIL | TECHNOLOGY,Chris Dupres,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/20/ipfs-filecoin-and-the-long-term-risks-of-storing-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d66720e079598e085785061e73b4adda08e3ed2-2400x1664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423869,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hVLh,1642687355,EOS Creator Dan Larimer Is Back,"The community behind EOS is looking to right itself by renewing tech ties with the network’s OG (original gangster) developer, Dan Larimer, who has engineered a “Mandel” hard break from the company that insiders say “burned” its $4 billion blockchain darling.  Larimer, who quit Block.one – EOS’ now-estranged mother company – last January, is ratcheting up technical contributions to the software he spearheaded in 2017. In return, EOS Network Foundation (ENF) – now the ecosystem’s de facto shot caller – will bankroll Larimer’s development work with token grants in its native EOS.  Larimer’s “Mandel” upgrade is a hard fork that would give ENF effective control of the EOS codebase – and thus the network’s power seat – if validators adopt it in the second quarter. Neither Larimer nor Block.one returned requests for comment.  Read more: Dan Larimer Announces Departure From EOS Builder Block.One  Mandel’s release, and Larimer’s return, represent a new chapter for EOS, which went from being one of the most well-funded projects in crypto to a mostly forgotten sideshow. Leadership at ENF is trying to change that narrative – and perhaps even the EOS name.  Team leads say fully severing ties with Block.one is the first step. Zack Gall, ENF’s director of communications, said the company that conducted EOS’s $4 billion token sale in 2017 had long since shifted its focus and funding – and even its vested EOS tokens – to the crypto exchange Bullish, which is preparing to go public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).  Block.one, or B1 for short, “burned” the EOS ecosystem in the process, Gall said in an interview.  “B1 essentially transferred their assets to a new company, which feels like the ultimate rug,” he said over Telegram, referring to “rug pull,” a crypto colloquialism for being deceived by project leadership.  Read more: EOS Foundation CEO: ‘EOS as It Stands Is a Failure’  Block.one’s relationship with the EOS community boiled over late last year with the crypto-governance equivalent of “you’re fired.” Stakeholders voted in early December to cease Block.one’s EOS token grants, worth $250 million, over a multiyear vesting period.  The reason: EOS backers had had enough of a once-pivotal codebase caretaker that they felt had commitment problems.  “The network came together to reach consensus [and] take back the only asset that it had jurisdiction over, which was their unvested EOS,” Gall said. (The company had already received nearly 30 million over the years.)  “It is probably the first and only time that a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) took action against a corporate entity,” he added.  Fresh start?  Many chains have their heavyweight corporate backers, arguments over decentralization aside.  Solana has Solana Labs, Avalanche has Ava Labs, Terra has Terraform Labs. These entities wield influential developer roles; often, they also hold critical intellectual property, like Twitter accounts and websites and code repositories.  The conundrum that ENF faces is that EOS gave its corporation the boot without reclaiming that intellectual property. Block.one still holds prominent assets like eos.io. More crucially, it maintains the EOS GitHub repository, an active codebase that hasn’t changed in eight months, an eternity in crypto land.  ENF tried to get it all from Block.one, Gall said. He said Block.one’s leadership “chartered a flight on short notice” to a backwater Canadian city to broker with Yves La Rose, who heads ENF. But Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer balked at the term sheet, setting the stage for the “firing” vote and leaving EOS’s new steward without control of the codebase or the intellectual property.  Larimer returns  That should change with Larimer’s contributions and the upcoming Mandel hard fork, Gall said. It will shift operational control of the codebase to ENF – which the network funds through a $100 million “inflation drip.”  Larimer, a serial blockchain entrepreneur, has grand plans for future EOS tooling that support DAOs and social media platforms. according to Gall. He said that some of those plans are possible only with the hefty codebase contributions that Larimer, Block.one’s former chief technology officer, is now set to lend.  Larimer’s getting paid 200,000 tokens for his work.  Though Larimer didn't respond to CoinDesk by press time, he explained his “business-like” relationship with the EOS chain in a recent YouTube segment. He's now managing two projects, including ClarionOS, which is working on the Mandel fork.  ֵENF hopes that all this will set the stage for a renaissance of EOS – or whatever it calls itself next.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE | FORKS,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/20/eos-creator-dan-larimer-is-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7de469a67f2487ce84c10791b1e3e888ec1550b9-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The marketplace will feature video NFT “Moments” from the league’s history, each accompanied by audio, crowd reactions and broadcast commentary, according to a press release.  “Video is our sweet spot in general, but we're looking at [UFC’s] partnership a bit differently,” Caty Tedman, head of partnerships at Dapper Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview. “The UFC calendar is so different from the NBA calendar. So we're going to structure much more around their pay-per-view events, which are like the premier events of their season.”  Growing roster  Dapper Labs is building out quite the sporting presence on its Flow blockchain, adding UFC to its growing list of league partnerships that already includes the NBA and NFL.  While the NFTs themselves are naturally violent in nature, Dapper isn’t concerned about the sport’s rough edges being unappealing to the average customer.  “It's less about this marketplace being a product for anyone and more about how it’s for the UFC fan community, and we hope it enables them to showcase their fandom in a new way,” Tedman said.

The funds will go toward hiring more staff, particularly engineers, and the continued rollout of the network’s infrastructure.  Aleph.im is a distributed cloud platform that provides serverless computing services, file storage and databases. It is meant to be a decentralized alternative to the likes of Amazon’s Lambda. Aleph.im allows Web 3 builders, dapps (decentralized applications) and protocols of any blockchain to ""decentralize"" an often overlooked piece of the development stack – middleware.  “When everyone talks about decentralization, they’re all looking at blockchains or smart contracts,” Aleph.im founder Jonathan Schemoul told CoinDesk in an interview. “The truth is that there is a lot of middleware in between. When you go to a dapp, in most cases, you still have a server between you and the blockchain.” Aleph aims to decentralize that server middleware part of the stack by running the middleware on different nodes rather than on one central server.  Other investors in the round included Zee Prime Capital, NOIA Capital, Theia Investment Group, /bitfwd Ventures, Ellipti, Incuba Alpha, Rarestone Capital, TRGC, Token Ventures, Seven Capital, Rare Capital co-founder Chris McCann and angel investor Owen Simonin.  Aleph.im is also rolling out its first computing resource nodes, which will eventually carry the bulk of the network’s processing power.

As a part of the strategic round, most of the investors are committing to run nodes to provide infrastructure for the network, Schemoul said.

42411531,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOnX0,1642686600,Understanding DeFi and Its Importance in the Crypto Economy,"Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is one of the most important topics in cryptocurrency. The aim of DeFi is to create an entirely new financial system, completely independent of the traditional financial (TradFi) economy. There are billions of dollars being invested into this goal, along with the efforts of thousands of developers around the world.  This is part one of our series on DeFi. The aim of this series is to provide a deep dive for financial advisors to further our understanding of this space and create a bridge that we can use efficiently to merge the TradFi world we work in with the new and innovative DeFi space that is being created.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  The origins of Ethereum and the DeFi ecosystem  In 2013, programmer Vitalik Buterin co-created Ethereum as an additional cryptocurrency project after his work on Bitcoin. Ethereum is different from Bitcoin because it’s designed to be a blockchain with multiple different functions: to be a digital money, to be used for global payments and to have blockchain applications run on top of its code. There’s currently an entire digital economy running on top of Ethereum, one of which is the DeFi ecosystem.  DeFi is a crypto movement that is built on cryptocurrencies like ether, open to anyone in the world (with an internet connection). DeFi is a trustless application, meaning the applications are not controlled or hosted by a central party such as a bank or a government. The aspects of cryptocurrency such as cryptography, smart contracts and blockchain technology allow this system of decentralized finance to exist for the global community to utilize.  Ethereum utilizes a robust smart contract programming language called Solidity, which allows for all of the necessary logic that financial contracts require to be included in the application code. Many other cryptocurrencies now compete with Ethereum to run DeFi applications, such as Avalanche, Terra, Fantom and others, but it is important to note that Ethereum is the largest network and was the first project that was used to create DeFi.  The first DeFi project, MakerDAO, was created in 2015 on top of the Ethereum blockchain. MakerDAO allows any user to lock ether, or ETH, via smart contracts and generate dai, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Dai is often used in the MakerDAO savings platform called Oasis, effectively creating a decentralized bank. Through the power of stablecoins and smart contracts, Oasis created a lending and borrowing platform for its users.  Lending and borrowing in the DeFi ecosystem  Lending and borrowing platforms have become a tremendous part of the DeFi ecosystem. Users are able to lock crypto positions into a smart contract and borrow against their position. Other users are able to lock crypto positions into a smart contract and generate yield by allowing their coins to be lent out to borrowers.  An interesting thing to note is the yields generated by lenders in the DeFi ecosystem are substantially higher than the traditional financial system. Running a smart contract is much more cost-effective than running a traditional bank; therefore, nearly all of the yield generated from lending money is passed directly back to the lender via the smart contract. Many people place their trust in these transparent smart contracts and are able to generate a significant income from their utilization.  In a world of ultra-low interest rates, the cost-effective smart contracts are providing a technological solution to this problem. Many people are upset with central bankers for allowing interest rates to be so low, and a solution isn’t found by political persuasion but rather through technology, which has yet again created an opportunity for borrowers and savers alike. Perhaps it would be wise to hedge your bets on the traditional banking system through building a robust DeFi portfolio.  Compound  Compound, an autonomous algorithmic protocol that allows users to supply various crypto assets and start generating interest, is another large application in the lending and borrowing category of DeFi. Its native cryptocurrency is COMP. There is currently $8.9 billion locked into Compound contracts (according to DeFi Pulse). Compound also allows its users to borrow against crypto positions such as ETH and borrow stablecoins (with interest) used for spending. This is very similar to the traditional finance concept of borrowing dollars against an appreciated security. Anyone can lock assets into the Compound protocol and immediately begin earning continuously compounding interest on their position.  Unlike traditional banks, Compound interest rates adjust automatically depending on supply and demand. When a user supplies tokens to the Compound protocol, they are credited with cTokens, representations of underlying assets that are generating interest and that are acting as collateral. Compound users are able to borrow up to 50% of their cToken value. Just like traditional financial systems, there are liquidation points on the borrowed position. Users have immediate liquidity and can withdraw their assets at any time.  Aave and flash loans  Another large lending and borrowing platform in the DeFi ecosystem is Aave. Similarly to Compound, Aave is a decentralized, open-source, non-custodial protocol running on Ethereum. Its native cryptocurrency is AAVE. There is currently $11.8 billion locked in Aave smart contracts. Aave allows users to lend or borrow crypto assets. Lenders are able to earn a yield on their assets that are supplied to the protocol. Like Compound, the earned yield adjusts depending on supply and demand of the market.  Aave also offers a unique service called “flash loans.” Flash loans are “one block borrow transactions,” which are transactions in which a user borrows and repays a loan in the same block. The smart contract only allows the loan to occur if the borrow and repayment of the loan occurs in the same block (transaction). This technology is a new feature that is used in arbitrage and quick trading. This type of loan does not exist in traditional finance and is seen as a major improvement to the TradFi system.  Flash loans enable cross-exchange arbitrage to exist in the crypto ecosystem, as detailed in this CoinDesk explainer: “Traders can make money by looking for price discrepancies across a number of different exchanges. Say two markets are pricing pizzacoin differently. It’s priced at $1 on Exchange A and $2 on Exchange B. A user can use a flash loan and call a separate smart contract to buy 100 pizzacoins for $100 at Exchange A, then sell them for $200 at Exchange B. The borrower then repays the loan and pockets the difference.” Thus, flash loans increase price stability across cryptocurrency exchanges and ultimately strengthen the crypto economy.  Decentralized exchanges  The creation of smart contracts, stablecoins and lending and borrowing platforms, led to another important creation in DeFi: decentralized exchanges (DEX), another incredibly important component of decentralized finance. DEXs saw over $1 trillion in trading volume in 2021. In my next article in this series, we will go through the creation of DEXs, their value to the crypto economy, how they interact with lending and borrowing platforms, and how users benefit from their existence.  Why DeFi is so important  The goal of DeFi is to create an open financial market that is trustless and permissionless. Significant development and investment has been placed into the advancement of DeFi, and as financial advisors, it’s important to understand this space. Much of the technology in the DeFi space builds upon, and improves, the TradFi system, possibly resulting in a better outcome for users – you and your clients. As the space continues to evolve and strengthen, it’s vitally important to have an understanding of decentralized finance and to be prepared to interact with, and rely upon, these applications.",POSITIVE,COMP | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/20/understanding-defi-and-its-importance-in-the-crypto-economy,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Cryptocurrency advocates want to talk about all the latest innovations to help people invest in tokens and put their investments to work. Data specialists want to talk about all of the new ways to capture, store, secure and use data to help businesses grow and evolve.  And wealth tech specialists throughout the advisor technology stack want to talk about their particular domain. Customer relationship management (CRM) software providers want to talk about CRM, financial planning software providers want to talk about financial planning software, and portfolio and investment providers want to talk about reporting, accounting, trading and managing client portfolios.

But what about cryptocurrencies and digital assets? What trends will we be talking about through the rest of 2022?  Perhaps the biggest trend is that more and better tools and services for financial advisors are almost sure to come online this year.  Crypto technology for advisors  “We’re starting to see the technology for digital assets come online,” said Brian McLaughlin, CEO of Redtail Technology, a popular CRM software for financial advisors. “There’s a lot of stuff coming in the financial space that will be focused on crypto, there’s been a massive shift to it. On the other hand, it’s so volatile still, and there seems to be almost no stability in crypto, and that’s kind of scary to advisors and their clients. At this point, they are still dabbling in the crypto and NFT (non-fungible token) space and trying to figure out how to provide it in a better fashion.”  Advisors’ urgency around cryptocurrency technology comes from a desire to keep clients within their ecosystem, said McLaughlin.  Until very recently, crypto assets had to be held away from advisors or in private placement vehicles like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund. (Editor’s note: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.) But in 2021, technology and services evolved to allow advisors several different options for accessing digital assets on behalf of their investors.  “Advisors want to be able to keep the client within their sphere of influence to help them see the whole picture and plan accordingly,” McLaughlin said. “The way this has worked over time in other areas is to address it with visibility and account opening capabilities first, and only then do we start looking at more value-creation opportunities. Step one is to keep the client with the advisor and not Coinbase or Crypto.com.”  How public – and client – sentiment is shifting  Public sentiment on digital assets is also shifting, said Kyle Wiggs, co-founder and CEO of UX Wealth Partners. UX’s THOR Technologies was among the first to create a digital assets product within separately managed accounts for financial advisors.  Wiggs believes that economic trends in 2022 could kindle new interest and zeal for crypto.  “When you look at studies out there, the exponential shift in mentality and acceptance for digital assets is unbelievable,” Wiggs said. “If inflation continues, if we get three rate hikes or more this year, if we continue to pump more money into the financial system, it will start to become a real thing for advisors, and if they don’t embrace it, crypto becomes a real threat to their business. Clients want exposure; if you don’t offer it in a simple and compelling way, they will take a percentage of their portfolio and go elsewhere.”  As advisors get the tools and infrastructure they need, a new cohort of sophisticated investors has been entering digital assets, a trend that Dan Eyre, CEO of BITRIA, expects to continue through 2022. BITRIA is a crypto service for financial advisors that was recently acquired by Gemini Trust.  To date, most digital asset investors were retail investors, Eyre said.  “They were the primary drivers of growth in this rapidly innovating space, and they were essentially doing micro-venture investing with tokens,” he said. “They would buy some tokens, and in doing so, they would increase the real-world usage and validity of a blockchain project. Now we’re seeing larger institutions and corporations enter the space and more awareness from regulators about exactly what’s going on.”  As a result, the investment thesis of digital assets is becoming “more coherent,” according to Eyre.  Blockchain innovations and the metaverse  Eyre is also eying innovations being driven by blockchain technology.  “It’s really leveling up the fundamental infrastructure that the world operates on, and in the process, you have a lot of centralized mechanisms being disintermediated across all of those spaces,” Eyre said. “As a result, we’re seeing new decentralized applications coming out of the woodwork and gaining more mainstream access and acceptance.”  Another application watched by Eyre is “the metaverse,” a convergence of artificial intelligence, blockchain and virtual reality technology creating a new medium for human interaction and connectivity.  The metaverse, according to Eyre, represents a step forward in the ways humans learn, store and share information potentially as profound as the advent of the internet. Yet even as the metaverse is born, many advisors are still debating whether to offer tokens like bitcoin and ethereum to their clients and wondering if cryptocurrency is right for their businesses.  “In reality, bitcoin and ethereum are just the start of a long journey,” Eyre said. “The way I like to think of this is that Web 3.0 in the advent of blockchain technology is really the start of the tokenization of everything towards much more efficient mechanisms for tracking the ownership of various assets, whether digital or physical. Tokens can be applied to just about anything, as we’re seeing from NFTs.”  Thanks to tokenization, investment opportunities that were once difficult to offer to a broad audience and that required long periods of illiquidity, such as private equity, venture capital and private real estate, can now be opened up to more investors. While the transition to tokenization will probably take time, it is already underway, and Eyre feels certain that advisors will recognize and seize the opportunity.  John Sarson, CEO of crypto asset manager and education provider Sarson Funds, believes crypto will further disrupt the payments ecosystem.  “Visa and Mastercard will continue to lose market share to crypto-based payment solutions, but the biggest impact will be felt by financial advisors in the movement away from traditional banking/wires and towards crypto centric payment solutions such as funding accounts with stablecoins and/or cryptocurrencies,” Sarson said. “Younger investors will bring an expectation for real-time transparency surrounding money movements, and savvy financial advisors would be wise to embrace cryptocurrency infrastructure to satisfy this demand.“  Marc Butler, CEO of Skience, which supplies a cloud-based platform to advisors automating client onboarding, advisor transitions, accounting and compliance tasks, believes traditional exchanges are ripe for blockchain disruption.  “It seems weird to me that in today’s day and age, where you can move money instantly across the world using digital assets, it still takes us two days to clear an equity trade,” Butler said. “I think we’re all waiting for a clearing platform built on blockchain that can clear trades instantly and with full transparency, and I think it’s coming. There’s no reason we should have to wait two days to clear a trade.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/20/what-advisors-should-watch-for-in-crypto-in-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ecdfd5649b3f546470cb978f2643d9bab7e1fab9-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Unlike most of the non-fungible tokens, the RAVE NFT collection will have real utility within the Ravendex ecosystem. For instance, holders from the collection can stake their NFTs to earn rewards in the form of $RAVE tokens. $Rave is the utility token powering the Ravendex ecosystem which has multiple utilities and use cases like staking, yield farming, governance. The token currently trades on Bitmart Exchange which pulls over $1million worth of trade volume daily. $RAVE&apos;s daily performance puts it among the leading brands on the Cardano native tokens by daily volume. In addition, users can also mint their NFTs on Cardano by simply paying just 1/4th of a dollar as gas fees. As of now, over 7% of the total NFTs have already been minted. The decentralized exchange intends to launch the Automated Market Maker (AMM) Powered DEX before the end of the second quarter of 2022.

42423859,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hV3h,1642683600,Stader Labs Raises $12M in Strategic Sale as It Builds ‘Staking as a Service’ Business,"Crypto staking platform Stader Labs announced Thursday it has closed a $12.5 million private sale led by Three Arrows Capital, valuing the Bangalore, India -based company at $450 million.  Blockchain.com, Accomplice, GoldenTree Asset Management, Accel and other investors also provided funding.  Staking is part of the consensus mechanism of proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols. Instead of relying on computers solving arbitrary mathematical problems to validate transactions on the blockchain, as is the case with proof-of-work, PoS randomly selects those that have staked large amounts of crypto to the chain to be validators.  The more staking that occurs on a chain, the more secure the network is. Those that stake their assets are paid interest, in a similar fashion to a bond.  Stader is building cross-chain modular middleware that allows users to stake their tokens, and institutions to build applications on top of Stader’s software.  An example of this could be a digital assets bank offering staking to their customers. The back end would rely on Stader’s infrastructure, similar to how companies rely on Amazon’s AWS cloud services, said Gajjala.  ""The staking market is at $250 billion currently, and will hit $400 billion to $450 billion once Ethereum moves to proof of stake,” Gajjala told CoinDesk in an interview. “It’ll be the largest segment of crypto, just like how the bond market is almost 5x the equity market.”  Gajjala said that the platform will be compatible with Ethereum when it fully transitions to PoS, which should be around the second quarter of this year. The company picked the Terra and Solana blockchains first because of their mature staking systems.  Institutional investors are said to be looking at staking as ""Internet Bonds,"" getting both the exposure to the asset class and a familiar structure.

Credit default swaps measure the cost of insuring against a country defaulting on borrowing repayments any time in a specified period.  ""Salvador's CDS is telling you a default is expected at some point,"" Charlie Morris, CIO at ByteTree Asset Management said. As of Wednesday, the nation's CDS was second highest in Latin America, behind Argentina.  While several traditional market observers were quick to call out El Salvador's supposedly utopian decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender and invest in the top cryptocurrency as the reason for the spike in the country's CDS, the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish turn also appears to have played a role.  Bitcoin's adoption as legal tender  The five-year CDS almost tripled to $1,100 from $400 after El Salvador's Bitcoin Law took effect Sept. 7, paving the way for citizens to pay taxes in bitcoin and use the cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange in a move that had drawn criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank when it was proposed.  The jump probably reflected concern that the country's negotiations with the IMF for a $1 billion loan program would founder, and priced in a greater probability of an eventual default. Since then there's been little to no progress in talks with the IMF over an $800 million debt repayment due January 2023. The bond was trading at over 78 cents on the dollar, offering a yield of over 35%.  ""What they [El Salvador] might have to worry about is whether the IMF will come with a bailout or not because of their BTC adoption,"" David Belle, founder of Macrodesiac.com and U.K. growth director at TradingView, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  Bitcoin's price slide  Since mid-November, El Salvador's five-year CDS has jumped to $1,800, while bitcoin's price has dropped nearly 40% from record highs near $69,000.  The country's credit outlook is now exposed to bitcoin's price gyrations because the nation holds more than 1,300 BTC and plans to issue a $1 billion, 10-year bitcoin bond this year. Bukele has been a consistent dip buyer over the past couple of months in a sign of confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects.  ""The government's bitcoin holdings certainly add to the risk portfolio,"" Jaime Reusche, an analyst at rating agency Moody's, told Bloomberg on Wednesday. ""Trading bitcoin is quite risky, particularly for a government that has been struggling with liquidity pressures in the past.""  According to Moody's, the value of El Salvador's bitcoin holdings has dropped some $10 million, and further purchases would amplify the risk. ByteTree's Morris foresees a further rise in the CDS if bitcoin's bear run continues, but expects little respite even if bitcoin strengthens because ""El Salvador has lost friends in the IMF.""  Demand for the bitcoin bond could be tepid if the cryptocurrency remains in the clutches of the bears. That's because the returns offered by the bond are tied to bitcoin's price.  While Blockstream sees annualized yield on the crypto bond reaching 146% in the 10th year, the performance is conditional on bitcoin rallying to $1 million in the next five years. That's an aggressive target, given it is currently trading near $41,800.  Selling ""a decent amount of bitcoin bonds could potentially help them with their liquidity pressures,"" Moody's Reusche told Bloomberg. But ""unless bitcoin bonds are very well received and oversubscribed, we are seeing that the probability of the need to restructure their traditional market bonds is increasing.""  High yields on the country's dollar-denominated debt have already closed the doors to foreign bond markets. ""Their 10-year USD bond has collapsed heavily, yielding about 40% now, which is insane for a sovereign bond,"" Macrodesiac's Belle said.  Fed tightening fears  Since November, the Fed has turned decidedly hawkish, signaling three rate hikes for 2022, an end to the asset purchase program in two months, and readiness to shrink its balance sheet. The Fed fund futures have baked in four quarterly rate hikes, and that has a knock-on effect for El Salvador.  ""CDS appears to be spiking because of higher interest rates being priced in more and more,"" Belle noted. ""We're now expecting FIVE Fed rate hikes this year.""  The debt burdens of El Salvador and other emerging nations with dollar-denominated bonds become more expensive as the Fed tightens. Thus, CDS offering insurance against potential default become costly.  Emerging markets' sensitivity to Fed tightening is also evident from the recent spike in the JPMorgan emerging market bond spread.  El Salvador's CDS has tripled, though as shown in the chart, it’s a very illiquid, hence the very spikey price action, ADMISI's Ostwald said in an email. ""As for other emerging markets, the picture is heavily divergent, depends on region, but the overall JPM EM Bond avg spread has drifted wider, mostly on the back of rising U.S. rate expectations.""

42423861,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2hV7h,1642680000,Bank of Russia Calls for Full Ban on Crypto,"Russia must ban cryptocurrencies, the country's central bank said in a report released Thursday.  The report, ""Cryptocurrencies: trends, risks, measures,"" was presented during an online press conference with Elizaveta Danilova, the director of the Bank of Russia's Financial Stability Department.  The report says cryptocurrencies are volatile and widely used in illegal activities such as fraud. By offering an outlet for people to take their money out of the national economy, they risk undermining it and making the regulator's job of maintaining optimal monetary policies harder, the report said.  The bank, therefore, said Russia needs new laws and regulations to effectively ban crypto-related activities. The bank is not suggesting banning ownership of crypto by private citizens, Danilova said.  Issuance and trading using the country's financial infrastructure, which could pose a risk to Russia's financial stability, however, should be stopped. The bank said in November that Russians conduct over $5 billion worth of crypto transactions in a year, and that level did not pose a risk. An existing ban on using crypto for payments should be reinforced, and punishment should be introduced for buying or selling goods, services and labor by Russian individuals and businesses, the report suggests.  Russian institutional investors should not be allowed to invest in crypto assets and no Russian financial organizations or infrastructure should be used for cryptocurrency transactions. The Bank of Russia has already barred mutual funds from investing in cryptocurrencies. Now, it is suggesting introducing penalties for breaking the ban.  Cryptocurrency mining, which has flourished in Russia over the past few years and even earned some nods of approval from the country's parliament last year, also came under fire.  Mining creates fresh supply of cryptocurrencies, so it stimulates the demand for other crypto services such as exchanges and ""creates a non-productive electricity expenditure, which undermines the energy supply of residential buildings, social infrastructure and industrial objects, as well as the environmental agenda of the Russian Federation,"" the report said.  The ""optimal solution"" would be to ban crypto mining in Russia, the regulator said in the report.  Miners said the stance was not a surprise. The report is a reiteration of the bank's existing position, and final policy is likely to include input from other stakeholders.  The probability of a complete ban of the entire cryptocurrency industry is ""negligible,"" said Roman Zabuga, the PR director of mining hosting provider BitRiver.  ""This is the Russian central bank reiterating their old sentiment ahead of upcoming working group formation,"" Compass Mining CEO Whit Gibbs told CoinDesk.  The crypto market also seemed unperturbed. Bitcoin was trading about $43,000 at publication time, up more than 3% since midnight UTC, according to TradingView data.  Still, if it is enacted, the ban would mark the end for big crypto businesses, especially mining farms, according to Sergey Mendeleev, executive director of a crypto investment platform InDeFi. ""I'm sure it will be more like the Chinese variant, with no options or loopholes,"" he said.  ""The consequences will be bad not for the [crypto] industry but for our future, it will be another step towards Russia lagging behind in technology even more than it is now,"" Mendeleev said. The best technology professionals and entrepreneurs would probably leave Russia alongside a big chunk of investments, he said.  The central bank plans to monitor cryptocurrency transactions by Russian residents and coordinate with the countries where cryptocurrency exchanges are registered to get information on transactions by Russian users, the report says.  The regulator said it believes that in the future, enhancing the current banking infrastructure, as well as introducing the digital ruble, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) currently in the worksby the Bank of Russia, will satisfy the need of Russians for fast and cheap digital payment options, effectively giving them advantages of crypto without crypto.  As for the investment appeal of crypto assets, that can be replaced by the digital assets, which will be issued in Russia under the law on the digital assets, in effect since the summer 2020, the Bank of Russia said.  The bank said financial market participants have until March 1 to comment on the report.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, said it's looking to improve communications with the regulator.  ""We always welcome dialogue on crypto and blockchain and we hope that the advisory report will initiate discussions between the Central Bank of Russia and representatives of the cryptocurrency market,"" the company told CoinDesk through a press representative. ""Binance goes above and beyond industry standards to detect these bad actors through proactive measures and collaboration with public and private sector stakeholders.""

Metaco has been providing the back-end crypto custody capabilities in Switzerland for banks including BBVA and GazpromBank since as far back as 2018. Since many of the world’s banks are already clients of IBM, the partnership with Metaco, announced in March of last year, makes for an even more compelling package, said Seamus Donoghue, Metaco’s VP of business development.  “Think of all the tier-one banks in the market, they’re probably all IBM clients, many of them strategic clients,” said Donoghue in an interview. “They can leverage the existing stack, existing run capabilities to manage Metaco vaults directly from existing infrastructure. And we have a number of other similar deals in the pipeline, leveraging our combined capabilities.”  IBM has traditionally been a stalwart of enterprise blockchain: private ledgers running inside the firewalls of companies involved in supply chains and the like. But Big Blue has now begun applying its key management know-how to public crypto.  This includes IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services built on IBM’s hardware security modules, according to a press release.  UnionBank, which has over $15 billion in assets under management, has been a tireless explorer of cryptocurrency initiatives including doing blockchain payments with Visa, remittances in partnership with Ethereum developer ConsenSys and even launching a stablecoin.  “We have the passion for meaningful and sustainable reinvention.
