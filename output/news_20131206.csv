42425189,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv8Xh,1386372942,"Baidu and China Telecom Stop Accepting Bitcoin, Price Slumps Again","UPDATE (7th December, 09:04 GMT):  The bitcoin price has continued to drop overnight on major bitcoin exchanges. The price on exchanges included in the Bitcoin Price Index all currently sit below $700, with the BPI overall having dropped almost 20% to $670 since close of play last night, and BTC China's price seeing a low of ¥4,003 ($658) this morning.  The price slump follows the statement from the People's Bank of China and the news that divisions of Baidu and China Telecom, two of the best known names in Chinese internet and telecommunications, removed references to bitcoin payments from their sites.  Analysis of the People’s Bank statement has been divided between optimism and pessimism, but its effect was felt on bitcoin values, which dropped from a high of $1,147 on 4th December to $834 the next day on the Bitcoin Price Index. After hovering around that mark for 24 hours or so, they dropped to a low of $670 at the time of writing.  The two big Chinese companies attracted a lot of attention in the past month when they announced they would accept bitcoin for certain products and services. In both cases, it was smaller divisions of the two companies trialling bitcoin rather than large-scale adoption, and likely done as a promotion.  But then came this week’s statements by the People’s Bank, which many say amount to the government’s official disapproval of bitcoin use. Without explicitly banning bitcoin trade, the statement which “clarifies the status of bitcoin” said all financial institutions “must not use bitcoin to set the price for products or services, not buy and sell bitcoins... and not directly or indirectly provide other bitcoin-related services including registering, trading, clearing or settlement.”  The statement applies to financial institutions. Bitcoin was a ‘virtual commodity’ that should not be referred to as a currency or virtual currency, the statement said, but added that the general public was allowed to continue trading on the internet. Bitcoin websites and other businesses were allowed to use it in daily life as long as they complied with the usual regulations.  It is not known whether the software division of Baidu (Jiasule) or China Telecom subsidiary Jiangsu Telecom, who accepted bitcoin, subsequently removed the option as a result of any official directive, or were simply playing it safe.  This week Suning Yigou, a Chinese home appliances retailer, had said it planned to introduce bitcoin services such as “storage insurance, insurance for bitcoin transactions and other insurance products,” as well as accepting bitcoin payments mining equipment and other hardware products. Whether or not these plans will be affected by events over the past couple of days remains to be seen.  ---------------------------------------------  The price of bitcoin has seen a larger than normal drop in trading prices over the past day on a number of bitcoin exchanges.  In a major sell-off that started last night, Mt. Gox, the largest US dollar bitcoin exchange, saw a low price today of $800 from a recent high of $1,230, a 35% decrease before bouncing back up a bit. Almost 52,000 bitcoins have been traded on Gox over the past 24 hours.  CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index  , which is an aggregate calculation of top exchange prices, has seen a 24-hour drop of $185 since the day's open, or 18%, at the time of writing.  The number of negative news articles being produced about bitcoin and virtual currencies in general has probably contributed to a decline in pricing over the short term.  Earlier this week, China’s central bank along with four government ministries released a statement effectively outlawing banks to use bitcoin, which could cause problems for any business that might exchange BTC for the Chinese Yuan.  And Baidu, which is considered the Google of China, had decided to halt accepting bitcoin after its Jiasule service started accepting it in October.  After the statement was released, a price drop was seen on China’s (and the world’s) largest bitcoin exchange, BTC China, where over 73,000 bitcoins have been traded in the past 24 hours.  The news cycle is clearly changing sentiment about the distributed virtual currency, raising into question why short selling is not more prevalent to provide better liquidity and less volatility.  While shorting bitcoin is technically possible, most of the largest exchanges on the market don’t allow it, leaving specialized trading arbitrators as the only providers.

42425170,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv81h,1386354415,Bank of France Warns of Bitcoin's Volatility,"French central bankers have joined their Chinese counterparts in issuing a warning against the risks of bitcoin trading.  On Thursday, France's central bank warned that the price of bitcoin is inherently volatile, and that some users may find it difficult to convert their bitcoins into real money.  Reuters reported  that the warning also addressed anonymity: the bank highlighted the fact that bitcoin's anonymous and unregulated nature made it suitable for money laundering and even sponsoring terrorism.  Risky investment?  The bank stressed that bitcoin isn't a credible investment vehicle yet, and that it does not pose a threat to financial stability, but, importantly, that it also poses a risk for those who choose to invest.  The warning echoes statements made by former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who recently told Bloomberg that bitcoin is still a risky personal investment, due to the fact that it has no intrinsic value.  The Chinese central bank issued a warning along similar lines earlier this week, citing mass speculation in bitcoin as a source of concern.  The Bank of France also raised the issue of speculation – warning that speculating on the price of bitcoin could be very costly for investors, as rampant speculation could lead to less demand and an eventual collapse.  This is a valid argument backed by many bitcoin supporters who see hoarding and speculation as the biggest threats to the development of a healthy bitcoin economy.  E-commerce  Interestingly, the bank also warned retailers and service providers that choose to accept bitcoin that they run the risk of being unable to cash in their bitcoin for real money.  This is perhaps the most interesting part of the statement, as it is direct address to the e-commerce outfits that are embracing bitcoin in ever-growing numbers.  It's interesting to note that the European Commission does not appear to have a clear stance on bitcoin.  The commission insists that all those involved in illegal activities using bitcoin should face penalties, but in essence this position is largely meaningless, as it already applies to 'regular' currency.

42425175,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv87h,1386352648,Mastercoin Foundation Lets Virtual Currencies Use Bitcoin Protocol,"The Mastercoin Foundation announced its launch earlier this week. Its development team, let by JR Willet, hope to add a programmable 'money layer' on top of bitcoin's existing block chain.  The development work will allow just about anyone to create their own virtual currencies using the existing Bitcoin protocol. In turn, this would allow new currencies to effectively 'piggyback' on bitcoin's infrastructure and economy.  It isn't a simple plan, as Mastercoin isn't just another cryptocurrency, it's a new protocol – a protocol that could change the way people feel about virtual currencies. In theory, it could allow people to devise new currencies pegged to certain commodities, other currencies or even precious metals.  Tangible assets  Since bitcoin is often criticised for not having an intrinsic value, Mastercoin could lead the way for virtual currencies backed by tangible assets.  It's an ambitious goal, but the Mastercoin Foundation has plenty of backing already. The foundation has managed to bank about $5m (or just over 4,700 BTC) since fundraising began. The initial sale was organised by David Johnston of BitAngels back in August. Ron Gross of Bitblu was named executive director of the foundation.  Mastercoin's block chain went live on 1st September and since then its overall market cap has grown to $132m, or roughly 1% of all bitcoins in circulation.  ""Bitcoin is not only proving to be a sturdy foundation to support all kinds of commercial activities, but to also support a secondary layer such as Mastercoin,"" said Willett. He said:  ""While Mastercoin is still at a high-risk stage, and we expect the usual setbacks, we are confident it will continue to grow in usefulness as we build out its service properties through the foundation. That, in turn, will also help the bitcoin ecosystem expand.""  Distributed exchange  One of the more interesting aspects of Mastercoin is the creation of a new, distributed exchange.  This exchange allows traders to deal in bitcoin through the Mastercoin layer. Since the foundation is taking an open-source approach, developers could potentially introduce new software to address specific needs of certain investors.  ""While Mastercoin itself is decentralised, the Mastercoin Foundation will be instrumental in helping to continue to make Mastercoin the conduit through which people can practically apply and use bitcoin,"" said Gross.  ""Whether it's personal money transfer, payment fulfilment, issuing user currencies and future event triggers, or simply conducting and recording bitcoin transactions, Mastercoin is the perfect operational unit, and its continued growth will proceed to drive the overall value of Bitcoin at large,"" he added.  The emphasis seems to be on more serious transactions, fulfilment and transfers, and this is understandable.  E-commerce  Bitcoin is possibly one of the best ways to transfer vast amounts of money at next-to-no cost, but many businesses simply refuse to embrace it, due to its frequent price fluctuations.  The Mastercoin layer could address this problem, at least in theory.  For example, e-commerce businesses could start using stable virtual currencies pegged to gold or a quasi-currency board in lieu of traditional transfers, thus eliminating currency issues in cross-border trading.  Mastercoin has three basic features that make it stand out. Firstly, it has a decentralised exchange that should speed up trading and simply exchanges between different currencies and Mastercoin.  It also has block chain price feeds that could be used to publish price data that can be used in virtual currencies. Lastly, it has an added layer of security, as it saves addresses and bolsters security for high-value savings accounts.

42425184,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv8Nh,1386349238,UK Tax Authority HMRC Rethinks Stance on Bitcoin,"HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC – the UK customs and tax department) has backtracked on its previous classification of bitcoin.  Last month, it was revealed that HMRC had decided to classify bitcoins as vouchers, which meant that VAT would be due on sales involving the digital currency.  Today, members of the UK bitcoin scene visited HMRC today to speak with the government department about cryptocurrency.  Tom Robinson from BitPrice, bitcoin entrepreneur Michael Parsons, Marc Warne from Bittylicious and Eitan Jankelewitz from Sheridans law firm were present at the meeting. Robinson said:  ""We started off by explaining bitcoin to them – a lot of the meeting involved educating them about bitcoin and what it's actually used for.""  He went on to say that the department, after hearing this, said it would withdraw its previous guidance about bitcoin being a type of voucher.  ""The general feeling I got from the meeting was that they don’t think VAT should be levied on the bitcoin value itself,"" Robinson added.  He described this as a really positive move as, under the current guidance, it is completely unviable for bitcoin vendors and exchanges to sell bitcoins in the UK.  Jankelewitz told CoinDesk the previous ruling caused ""no small amount of concern"" to a number of his clients, which are UK-based bitcoin companies.  ""The implication of a classification as a single use voucher is that anyone selling bitcoins would have to charge an additional 20% to cover the VAT. Obviously, this puts bitcoin businesses at a huge disadvantage,"" he said.  In the meeting, Warne added that he had been considering moving his company offshore because of HMRC's classification of bitcoin.  Jankelewitz said he hopes to hear more from the department in the next few weeks.  ""I found HMRC to be pretty open minded and I was left with the impression that they are taking bitcoin seriously,"" he concluded.

42425181,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv8Lh,1386347453,"Questions for Cash, Chains of Command, and with this Coin, I Thee Rob","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 6th December 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.    Fair exchange?  Bitcoin in its present form has a number of weak points, but the most notorious – and weakest – is the exchange mechanism that converts bitcoin into real-world currencies. Like the transporter system on the Starship Enterprise, you’re not always guaranteed to get out what you put in, arrive where you expected, or even get through at all.  This is partly due to the uncertain and frequently hostile regulatory environment of the existing cash control networks. This environment makes it hard to run an exchange which has normal bank accounts and legal safeguards in all the markets where you’d like to exchange your bitcoin.  This is also due to the currency's 'frontier' nature: a great deal of its attraction lies in its extra-legal aura. However, the exchanges themselves do not always avoid the same shimmery vagueness.    This week’s worry is BTC-e, Europe's second-biggest exchange, which is seeing a lot of consumer dissatisfaction because, well, their money isn’t turning up.      Fierce debate continues over where exactly the problems lie on the spectrum of overloaded systems through to out-and-out mobsterism. BTC-e isn’t helping matters by not having a bank account, not answering questions and not revealing who’s behind it.      If you don’t plan to turn your bitcoin into fiat cash - the part of the translation that always seems to cause the most problems - then you needn’t worry: if you’re holding it for fun or if you’re using it to buy stuff from bitcoin enabled retailers, then none of this is your problem.      However, if you do need to see the hard stuff, then for your future happiness,you may wish to apply some simple tests to anywhere you’re planning to send large amounts of money. Who are they, what are they going to do with your money, when will they do it, and what do you plan to do if they don’t? Failure to get a decent answer to any of those questions and just remember there’s a reason Kirk always took a phaser and two redshirts into the transporter booth with him before energising.      But, alas, such questions don’t always help. John Law remembers one online discussion he was part of a few years back, where a blatant too-good-to-be-true online deal was being offered on some particularly desirable mobile phones. The website owners didn’t check out, the contact details weren’t valid, the company was unknown and the prices were so far below wholesale that even if the goods were actually as offered, they had to be hooky. John Law and others searched out and provided all this information, and presented absolute cast-iron reasons why none of this could be remotely true.      “Yes,” said one online denizen. “I know. But I’m going to send them my money anyway. It might be true, and if it is - wow, what a deal!”      There's only so much you can do to keep the redshirts away from the Klingons.      Block-buster    A typically balanced piece by the Economist on bitcoin canters calmly over familiar territory - is bitcoin safe, does the maths work, is there a bubble, and so on. But it also raises two questions connected with mining, one also familiar – but one less so, and worth a good look. The familiar one is that the arms race among miners is making it impossible to invest the time, energy or custom hardware costs to see a decent return; for now, the bubble-icious nature of the beast is keeping people keen. But that’s not guaranteed.      The less familiar, and more intriguing, question is about the block chain. It records all transactions, which is dandy, but as bitcoin gets more popular the block chain grows like Topsy. Currently at 11GB, this is now a seriously large chunk of data to move about the place – and it does have to move about, as multiple nodes have to keep copies to keep things verified. Yet there’s no obvious motivation or reward to node owners to participate; miners, yes, but as noted that’s not guaranteed to remain a widespread activity.      The Economist notes that a number of proposed fixes are in the works – so nodes could be paid a tiny fraction of each transaction – and that the protocol now has a track record of successfully overcoming problems. But it frets, as only the Economist can, that it’s all a bit fragile and run by people who can’t control it.      John Law cannot predict the future. But he does remember the past: in particular, the past evolution of the Internet. As he has repeatedly noted, many of the same issues now confronting bitcoin were previously raised as serious reasons why the Internet itself would fail. Nobody controlled it. It didn’t have the capacity to carry huge amounts of data – for graphics, say, or audio, or even (as some visionaries recklessly claimed) video. It couldn’t cope with the huge numbers – some thought there might be millions – of users if it was opened up to the general public, and the economics just couldn’t work.      As you will have noticed, none of this actually broke the Internet. Threats do remain, but they aren’t technological – they’re more along the lines of corporations and governments trying to balkanise the Internet for reasons of control and profit, and trust being lost due to spooks and crooks mucking about where they’re not welcome. Expect the same basic class of threat to be the biggest real issues bitcoin – or bitcoin-like systems – face, and expect them to be fiercely resisted, much as the elder tribes of the Internet are even now marshalling their forces to make the place secure, private and impossible to traduce.    Broken hearts, broken banks  In this wicked world, money and sin are often found in bed together. And thus the question arises: is bitcoin a sensible place to hide assets from the law – especially when one is preparing to divorce the other half while keeping rather more than your half of the marital assets.    The question has been answered: no, not really. Hiding stuff from courts is all perjury-fraudery jaily-waily, and you’ll have to answer embarrassing questions about where it’s all gone no matter how you’ve tried to disguise your intentions.      John Law would put bitcoin quite a long way down the list of portable high-value disguises for cash, independent of whom you are trying to hide it from. Traditional and more congenial alternatives include diamonds, gold and art – the latter especially tempting at the moment – provided you always establish a conduit in good time into which regular, large sums of cash can vanish in an untraceable way. Get known as a bon viveur with a taste for expensive booze and slow horses. (The real specialists appear to sink so much money into these and other reprehensible hobbies that their spouses divorce them for recklessness, which makes it twice as hard to argue that the dosh still exists somewhere.)    For those with stronger nerves, however, bitcoin does offer an intriguing possibility: you could short yourself. The principle’s simple. Openly buy a bunch of bitcoin. Immediately sell them, and stick the resultant cash in a sock somewhere. Then, when bitcoin crashes, buy back the number you first thought of. You still have a fully-stocked wallet when the lawyers come knocking, but your real stash will be silently waiting for you after the dust dies down.    Of course, if you get your timing wrong or bitcoin never crashes you’ll end up with an empty wallet and no way to buy back enough bitcoin to replenish it. In that case, you can sadly reveal you bottled out early, and cough up. And if you have no fraudulent intent - you’re planning a nice surprise for your golden wedding anniversary - then sell high, buy low is a perfectly respectable investment strategy.      John Law earnestly recommends you do none of the above, and conduct both fiscal and marital matters with utmost probity. Personally, he has his hands entirely full doing just that without introducing any complications to do with bitcoin, perjury and general dodginess, and can assure all concerned that any cash that appears to vanish in large quantities into the bank accounts of the wine merchants of Soho is doing precisely that.

42425176,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv8Bh,1386345606,Core Developer to Launch Bitcoin Node in Space,"Bitcoin has already spread rapidly across the globe, but now one of the currency's core developers wants to take it where no virtual currency has gone before – space.  Developer Jeff Garzik plans to launch several tiny satellites into space which will serve as a node on the bitcoin network.  Historically, it has cost tens or hundreds of millions to launch satellites into space, but a new generation of privately-funded, bootstrapped satellite services has changed all that.  Cubesats  Garzik’s project involves building ‘cubesats’, which are standard, small-sized satellites, typically measuring 10cm on all sides. These satellites can be launched into space cheaply by piggybacking on other payloads.  Garzik estimates that it would cost just $2m to get one into orbit. Once in space, it would serve as an alternative way to distribute block chain data. “Information wants to be free,” Garzik said in his post about the project.  But can’t it be free on the ground? The Internet already does a pretty good job of letting around 5,000 bitcoin nodes distribute information. It was built to route itself around damage, and we rely heavily on it.  If the Internet ever failed, we’d presumably be too busy trading chickens to worry about whether we could confirm cryptocurrency transactions.  Beating Sybil attacks in space  Garzik explained that a bitcoin node depends on other nodes for its view of the network, he said:  “It is not an ‘internet-melts-down’ scenario, but a more limited ‘thousands-of-nodes-attacked-at-once’ scenario that happens on a daily basis on the Internet.”  One such attack, named a Sybil attack, focuses on peer-to-peer networks like bitcoin. In an attack like this, malicious nodes surround a victim node and pass it false information.  “Bitcoin nodes are ultimately at the mercy of the data they receive from outsiders,” Garzik says.  “All it takes is one honest source of block chain data to defeat a Sybil attack and similar attacks. Eventually, the honest block chain with the largest proof-of-work will win the day.”  That honest source would be in orbit, and it’s better to put it up there because satellites are great at one-to-many communications. It could beam blockchain information to any node that wanted to communicate with it.  The bandwidth required for this satellite wouldn’t be huge, 1MB per minute should do it.  The cubesat would get its data from multiple groundstations, which would act as normal peer-to-peer nodes, but would verify that the block chain information was correct before transmitting it.  That data would initially be the latest bitcoin block, which the satellite would broadcast repeatedly. In the future, it would broadcast recent chains and transactions.  To boldly go  Garzik has two mission profiles for his satellites. One will involve between four and six of these devices, with which he believes he can get full earth coverage (or at least major continents).  The second would see a single satellite go up. He’s hoping that the satellite(s) would help to serve bitcoin users in remote areas where traditional connectivity is patchy.  Even if the full network didn’t deploy, bitcoin users would at least be able to access stellar block chain data for a small amount of time each day, and this would still carry significant value, he says.  “Any bitcoin participant on the ground can still have significant value from reading even 25% of the satellite broadcast,” Garzik reasons.  “The point is to discover ‘honest’ blocks with valid proof of work. The network is self-correcting, even given a reduced trickle of valid blocks.”  Multiple phases  There are multiple phases to Garzik’s project.  Phase one will see the creation of a team – which will flesh-out the cubesat specifications, price-out leased bandwidth, and workout specific data needs. Phase two will see the build and launch of the first satellite.  The money for the second phase isn’t coming through the block chain just yet. Garzik posted about the project on 15th November, announcing a donation address and two sponsors: himself and Bitcoingrant.org. At the time of writing, the wallet address was yet to receive more donations.  Nevertheless, there is sufficient interest to get the project moving. Garzik says:  “Fundraising has not begun in earnest, though donations are solicited now, because BitcoinGrant.org and my funds should suffice to complete phase one.”  He hopes to have a demonstration satellite in orbit by 2016-18. “Additional interest and funding will dictate how large the network may grow,” he added.  He claims to have verbal commitments for full cubesat construction in phase two, and says that these commitments also cover around 25% of the launch's costs.

42425174,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv85h,1386337837,Bitcoin Awareness Grows in South Korea After Central Bank U-turn,"Asia's reputation as an international hotspot for bitcoin news is growing.  While China's central bank caused a major stir with yesterday's statement on digital currencies, South Korea’s central bank, the Bank of Korea (BOK), this week provided statements of caution and optimism.  The BOK released a report on bitcoin on 3rd December, according to BusinessKorea, which pondered the measures required to “open the virtual currency to the public”. It may not sound like much, but the BOK had previously ruled out any possibility that bitcoin could become a regular currency.  However, this report did counter this idea with a more pessimistic view of bitcoin's ability to go mainstream.  In the complex and multi-faceted world of government, any sign of leeway on digital currencies is more welcome than a rush to block or ban them outright.  Bitcoin's usefulness  In Korea, as with several other countries, it may be up to the business community and general public to demonstrate bitcoin’s usefulness first. BusinessKorea reported bakery chain Paris Baguette's recent move to become the first physical store in the country to accept bitcoin.  Similar to neighbouring Japan, none of the world’s major payment processors work smoothly with Korean bank accounts and there are no local competitors.  The owner of the Paris Baguette bakery in Incheon City, Lee Jong-soo, is using a smartphone-based payment app developed by his son Lee Jin-woo. He says he became interested in bitcoin after an introduction from his other son, Lee Chan-woo, who had studied finance in the US.  Apparently only a handful of customers have asked to pay with bitcoin since he set up the system, indicating the bitcoin community will need to engage in more promotional activity to help him spread the word.  Local traders  Often, though, it’s cutting-edge local traders like Lee who communicate most effectively by demonstrating a daily use case to other curious businesses. Additionally, it's small businesses who feel the pinch of bank processing fees and credit card chargebacks hardest.  Kevin Lee is a Seoul-based bitcoin entrepreneur and CEO of BitcoinKorea, South Korea’s first bitcoin business and portal. He has traveled around Asia attending bitcoin-related conferences and meetups, and wants to be instrumental in promoting its use in his native land.  He thinks South Korea’s need for digital currency options are similar to China’s: a way to diversify investments and find a way around capital controls. He explained:  “Most Koreans are interested in bitcoin for investment purposes. They do not care about the central bank of Korea's policy. The Korean government will follow the international trend of bitcoin.”  “The Korean government is strict on sending dollars from the country, since Korea is always short of dollars,” Lee added.  Lee, a friend of Asia-based bitcoin missionary Roger Ver, said the pair will tour South Korea from 8th to 23rd January to spread the word – talking to major news organisations and helping to introduce Kraken, an exchange that launched in the country just last Friday.  KRW Exchanges  Kraken has Korean as a language option and allows deposits and withdrawals in South Korea's local currency, won (KRW). It is open to users both inside and outside South Korea.  With Kraken’s launch there are now four bitcoin exchanges in Korea, the others being: Korbit, BitUP and ddengle. Lee reveals that more will be coming soon.  Ddengle is also South Korea’s primary bitcoin user forum, with about 7,800 visitors per day. The platform has plans to introduce litecoin trading in future.  Bitcoin’s price in KRW was generally higher than the rest of the world, Lee added, presenting an arbitrage opportunity for anyone with using Korean exchanges.

Back in November, the Cypriot university announced it would accept the cryptocurrency for tuition and fee payments, becoming the world’s first accredited university to do so.  By late November the university had received a payment from Francois Rossouw, a South African student. Rossouw paid 1 BTC towards tuition for an online Master of Business Administration degree, so he could be on his way to receive the first bitcoin-funded MBA. He said:  “I am honoured to be a part of this historical occasion. Being able to pay for a world-class tertiary education with bitcoin was a dream of many, but few believed that it would become a reality so soon.”  “I am not surprised that it was the University of Nicosia, with their history of trendsetting and innovation, who took the first step. I commend them on breaking the shackles of traditional payment barriers,” Rossouw added.  Africa's influence  Dr Christos Vlachos, member of the Council of the University of Nicosia and the University’s Chief Financial Officer, said the university expected initial adoption to come from students attending online degree programmes from countries in Africa.  “In some countries, international payments are extremely cumbersome and given that certain students pay on a monthly instalment plan, transmission fees end up reaching 5 – 10% of their payments, and are highly inconvenient,” said Vlachos. He added:  “The intention of this initiative is to ease transmission difficulties and to build our own practical knowledge about this field.”  However, accepting bitcoin tuition payments is just one part of the story. The university is also launching the first Master of Science degree programme in digital currency next spring.  It's even more ambitious than it seems, as the university plans to bring the government on board to initiate a “comprehensive framework for developing Cyprus into a hub for bitcoin trading, processing and banking”.  Banking hub  Cyprus is already a major regional banking hub, thanks to its liberal legislative framework.  Although some term it the 'Switzerland of the Mediterranean', the Cypriot banking sector is not as healthy as its Swiss counterpart. Cyprus has a huge off-shore banking industry coupled with a relatively small domestic economy. The disparity indirectly precipitated the country's financial crisis last year.  Additionally, Cyprus has a reputation as a safe haven for Eastern European oligarchs and their hard-earned savings.  Its reputation as a tax haven for wealthy Russian depositors was shaken following the 2013 EU/IMF bailout, which also resulted in a one-off levy of up to 9.9% on deposits over €100,000.  In theory, Bitcoin could help the country’s banking sector gain a competitive edge once again.
