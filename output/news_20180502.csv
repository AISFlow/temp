Martina Hund-Mejean said that the company's cross-border payments volume rose 19 percent during the first part of 2018 overall – however, that volume was down 2 percent when compared to the last quarter of 2017 ""in part due to the drop [in] crypto wallet funding,"" she said, according to an earnings call transcript published by Seeking Alpha.  She explained:  ""So the issue in this, first of all, in terms of the stacks, on the cross-border volume growth, the cryptocurrency funding or the crypto wallet funding really was 1 percent. It was 1 percent that we saw in the fourth quarter and it was 1 percent that we saw in the first quarter. What the issue is that a number of the banks have decided, in particular in the United States, that they would not allow the usage of cards for this particular funding vehicle. And that's why we have already seen a relatively significant decrease of the volume related to that event.""  Over the last several months, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Bank of Montreal, Capital One and Citi from the U.S. and Canada were among a group of banks to bar cryptocurrency purchases due to the supposed credit risk that results from their price volatility.  Furthermore, new restrictions and uncertainty around exchanges have also helped lead to the decline in volume, said chief executive officer Ajay Banga.  Falling interest levels have also not helped, he continued, saying ""right now there's a little less interest than there was in the latter part of the fourth quarter and the first quarter.""  That being said, Mastercard is not interested in counting cryptocurrencies as part of its earnings projections, Banga said, explaining:  ""We actually said that this is not something we count on because we just don't know how to predict it or we don't even want to count it.""

""We applaud the [Office of the Attorney General] for taking action to bring further transparency to the virtual currency markets,"" Coinbase's chief legal and risk officer Mike Lempres wrote in a five-page letter.  Schneiderman's office launched a ""fact-finding inquiry"" into cryptocurrency exchanges in April, sending a detailed questionnaire to 13 firms, including Coinbase. The inquiry seeks a wide range of information about exchanges' operations, their leadership, funding, terms of service, privacy protocols, relationships with other financial institutions and use of trading ""bots.""  In the public version of Coinbase's reply, Lempres addresses the assets kept on Coinbase's platform ($150 billion in total), the firm's funding ($225 million to date), its financial position (""a profitable and self-sustaining business""), and its personnel levels (over 300 employees, 1,000 total when you factor in contractors).  The letter describes Coinbase's cooperation with law enforcement and regulatory agencies across the globe, its ""state of the art"" cybersecurity program, and its recent systems upgrades, which Lempres says enabled the platform to achieve 99.99% uptime in April.  It also says Coinbase is a federally regulated money service business and has been granted licenses by regulatory authorities in 31 states, including New York's BitLicense. The letter notes that this controversial license involves ""considerable regulatory oversight.""  Yet Coinbase's full response to Schneiderman's request will likely remain out of the public eye, per a request from the startup.  Lempres asked for ""confidential treatment"" for the full response, which the exchange is transmitting ""via an encrypted end-to-end secure file exchange service consistent with our security protocol.""  Rachael Horowitz, Coinbase's vice president of communications, later told CoinDesk via email:  ""That full response has a bunch of highly confidential information that we are unable to share publicly. Our aim is to be as transparent as we can in responding to this action publicly so we shared the cover letter.""  Most exchanges  CoinDesk contacted welcomed the New York Attorney General's inquiry, but Kraken, an exchange that left New York due to the BitLicense, pointedly refused to cooperate.

On Wednesday, Financial News reported that three members of BlackRock's institutional clients team in London have jumped ship in order to launch their own fund, Eterna Capital. The fund will focus exclusively on blockchain-based solutions and derive its inspiration from the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.  Eterna aims to raise €20 million and will be led by Andrea Bonaceto, who founded HiredGrad in 2014 after earning a finance degree at Imperial College London. The other three founding partners all come from BlackRock: Nassim Olive will serve as chief economist and COO, Asim Ahmad as head of portfolio management, and Mattia Mrvosevic as head of research.  Ahmad explained the decision to leave BlackRock and start a blockchain-focused fund in an interview on Skype, telling CoinDesk:  ""BlackRock, they pay well, it's a great place to learn … [but] the opportunity is just too big to miss.""  That kind of thinking appears to be gaining traction on Wall Street and in the City of London, where people are leaving traditional finance to join or launch ventures focused on cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology.

The extension also has the ability to hijack cryptocurrency transactions on a variety of major exchanges including Poloniex, HitBTC, Bitfinex, Ethfinex, Binance in addition to Blockchain's (previously Blockchain.info) crypto wallet, according to Trend Micro.  First exposed in August 2017, the malware initially used Facebook Messenger to send malicious links that, when clicked on, provided the attacker with access to users' Facebook accounts while also infecting their operating systems. FacexWorm resurfaced in early April of this year.  Trend Micro said it had discovered one affected bitcoin transaction, but it has not identified the value of the plunder garnered from the crypto mining.  The company reported that Chrome removed many of the FacexWorm extensions prior to Trend Micro's discovery and that Facebook Messenger is also capable of detecting and blocking the insidious links the malware uses.

The court’s ruling on April 30 was with respect to jurisdiction. We will be submitting a new motion and are confident we will be able to put an end to this willful, concerted and unlawful scheme by the ABBC Foundation to exploit Alibaba Group trademarks.""      U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken rejected digital retail giant Alibaba's trademark lawsuit against the Alibabacoin Foundation at the end of April, court filings show.  Alibaba failed to show that the District Court from the Southern District of New York has jurisdiction over the Alibabacoin Foundation, according to the ruling. The company first brought the suit early in April when it alleged that Alibabacoin was trying to mislead investors by implying that Alibaba was involved in the project somehow.  The foundation is based in the Cayman Islands, and while its website is accessible in New York state, that alone is insufficient to prove ""personal jurisdiction.""  ""Alibaba fails to cite a single case in which a court has concluded that an agreement with a third-party web-hosting company in New York bears an articulable nexus to a trademark infringement claim involving a website,"" Oetken wrote.  The judge goes on to explain that Alibaba has not shown that any U.S.-based individual maintains the foundation's website, which would be needed for a jurisdiction argument.  The judge further points out that some of Alibaba's arguments would apply to securities cases, but not to a trademark suit. He also noted:  ""Alibaba has failed to identify a specific economic injury in New York ... nor has it alleged the existence of a New York market in which it lost actual or potential customers to Alibabacoin. To the contrary, Alibaba expressly disclaims any intention to enter the cryptocurrency market, in New York or anywhere else.""  He continued, saying ""without allegations of specific, non-speculative harm in the form of actual or potential injury in a New York market for it sservices. Alibaba cannot estalbish a New York-based injury under an economic tort theory.  He concluded by releasing the temporary restraining order by Alibaba against Alibabacaoin was dissolved.  ""Alibaba has not met its burden to establish a reasonable probability that the Court has personal jurisdiction over Alibabacoin,"" the judge wrote.

42429032,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrE1h,1525280709,"EOS, TRX, ADA: April's Crypto Winners Saw Over 100% Gains","Alternative cryptocurrencies shone brightly in April, as the markets regained poise following a miserable first quarter.  In a sign of that recovery, the value of the total crypto market increased by 63 percent to $431 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, and as the final tallies prove, there were gains to be had for savvy traders willing to shoulder the risk.  While bitcoin appreciated by 32 percent, the bitcoin dominance rate, which tracks the largest cryptocurrency's share of the total market, fell from 45 percent to 36.9 percent.  Still, big-name coins like ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and litecoin (LTC) more or less flatlined, indicating money was likely rotated out of large-cap cryptocurrencies and into shallower markets.  And as the data shows, some coins with smaller market caps saw big benefits from the decline.  Monthly top performers  EOS  Monthly performance: +193 percent  All-time high: $22.89  Opening price on April 1: $6.00  Closing price on April 30: $17.58  Current market price: $17.58  Rank as per market capitalization: 5  EOS almost scored a double century in April, rising to a new all-time high of $22.89 on April 29, beating the previous record of $18.67 set on Jan. 13. Daily trading volume also surged 915 percent month-on-month in April, adding credence to the rally in prices.  The cryptocurrency gave all the right signals in April. Prices rallied sharply in the run-up to April 15 and remained bid through the month, possibly due to significant interest within the investor community about the platform's expected mainnnet launch.  Further, the Block.one joint venture and the talk of listing on Upbit – one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, may have added to the positive sentiment.  TRON  Monthly performance: +176 percent  All-time high: $0.30  Opening price on April 1: $0.033955  Closing price on April 30: $0.093777  Current market price: $0.090563  Rank as per market capitalization: 9  Tron's (TRX) near 90-degree rally in April could be associated with the increased interest in the investor community about a coming blockchain upgrade, one that could see Tron finally migrate from ethereum to the long-awaited TRX mainnet.  Tron founder Justin Sun believes TRX will pose a serious threat to larger, more established blockchains, though investors stand divided on the issue. Nevertheless, the mainnet launch seemed to have put a bid under TRX last month.  Additionally, on April 21, Tron representatives announced a 30 million TRX airdrop to the ethereum community, although it is not clear if the news pushed up TRX prices.  As of writing, TRX is changing hands at $0.09 on Bitnance. The token may remain better bid in May, courtesy of the bullish breakout seen in the technical chart below.  Cardano  Monthly performance: +126 percent  All-time high: $1.33  Opening price on April 1: $0.15  Closing price on April 30: $0.34  Current market price: $0.369254  Rank as per market capitalization: 6  Cardano (ADA) picked up bids in early April, tracking the broader market recovery and outperforming most of its peers.  While the reasons for smaller crypto market increases might always be somewhat elusive, the coin saw a notable profile boost courtesy of its listing on Houbi – one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges – and a notable nod from CNBC, which highlighted the coin for investment.  Further, cryptocurrency exchange Binance added cardano-binance coin (ADA/BNB) and cardano-tether (ADA/USDT) trading pairs on April 19.

42429029,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrDxh,1525266043,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Is Back – And It's Got a Roadmap to Prove It,"Since its formation nearly a year and a half ago, it's safe to say that the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has been quiet.  Apart from a steady stream of new members, there has been a lull of live projects, one that has led some to theorize the consortium might not deliver on standards for enterprise use of the world's second-largest blockchain. In a Medium post last month, for instance, the CTO of competing DLT consortium, R3, even went so far as to stake such a claim, contending that the lack of progress proves ethereum is unsuitable for enterprise.  But if competitors were eager to send the EEA to an early grave, Wednesday might mark the consortium's rise from the dead, as the company has revealed the release of a new guide outlining its open standards work.  While this is just the first step in making public work that could make enterprise blockchains based on ethereum interoperate with each other, it comes as businesses are broadly beginning to acknowledge it's time to move any proofs-of-concept toward viable blockchain products.  Case in point, the consortium itself has swelled to more than 500 firms – ranging from global banks such as BBVA, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan to blockchain startups and traditional tech providers like Microsoft.  Yet, Ron Resnick, the EEA's first executive director who was hired in January, used this diverse membership to argue that reaching a standards reference model in a year and a half is comparatively fast going.  As the former president of WiMAX Forum, which was created to promote interoperability between the wireless communication standards developed by the IEEE Standards Association, Resnick has been through the gamut when it comes to standards in the telco space.  He told CoinDesk:  “If you look at other standards bodies it can take about three years. In fact, at the IEEE you get four years to deliver something.”  Plus, he continued, standards developing is a slow and methodical process (one that many crypto entrepreneurs, who are used to the fast pace of the industry's permissionless innovation, have shied away from).  But it's one, that if done right, will offer plenty of benefits.  “All the ethereum client companies see the need to agree on these building blocks and components and how they talk to each other, because if we don't, then we don't have a way to compete against the proprietary solutions,"" Resnik said.  Milestone ahead  Still, the EEA is “working aggressively” to deliver on its roadmap, with the whole process coming to fruition before the year's end, Resnick said.  As a first step, the architecture stack EEA has published comprises five layers. From the bottom up, there’s the base-level peer-to-peer network protocol layer, and on top of that is the core blockchain layer, which organizes consensus, transaction execution and data storage (on-chain and off-chain).  Sitting on top of that is a layer devoted to privacy and scaling, again in an on-chain versus off-chain capacity. Then a tooling layer handles things like permissioning credentials and how oracles interact; topmost is the application layer.  Today's publication of the enterprise ethereum architecture stack will be followed “very shortly” by the spec, Resnick said. That, in turn, will be followed by a testnet and after that comes the establishment of a certification program.  But enterprises also seem interested in using public blockchains, so the EEA is making sure a general confluence happens between the public ethereum network and the private enterprise blockchain work.  “They have seen our stack, they know what's needed for enterprise,"" he said. ""As this grows, even if it's a private network, that network can actually connect to the [public ethereum] mainnet – which a lot of folks want to do.""  Referring to specific use cases such as clearing and settlement in financial services, Resnick said the foundation recognizes the needs of enterprises and will implement and deliver work contributed by members.  And the consortium hopes to return the favor. At a recent talk at London’s Blockchain Expo, EEA founding board member Jeremy Millar said it's likely some EEA features will be taken back into the code for the public ethereum blockchain in the form of ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs).  Privacy challenge  Still, a key challenge for EEA is the fact that ethereum was designed for public use, and so fully broadcasts transactions to all nodes in the blockchain. This means the tech has to be modified for much of the privacy-centric enterprise world – as opposed to custom-built DLTs like Corda or Fabric.  This was one of the main reasons R3’s Brown claimed ethereum and enterprises can’t mix.  “Ethereum works on the basis of sharing all data with all parties,” he wrote, calling a public network the “wrong architecture for business.”  And Resnick acknowledged that “the biggest debate I’ve seen internally” within the EEA has been about how to deal with privacy. Discussions are ongoing about how much data needs to be communicated in particular cases and the extent to which privacy will be mandated, he said.  What's more, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which aims to give better control to EU residents over their personal data and so limits what businesses can do with that data, further complicates matters.  “I suspect that you are going to see multiple flavors of how privacy is implemented,"" Resnick said. ""I don't think that's a problem. But I think it's still open-ended and not crystal clear, even by the regulators, with things like GDPR is just coming out.""  To address the problem, the EEA architecture stack’s privacy layer will manage mechanisms to choose which data can be broadcast to the chain and which transactions can take place within a trusted execution environment.  “There are different ways you can do it: is it going to be on the mainnet, is it going to be in off-chain – or a combination of both?” said Resnick. “How much data are we going to share and will have visibility, even if it's encrypted?”  On the subject of privacy, JPMorgan Chase’s Quorum, which was last year described as the jewel in the EEA crown, blazed something of a trail by incorporating zero-knowledge proofs into its banking blockchain design. Now the word on the street is that Quorum may be spun out of JPM, and its blockchain lead Amber Baldet has since left the bank to join a yet-to-named startup.  However, Resnick confirmed that technology developed by the team behind zcash will continue to play a part in what the EEA is doing and that JPM is actively engaged in the stack.  But he was quick to add there is no favoritism in the EEA.  “I can tell you that in my world every member gets treated equally. We treat JP Morgan's Quorum as equal to BlockApps and Clearmatics etc,” Resnick said, concluding:  “If members are not working, I’ll call them up and give them a hard time. If you don't participate here, then when the spec is published and if it doesn't have what you want in it, don't blame us.”  Maze image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/02/enterprise-ethereum-alliance-is-back-and-its-got-a-roadmap-to-prove-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3eeb47c6527071322a588af8c1a42dd874ad0d92-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42429031,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrDrh,1525260020,"BMW, Ford, GM: World's Largest Automakers Form Blockchain Coalition","Four of the world’s largest carmakers have joined tech providers and startups to form the biggest-ever consortium focused on applying blockchain tech in the automotive sector.  Announced Tuesday, the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) has revealed founding members including BMW, Ford, General Motors and Renault. Also present among the ranks are the car-parts manufacturers Bosch and ZF as well as major companies (Accenture, IBM) and blockchain industry groups (Consensys, Hyperledger).  As such, while there have been a number of proofs-of-concept in the sector of late (last year, IBM and ZF tested a crypto car wallet), the consortium perhaps distinguishes itself through its broad representation, as well as the participation from groups backing both private and public blockchain systems.  Rather than push a particular type of distributed ledger, MOBI aims to create common standards and APIs to enable payments and data-sharing between cars – all in service of driving forward a new digital mobility ecosystem, from ride-sharing to self-driving vehicles and everything in between.  Chris Ballinger, the chairman and CEO of MOBI, said that in his previous job at Toyota Research Institute he realized the need for a consortium after conducting several blockchain proofs-of-concept with startups.  What is required to move those forward, he said, is a decentralized business network.  “You really have to have common standards and common ways for cars to communicate, to identify themselves and make payments,” Ballinger told CoinDesk, adding:  “But if each auto company is trying to develop its own car wallets or its own way of paying tolls, or providing a ride sharing service, it just doesn't work; it's the Tower of Babel.”  And while he started a fledgling consortium during his time at Toyota, Ballinger's company was the only automaker on board with the idea. Still, it's a concept that seems to have gained some steam with MOBI coming out of the gate with members that account for 70 percent of global car production, along with 30 other partners.  Dan Harple, the CEO of Context Labs, who is working closely with Ballinger, said the new consortium's first step will be to establish a ""minimum viable ecosystem"" for gaining network effect.  The work will kick off with in-person member meetings to form project teams for areas such as vehicle identity and data tracking; ride sharing; mobility ecosystem commerce; and data markets for autonomous and human driving.  Internet's original sin  All told, the MOBI consortium is perhaps the auto industry's first coordinated response to the realization that data produced around cars is a valuable resource and that blockchain could help the automotive industry itself keep control of and manage this data.  Stepping back, the fact that data lacks good property rights means it ends up in data silos of big tech companies which become quasi-monopolies and then just get bigger and bigger – what MIT’s Michael J. Casey (a CoinDesk columnist) refers to as ""the Original Sin of the internet.""  But while the car is the next data battlefield that Apple, Google and Amazon are fighting over tooth-and-nail, MOBI sees blockchains offering a powerful tool for decentralization. Moreover, that data, once it is shared, can conceivably deliver benefits to society, such as improving road safety and reducing congestion.  “Everybody wants that data. Apple has their car play, Amazon is putting Alexa in the car, Microsoft Azure has their car system, Google's got theirs,"" Ballinger told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The car is the fourth screen and the next big data battleground. It’s a trillion-dollar prize.""  As such, Ballinger anticipates many data opportunities going forward.  One is the data generated inside the car: the average commuter spends a couple of hours a day in their car, and increasingly they're using the internet during that time – for instance, asking virtual assistants for directions.  “The opportunity here is if you can create property rights, then that data can eventually become self-sovereign and owned by whoever generates it – whether that's an individual owner, a fleet operator, a city government perhaps operating traffic lights, whatever,"" Ballinger said.  Sensor data explosion  Another type of data that MOBI hopes to harness using distributed ledger tech is much more up for grabs.  That's the data generated by the car itself via the multitude of sensors positioned within and around it. Connected cars today are producing about 25 gigabytes of data an hour and that figure is expected to increase by orders of magnitude in a future with vehicles (manual or autonomous) that have remote sensing methods like light detection and ranging (LIDAR).  “With these kinds of rich sensors, the cars will be producing massive amounts of data that probably not even 5G networks can handle,” Ballinger said. “Imagine real-time mapping in such detail that you could deliver a package with a robot to a door of somebody's apartment or house.”  Added to that could be real-time weather sensors, cars that are negotiating rights of way with other cars, cars negotiating carbon pricing and pollution and the energy they use and so on, he continued.  All these data points, if managed and used correctly, could make being on the road much safer too.  While the likes of Google and Tesla are way ahead in terms of collecting self-driving car data, Ballinger believes it's still going to take a half a trillion miles to develop cars that are really safe and can handle all the real-world driving situations, such as driving through cities in bumper-to-bumper traffic or navigating the highway in torrential downpours.  Yet, blockchain-based systems will help here as well.  While at Toyota, Ballinger took part in a proof-of-concept involving startup BigChainDB which used a blockchain to create property rights for data so it could be shared among car makers, which could then use it to train machine-learning algorithms. According to Ballinger, sharing this data is the only way we speed up the process of getting safe, self-driving cars on the road.  “No company is anywhere close to having that amount of data and won't any time soon,” said Ballinger, adding:  “That data might be out there, but nobody is sharing it and so the day when we get safe cars is probably further away than it otherwise could be.”  MOBI's partners announcing today include: Accenture, Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance Services USA, BigChainDB, BMW, Dashride, Deon Digital AG, Dovu, Chronicled, ContextLabs, Crypto Valley Association, Foam, General Motors, Hyperledger, IBM, IOTA, MotionWerk, NuCypher, Oaken Innovation, Ocean Protocol, Renault, ShareRing, Shift, Spherical Analytics, Trusted Internet of Things Alliance, Vasily, Xain, and ZF Friedrichshafen AG.

42429033,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrDzh,1525255216,Bitcoin Bulls Seek Breakout to $10K or Higher,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a narrowing price range over the past week, but a bullish breakout is looking likely, the technical charts suggest.  The cryptocurrency created a bearish outside-day candle last Wednesday, signaling the rally from the low of $6,425 had run out of steam. However, the bitcoin bulls ensured there was no negative follow-through on Thursday and defended $8,800 over the weekend.  While a convincing break above $9,500 has remained elusive so far, the charts suggest the bulls have the stronger hand going forward.  4-hour chart  The chart above shows that bitcoin is trading in a narrowing price range with higher lows and lower highs, forming a bull pennant pattern.  A bullish breakout would mean the rally from the low of $6,425 has resumed and could open the doors to $12,000 (target as per the measured height method – i.e. length of the flagpole added to breakout price).  While that target looks a little far-fetched, BTC could rally to $10,000 on confirmation of a bull-pennant breakout (4-hour close above pennant resistance of $9,400).  On the other hand, a downside break would add credence to last Wednesday's bearish outside-day candle and could yield a pullback to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4).  That said, the odds of a bull-pennant breakout are high as indicated by the price action in the daily chart below.  Daily chart  The bears failed to capitalize on bullish exhaustion last week, as indicated by the bearish outside-day candle. This is evident from the lack of bearish follow-through on Thursday and higher lows pattern – $8,652 (April 26 low), $8,750 (April 28 low) and $8,818 (May 1 low).  Further, the gradually ascending 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA continue to favor the bulls.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,120 on Bitfinex, representing marginal gains compared to the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,066.  View  Bitcoin will likely witness a bull-pennant breakout and rise towards $9,975 (200-day MA) and $10,000 (psychological hurdle).  A daily close (as per UTC) above $10,000 could bring a stronger rally to $11,306 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $19,891 to $6,000).  A downside break of the pennant pattern would weaken the bulls and expose support lined up at $8,490 and $8,104 (50-day MA).  Only a daily close below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal bear revival.

42429016,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrDZh,1525251619,Peter Thiel Fund Moves to Ease Trades for Big Crypto Investors,"Founders Fund, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm known for its early investment in Facebook, has reportedly put money into a cryptocurrency startup that aims to optimize the bulk trading of cryptocurrencies.  According to the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Founders Fund – co-founded by the high-profile investor Peter Thiel and based in San Francisco – is now backing a startup named Tagomi Systems Inc., which boasts a mission to serve as a broker-dealer to optimize bulk bitcoin trading orders for high-value clients.  While it remains unclear how much Founders Fund has invested in Tagomi, the report said the startup has netted $15.5 million in funding so far. In addition, a filing made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated March 15, indicates that Napoleon Ta, a partner at Founders Fund, will serve as a Tagomi director.  According to the WSJ report, the problem that the startup aims to solve stems from a fragmented trading environment across global cryptocurrency exchanges, where, for instance, the price of bitcoin can vary between platforms.  As such, the startup – co-founded by Greg Tusar, the former chief of electronic equities trading at Goldman Sachs – is building a platform that finds the best market to execute large numbers of cryptocurrency trading orders at a specific time.  The news comes soon after it was revealed that Founders Fund itself has already moved to invest in bitcoin, as reported by CoinDesk in January.  It also follows Thiel's bullish view on bitcoin reported in October last year when the billionaire investor argued that critics of bitcoin were ""underestimating"" the cryptocurrency. And, in March, he said there will ultimately be only one digital equivalent to gold, and bitcoin, as the ""biggest"" cryptocurrency, will triumph.

42429020,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrDfh,1525248050,"I Would Short Ether Before Bitcoin, Says Citron's Andrew Left","""I'd rather short ether.""  Andrew Left, the activist short-seller behind Citron Research, told CoinDesk on Tuesday that he thinks both bitcoin and ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, are ""bubbles."" If he had to choose one, though, he'd bet on ether's price to fall.  Left is known for writing explosive reports into companies like the Canadian pharmaceutical firm Valeant, arguing that investors should short them.  His comments came a day after he fired a Twitter broadside at Square, a payments company that has been adding support for bitcoin buying and selling. He declared that the company's share price is likely to drop to $30, from just under $49 prior to the tweet.  ""WallSt drunk on Bitcoin nonsense, SQ-Cash to BTC trading has been insignificant,"" Left wrote.  Square is scheduled to report its latest earnings data on Wednesday, and if ""they've earned nothing from crypto, don't be surprised,"" Left told CoinDesk.  Left has taken aim at other investments related to cryptocurrency in the past, but he told CoinDesk that each had an ""individual reason.""  Addressing bitcoin's merits in and of itself, he acknowledged the appeal of a decentralized asset or a kind of digital gold, commenting: ""I dig it.""  He's not so sure that bitcoin will win out, he said, but as mentioned before, he would gladly short the second-largest cryptocurrency by value. Left dismissed a bullish argument for ether – that its price will grow because entrepreneurs can issue tokens and build decentralized applications on top of the ethereum blockchain – using the analogy that Oracle doesn't own part of the businesses that run on its own servers.  In his view, ether bulls use a ""circular argument"" – that is, ""it'll go up because it'll go up.""  ""I think both are bubbles,"" he said of bitcoin and ether, but ""if I were going to be wrong about one of these, it would be bitcoin.""  Left has been shorting stocks full-time since 2001, and has said he's made money every year. Short sellers profit when the price of a stock (or another asset) falls; they accomplish this by borrowing shares, selling them, and buying them back later to return to the original owner.  The Citron founder is most famous for correctly predicting the fall in shares of Valeant, a Canadian pharmaceutical company that has been at the center of an accounting scandal.

42429014,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrDVh,1525233603,Not Just Bitcoin: OpenBazaar Is Gearing Up for a Radical Redesign,"OpenBazaar is gearing up for an overhaul.  Since startup OB1 launched in 2014 to develop a ""bitcoin-powered"" online market, the founders have focused almost exclusively on the world's largest cryptocurrency. But with the scaling debate still raging in some ways, OB1 co-founder Washington Sanchez took to Twitter recently to vent his frustrations about that course of action.  ""I personally wasted so much time in the bitcoin scaling civil war that I could have used designing [and] building dapps (decentralized applications) and opening up OpenBazaar to multiple currencies,"" Sanchez wrote. ""Instead, we had to wait for fees in bitcoin to cripple any consumer usage before we woke up.""  Strong words – especially in light of a number of developers working diligently on layer-two technologies, such as lightning network, which push transactions off-chain in an effort to scale for an ever-growing user base.  Still, it's also become clear to OB1 that its user base not only wants to be able to use bitcoin, it wants to use other crypto assets on OpenBazaar's peer-to-peer (P2P) network.  While bitcoin remains the most widely used – with 11,000 listings of items to purchase with the cryptocurrency – other coins are making a mark for OpenBazaar's 5,000 weekly users. There are around 1,122 listings for items to buy with bitcoin cash, the cryptocurrency that forked off bitcoin in August 2017, plus a few dozen products being sold for privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash.  And it seems today, the founders of OB1 are ready to open their minds and platform to a whole new world of cryptocurrencies.  Speaking to that new outlook, OB1 co-founder Brian Hoffman told CoinDesk the vision for OpenBazaar is to be ""the easiest and fastest way to start a business that accepts cryptocurrency and to buy or sell anything you want with cryptocurrency.""  And on Twitter, Sanchez seconded that sentiment, saying, ""OpenBazaar is supposed to be a free and open protocol for trade using cryptocurrency, a way for currencies and tokens to gain meaningful economic utility to acquire goods and service, and an entry point for people to earn and onboard.""  He added:  ""This vision cannot be limited to a single coin.""  But that shouldn't exactly come as a surprise. The ambitious redesign and the move to a multi-cryptocurrency mission was at least hinted at previously.  For one, Hoffman announced plans to launch OpenBazaar Token (OBT) during crypto conference Token Summit in December, and the team laid out some of its other plans in January after raising $5 million (bringing its total to $10.5 million) from investors like China-based crypto mining hardware giant Bitmain.  During that time, OB1 mentioned a web and mobile app and a service to allow users to trade cryptocurrencies with each other.  But that goal isn't just about making a pretty penny monetizing its services (currently it only makes money off affiliate links), but about facilitating broader engagement to encourage the types of communities seen on social media.  “We’re trying to drive more adoption as a network, as a protocol,” Hoffman said. “It’s kind of a longer-term play.”  A crypto Pinterest  And the start of that play, according to Hoffman, will happen later this month with the debut of a new section for swapping several types of cryptocurrencies, including litecoin and zcash.  “Ultimately, the platform can be used with any cryptocurrency that supports a few key things like multi-signature [wallets] and if it can be used as a transactional currency,"" Hoffman told CoinDesk.  Albeit, OpenBazaar won't be able to support every coin right away. Currently, its aim is to facilitate P2P transactions (without trading fees) among the top-ranking cryptocurrencies.  On top of that, once OpenBazaar'a native crypto token OBT launches, users will be able to earn and use those.  The launch of that isn't slated till after Q4 2018, though, since the company must build the features necessary for earning. Those features take from several social media giants' playbooks, allowing users to set up and post statuses to feeds similar to Twitter and Facebook and create curation boards a la Pinterest.  Creating sought-out curation boards or having popular posts will earn you OBT. In this way, OpenBazaar is ""using the token to incentivize activity on the platform,” Hoffman said, adding:  “You don’t need the token to operate OpenBazaar, necessarily, but you can earn crypto by helping make the network better.”  After OBT launches, OpenBazaar plans on taking its multi-currency outlook one step further next year, offering support for ethereum and ethereum tokens, even crypto-collectibles such as CryptoKitties and other digital pets.  ""One of my biggest regrets is not realising the awesomeness of ethereum and other projects and dapps, because I was blinded by my bitcoin maximalism,"" Sanchez tweeted.  And with this, the team hopes to attract more people across a variety of cryptocurrency communities.  “There’s no reason to block those people out,” Hoffman said.  Beyond the node  Yet, what remains one of the startup's highest barriers to mass adoption is the complexity of accessing the market.  Currently, it requires users run a full node and interact only through a clunky desktop app.  As such, OpenBazaar is looking to revamp its desktop website and launch mobile apps (one from iOS and one for Android), which will start being beta-tested in June.  At first, these interfaces will feature read-only versions of the desktop app where newbies can merely browse through listings and profiles, but later, OpenBazaar will create a browser-ready site like any other site (no full node needed). And then by the end of 2018, those interfaces will allow for purchases too.  And on top of putting a significant amount of its developer power towards making the marketplace more accessible and open, OpenBazaar also plans to make ideation and development more accessible to those outside its ranks.  To that end, OB1 co-founder Sam Patterson will soon split off to launch a separate non-profit, The OpenBazaar Foundation, which will focus on giving the community a conduit for influencing what features make it into OpenBazaar’s open-source protocol.  And that should give the hundreds of people interested in attending the company's developer meetings (500 people RSVP'ed for the next one so far) a better way to connect.  Hoffman concluded:  “We’ve spent the past few years making sure the protocol is stable. Now building apps on top is a much easier process.”  Marketplace at dark image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | LTC,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/02/not-just-bitcoin-openbazaar-is-gearing-up-for-a-radical-redesign,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9702e265eb4638747b2b73996225a6175318e80e-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42429024,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrDlh,1525228257,Ripple Put on Defensive at UK Parliament Blockchain Hearing,"Skepticism dominated a Tuesday hearing on cryptocurrencies and blockchain at the U.K. parliament, but it was not the members of parliament (MPs) who set the negative tone.  Rather, it was interbank payments startup Ripple and the XRP cryptocurrency that came under fire as Martin Walker, director of the non-profit Centre for Evidence Based Management and a former product developer at blockchain consortium R3, claimed that the technologies are unlikely to solve inefficiencies in the financial sector, specifically criticizing Ripple's current products.  Defending Ripple's record was director of regulatory relations Ryan Zagone. Dr. Grammateia Kotsialou, a postdoctoral researcher at King's College London and Chris Taylor, chief operating officer at asset tracking blockchain startup Everledger, filled out the panel, which answered questions from the British Parliament's Treasury Select Committee.  During his testimony, Zagone cited the ability to track money transfers as a core benefit of the company's technology. However, Walker argued that the company's model offers little more than the existing SWIFT messaging system, saying ""the hard thing about tracking payments is actually getting the people involved in the payments to actually upload the status.""  ""So simply having a blockchain doesn't actually get people to update the status of where the payment is,"" he continued.  Likewise, he criticized Ripple pilot projects that propose to use XRP as a means of bridging two currencies in an international transaction - a role that the U.S. dollar commonly occupies.  ""You have the concept of a crossing currency to deal with that scenario where there's a lack of liquidity,"" Walker explained, remarking further:  ""You need someone to provide the liquidity to be able to change into and out of Ripple. And holding Ripple, a currency which has seen its price drop 80 percent and then back up 100 percent in the course of the last two months is just not credible. So, putting cryptocurrencies into the financial sector is a huge source of risk.""  The ministers at the hearing also turned their attention to Ripple, specifically expressing confusion regarding XRP's relationship to Ripple Labs.  MP Stewart Hosie commented that ""if people buy XRP, a financial asset from Ripple Laboratories, it doesn't entitle them to an ownership stake, there's no right to be converted back into conventional currencies, and it doesn't pay any return. It also seemingly has no purpose.""  However, Zagone pushed back against this statement, saying ""that's a common misperception.""  He told the panel:  ""XRP is open source and it was not created by our company, so that existed as an open source technology. We created a company that was interested in modernizing payments and then began using that open-source tech to do so ... We didn't create XRP ... What we do have is we do own a significant amount of XRP, it was gifted to us by some of the open-source developers that created it. But there's not a direct connection between Ripple the company and XRP.""  Asked whether XRP was designed to avoid regulations, Zagone reiterated his statements from earlier in the hearing that Ripple only sells XRP to institutional investors and not retail consumers, and likewise that the company merely makes use of XRP, but is not directly connected to it.  With the conclusion of the hearing, Walker advised the Committee to think critically about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, concluding  ""I would just urge the committee that we do not repeat the mistakes that have been made over and again of getting blinded by the word innovation, particularly relating to financial products.""  The full hearing is now available online.  UPDATE: This article has been updated to indicate Walker was previously employed by R3.
