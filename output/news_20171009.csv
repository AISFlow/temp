Announced Monday, the partnership follows R3’s pilot with Japanese financial giant Mizuho to digitize letters of credit and bills of lading, and a trade finance app developed by 11 international banks using the consortium’s Corda platform.  R3’s newest partner, the U.K.-based Bolero, already offers an electronic bill of lading and title registry, with a common legal framework, but the reach of that service will be extended by developing an oracle on Corda, the companies said.  Part of R3's broader mission is to ""help connect digital islands,"" Todd McDonald, a co-founder and head of partnerships at R3, told CoinDesk.  The new partnership will plug the carriers that use Bolero's existing service into R3's ""large and growing ecosystem of financial institutions"" that use Corda, he said.  In so doing, the new service will cut the time – from days to hours – it takes for companies throughout the supply chain to complete document presentation, financing and payment, R3 and Bolero said.

42400516,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJoHR,1507557628,Ripple Rebound? XRP Price Jumps to 7-Week High,"Ripple's native XRP token jumped to a near seven-week high of $0.28 yesterday despite technical indicators that suggested the cryptocurrency's recent rally might be overdone.  While a re-test of the August 31 high of $0.26 was on the cards, the rally was something of a surprise given that the broader market is under pressure. At press time, the ripple-U.S. dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is up 10.47 percent at $0.27. Week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is up 33.33 percent, while month-on-month, it's up 27 percent.  Even so, XRP is well short of its record high of $0.39 set in May. As such, the present XRP rally could be a result of renewed interest among traders ahead of anticipated publicity for the company. If so, that makes the cryptocurrency vulnerable to ""profit taking"" following the conclusion of the event.  As of now, however, XRP bulls have no reason to fear. Price action analysis indicates the cryptocurrency is all set for a rally to possibly record highs.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows:  Rounding bottom formation  Bullish rising channel breakout  Overbought 14-day relative strength index (RSI)  Five-day moving average and 10-day moving average sloping upwards  Volumes rose over the weekend, which adds credence to the bullish price action  A ""rounding bottom"" is a saucer-shaped formation suggesting bearish-to-bullish trend change. In XRP's case, that means the pullback after the May high of $0.39 is over and the bulls have regained control.  The overbought RSI indicates an extended move to the upside. The term ""overbought"" indicates a market that has advanced to a point at which, historically, it has tended to reverse and move lower.  View  Due to overbought RSI, short-term consolidation or a minor pull back to $0.25–0.24 cannot be ruled out.  The broader outlook remains constructive. XRP looks set to take out the August high of $0.2980 and test record high of $0.3988 by the year's end.  Only a drop below $0.1868 (May 30 low) would signal a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.

42400520,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJoGS,1507554039,Transparent ICOs? Blockchain Projects Prove Value with New Accounting Tech,"With new initial coin offerings (ICOs) now being announced on an almost daily basis, it's been challenging for investors to decide where to invest, or what exactly they're getting for their money.  Valuations have largely been determined to date by trust in founders, the white papers they write and the strength of target use cases. But with more than $2 billion having already flowed into token sales, blockchain startup Balanc3 thinks it's time to make ICO accounting more sophisticated.  Last week, in the first live demo of its new accounting platform, the company gave more than 200 people from the ""Big Four"" accounting firms, other blockchain startups and regulatory agencies a glimpse into a new way to value ethereum-based token sales.  In an exclusive interview, Balanc3's Griffin Anderson told CoinDesk:  ""It really allows the industry to begin to hold accountable these token sales that have essentially almost gone public, and the markets will be able to use this information to more accurately price what these token sales are worth.""  While this would be good for investors, it's not as easy as just switching this functionality on to provide such insight. ICO issuers will have to sign up with Balanc3 and turn over all addresses associated with the offering. Balanc3 then aggregates that data into a single account where project bookkeepers can provide line-by-line categorization (such as payroll, inventory, sales, business travel etc) of all transactions entering and leaving those accounts.  While it might seem hard to imagine a company that has conducted an ICO opening up its books to investors, Balanc3 believes investors might start demanding that transparency to gain the security of knowing where their money is being used.  Currently working on the beta version – with hopes of it going live in early November – Balanc3 is trying to figure out how best to feed the information ICOs put into the system to investors.  Crypto accounting  In the demo, live financial statements were revealed for token sales from early adopters Aragon (valued at $56 million), Digix (valued at $140 million) and Gnosis (valued at $142 million). Included in the data were expenses such as wages and travel, and a breakdown of other crypto-assets owned by the companies.  ""For those that operate at the highest level of standards,"" said Anderson, ""this may actually increase their value and market cap, depending on how the market sees it.""  Aside from possible bumps to their market cap, ICO holders might also adopt the platform for its features, which Anderson touted as saving both time and costs.  For instance, the categories and other metadata tacked onto transactions can aid the automated reconciliation of accounts, which should make transactions more easily identifiable and, in turn, cheaper to track.  While accountants using the alpha release are still expected to manually add the appropriate descriptions, Anderson said that eventually that process could be automated.  ""Going forward, there will be no input from the accountant or bookkeeper. It will be completely automated in real time,"" he said. ""You’ll be able to see and view the financial information in real time and get a real-time evaluation of these underlying protocols using blockchain technology.""  The other possible benefit of the Balanc3 platform is the so-called triple-entry accounting (from where Balanc3 took its name). Transactions are not only logged to show the money received in one account and deducted in another, but are also recorded on a cryptographically protected ledger.  Originally conceived in 2005 paper by Ian Grigg, triple-entry accounting gained more momentum with the advent of blockchain technology, which creates a cryptographically secure public account.  Self-regulating industry?  The hype and subsequent growth of the ICO market has not only caught the attention of startups and investors, though. It's also piqued the interest of regulators.  After years of waiting to provide formal guidance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently issued a trove of documents and most recently created an entire unit dedicated to policing token-based investment vehicles. Other jurisdictions around the world are also starting to weigh in, some extending an accommodating hand and others taking a harsh stance.  Anderson believes the Balanc3 platform, among other things, shows the industry is interested in proactively taking steps to hold companies accountable and keep investors safe, which could influence how future regulatory hammers come down.  ""Regulation may still be needed, it's a little unknown right now,"" Anderson said, concluding:  ""But what you're starting to see is the first step to the industry saying, 'we're going to take charge, we're going to hold ourselves to a higher degree of standards and accountability'.""

42400515,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJoFT,1507550440,Regulated Cryptocurrency Betting Just Got a Big Boost in Europe,"Regulated cryptocurrency gambling is about open up across a large swathe of Europe.  Announced today, major eSports platform Unikrn has been awarded a gambling license in Malta, a move that will open up its platform to real-money wagering via its UnikoinGold crypto token.  UnikoinGold – which is based on the ERC-20 ethereum standard and is currently being distributed via a token sale or ICO – is being deployed as a medium for real-money wagering in licensed jurisdictions. And, with the Malta licensure, that will mean 80 percent of the European continent.  According to Rahul Sood, chief executive of Unikrn:  ""The European expansion means there’s going to be a large and soon-growing marketplace of users, including the real-money transition of already established users, who want to buy, exchange and use our token to bet on our platform.""  And Sood isn't wrong.  The company formed Unikrn EU through a joint venture with RBP, a leading online gambling platform in France boasting over 300,000 registered users and 1 million unique monthly visitors.  Further, eSports – video games played competitively for both online and in-person audiences – are surging in popularity with young people, and are widely considered to be the fastest growing ""sport"" in the world. Market research firm Newzoo estimates that global eSports revenues for 2017 will top $696 million – a 41 percent year-over-year jump – with that figure predicted to reach $1.5 billion by 2020.  As profiled by CoinDesk, Unikrn has won the backing of high-profile investors like Mark Cuban, Ashton Kutcher and Elisabeth Murdoch.  Token benefits  Until now, Unikrn had only offered real-money betting in Australia and the United Kingdom – the only two nations where it held gambling licenses. It offered free betting in other jurisdictions on popular first-person shooter and multiplayer battle arena video games such as Counterstrike: Global Offensive, League of Legends and Dota 2.  This was all done through its older free Unikoin tokens, but these are now being retired thanks to the introduction of UnikoinGold and its ICO (now reaching its close).  The Malta licensure and rollout of the UnikoinGold token are critical steps toward migrating the company's free-play bettor base to real money, as well as broadening the number of non-betting related uses that a token owner can derive from holding them.  Another free token, UnikoinSilver, will be launched to keep players in non-licensed areas engaged, though these tokens can't be traded on secondary markets.  For Sood, the decision to transition away from the strictly free-play token was straightforward, particularly as his team had proved the concept of a tokenized scheme for building its global community when it released the original Unikoin two years ago.  Sood told CoinDesk:  “We couldn't have fathomed how popular they'd be. We turned over more than a quarter billion of them in under two years.""  Youth appeal  Part of the new token's appeal is that participants, whether gamers or spectators, don't necessarily need to wager to earn tokens.  For example, tokens can be earned by playing in a tournament or by just watching a match online or in person.  Sood explained: ""Earning, using and utilizing UnikoinGold is not going to be restricted by region, and we think the more fans that are able to get it, the more uses we can give it. The more uses we give it, the more people will want it, and that drives a ton of potential into our platform.""  Both the betting and non-betting appeal of eSports has sparked great interest among the global gambling industry, as well as Las Vegas casinos, all of which are desperately seeking ways to appeal to younger audiences (seven separate panel sessions were held on the topic at last week's Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas last week, for example).  ""Walk through any slot floor and you will see more walkers and wheelchairs than at a Jimmy Buffet concert in a retirement home,"" Sood said of the industry's demographic struggles.  But the only way to bring about this revolution in gambling, according to Sood, is to play by the rules.  The Malta licensure, he argued, highlights the company's commitment to providing its customers a safe, legal and regulated ecosystem that is underpinned by the token. And, notably, Malta is seeking to become a global leader in legal and regulated cryptocurrency gambling.  The key difference between UnikoinGold and other ""gambling tokens"" is that most others simply serve as little more than a ""shortsighted"" means of placing a bet, Sood said, adding:  ""Many companies are doing ICOs for all the wrong reasons. They believe that by using crypto they can skirt gambling regulation, which is wrong. We think it will eventually catch up to them, and anybody holding their tokens.""  eSports competition image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Aaron Stanley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/10/09/regulated-cryptocurrency-betting-just-got-a-big-boost-in-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7043b0132051681a3288e7f760960d3fc0f61a50-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42400511,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJoBX,1507546836,BitPay Is Growing? How Startup Suspicions Are Fueling Bitcoin's Fork Debate,"Is bitcoin a medium of exchange or a store of value? For much of the technology's short history, the answer has been both.  ""All sides want the same thing – for bitcoin to be used by everyone,"" Jameson Lopp, a software developer at bitcoin wallet provider BitGo, told CoinDesk.  However, it's the path to that future, where both functions are fulfilled, that is proving a challenge. The debate over which of those applications should define bitcoin today is now arguably at the heart of the network's scaling debate, though it has gained an added nuance. Namely, whether this should all be accomplished by the base layer blockchain (as opposed to other top-layer networks).  While that may seem like a small consideration – it's anything but.  It seems to all be summed up by two opposing questions:  For businesses and miners, if you're not transacting on the bitcoin blockchain, are you using bitcoin?  And for developers, if you're not storing a full history of that blockchain, are you using bitcoin?  But while such questions might verge on the academic, in November, they'll come more directly to a head. That's when Segwit2x, a proposal to change the blockchain proposed by business and miners, will move forward with a hard fork aimed to boost the capacity of the bitcoin blockchain.  The move, one that could split the network (again), has strained ties among the technology's enthusiasts, separating those formerly united toward exits for common startup endeavors.  ""The only difference is that one side thinks it's urgent for bitcoin to grow ASAP, while the other side is patient and willing to put more effort into engineering efficient solutions,"" Lopp, a visible and vocal opponent of Segwit2x, said.  Others, including his colleague, BitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe, believe the proposal is the only way forward, given that the network's startups are strained by the current restricted capacity.  Until recently, however, there has arguably been little in the way of data points to back this business perspective. After all, most are already passing fees off to users, while others don't interact with the blockchain in real time, instead batch-settling transactions in bulk at a later date.  But that may be changing now that merchant processor BitPay has released new details about its payments dollar volume, which it claims has grown 328 percent over 2016. According to the company, it's on pace to process more than $1 billion in payments this year on the bitcoin blockchain.  ""People always wonder what people are spending bitcoin on all over the world, and this shows that people are actually using bitcoin around the world for real purchases,"" said Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer at BitPay.  He continued:  ""And it doesn't matter the price of bitcoin … our volumes don't go up and down with the bitcoin price. Our growth rates are gradual.""  Digging deeper  But BitPay's claims will surely add fuel to the political fire, primarily because many remain skeptical of press releases showing large gains in transaction volume. That's because it's not always clear how bitcoin businesses are calculating their growth.  For example, multiplying sales by the price of bitcoin would be one approach, though it would be problematic given that the price has increased drastically since last year.  But BitPay says it's not playing those games.  According to Singh, BitPay's growth numbers have nothing to do with the price of bitcoin. When a consumer goes to Microsoft's website and buys an Xbox gaming console through BitPay, the company uses the dollar amount to keep track of growth.  But, while U.S. dollar (and other fiat money) volume has increased, that's not because of more transactions per se, that's just that larger value payments are being made.  Singh told CoinDesk:  ""We've seen a smaller than normal increase in the number of transactions from last year. We’ve also seen a large increase in [business-to-business] transactions, which are around $200,000 per transaction.""  That's why BitPay's sales team is laser focused on securing more business-to-business commerce, according to Singh, and less fixated on the smaller retail and e-commerce merchants that in 2015 brought BitPay into being.  Talking to Singh, though, it seems the company would love to be able to help both, but, with transaction fees currently rising, it's just not practical to make transactions under $20, he said.  Chris Pacia, lead backend developer at bitcoin marketplace OpenBazaar, agreed.  ""I think the fees hamper the use case as a medium of exchange,"" said Pacia, who has set up a DNS seed for Segwit2x. ""This is why it seems to me like at least some people have just given up on payments and are now stating that bitcoin should just be a peer-to-peer speculative trading asset (aka digital gold).""  Fee squeeze  But was bitcoin really ever suited for retail and small e-commerce transactions?  It makes sense for a large U.S. corporation buying from Chinese suppliers (or vice versa) to lower the time and transaction cost of a $200,000 transaction. With bitcoin, rather than bank wires, companies can drop the time it takes to settle a payment by several days and the amount paid to have that payment jump through a handful of middlemen.  BitPay points to shampoo manufacturer Bellatorra as a good example. The company pays one of its suppliers in China $500,000 every month, according to Singh, and by using bitcoin, fees have gone from 5 percent to 1 percent and the time has been cut from five days to one.  But for a small merchant, whose average ticket is around $20, they're not really saving enough time and money over credit cards and other traditional payment methods (which are far more popular with consumers) to make it worth setting up to accept bitcoin.  This is especially true since BitPay began charging all merchants miner's fees in March.  ""All the big companies in the space decided we couldn't absorb the fees anymore,"" said Singh. ""This is a bigger deal for the smaller merchants.""  BitPay currently charges a flat 1 percent transaction fee plus the network's transaction fees – which have increased from 55 satoshis per transaction in October 2015 to around 120 satoshis per transaction today (although they have been much higher).  While BitPay has always had a roller coaster relationship with fees, it does seem that part of the company's inability to offer a fee plan that works for small to mid-sized merchants has been predicated on the increasing miner's fees.  According to Singh: ""We work with many non-profits like Greenpeace and the American Red Cross, and people could donate $1 if they wanted, where now that's not practical.""  Unfortunately, Singh was unable to give a concrete idea of the amounts such non-profits might have potentially lost over the past year due to the issue of transaction costs.  Risk of centralization  So, while bitcoin was at one time touted as a quicker, cheaper payment method for all, that currently isn't the case. And both sides of the debate have developed strong opinions about the growing issue.  While BitPay may want an increasing number of transactions to determine bitcoin's success, bitcoin developers largely believe there is an inherent ""security trade-off"" in scaling via methods such as Segwit2x. For example, as blocks get bigger, the extra information must be stored by all those who hold a copy of the network's ledger.  Should the blockchain become so large that only major miners and businesses can hold the full blockchain, the argument goes, how then does bitcoin differ from banks? And should businesses be trusted to determine the future of the technology given their economic interest in their own success?  BitPay, for its part, would like to focus on its impact on real businesses, as well as helping the underserved in areas where traditional currencies and institutions often fail large sections of society. For example, while Latin America only accounts for 2 percent of BitPay's business, that is a significant increase over last year – and even its own employees in the region are moving to the digital currency.  ""Everyone in the company has the option to take their salary in bitcoin. We have a development team in Argentina, and that team takes 100 percent of their salaries in bitcoin,"" Singh said.  Still, as for how the question of scaling now or scaling later will play out, the verdict may only come with the passage – or rejection – of Segwit2x by network users.  As bitcoin developer Jimmy Song has heard it put, the bottom line is:  ""Bitcoin owes no man their business model.""  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

42400509,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJo9Z,1507543206,The CFTC Is Still Considering a Cryptocurrency 'Delivery' Definition,"The U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is reportedly still working to define when exactly a cryptocurrency can be deemed ""delivered"" due to the complexities of cryptographic key management.  Referencing past enforcement actions by the agency, CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz said at an event last week that officials at the agency are ""working very hard to provide a suitable response to that question."" At the same time, he also raised recent media criticism of bitcoin, including the argument that it is a ""fraud"" as advanced by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.  Yet his comments on the rules for the delivery of digital commodities are perhaps the most significant, coming more than two years after the agency first said it would begin overseeing the trade of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. as commodities.  He said at the event:  ""Would someone here like to tell me how to define the 'actual delivery' of a virtual commodity? The CFTC is working very hard to provide a suitable response to that question.""  That lack of clear-cut rules in this area – a result of existing regulations clashing with new technologies and the products they facilitate – is what led to a $75,000 settlement in June 2016 for cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex amid allegations by the CFTC that it did not properly deliver funds to customers.  And it was that enforcement action that subsequently sparked a petition by U.S. law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP to address the matter. In July of last year, the law firm asked the CFTC to provide regulatory clarity regarding the definition of ""delivery"" in the context of transactions conducted using blockchain-based assets.  While Quintenz didn't offer a clear timeline for release of its proposed rules, he did say that they would be subject to open debate by both the agency itself and its private-sector advisory committee.  ""Once a proposal comes forward, I expect to request the [Technology Advisory Committee's] input and feedback as we work to provide regulatory consistency with other commodities ... as well as regulatory certainty within which a more constructive trading environment may develop,"" he said.  Commentary pushback  Elsewhere, Quintenz called recent media coverage around bitcoin ""terribly misguided.""  In recent days, a number of notable Wall Street figures and financial analysts have taken aim at the cryptocurrency market, with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman joining Dimon by offering negative perspectives on the technology.  According to Quintenz, those views – particularly about market speculation – miss the point.  ""Certainly, we can all debate the value of bitcoin – whether it is overvalued, undervalued, or a 'fraud' – but that price-based conversation misses bitcoin's broader technological and innovation achievements entirely,"" he said at the event, adding:  ""One of the most fascinating aspects of bitcoin is not that it's a virtual currency. It's that it's an ecosystem.""  Those characteristics – and the benefits and risks they bring – present both challenges and opportunities for regulators like the CFTC, he argued.  ""But it is important for us as regulators to be aware of the diversity of these potential ledger ecosystems, from the narrow and mostly private to the very broad and incentivized, so we can appropriately estimate risk and regulation,"" he said.

42400507,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJo7b,1507536012,Rumor or Not: Goldman Trading Would Change Bitcoin,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.      While Jamie Dimon may be convinced bitcoin is a fraud, it appears that the competition has a different view.  Earlier last week, The Wall Street Journal reported on a rumor that Goldman Sachs is considering putting together a new trading outfit for cryptocurrencies. Its CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, later tweeted that he was undecided on bitcoin as a currency, deftly skirting the issue. Of course, it's not necessary to ""believe"" in the bitcoin story to see that there's money to be made by trading it (and Goldman Sachs research covers bitcoin as an asset).  If true, however, this is more than just another example of Wall Street and bitcoin getting closer. First of all, Goldman Sachs would not be alone in putting financial weight behind bitcoin.  Fidelity Investments has been working on bitcoin-related projects for some time through its R&D arm Fidelity Labs, most recently unveiling a partnership with Coinbase to enable account holders to track their cryptocurrency holdings alongside more traditional assets.  Still, it would be the first Wall Street-based institutional trading desk for the asset.  The report does stress that Goldman may eventually pass on the project. Yet even if it does, it is indicative of an increasing acceptance in the upper echelons of finance that bitcoin is not going away, and that there is money to be made.  What's more, the strategy does fit in with Goldman's reputation as aggressive traders seeking high-risk, high-return turnover – more so than does its recent foray into retail banking.  And with market volatility at a five-year low (according to the leading index), it makes sense that the investment bank would look for a new opportunity to offset the recent slump – Q2 trading revenues were down 40 percent year-over-year.  Will other Wall Street giants follow? It's likely. Last week the CEO of Morgan Stanley stated that bitcoin was ""more than just a fad.""  Choppy charts  Yet, the potential impact of the project, if pursued, would go beyond Goldman Sach’s bottom line.  The most noticeable impact would be on bitcoin's trading volumes, as even more institutional funds pour into the market. This could significantly push up the volatility, making bitcoin even more of a high-risk/high-return asset than it already is – which in turn could attract more risk-seeking institutional funds, perpetuating a chaotic cycle that could well end in tears.  On the other hand, we could also see a corresponding increase in the trading of bitcoin derivatives. Earlier this year, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission authorized LedgerX as the first regulated bitcoin derivatives exchange and clearinghouse. And the Chicago Board Options Exchange is expected to launch bitcoin futures contracts later this year.  With heightened demand for hedging instruments, it's likely that others will emerge.  Since hedging reduces the need to ""churn"" positions (what investors lose on one position they make on another), a more liquid derivatives market could partially calm bitcoin volatility.  It could also kickstart a snowball effect on liquidity. One of the reasons the SEC gave for rejecting the Winklevoss brothers’ bid to launch a bitcoin ETF was the vulnerability of the bitcoin price to manipulation. A strong increase in liquidity could encourage a favorable review of the situation.  New plan  A final, tenuous but nevertheless intriguing effect could be the emergence of bitcoin as a competitive tool. We could see corporate strategies regarding bitcoin services as a differentiating factor that positions financial businesses as more forward-thinking, trader-friendly and value-driven than the ""old school"" counterparts.  This is already beginning to happen in the banking sector. In Japan, several large financial firms have invested in bitcoin exchanges, with SBI contemplating setting up its own. And Skandiabanken of Norway is offering its clients cryptocurrency services. That investment banks are thinking of officially getting involved is a sign of the idea spreading to other areas of finance.  It's worth emphasizing, though, that rumors by nature are unconfirmed, and Goldman Sachs may decide to not go ahead.  It's even possible that they're not even thinking of it at all, and that this rumor was maliciously started to move the bitcoin price. However, the strategy makes sense, and if Goldman Sachs isn't thinking of it, it should be.  Because if they don't, a competitor will. And the rest of us will have to brace for yet more of a wild ride.
