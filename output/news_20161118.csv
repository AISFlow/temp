42378975,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhK9,1479510275,The Developers Behind The DAO Are Launching a New DAO,"The guys behind Slock.it are at it again.  The team that created the now-infamous ethereum-based funding vehicle known as The DAO have regrouped, and in a blog post published today, Slock.it CTO Christoph Jentzsch announced a new open-source initiative called Charity DAO.  The original DAO raised as much as $150m worth of ether by selling tokens that would be used by stakeholders to vote on projects to fund. Yet a then-unforeseen flaw in the DAO's smart contract was exploited, resulting in a $60m loss and the collapse of the project.  Charity DAO, by contrast, is aimed at making charitable functions more transparent, and if everything works as planned, increasing the willingness of donors to give.  Jentzsch told CoinDesk:  ""I want to see a truly decentralized autonomous organization being built on top of ethereum, and a charity DAO is a great application for many reasons.""  Unlike the for-profit DAO, which was intended to pay dividends to investors based on the success of its investments, this effort is intended as a nonprofit. But to prevent even the potential of such high-stakes losses like with The DAO, Jentzsch says this time around he’ll temporarily cap the amount raised and a so-called ""security hatch"" will be written into the code.  “But long term, I hope this can be removed to be truly decentralized and autonomous,” he told CoinDesk.  Conducted in partnership with a group identified as ""Giveth"" in the blog, Charity DAO will let donors control their funds and vote on which projects they want to fund.  While this is not formally a product of Slock.it, Jentzsch says some of the same people who contributed are still involved. Jentzsch is leading the project, but wants to open it up to outside contributors.  The model itself sounds remarkably similar to The DAO, except the recipients of the funds will ostensibly also be nonprofits.  ""We want to use the knowledge and the experience learned from this experience to create a Charity DAO,” wrote Jentzsch in the post. “The Charity DAO will have a very narrow focus.""  A second chance?  In the aftermath of the collapse of The DAO, when an unknown perpetrator took advantage by moving $60m worth of funds into an account he or she controlled, the ethereum community suffered immensely.  Charity DAO, as a result, will likely face an intense amount of scrutiny.  In pitching the project in the blog post, Jentzsch argues that ""trust in charities is at an all time low"" and “charities have a public image problem,"" both of which might be hard to swallow for investors who were temporarily burned in the fall-out surrounding the DAO collapse.  But in spite of a call from one member of cryptocurrency academia to ostracize the Slock.it team from the community, one cannot help but remember the old startup-maxim: fail fast and fail often.  In the end, all DAO investors were given a chance to receive a refund following a controversial hard fork that resulted in a schism in the community and the formation of ethereum classic.  Jentzsch said his involvement with The DAO was ""a humbling experience"" that highlighted previously unknown factors. He added that it is, perhaps, exactly this experience that helped improve the code used in this current incarnation.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I think there is no other smart contract which got more reviews then theDAO contract, and we can use all of this knowledge and feedback to build a better one.""

42378987,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhUD,1479501114,Bitcoin Tipping Service ChangeTip to Shut Down,"Months after its core development team was acqui-hired by accommodations startup Airbnb, bitcoin tipping service ChangeTip is closing its doors.  Nick Sullivan took to Reddit today to announce the closure. He said that the tipping service will be officially turned off at the end of November, though its website will remain open “for a number of months” in order to allow for user withdrawals.  The closure comes less than two years after the startup, once a popular tool for sending bitcoin tips via social media, raised $3.5m in a seed funding round. ChangeTip sought to bring bitcoin tipping to popular Web platforms like Twitch and Facebook.  ChangeTip had attempted to sell the remaining assets and code tied to its tipping service but struggled to do so in the months following Airbnb’s acqui-hire. Those hires took place in April.  In today’s post, Sullivan confirmed the struggles to find a future for the service, adding that the cost of continued operation played a role in the decision.  Sullivan wrote:  “In the spring of 2016, ChangeTip’s employees were acqui-hired by Airbnb, where most of us work today. Since then, we’ve been searching for the best outcome for ChangeTip, and unfortunately the only remaining option is to shut it down.”  Sullivan said that withdrawals would be processed every 24 hours or so, before going on to the service’s users for their commitment over the years.  “It was a great adventure, and we’re proud of what we built – we sincerely hope you enjoyed using ChangeTip,” he wrote.

42378971,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhF7,1479495326,The IRS is Seeking Data on Coinbase's Bitcoin Customers,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is seeking access to user records held by bitcoin and ether exchange Coinbase as part of a taxpayer investigation.  The US tax agency filed a petition in the District Court for the Northern District of California on 17th November asking for permission to serve a summons to Coinbase over user information, court records show. The targets of the investigation are not directly named, but are rather referred to as a group of ""John Does"" who are believed to have avoided or failed to have paid taxes on transactions involving digital currencies.  Now, it seems, the IRS is looking to more aggressively police digital currency users in the US, and the investigation itself focuses on taxpayers who transacted between 2013 and 2015.  Attorneys for the US government wrote:  ""The 'John Doe' summons relates to the investigation of an ascertainable group or class of persons, that is, United States taxpayers who, at any time during the years ended December 31, 2013, through December 31, 2015, conducted transactions in a convertible virtual currency as defined in IRS Notice 2014-21.""  The court action comes more than two years after the IRS declared that it would regulate bitcoin and other digital currencies as kinds of property subject to tax and reporting requirements.  Yet, in the years that followed, the IRS has reportedly failed to create a comprehensive strategy around the tech, according to a recent inspector general report. That report blasted the IRS, arguing that the agency's shortcomings have heightened tax avoidance risks.  In the meantime, tax professionals in the US have attacked the agency’s approach as too vague and in need of improvement.  As of press time, Coinbase has said that it is weighing the filing and that it is seeking to respond in a way that maintains user privacy.  ""We take user privacy very seriously and will work to protect the privacy of our users in broad information requests,"" Coinbase representative David Farmer said. ""We are taking a very careful look at this petition and the scope of the government's authority as it relates to this request.""  A representative for the IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Investigations detailed  While the petition does not point any fingers at potential tax cheats, some of the filings from the IRS offer examples of the kinds of investigations the agency has conducted to date.  A statement from IRS agent David Utzke outlines three instances in which the target of an investigation had ultimately confessed to using digital currency in a bid to avoid scrutiny. He wrote about one individual who, after using offshore accounts for years to maintain their funds, started using the tech to move their money.  Utzke wrote:  ""...instead of repatriating his income from an ATM in the form of cash, Taxpayer 1 diverted his income to a bank which works with a virtual currency exchanger to convert his income to virtual currency. Once converted to virtual currency, Taxpayer 1's income was placed into a virtual currency account until Taxpayer 1 used it to purchase goods and services. Taxpayer 1 failed to report this income to the IRS.""  Two other cases involved ""corporate entities with annual revenues of several million dollars"", each of which involved the use of a Coinbase account.  ""Both taxpayers admitted disguising the amount they spent purchasing the bitcoins as deductions for technology expenses on their tax returns,"" Utzke wrote. ""The bitcoin transactions were discovered after repeated requests for the original documentation necessary to substantiate the technology expense items claimed on the tax returns.""

42378974,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhIt,1479484778,Japan's Central Bank Believes Blockchain Could Create Tax Issues,"Growth in the use of both digital currencies and distributed ledgers could hold regulatory and monetary policy implications, a senior official for Japan’s central bank said today.  Speaking during a fintech event at the Univeristy of Tokyo, Bank of Japan deputy governor Hiroshi Nakaso remarked about the benefits and risks of the increasing digitization of financial services. Particularly, he noted that the use of distributed ledgers could lead to confusion among regulators in instances where wholly electronic ledgers are maintained.  He told attendees:  “Moreover, if FinTech stimulates economic transactions through the internet and smartphones as well as business applications of DLT, it might become increasingly difficult to identify the physical ""location"" where transactions take place and the relevant ledgers are kept. This could lead to a variety of issues including those related to regulation and taxation.""  Nakaso has commented on the technology in the past, speculating in August that it could potentially reshape some functions in the financial space.  During the event in Tokyo this week, Nakaso echoed past comments in suggesting that digital currencies, should they see wider use among consumers, could affect how central banks conduct monetary policy.  “Indeed, if virtual currencies such as bitcoin are to be widely used to purchase goods and services directly, there should of course be influences on monetary policy,” Nakaso said. “At present, however, the consensus view in various international forums is that virtual currencies are unlikely to overwhelm sovereign currencies.”  Nakaso closed his speech by calling for greater collaboration among stakeholders in the fintech space.  “In order to overcome those issues, we need to cooperate with a wide-range of entities, including private businesses and academics in particular,” he concluded.

42378991,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhXz,1479481240,The Swiss Government is Paving the Way for Crypto Banks,"Swiss Parliament member Franz Grüter could hardly be happier that his proposal for new blockchain regulations has been shot down.  For months, he resisted the government's requests to kill his motion, which would have changed the definition of a bank to make it easier for cryptocurrency companies to open in Switzerland.  ""We got this,"" was the gist of what they told him. ""Thanks, but no thanks.""  But Grüter, who was elected to represent the Lucerne region of Switzerland a year ago, remained skeptical.  ""The reason I was frustrated was that I didn't believe how bureaucracies work, how bureaucracy works in governments,"" Grüter told CoinDesk. ""I was not expecting that they would really say what they were writing. So, I kept my motion in place.""  Two months later, he changed his mind. In August, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) (which oversees the nation's financial sector) finally convinced him what they were working on would amount to a real impact on blockchain companies — and soon.  Instead of lowering the amount of capital required for banks to keep on hand, the regulation currently being prepared will create an entirely new category of financial institution, he said.  Grüter calls this new breed of company a ""crypto-bank,"" and since he's rescinded his own motion to change the law, he's pledged his support to these new financial entities.  Grüter told CoinDesk:  ""I'm more than open to help the whole industry. If there are any further hurdles for them, we can eliminate those hurdles. Up to now, I can say my influence worked.""  Square one  Grüter said he first became aware of the issues faced by cryptocurrency startups when he was approached by Xapo CEO Wences Cesares, who was then considering whether to move his bitcoin wallet provider's headquarters to Switzerland.  The information technology veteran and current chairmen of Swiss Internet firm Green.ch ended up receiving multiple ""complaints"" from blockchain entrepreneurs, and in order to better serve them, he sought the advice of local industry insiders.  Following the recommendation of Zug, Switzerland-based lawyer Andreas Glarner and the Switzerland Bitcoin Association founder Luzius Meisser, Grüter opened his first bitcoin account and began to experiment by purchasing the cryptocurrency.  Then, in May of 2015, Cesares officially moved Xapo's headquarters to the Zug region of Switzerland known as ""crypto-valley"". (He confirmed to CoinDesk that he continues his work with Swiss regulators and that he can't comment further).  This was soon followed by regulatory action.  The following month, Grüter and fellow Swiss Parliament member Claude Béglé collectively filed three blockchain-related motions. According to Swiss law, FINMA then had the right to recommend that such motions be passed, shot down or the ability to make a counter-proposal.  In this case, Grüter says he was unwilling to rescind or ""liquidé"" his own motion until he was contacted by a surprising source – the person who set him on on his cryptocurrency crusade, Wences Casares.  ""Wences approached me and he told me, 'Hey Franz, you won't believe it, they are totally excited, they want to introduce now a new group of crypto-banks that has totally different regulations,'"" Grüter said, adding:  ""I decided there is no need at this point that I push it further since my intervention already worked and the government is making the changes proactively by themselves.""  The future of 'crypto-banks'  Now that Grüter has rescinded his initial proposal, he says he’s only getting sporadic information about the future of these new financial entities.  But thanks to a series of public documents, the crypto-banks makeup is beginning to take shape.  Just days after Swiss rail operator SBB announced it would begin offering bitcoin via its ticket kiosks, Switzerland's Federal Department of Finance (FDF) published the first details about the project.  Revealed earlier this month, these so-called ""FinTech licenses"" may be granted by FINMA with capital requirement as low as CHF 300,000, or 5% of the accepted public funds. (The total amount of public funds that can be accepted by those with a FinTech license may not exceed CHF 100m).  The day before the FDF published the license details, FINMA released a corresponding document that helped lay the framework by redefining corporate governance guidelines for banks.  Specifically, the document instituted the proportional application of certain regulations, ""leaving institutions free to implement the requirements in a way that takes account of their differing business models and of the particular risks associated with them.""  But that isn't all. Yesterday, FINMA defined its strategic goals for the four years beginning in 2017. The document explicitly mentions a ""pro-innovation approach to supervision and regulation, and tackling newly emerging risks,"" as among the regulator’s top priorities.  From the document:  ""The long-term success of Switzerland's financial centre depends largely on its ability to innovate. FINMA is therefore adopting a more pro-innovation approach to regulation and supervision and will push for the removal of unnecessary regulatory obstacles for innovative business models.""  The mind shift  Though an exact timeline has yet to be published, Switzerland’s Federal Council has instructed the FDF to complete a draft of its legislative amendments by the beginning of next year.  Some of the proposed measures could even be enacted by an executive order at an earlier date, according to Bitcoin Association Swtizerland founder, Luzius Meissner.  As part of that work, the FDF is expected to join forces with related authorities to clarify certain stipulations and further reduce barriers for FinTech startups.  According to Grüter, behind all these changes is nothing less than a total shift in the way Switzerland views cryptocurrency startups.  Instead of being focused on the potential risks, Grüter argues that his colleagues have determined to prioritize the potential benefits.  ""The mindset is completely changing now from a certain critical, not really knowing what are the threats of the technology to a very open-minded, opportunity-driven people,"" said Grüter.  Meisser reiterated Grüter’s position, but more cautiously.  ""It is great to see that the government finally starts to think about realizing opportunities instead of eliminating risks. Often, governments tend to overemphasize the latter while neglecting the former,"" he said.  ""However, it is too early to cheer. It remains to be seen which suggestions actually will survive the political process.""  Bitcoin where his mouth is  Since Grüter opened his bitcoin account with BreadWallet earlier this year, he said he’s mostly just focused on how to buy the digital currency and track its price changes.  But over the coming months, he expects to make his first bitcoin purchase using the wallet.  Already, the canton of Zug has voted to accept bitcoin for payment of certain government services, with further evaluation by the end of this year.  But as the SBB plan to start accepting bitcoin goes into action, he thinks his first purchase will be for a ticket to ride.  Grüter concluded:  ""This makes it much more widely public now, and probably I will use it mostly there.""

42378976,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mhLP,1479478488,Bitcoin Miners Can Now Signal Support for SegWit,"Bitcoin miners can now show their support for a long proposed technical update that would boost the network's transaction capacity.  Following block 439,488 on the bitcoin blockchain (which occurred at roughly 8:30 UTC today), miners can now upgrade their software by changing a header value in the blocks that they process.  Called Segregated Witness (SegWit), the change is best known as a way to scale transactions on the bitcoin blockchain by carving out more space in each block, though it also solves a long-known major bug and expands the software in a few other notable ways.  As coded in the latest bitcoin software release (0.13.1), 95% of miners need to signal support for the change in a series of 2016 blocks, or a period of roughly two weeks. If that happens, there will be another two week period before SegWit is officially activated.  If activated, the change would ripple out to the rest of the ecosystem of wallets and software projects, and users on the network could begin to take advantage of the update.  But not everyone supports the change (one observer even called the signaling period the beginnings of a ""dirty war"").  With miners ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com reaffirming their intent to block the update in recent statements, their combined hashing power (roughly 8%), means there's chance the threshold won't be reached.  On the other hand, other mining pools have shown eagerness to make the upgrade, with Slush signaling support for the change early (despite the alleged dangers of doing so) and BTCC indicating that its mining pool is ""ready"" for SegWit.  Others may not be technically prepared to make the change quite yet.  F2Pool said in an email that the mining pool cannot signal support in the ""near future"" because their system isn't upgraded to the correct version of the programming language C++.  Bitcoin Core, the volunteer group behind the most popular bitcoin software, released a graph that shows the total, estimated hashrate flagging support of SegWit at any given time (as indicated by the red line).  According to the coded rules, miners have one year to reach the near-unanimous threshold before the change times out.

The Financial Services Commission convened the first meeting of its new task force this week, and the agency is planning additional hearings over the next few months. Other government bodies represented on the task force include the the Ministry of Strategy and Finance and the Financial Supervisory Service. The Bank of Korea, the country’s central bank, is also involved in the initiative.  Up for discussion, the FSC said, is which approach to take, citing examples like New York’s BitLicense and Japan’s recent regulatory moves as possible models. The European Union's work on regulation was also mentioned as a possible starting point.  In a translated announcement release, the agency cited “regulatory blind spots” as drivers for action, as well as money laundering and tax evasion risks.  The move comes as South Korea’s financial system has pursued varied applications of blockchain, particularly in the area of remittances.  In October, bitcoin startup Coinplug said that it was working with South Korea’s largest credit card company on a new identity solution that leverages the tech.

42378961,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mfWB,1479475548,Bitcoin Price Passes $750 as it Nears Five-Month High,"The price of bitcoin is now trading above $750, its highest total in just under five months.  At press time, bitcoin prices were up 2% on the day's trading, and up $50 since the start of Monday's trading at 0:00 UTC.  Propelled by a sharp uptick earlier this week (in which the price spiked $30 in just one hour), the price of bitcoin is now nearing the 2016 highs it set in early June. According to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin is now trading at its highest mark since 20th June, when anticipation for bitcoin's decline in mining rewards was arguably at its peak.  In this case, however, the uptick may not be attributable to just one factor.  Bitcoin has been enjoying continually bullish sentiment among avid traders in past months, and there are increasing signs that its recent gains may have been sparked by exterior market forces.  For example, India has recently seen a ban on certain denominations of banknotes, a development that local bitcoin startups claim has bolstered business, though websites with public data (such as LocalBitcoins) indicate the effects are perhaps less clear.  At press time, the price of 1 BTC on India-based exchange Unocoin was 61,688 India rupees, or more than $900, a figure that boosts claims of strong local demand.  Other factors boosting the price could be the devaluation of China's yuan, which has suffered daily declines this week.  Also a possibility is a general warming sentiment about key technical improvements to the network, with code that could scale the bitcoin blockchain expected to roll out before the end of the year, potentially muting long-held concerns about transaction capacity.
