42406648,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAextv1,1624050216,4 Common Misperceptions About Ethereum’s EIP 1559 Upgrade,"At block number 10,499,401, which is expected to be mined next Thursday, the Ethereum test network Ropsten will undergo a backward-incompatible upgrade dubbed “London.”      This is the first of three test network releases for London in the lead-up to a main network activation tentatively scheduled by Ethereum developers for mid-July. Included in London are five code changes, also called “Ethereum Improvement Proposals” (EIPs). In a blog post released Friday, Ethereum Foundation’s Tim Beiko said:      “[EIP 1559] introduces changes to the block header, adds a new transaction type, comes with new JSON RPC endpoints, and changes the behavior clients in several areas (mining, transaction pool, etc.). It is highly recommended that projects familiarize themselves with the EIP.”      Out of the five EIPs in London, EIP 1559 is arguably the most anticipated and controversial code change of them all. EIP 1559 introduces a minimum payment, also called a “base fee,” for sending transactions on Ethereum that dynamically adjusts based on network activity and demand for block space.      Since EIP 1559 was first proposed over two years ago in 2019, there have been several misconceptions about its use and impact on end users, miners and investors. The following are four common myths about EIP 1559 sourced from CoinDesk Research’s latest report, “The Investment Implications of EIP 1559.”      Read the full report on the CoinDesk Research Hub.    Myth 1: EIP 1559 is aimed at reducing high fees on Ethereum.    At its core, the aim of EIP 1559 is to make transaction fees less volatile and more predictable by creating an algorithmic model to automatically adjust costs by a factor of 1.125x at most per block.      Under the current blind auction-like system for determining fees on Ethereum, the costs for sending a transaction can skyrocket at a moment’s notice depending on the ups and downs of the crypto markets. Under EIP 1559, fees are regulated to increase and decrease based on the use of block space. If blocks are filled above a set “gas target,” the base fee will increase by 12.5% and vice versa.      See also: CoinDesk Research’s Metrics Report Explaining Ethereum Gas Costs      These changes to the inner workings of Ethereum’s fee model are not expected to reduce transaction fees on Ethereum, however. The issue of high fees is primarily caused by limited network capacity to process transactions. EIP 1559 on its own will not affect how many transactions the network is able to handle at once.    Myth 2: EIP 1559 will make Ethereum’s monetary policy more predictable.     EIP 1559 introduces a fee-burning mechanism that will permanently remove coins from the total circulating supply of ether (ETH). The reason for burning the base fee rather than distributing them to Ethereum miners is to ensure there is no financial incentive for miners to artificially congest the network and keep the base fee high.      Because of this burning mechanism, EIP 1559 may strengthen a bitcoin-like narrative of limited supply to the investment case for ether. It is difficult, however, to predict exactly how much ether will be burnt over time given that the base fee dynamically adjusts according to network activity and demand for block space.      While EIP 1559 introduces a counterbalance against an ever-increasing ether supply, it doesn’t make Ethereum’s long-term monetary policy more stable. On the contrary, it introduces economic instability to the network by making it impossible to control what the total supply of ether will be over time.    Myth 3: It is likely that EIP 1559 will cause Ethereum miners to quit and attack the network.    It is estimated that miners will lose 20% to 35% of their income with the activation of EIP 1559, and so there have been petitions from mining entities on Ethereum to stop EIP 1559 in its current form from being accepted into the London upgrade. In addition, amendments to EIP 1559 have been proposed. Those include changing the proposal so that the base fee is not burned, increasing miner income from other sources such as block subsidies and making adjustments to Ethereum’s mining algorithm so that competition for network rewards among miners is more equitable.      Despite the opposition from members of the Ethereum mining community, EIP 1559 is expected to be released on Ethereum’s main network in July, which raises the question of whether miners could potentially resist the London upgrade by shutting down their machines and weakening the security of the network.      While that is possible, there are a number of reasons why it is unlikely that the majority of miners will defect or try to sabotage Ethereum as a result of EIP 1559 activation. One of the primary reasons is that miners would have to forgo rewards they might have otherwise earned by upgrading their machines and continuing operations. There is also the reality that miners have a limited runway on Ethereum and will have to forgo 100% of rewards once the network switches to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol early next year.      See also: The New Plan to Merge Ethereum to PoS    Myth 4: EIP 1559 will solve the issue of miner extractable value (MEV) on Ethereum.     Miner revenue on Ethereum has historically consisted of a fixed block subsidy and transaction fees. However, as a result of the growing popularity for high-frequency trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), miner income from MEV has become increasingly lucrative. Research and development organization Flashbots estimates daily income from MEV has grown from half a million dollars at the start of this year to over $6 million in June.      As background, MEV is the income that miners can earn as a direct result of their ability to order transactions within a block. It is difficult to quantify because miner revenue made from reordering, including or censoring certain transactions within a block, can come anytime a user interacts with another user or application on Ethereum.      See also: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of MEV on Eth 2.0      EIP 1559 reduces the ability for miners to rely on transaction fees as a way to extract MEV from users, but the ability for miners to order transactions and thereby earn MEV through other means will remain unchanged under EIP 1559. Speaking to the continued need for research and development on MEV after EIP 1559 activation, Flashbots researcher Philip Daian said during a virtual Ethereum conference in May:      “The transaction fees people are paying for inclusion [in a block] are actually a very small percentage of the eventual MEV market … The game is still fundamentally unchanged and the deeper protocol level mitigations are still things that we haven’t explored yet.”      For more information about EIP 1559 and its investment implications, download the full report by CoinDesk Research here.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | RESEARCH,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/18/4-common-misperceptions-about-ethereums-eip-1559-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afab5577ded925765debb2a75d8d260b21814102-766x420.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406651,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAextw0,1624047553,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops Ahead of Looming ‘Death Cross’,"Bitcoin declined about 5% over the past 24-hours as the price broke below $36,000 support. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is still up about 23% year-to-date, although some traders are concerned about the looming ""death cross,"" which could indicate a shift from a bullish to bearish price trend.      The death cross is defined by a cross of the 50-day moving average below the 200-day moving average, which could occur over the weekend.      Still, some analysts remain bullish on bitcoin relative to equities.      “When the equity tide pulls back someday, we expect bitcoin and gold to be the primary beneficiaries,” wrote Mike McGlone, commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, in a Friday report.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $35469, -5.92%  Ether (ETH) $2166.02, -7.15%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4166.45, -1.31 %  Gold: $1769.37, -0.19%  10-year Treasury yielded 1.437% versus 1.52% on Thursday  Technical backdrop weakens    “The recent stabilization just isn't sufficient to suggest buying dips,” wrote Mark Newton, founder of Newton Advisors, in an email to CoinDesk.      Newton’s cycle work points to continued weakness this year. “For those who are aggressive traders, any break of $30K should lead down to $20K-$25K and that should be a better area to consider buying dips for a bounce,” Newton wrote.      And for ether, Newton expects a volatile decline over the next one or two weeks given the break below prior lows.    Regulatory crackdown    Bitcoin has been weighed down by ongoing regulatory uncertainty and environmental concerns.      On Thursday, miners in Ya’an, one of the major crypto mining hubs in China’s Sichuan province, received an inspection notice that required shutdowns.      And on Friday, Wu Blockhcain reported that Alibaba Cloud, China’s largest cloud service provider, made calls to cryptocurrency and mining companies registered in China regarding potential domain name cancellations due to regulatory requirements.      “This has little impact on the exchanges because their servers and registered locations are outside of China, but mining companies may need to do some replacements,” Wu Blockchain tweeted.    Growing institutional demand    Despite regulatory hurdles, institutional demand for crypto remains strong, which could force countries to compete for crypto related businesses.      For example, on Friday, Spanish banking giant BBVA is making its cryptocurrency trading and custody service available to private banking clients in Switzerland from June 21.      BBVA said the reason why the service will only be available to clients in Switzerland is due to clear regulations and the widespread adoption of digital assets in the region.    Crypto correlations rise    The chart below shows the one-month correlation between the top 10 crypto assets by market cap has greatly increased since mid-May, according to data from Skew. This reflects broad selling pressure from the sharp correction in May across cryptocurrencies.    Bitcoin ESG update    One month after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted his concerns about the potential environmental harm from bitcoin mining, some industry players are rushing to respond. They’re looking at ways to address the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that might deter big institutional investors from embracing bitcoin.      Crypto.com, an app for trading cryptocurrencies, set a goal for the next 18 months of becoming “carbon negative.” Asset management firm One River Digital filed for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would be carbon neutral. Digital asset investment firm CoinShares made a strategic investment in Viridi Funds and said it would advise the manager on ""the first ESG crypto mining product in the U.S.” Wrapped, a collaboration between tokenization specialist Tokensoft and digital-asset custodian Anchorage, announced a ""carbon-neutral bitcoin-backed-asset"" called Eco BTC (eBTC).      “They are doing it out of the sense of survival,” said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Internet Enforcement who now works as a consultant.    Altcoin roundup  The Swiss Federal Council has enacted a new ordinance to regulate decentralized finance (DeFi). The ordinance creates a license for distributed ledger technology (DLT) trading facilities, which will be effective on Aug. 1. “This will allow for innovative DLT trading facilities and increase legal certainty in the event of bankruptcy,” the council said in the press release. The news broke after Mark Cuban, who said he lost money from the price crash of DeFi token TITAN, called for regulators to determine what constitutes a ""stablecoin.""  Crypto-asset manager Grayscale said it is considering 13 more tokens, most of which are DeFi-related, for potential development into investment products. The tokens include 1inch, Bancor, Curve, Polygon and 0x, among others. Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.

42406656,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAextxy,1624038622,Money Reimagined: DC's Digital Dollar Choice,"One measure of the impact of cryptocurrency technology is the growing mindshare it occupies among policymakers. The past two weeks’ congressional hearings on the digital dollar are a case in point. There’s no way to talk about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) without acknowledging the context fostered by the invention of cryptocurrencies – which are, in some but not all aspects, the polar opposite of CBDCs. Bitcoin tends to work its way into any public discussion about fiat digital currencies, if only to allow the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) an excuse to trash it.      The connection between the two might be much closer than either government officials or bitcoiners recognize, however. That’s the topic of the main column for this week’s newsletter.      This week’s Money Reimagined podcast explores how “blockchain thinking” around decentralized systems, incentives and resilience might help us reimagine insurance and risk management for threats such as ransomware attacks. For that, we talked to two outside-the-box thinkers.      The first is Dante Disparte. Best known in the crypto community as the former vice chairman of the Diem (formerly Libra) Association and currently as chief strategy office and head of global policy at Circle, Disparte has a long history as an insurance innovator via his role as chairman and founder of the Risk Cooperative. The second is Pindar Wong, the Hong Kong-based chairman of VeriFi. Wong is an internet pioneer who has become a leading Asian voice on how blockchain design principles can be applied to a new wave of internet-based digital economic models.      Have a listen after reading the newsletter.    Will the dollar rule the world? Or bitcoin? Or both?    Congressional hearings on a digital dollar these past two weeks were framed as an opportunity to advance financial inclusion.      That’s a noble objective. But let’s be realistic: This is about power.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    There’s a direct line between President Biden’s call, at last week’s Group of Seven meeting, for an alliance to counter China’s Belt and Road trade initiative and Washington’s growing interest in a digital dollar. China’s central bank digital currency is at the heart of its international ambitions, and some fear it poses a threat to the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency.      Many in Washington see the dollar’s dominance in terms of the enforcement power it gives U.S. regulators, who are able to track and control money flows in and out of U.S. banks, granting them unique capacity to impose sanctions on rogue actors and curtail the activity of criminals.      The problem is that this surveillance approach to monetary power is antithetical to financial inclusion. With identification and tracking at its core, the model imposes heavy burdens on the poor, who often don’t have access to the kind of ID systems, credit scores and other means of proving their eligibility for banking services.      What’s more, as speakers at the hearings highlighted, there are legitimate concerns about more extensive breaches of privacy when, armed with central bank digital currencies administered through a single centralized ledger, governments are able to monitor and control every person’s transactions.      So, it’s notable that two people who testified in favor of a digital dollar – Christopher Giancarlo, the former Commodities and Futures Trading Commission chairman and founder of the Digital Dollar Foundation, and Rohan Grey, a professor at Willamette University College of Law – called for robust privacy protections within whatever digital dollar solution the U.S. develops.      Grey wants a digital dollar that functions something like cash, as a bearer instrument that can pass from user to user without requiring a third-party recordkeeper to affirm the legitimacy of the payer, their balance or their right to make a transaction. Giancarlo argues that constitutionally protected privacy would make the digital dollar a more attractive currency for users worldwide than China’s digital yuan, which is expected to be subjected to heavy surveillance by the Chinese government.    Open-source money    How do you build such assurances into a project led by a government that has been shown to run surveillance on its own citizens?      Well, according to his response to a question from CoinDesk executive editor Marc Hochstein, Grey believes the model needs free and open-source software and hardware, as well as technology-neutral spectrum licenses (presumably for mobile wallets built on different device standards).      In the exchange that followed, Hochstein and others questioned how a U.S. intelligence community that’s built a pervasive system of financial surveillance would ever allow an open-source approach it can’t control. While Grey acknowledged that challenge, he stuck to his position that ultimately, public money is the purview of governments, not of decentralized protocols such as Bitcoin’s. In his words, “It’s important not to confuse skepticism towards altruistic expression of government power with the legitimization of the idea there's another alternative” such as Bitcoin.      Grey says that only governments are capable of taking on the difficult governance responsibilities that come with issuing money and that we are best off lobbying Washington to take a more open, pro-privacy approach.    Not waiting for anyone    The thing is that developers of bitcoin and open-system stablecoins are pressing ahead, regardless. And as this process continues – with people increasingly moving money around the world in ways that bypass the U.S. banking system – Washington may have no choice but to work with that movement, rather than against it.      The outcome from that may even be quite favorable to the U.S. MicroStrategy CEO and outspoken Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor told CoinDesk TV earlier this week that he thinks “the U.S. dollar is going to spread to 5 billion people” in a digital form that is “on every iPhone, on every Android phone and in every country in Africa and Asia and South America.” It’s just that this even-more ubiquitous “reserve currency of the world” will “move on Bitcoin rails.”      That last bit is the tough one to accept if you’re a fan of U.S. financial surveillance. “Bitcoin rails” means that the open Bitcoin protocol would be the settlement network for cross-border movements of digital dollars – in the form of privately issued and DeFi-based stablecoin tokens, rather than as an official U.S. CBDC. That could eventually mean that governments are no longer able to identify users.      It would render redundant the SWIFT network, the bank-led communication organization that currently enables the clearing and settlement of international bank-to-bank money movements. And if these digital stablecoin dollars circulate without ever being redeemed for banking system-based dollars, long transaction trails will occur without people ever engaging with a bank.      This model could be tremendous for the execution of U.S. ”soft power.” Having digital dollars everywhere will naturally benefit U.S. companies, which will be freed of exchange rate risk, and will drive demand for U.S. financial assets, including government bonds and T-bills held by reserves-based stablecoin providers.      On the other hand, it will mean giving up the “hard power” of being the world’s financial policeman, which will have far-reaching consequences for Wall Street and corporate interests tied into that system.      But while this soft power/hard power dichotomy seems like a trade-off, it doesn’t mean U.S. policymakers will necessarily get to choose the outcome. Saylor’s scenario could happen on its own, without Washington’s blessing, as crypto developers everywhere pick up the dollar stablecoin ball and run with it.      It’s good that U.S. congressmen are discussing these things, but while they talk, a new model for money is being built.    Off the charts: U.S. government left holding the bag    Wednesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's all-important Open Market Committee signaled that the era of very low interest rates is coming to an end. With the economy bouncing back from the pandemic and the risk of inflation suddenly on everyone’s minds, the consensus is now that rate hikes will start toward the end of 2023, which implies the central bank will soon-ish slow its quantitative-easing (QE) policy that has underpinned everything from stocks to fine art to bitcoin.      Did those FOMC members notice the elephant in the meeting room? Namely: Trillions of dollars in newly issued COVID-era debt. How to address the economic drag from those future obligations, both government and of the private-issued debt, is the FOMC’s multitrillion-dollar question.      We’ve known since the 2013 “taper tantrum” that markets are addicted to Fed money. But now we face a bigger “cold turkey” risk: that a stock and bond market shock triggers economy-wide bankruptcies. Will growth ever be fast enough that debtors can afford sharply higher interest rates? Doubts about that are why many invest in bitcoin. The skeptics argue the government will have no choice but to absorb that debt, and because tax revenues won’t be high enough for it to meet repayments, the Fed will be compelled to monetize it. In what will be a real-world test of modern monetary theory, many see this as a route to dollar devaluation and much higher inflation      For context, let’s look at different measures of private and public debt relative to gross domestic product: total household debt, corporate debt, total federal debt and federal debt owned by foreign investors.      All four spiked sharply in early 2020. That’s partly because the GDP denominator shrank as lockdowns curtailed U.S. economic activity and partly because easier credit conditions enabled companies, households and the government to borrow more. Just as noteworthy: There was a subsequent correction in household debt, corporate debt and debt held by foreign investors later in 2020, whereas total federal debt held mostly steady.      One read on this: The U.S. government kept the economy from collapsing with stimulus checks, sector bailouts, employee retention loans, rent mitigation and so forth. In doing so, it shifted private debt to the public books.      A second takeaway: Lower foreign investor debt holdings set up an easier path to monetization. If the government is less dependent on foreigners to fund itself, there’s less concern about a sharp drop in the dollar exchange rate because most creditors are dollar-based anyway.      A third: Federal debt at 130% of GDP is far above the International Monetary Fund’s recommended 80% threshold. If that number were lower, it would be easier for the U.S. to grow its way out of this problem. But at these levels, we could be forever behind the eight ball. Bad news for the economy. Good news for bitcoin.    The conversation: Schiff show    Peter Schiff, a gold bug who’s also one of the most prominent bitcoin critics, has a family problem: His son, Spencer, is all in on BTC. (Spencer’s laser eyes Twitter profile says he’s a “Former goldbug, now a Bitcoin maximalist.”)      With the younger Schiff constantly taking his father’s anti-bitcoin tweets to task, Schiff Senior used the recent crypto sell-off to deliver a stern life lesson – in public:      Did the man-to-man talk work? Hardly:      Of course, Spencer knew Bitcoin Twitter would have his back. Here’s the aforementioned Michael Saylor responding to the elder Schiff with an own-retweet putting bitcoin volatility into a longer-term perspective:      Schiff Senior’s response: long-term gains don’t matter if short-term volatility destroys your leveraged position:      What many noted, though, is that Spencer’s investing strategy was quite conservative, at least compared to what is on offer in crypto land:      Time will tell who wins this family spat. In the meantime, Lolli CEO Alex Adelman has some other advice for the pair:    Relevant reads: China’s mining exodus    One of the most important recent trends in Bitcoin: Miners in China being pressured, with varying degrees of compulsion, to pare their operations. What began as a somewhat vague but ominous message from senior levels of the government has more recently translated into action at the provincial level.      For example, last week, as Nikhilesh De and David Pan reported, Qinghai province ordered all crypto miners to shut down.      And last weekend, after some initially confusing messaging from officials in the local government, David Pan confirmed that the province of Yunnan, while not instituting an outright ban, is cracking down on miners’ “misuse of energy.”      Not surprisingly, a drawdown in a place that hosts more than half of bitcoin’s mining capacity has real-world implications for the network. For one, as Frances Yue reported, the bitcoin hashrate, a measure of total computational power in the network, dropped to a six-and-a-half month low this week.      However, what’s bad news for Chinese miners is good news for miners in North America, which is expected to see a mass relocation of mining operations. It’s good timing in particular for Canadian miner Hut 8, which as Jamie Crawley reported, will be listing its shares on Nasdaq.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING,Michael J.

La empresa planea aceptar bitcoin, ether, shiba inu y chiliz como formas de pago en sus 24 locales, que incluyen discotecas, restaurantes y pubs, dijeron los directores Santiago Sosa y Rodrigo Nogues Bazan a CoinDesk.      La noticia llegó después de que el diputado paraguayo Carlos Rejala anunciara sus planes de presentar un proyecto de ley para atraer a Paraguay empresas internacionales de minería de bitcoin y otros negocios relacionados. El anuncio de Grupo Cinco aumentará las posibilidades de que el proyecto de ley sea aprobado por el Congreso paraguayo, dijo Sosa.    Read this article in English.    ""Estamos hablando de emprendedores paraguayos de primera línea que tienen mucha influencia en la juventud.

Al aceptar criptomonedas, Grupo Cinco proporcionará a sus clientes y proveedores facturas tradicionales como contraparte, dijo Sosa, quien añadió que los negocios de la empresa tienen más de 50.000 al mes.      GrupoCinco también posee G5Pro, una unidad de eventos en vivo que en 2019 vendió 450,000 tickets, dijo Nogues Bazan. G5Pro no aceptará inmediatamente criptomonedas para la venta de entradas, aunque planea hacerlo pronto.      La compañía implementó los pagos con criptomonedas con la ayuda del empresario Juanjo Benítez Rickmann, director general de la empresa minera local Bitcoin.com.py, dijo Sosa.      Los pagos serán procesados a través de la red Lightning y los locales tendrán la opción de quedarse con las criptomonedas o cambiarlas por fiat, dijo Benítez Rickmann.      Para estar de acuerdo con la legislación actual de Paraguay, Grupo Cinco considerará las criptodivisas como activos digitales ya que el país aún no posee una legislación para los criptoactivos, Benítez Rickmann añadió.      Tras el cierre de locales provocado por el COVID-19, Sosa y Nogues Bazan comenzaron a adoptar criptomonedas para uso personal y luego decidieron aplicarlas en sus negocios, dijo Sosa.      El anuncio de Grupo Cinco podría animar a los jóvenes de Paraguay a utilizar criptomonedas, ya que el 80% de los clientes de la empresa poseen entre 18 y 25 años, dijo Sosa, quien añadió que el 60% de la población del país tiene menos de 30 años.

42406638,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAextq6,1624036846,The Infinite Tomato Economy,"It’s been another wild week, so let’s ease back to talk about something entertainingly dumb: This tweet from Thursday about how to turn $50 into $3.9m in two years by planting tomatoes.      It’s very hard to know where to start with this. It’s a kind of nth-dimensional object melding hustle-culture brain rot and venture capital pitch-deck anti-math. It encapsulates some of the most pernicious ideas of our economic era, particularly the fetishization of “scale” and a total, unexamined contempt for actual labor. The author’s unrestrained self-importance and manifest ineptitude at real-world business thinking, all while trying to sell himself as a business and investing coach, would be completely at home in the most shameless corners of the crypto hype machine.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Obviously the proposal itself doesn’t make a lick of sense, starting with the fact that you can’t sell most tomatoes for a dollar. Twitter user @keewa was even more incisive, writing that the scheme assumes “infinite growth within a finite system.” In other words, this makes sense only if you assume you don’t need anywhere to plant the tomatoes, or anyone to pick them, or really any inputs whatsoever except seeds.      Of course, we’re not really talking about tomatoes here – Huber means it as a metaphor for the benefits of compounding re-investment. The problem is that his metaphor uses actual numbers that are totally unrealistic. In fact, math seems to be a recurring problem for Huber, who backed his way into the tomato-farming tweet by first insisting that he’d rather be given $50 a month for the rest of his life than $1 million cash today. When it was pointed out that you’d have to live for well over 1,000 years for $50/month to be as valuable as $1 million today, Huber was undeterred from his thesis.      Are you enraged yet? Good. Because this was all a very on-point troll.      When not in character as a Dumb Hustler Twitter Guy, Huber writes this of his training courses: “I started the Sweaty Startup in December of 2018 because I believe the Shark Tank and Tech Crunch culture is ruining the real spirit of low-risk entrepreneurship.” He claims to run a network of storage facilities, which is the sort of capital-intensive, not-very-scalable business he’s arguing has been overwhelmed by the rampant quest for 10,000% VC returns and gigachad s**tcoin pumps. He’s trying to warn people against the kind of get-rich-quick BS his tweet satirizes.    Huber’s troll succeeded, though    Huber’s troll succeeded, though, because there are so many would-be influencers and cosplay “investing gurus” out there saying more or less the same brain-dead stuff unironically. The original $50 per month vs. $1 million today question was posed by a guy going by Side Hustle King, who endorses the “law of attraction” as part of his brand. For those not familiar, “the law of attraction” is basically The Secret, a pile of mystical nonsense that argues you can simply visualize good things and they’ll happen to you.    Read more: David Z. Morris – The Lesson of Bitconnect: Promoters Can Be Liable    Now, I empathize with hustle-culture fans. Unscientifically, it seems like it attracts a lot of folks who are out to better themselves from modest circumstances, and no shade on that. The real problem is the sort of higher-up people Huber is satirizing, who manipulate that desire for self-improvement to sell extremely bad ideas at a huge markup. The crypto version of this is day-trading Telegram groups and training courses, many of which are (allegedly) scams run by dopes and charlatans looking to take your money, not educate you.      More interesting is the way Huber’s troll indicts tech investing and business models. The reason the tomato tweet is so deliciously infuriating is that it replicates the most pernicious logic of venture capital and finance over the last two or three decades – that all businesses are basically interchangeable and the abstract unit economics is all that matters.      Seeds, after all, don’t grow themselves, brain genius. Not only do you need expensive land and labor, you need a highly sophisticated set of skills from horticulture to marketing. Ignoring those complexities was key to the growth of some of the biggest startups of the 21st century, and the consequences have often been devastating.    Read more: Matti Gagliardi – The Supercycle: How Crypto Could Shape the Decade Ahead    Nobody remembers this, but Uber for many years told investors that its blood-red balance sheet was essentially meaningless because it was about to invent driverless cars and wouldn’t have to pay drivers anymore. Then an autonomous Uber killed a woman in Arizona and they stopped talking about that. But in the meantime, the app had gutted the conventional taxi industry, where nearly a century of work had gone into establishing safety standards and worker protections. Facebook’s commitment to huge scale and zero labor made it extremely slow to hire enough people to monitor the site for silly little things like overt promotion of genocide.

42406634,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAextfH,1624035913,"BlackRock Wants a Blockchain Strategy for Aladdin, Its Investments Engine","BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with almost $9 trillion in assets under management, is seeking to develop a blockchain strategy for its flagship portfolio management system, Aladdin, according to a job posting.      The director-level hire will “evaluate different blockchain protocols/platforms to explore solution alternatives.” Public and private chains are on the table, a source familiar with the posting said.      Aladdin (short for “Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network”) is BlackRock’s system for measuring risk and making trades. According to the job posting, Aladdin’s new director will investigate how blockchain could fit into the system.      Aladdin has been called “the tech hub of modern finance” for its prominence among portfolio risk management tools. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matthew Hougan said it is BlackRock’s “crown jewel.”      “Aladdin is the secret sauce that makes BlackRock tick, it’s a software tool that managers use to analyze, interpret and work with the capital markets,” Hougan said in an interview.      BlackRock declined to comment on the scope of the position. A spokesperson provided the following statement:    “We’re hiring an engineering lead for distributed ledger technology to build out our expertise and execution capabilities in the distributed ledger technology space. While we have engineers working in the distributed ledger technology space today, this hire will allow us to increase our focus and capacity.”    Aladdin has evolved since the firm, which is now led by co-founder Larry Fink, was founded in 1988. Once exclusively an in-house product, it is now used by more than 250 clients.    BlackRock’s blockchain roadmap    The job posting calls for candidates experienced in building “resilient” blockchain systems and integrating them into big-business tech stacks. That language suggests an interest in scalable enterprise blockchains, the closed cousins of open networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.      Some Wall Street firms have run enterprise blockchains for trade finance, wholesale banking payments and even collateral-asset tokenization on the belief that distributed ledger technology is more efficient than centralized systems. JPMorgan is one example: It built a blockchain protocol called Quorum to host projects including JPM Coin and Liink.      Only approved parties such as other banks are allowed on private blockchains like JPMorgan’s. Well-known public cryptos are out of the picture, replaced instead by tokenized versions of traditional assets, like real estate or gold.      BlackRock wants its new engineer to help bolster the firm’s understanding of tokenization.      “Crypto natives have been talking about tokenization and seeing how that could play a role in the future for years,” Hougan said, adding that banks and mega-managers are now beginning to follow suit.      “What this seems to suggest is that it’s finally gotten too big to ignore for the largest institutions in the traditional financial world,” he said.

42406629,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAextmA,1624034905,El Salvador Doesn't Need a Bitcoin Mandate,"Two weeks ago, the government of El Salvador shocked the world with the sudden announcement that the Central American nation would make bitcoin legal tender. The announcement, made by President Nayib Bukele on the final day of the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, was followed up mere days later with the midnight passage of the law. Longtime critics of bitcoin, after granting Bitcoiners a brief reprieve to enjoy the momentous occasion, came to focus on Article 7 of the hastily passed law:    Article 7. Every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service.    To the critics, led by George Selgin, this amounts to a “forced tender” mandate that goes far beyond a mere legal tender law (which would declare a monetary medium an acceptable but not obligatory medium of exchange) and moves into the domain of coercion.    CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.    The actual implementation of this provision, which is due to take effect in 80 days, is still uncertain; it seems far-fetched in the extreme to imagine that the Salvadoran government will enforce a bitcoin merchant mandate by force everywhere in the country. Economic exchanges happen millions of times a day, and virtually no state on earth possesses the capacity or the political will to force such a monetary transition on its people. There are countless instances throughout history of states attempting to prohibit or enforce monetary transitions, often at the penalty of death. Generally, economic forces prevail, and when pressed, people tend to find ways to defy state monetary mandates. This instance will be no different.      It would also be politically unwise to force merchants to accept bitcoin on such an accelerated schedule. Bukele enjoys a political mandate and world-leading popularity, but an aggressive interpretation of this law would erode some of that support. Already, the primary reaction I have seen from everyday Salvadorans has been confusion and dismay at the prospect of having this new obligation imposed on them. From a practical standpoint, the Bukele administration should consider not enforcing Article 7 or should eliminate it altogether.      Very real impediments exist to implementing a digitized transactional network in El Salvador: Not everyone has access to a smartphone, power or the internet, and learning how to use bitcoin – whether on-chain, via Lightning or through a custodial app – takes time and effort. Bitcoin is great for some types of exchange, but brick-and-mortar retail transactions are not among them.    Let Bitcoin flourish on its own merits    Granted, there are some mitigations to the unfortunate Article 7. Article 12 exempts those who “do not have access to the technologies that allow them to carry out transactions in bitcoin.” Article 8 specifies that the state will provide “alternatives that allow the user to carry out transactions in bitcoin and have automatic and instant convertibility from bitcoin to USD if they wish.” The specific mechanic here would be a trust created under the state fund known as Banco de Desarrollo de El Salvador (BANDESAL) providing dollar-to-bitcoin liquidity. But even with these exemptions and devices meant to smooth the transition, the optics of a “forced tender” law are still poor.      And one wonders why exactly the Bukele administration is so keen on merchant adoption specifically. While the Bitcoin Beach experiment has been a successful case study, it still represents a small petri dish, unlikely to extend smoothly to an entire country. An embrace of bitcoin offers many potential dividends to El Salvador: access to a monetary network independent of the political stipulations that accompany the dollar, and free from Fed-driven dollar debasement; a beacon to attract wealthy and mobile crypto entrepreneurs to Salvadoran shores; and potentially a more efficient and direct system for settling remittances. None of these agenda items relies on the acceptance of bitcoin by local, small scale or informal merchants.      A far stronger gesture of faith in bitcoin would be to establish it as a parallel monetary network, on a par with dollars. If the bitcoin law simply eliminated capital gains taxes for bitcoin transactions, allowed the settling of tax liabilities in bitcoin and established it as an acceptable but not obligatory legal tender, it would accomplish this.      In practice, it is the specific friction imposed by tax policy that keeps fiat currencies like the dollar sovereign and subjugates others. American Bitcoiners have to track their dollar-denominated gains and losses in BTC, and when BTC appreciates against the inflationary dollar, they incur a tax liability (capital gains).    Read more: Central American Development Bank Forms Technical Group for El Salvador Bitcoin Bill    Additionally, when they spend their bitcoin, they have to treat the expenditure as a sale and pay taxes accordingly. Thus, eliminating the capital gain friction is most of the battle in elevating bitcoin to the level of sovereign currencies. Any stipulations beyond that is unnecessary: You can’t hurry bitcoin adoption. Its growth is a natural process of discovery that around 100 million individuals have undertaken in the last decade. For governments focused on unleashing the economic potential of bitcoin and its adherents, merely removing the tax burdens should be sufficient.      I remain cautiously optimistic regarding the bitcoin project in El Salvador. While the law is admittedly questionable in parts, it is very brief and rather underspecified. Much will depend on its actual implementation. I question the hysterical projections of the critics regarding a mass mobilization of state force to mandate bitcoin acceptance at every pupuseria and supermercado. Most likely, the Bukele administration will recognize the burdensome nature of the law and de facto walk it back. But to eliminate doubt as we progress toward implementation, El Salvador should reconsider Article 7 and let bitcoin flourish on its own merits.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/18/el-salvador-doesnt-need-a-bitcoin-mandate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c60919c024b63df03c0e70e1fd75330657d322d0-2400x1346.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under growing demand from institutional clients, in March Goldman Sachs reopened its crypto trading desk after a three-year hiatus. The desk is part of the bank’s U.S. Global Markets division.      Galaxy Digital will provide liquidity, or act as a market maker, for block trades on CME Group, Galaxy said in a statement on its website.      The partnership with Goldman Sachs is one of several high-profile moves Galaxy has made in recent months, including a string of acquisitions of digital-asset management firms. The acquisitions include Vision Hill and BitGo, the latter of which Galaxy bought for $1.2 billion in May.  Goldman becomes the second major investment bank in the past four months to close deals with Galaxy Digital. In March, Galaxy said Morgan Stanley had begun offering wealth-management clients access to some of its bitcoin funds.      Galaxy’s acquisitions have more than doubled the firm’s comprehensive income since 2020, and are part of its pathway to a U.S. listing later this year.      Despite bitcoin’s price stagnation after falling more than 30% from its all-time-high in May, institutional investors are still piling into the space.

Sichuan, which is arguably the largest hydro-based crypto mining hub in China, is joining the ranks of Chinese provinces cracking down on bitcoin mining. A number of provinces have been cracking down on mining operations within their borders recently. Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and Yunnan have already announced crackdowns or partial bans on the industry.      Municipal governments, city governments and energy providers, including the State Grid Corporation of China, in Sichuan will lead the crackdown. Local authorities plan to shut down 26 companies that have been identified as potential crypto mining businesses by the State Grid.      These companies are located across 15 hydro-rich counties in five cities and regions in Sichuan province and will be shut down by June 20, according to the notice.      In the meantime, municipal and city governments will immediately carry out an inspection. Any company that is found to be a crypto mining project during the inspection will be shut down. The local governments are required to report updates on the process to the NDRC by June 25.      State and provincial level energy providers are required to conduct self-inspection and immediately suspend any crypto mining projects. The electricity companies should enforce the crackdown directive “without any discount”, according to the notice.      The notice also stresses the responsibilities of local governments in the crackdown. “Local governments must show and be more aware of their political stance, must guarantee the quality and quantity of the crackdown and maintain social stability,” the notice said.      The news came after Chinese local media reported miners at Ya’an in Sichuan province had received a notice that required them to shut off mining operations for self-inspection on Thursday night. Miners were expecting an official notice on Friday.      Read the full notice below:    Notice from the Sichuan National Development and Reform Commission and Sichuan Energy Bureau About Cleaning Up and Shutting Down Crypto Mining Projects Municipal and city governments, the State Grid Corporation of China in Sichuan, Sichuan Energy Investment Group, central electricity companies in Sichuan and provincial state-owned electricity companies: Based on the provincial government’s 73rd routine meeting and the requirements to crack down on bitcoin mining from the 51st meeting by the Financial and Development Committee of the State Council, we have issued the following: 1. Complete the process to filter out and shut down crypto mining companies The local governments, with assistance of the State Grid and Sichuan Energy Investment Group, will filter out, clean up and shut down 26 companies that have been inspected and reported as potential crypto mining projects by the Sichuan branch of the State Grid by June 20. The NDRC will monitor the electricity usage and the shutdown, and make daily reports. 2. Carry out self-inspection among electricity companies in Sichuan Central electricity providers in Sichuan and provincial state-owned electricity companies should investigate their clients and immediately cut off their electricity supply once found to be mining projects during the inspection. The companies should enforce the crackdown issued by the government without any discount and report their inspection results to the NDRC before June 25. 3.

42406626,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAextjD,1624025498,The Left’s Bitcoin Dilemma,"It has often been said that the creation of Bitcoin was rooted in a libertarian or even anarcho-capitalistic ideology, and there are even some public comments from the peer-to-peer electronic cash system’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, to support this theory.      Many of the earliest bitcoin adopters and promoters were self-described libertarians who frequented the annual Porcupine Freedom Festival in New Hampshire, and these early supporters of the technology were largely motivated by the cypherpunk vision of changing the world through the development of new tools for humanity rather than going through the traditional political process.      If you accept the premise that there is a hardcore libertarian mindset behind the promotion of Bitcoin, then there are obvious reasons for those with left-leaning political beliefs to hate it.    Kyle Torpey is a freelance writer who focuses on Bitcoin.    A bitcoin standard, in which either government-issued currencies are pegged to the crypto asset or everyone is using bitcoin as a currency directly, would make it more difficult to have a large percentage of overall economic activity centralized in the hands of government officials because governments would be forced to tax or borrow to pay for their expenditures, rather than issuing new money and potentially diluting the value of the local fiat currency. Additionally, Bitcoin could make it easier for individuals to hide their savings from Big Brother in a situation where privacy, liquidity, and the circular economy around bitcoin are improved.      Obviously, such concealment would be a blow to the sorts of wealth redistribution programs that are popular on the left. At the same time, Bitcoin's environmental impact has been rising up the policy agenda, giving critics on the left additional ammunition to attack the cryptocurrency and its energy-intensive proof-of-work system.      That said, much of the climate change-focused hysteria around bitcoin mining has, at least up to this point, been based on bad science. In reality, there is an argument to be made that bitcoin mining may help improve the economics of renewable energy sources.      The perception that Bitcoin is an attack on liberal democracy as a whole has caused The Conscience of a Liberal author and Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman to refer to the cryptocurrency network as everything from “libertarian derp” to downright “evil.” More recently, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called for a crackdown on Bitcoin due to its perceived negative effects on the environment. Meanwhile, U.S. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) and U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) have called for outright bans on bitcoin.    Those in power always have an incentive to squash the minority opinion    Of course, the problem with banning bitcoin (outside of the fact that it was built for the specific purpose of avoiding government regulation) is that making a transaction on the Bitcoin network amounts to not much more than broadcasting a string of ones and zeroes over the internet or some other communication channel. Put differently, a ban on using the Bitcoin network necessitates restrictions on free speech. It is not dissimilar to the decades-old debate over the use of strong encryption by the general public, commonly referred to as the Crypto Wars.      So, the real question is: Are left-leaning politicians in the United States and elsewhere going to make an anti-free speech and, to put it bluntly, authoritarian argument to implement their desired Bitcoin policy? Should this policy also be extended to online communications more generally? Where are they going to draw the line? Are Democrats in the United States going to abandon one of the key principles upon which the country was founded?    Read more: David Z. Morris: Elizabeth Warren Versus the Volcano    To be clear, those in power always have an incentive to squash the minority opinion, and the free speech issue speaks to the authoritarian tendencies found on both sides of the aisle. For example, in the United States, both Democrat and Republican presidents have taken authoritarian stances on whistleblowers and political dissidents such as former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. However, those on the left seem more willing to sacrifice their values around free speech when it comes to Bitcoin specifically due to it being a financial phenomenon. Or maybe they just don’t understand the implications of their stances.      To be fair, there are some pro-Bitcoin Democrats out there, from Colorado Governor Jared Polis to President Biden's economic adviser Tim Wu. Additionally, Donald Trump is clearly not a fan of the cryptocurrency.      What many of the people who are uniting around politically motivated technologies like Bitcoin really seem to want more than anything else is less hypocrisy from those in power. It will be interesting to see how left-leaning politicians like Warren react when the free speech implications of their Bitcoin policies are put on full display.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Kyle Torpey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/18/the-lefts-bitcoin-dilemma,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9d33c053f68c04859f56f78c210dff29bb853b4-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406637,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAextp7,1624025086,How the Bitcoin Industry Is Responding to Wall Street's ESG Concerns,"One cryptocurrency asset manager is buying emission offsets. A digital-asset trading platform says it wants to be ""carbon negative"" within 18 months. A new token would wrap bitcoin with carbon credits so that they could trade together as a single asset.      Just a month after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted his concerns about the potential environmental harm from bitcoin mining, sending the cryptocurrency’s price into a tailspin, some industry players are rushing to respond. They’re looking at ways to address the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that might deter big institutional investors from embracing bitcoin.      “They are doing it out of the sense of survival,” said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Internet Enforcement who now works as a consultant.      Though some experts had been warning for years that the bitcoin market’s narrative of “institutional adoption” was on a collision course with the ESG mandate that now dominates the activities of big money managers like BlackRock, it’s too early to tell how much of a difference the latest efforts might make. Will the bitcoin mining industry actually shrink its carbon footprint or just announce ambitious goals and make peripheral adjustments to give big investors cover?      “Bitcoin in its current form is not good for the environment,” said Campbell R. Harvey, an economist and professor at Duke University. “Nobody can argue that this isn’t a true statement.”      Some industry executives have criticized the narrative that bitcoin is particularly bad for the environment, arguing that the adverse climate effects are overblown. As MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said at a meeting this week of the newly formed Bitcoin Mining Council, ""We are not trying to fix bitcoin"" but trying to counter the threat that ""people don't understand bitcoin.""      Another position is that the digital currency's value to the economy and society justifies the energy consumption.      Jesse Powell, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, told Bloomberg in an interview published this week that bitcoin is ""a lot greener than people give it credit for."" Early Thursday, Bitcoin Magazine tweeted out a screen grab of the interview, and Musk tweeted in response: ""Based on what data?""    Read more: Bitcoin Tops $40K as Musk Says Tesla May Accept Crypto in Future    The issue doesn't seem to be going away, with bitcoin now changing hands at around $37,500, well off the all-time high near $65,000 reached in April.      So some big players are moving beyond the rhetoric and denial toward business changes that might help to address or remedy any environmental ills.      Here's a rundown:    Crypto.com wants to be ""carbon negative."" Crypto.com, an app for trading cryptocurrencies, announced in a blog post on May 27 that it had set a goal for the next 18 months of becoming “carbon negative.” ""Starting immediately, the first phase will focus on an assessment of the carbon generated through cryptocurrency trading, deposit and withdrawal activities across all of Crypto.com’s platforms (App, Exchange, NFT, DeFi, and Crypto.org Chain),"" according to the post. ""The second phase will identify the most effective ways to offset the carbon generated, with the support of accredited organizations specializing in carbon offsetting and sequestration."" A third-party auditor will be retained to offer accountability. “The climate crisis is the most pressing issue of our time” CEO Kris Marszalek said in the post.  One River Digital and ""tokenized carbon credits."" The asset management firm has filed for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would be carbon neutral. The company said last week that an overwhelming majority of assets in an existing institutional bitcoin fund had chosen to switch to a new ""carbon neutrality share class."" The firm has ""developed an index (BTC.X) based on the estimated carbon emitted per bitcoin and the market price of the offset required to neutralize that emission,"" according to a press release. ""At today's prices and estimated carbon emissions, this is equivalent to $55 per year, or 0.15% of the cost of a bitcoin. One River buys tokenized carbon credits, validated on a blockchain.""  CoinShares and the ""ESG crypto mining product."" CoinShares, a digital asset investment firm, said in a May 27 press release that it had made a strategic investment in Viridi Funds and that it will advise the manager on ""the first ESG crypto mining product in the U.S.” According to the press release, the move will help ""meet emerging client appetite for these types of products.""  Tokensoft and the ""carbon-neutral bitcoin-backed asset."" Wrapped, a collaboration between tokenization specialist Tokensoft and digital-asset custodian Anchorage, announced a ""carbon-neutral bitcoin-backed-asset"" called Eco BTC (eBTC). According to a press release, the asset will combine bitcoin and carbon credits into a single digital asset, built atop the Celo blockchain platform. The deal will allow ""institutional investors to add bitcoin to their portfolio and meet their fund's sustainability goals,"" Tokensoft CEO Mason Borda said in the statement.    Of course, bitcoin mining represents just one of many industries struggling to adapt to the ESG concerns. According to the Wall Street Journal, General Motors and Ford are boosting investments in electric vehicles to reduce emissions, while utilities including Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy are producing more renewable power.      “The auto industry in America is tackling ESG concerns at the moment,"" said Steve Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager Digital. “However, it doesn’t come under the same level of scrutiny as the crypto industry does.”      Harvey, the Duke professor, says some investors might latch onto the idea that their bitcoin-related investments could be sanitized via carbon credits, but he notes that other investors might not care at all – preferring the returns that might come from fast-moving cryptocurrency markets and disregarding the potential environmental impact.      In the long run, Harvey says, the concerns might be mitigated because “eventually energy production won’t be dirty,”      “Then bitcoin will no longer have this problem,” he said.      None other than Arthur Hayes, founder of the BitMEX exchange (and also a defendant in U.S. federal charges over alleged violations of the Bank Secrecy Act) noted in a blog post last week how crucial the issue had become.      “The ESG narrative is front and center because the most desirable locations for mining bitcoin are those that appear to be ESG-compliant,” Hayes wrote on June 10. “That stamp of approval allows institutional money to check their box, and invest.”      Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, told Bloomberg this week in an interview that solutions to address investors’ concerns might be “something the industry could pay without really setting itself back that much.”      “The answer is that it’s not free to mitigate, but it’s not that expensive,” Bankman-Fried said.

However, the weekly RSI is not yet oversold, which could keep sellers active toward lower support levels.

42406620,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAex72h,1624015053,Bitcoin Remains Relatively Resilient Post-Fed as Fiat Currencies Drop Against Dollar,"Bitcoin is trading in familiar ranges even as the U.S. dollar gains ground in currency markets on the Federal Reserve's interest-rate outlook.      While the top cryptocurrency has dropped 5% to $38,000 since Wednesday's Fed rate guidance, it remains locked in a multi-week range of $30,000 to $40,000, CoinDesk 20 data show.      In contrast, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against the euro, pound, yen and other major currencies, rose above 92.00 early today, reaching its highest level since April, according to TradingView data. Gold and base metals have also taken a beating since Wednesday, pushing commodity currencies like the Australian dollar lower.      The U.S. dollar's rally follows an unexpected hawkish tilt at the Fed. On Wednesday, the central bank brought forward projections for the first post-pandemic interest-rate hikes into 2023, challenging the consensus for a weaker dollar for the rest of the year.      One possible explanation for bitcoin's resilience could be that the cryptocurrency was relatively oversold heading into the Fed's announcement, as QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel.      Prices fell from $58,000 to nearly $30,000 in mid-May after a reported surge in the U.S. consumer price index for April increased concerns that the Fed may consider an early rate hike or reduction of liquidity-boosting asset purchases, which is known as quantitative easing.      The cryptocurrency's bull run ran out of steam in the March-April period, after the annualized growth rate of the U.S. M2 money supply peaked at 21.7% in February. The data show bitcoin was likely the first to take the hit on fears that the Fed would wind down its bond-buying program sooner than expected.      ""Bitcoin, considered by fiat-based institutional investors at the extreme end of the risk spectrum, thrives in quantitative easing (QE), irresponsible fiscal and monetary policy, and doesn't quite like quantitative tightening (QT),"" Messari's Mira Christanto said in a blog post dated May 27. ""Crypto investors no longer have the luxury to focus only on token dynamics but also need to follow global macro, equities, and credit markets to understand the direction of cross-asset flows.""      Bitcoin's resilience could turn out to be short-lived if U.S. economic data continue to paint a positive picture for the economy, amplifying expectations that the Fed will tighten its monetary policy. That could bring more selling pressure from traders who buy bitcoin as a store in value, similar to gold.

The Senate's Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade Committee report on Thursday made several recommendations intended to sharpen the focus of the country's customs bill.      The committee, which was charged with examining the potency of Australia's Customs Amendment (Banning Goods Produced By Uyghur Forced Labor) Bill 2020, has made 14 recommendations ranging from broadening the legislation to empowering the country's border force.      The report underscores the importance of investigating various technologies to track the provenance of goods along the supply chain in order to stop imports produced by slave labor.      Blockchain, along with isotopic labeling and microbiome tracing, could ""empower"" companies and governments to more ""efficiently"" and ""effectively"" trace their supply chains, the report stated.      The Customs Amendment, which was proposed in December by Independent Senator Rex Patrick, seeks to amend the country's Customs Act 1901. If passed, amendments to the bill would prohibit the import of ""slave labor"" goods arriving from the Xinjiang province and other parts of China.      “I am very pleased with the outcome of this important inquiry which has delivered strong bipartisan recommendations for action to prevent the importation of goods produced using forced labor,"" Patrick said in a press statement on Thursday. ""Especially in regard to imports from China made using coerced Uyghur people.”      Australia's relations with China have soured in recent years, because of allegations over the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19, Chinese-instituted tariffs on Australian exports and allegations over China's treatment of its ethnic Uyghur population.      Patrick said given the emergency, the Australian government should move ""without delay"" to implement the Senate committee’s recommendation before years' end.

Later this month, the media giant will launch “Vault by CNN,” an NFT collection minted on the Flow blockchain featuring moments from the cable news network’s 41-year history.      CNN has not specified the exact moments it will include in the first of six weekly releases, but according to a CNN press release, the collection could feature scenes from U.S. presidential elections, key moments in world history and early CNN exclusive footage.      CNN’s NFT collection is one of many recent attempts by well-known companies, including luxury car manufacturer McLaren, to enter the crowded NFT market. The collection is also noteworthy for being one in a series of recent NFT experiments by television networks, like Fox Entertainment’s $100 million investment in an NFT project with Dan Harmon, creator of the ""Rick and Morty"" sitcom.      Unlike most NFT collections, the NFTs in the “Vault by CNN” collection can be bought with fiat. Potential buyers must make an account with a digital wallet called Blocto and may then pay for the NFTs with credit cards via Stripe.      According to CNN, the NFT buyers will then “own the digital copy for collectible purposes,” and be able to display their NFTs, called “Moments,” on a user page in CNN’s Vault website.
