42399139,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVQD,1469050221,DAO Critic Defends Ethereum Hard Fork as 'Rite of Passage',"A Cornell University professor of computer science who has proved to have a knack for pointing out flaws in blockchain code believes the hard fork that occurred earlier today is a sign of maturity for the ethereum platform.  Last month, Cornell's Emin Gün Sirer emerged as a major critic of The DAO, the project whose failings ultimately led to the hard fork, pointing out vulnerabilities in its code and becoming the go-to source for ethereum coders looking to understand what exactly happened and how it could be avoided again.  Though he’s still quick to point out that unforeseen vulnerabilities in the code might persist, he told CoinDesk there are several reasons to be hopeful for the future of ethereum, even after the weeks of drama that ended in today's hard fork.  From an ethereum bootcamp co-hosted with the Ethereum Foundation, Gün Sirer said ""chains change"" because they are responding to the needs of a community, and not necessarily because they are weak.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It’s a point of strength to be able to adapt to that change, to be able to respond to it, to be able to do it in an orderly fashion. Ethereum just demonstrated this. I think this is a rite of passage for ethereum.""  A lesson for every currency  After weeks of planning, and several coordinated efforts to help achieve consensus among the miners on the etherum blockchain, the hard fork occurred today at approximately 14:30 UTC, returning about $140m worth of funds lost in the collapse of The DAO to an account available to its original investors.  According to Gün Sirer, the hard fork should be seen as a sign of growth not just for ethereum, but a lesson for anyone using cryptocurrency of any sort, or for that matter, fiat currency.  In particular, he describes the belief among some cryptocurrency users that the length of a blockchain is the source of its value as ""long-chain fetishism"" that misses the point of what really gives any currency value.  He said:  ""The most important lesson, at least for me, and I hope for the public at large as well, is that the fiat currency in my pocket and also the cryptocurrency in various different wallets that I have, they all have value because of community properties, because the community believes them.""  No rest for the weary  Beginning today and for the next week, Gün Sirer is co-hosting an etherum bootcamp with both the Ethereum Foundation and the inventor of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, as part of an effort to build out that community.  Thirty-eight guests have enrolled to participate in the event from all over the world, half of which come from Cornell University, where it is hosted. Coding instructors include Buterin and three other Ethereum Foundation members and multiple Cornell University staffers. Participants range in experience from early-stage developers to high-level executives from several companies interested in exploring ethereum.  But not everything about building such a strong community is positive, according to Buterin. In email to CoinDesk, Buterin explained that ethereum users were ""lucky"" the hack gave them time to respond, but that might not always be the case.  Buterin wrote:  ""The next time around, we may well not have such an opportunity at all. Additionally, forks will only get more and more difficult to implement over time as the community grows.""

42399152,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVd0,1469046334,Nearly Half of All DAO Funds Withdrawn After Ethereum Hard Fork,"Roughly 43%, or nearly half of all funds associated with The DAO, have now been withdrawn by former project investors.  The activity comes hours after developers on the ethereum network executed a hard fork of its blockchain, a network change meant to specifically reverse the failure of The DAO project and move funds tied to its compromised smart contracts into a new account.  Data  from the ethereum blockchain shows users began removing funds in ether shortly after the fork. At press time, the address for the new smart contract shows 6.6m ETH (or roughly $80m).  This figure was down from the roughly 11.58m ETH (worth $145.2m) available in the original smart contract shortly after its creation. In total, 1,188 withdrawal transactions have been executed in the first six hours the funds were available, a figure that can be tracked more closely here.  Prior to its mid-June collapse, The DAO had an estimated 23,574 users who had purchased DAO tokens, and would therefore be eligible for refunds. Should the withdrawal transaction figures represent individual users, this would mean roughly 5% of DAO users have now received refunds.  That such a small number of users could withdraw nearly half of the smart contract's ether funds is not surprising.  Those funds were originally exchanged for DAO tokens during a crowdsale earlier this summer, and while the total The DAO raised was impressive, its number of investors was comparably small.  Previous CoinDesk Research analysis revealed the top 500 DAO addresses held more than 70% of all DAO tokens, while the top 50 held over 40% of the funds. Developers and individuals close to both the ethereum project and Slock.it, the startup that wrote code for The DAO, were also among those who held funds in the project, an issue that proved controversial in previous weeks.  Regardless, reports on social media indicate that users began pulling out their ethers this morning to a mostly positive response.  Block explorers indicate that not all transactions were successful, though errors were said to be unrelated to the contract design, attributable instead to errors such as the failure of those executing transactions to pay the necessary gas fees. Users were paying on average 1 cent to execute transactions at press time.

42399149,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVa3,1469040785,Petition Pushes CFTC to Clarify Rules on Blockchain 'Delivery',"US law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP has filed a petition with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), calling on the agency to provide more clarity regarding the definition of ""delivery"" in blockchain-based transactions.  Signed by Steptoe partner Micah Green and senior policy advisor (and former CFTC commissioner) Michael Dunn, the petition centers around actions the agency took against Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex in June. At the time, the company paid $75,000 amid allegations that it never properly delivered certain funds to traders.  While Bitfinex was fined, it also settled its charges with the CFTC. However, the petition takes issue with the fact that the exact changes Bitfinex implemented to come into compliance were not made public, and that as such, any clarity as to how it satisfied the CFTC’s definition of delivery was never disseminated to the wider market.  Green and Dunn wrote:  ""Absent a definitive Commission statement identifying the essential elements, participants must attempt to discern what is lawful and what is problematic through assessments of enforcement orders, which are focused on a single entity at a time and may or may not be instructive.""  The petition goes on to argue that the definition of custody in a blockchain environment remains a gray area, one the authors assert is ""harmful"" to digital currency and blockchain startups.  For example, those backing the petition assert that the CFTC's ruling suggest Bitfinex ran into trouble by holding the private keys associated with bitcoins loaned to traders, an action the CFTC interpreted as meaning the bitcoins in question were never actually delivered.  Such wording, the petition contends, could lead to interpretations that custody and wallet control need to be directly linked in blockchain environments. Further, when combined with the long settlement times on public blockchains, these observers say, this might make certain business models based on prompt delivery more difficult to execute.  To better understand and address such concerns, the letter requests that the CFTC undertake a rulemaking process that would find it soliciting feedback from the wider community on how it could best determine a more formal definition.  ""Given the novelty of both the cryptocurrency market and the use of blockchain technology, engaging the public through a notice-and-comment rulemaking process would help to inform the Commission about the relevant considerations in developing the elements of ‘actual delivery’ and the potential unintended consequences in rendering such an articulation,"" the notice reads.  More broadly, the filing again raises questions regarding definitions of custody that have long been cited as an issue with existing US state laws meant to cover blockchain-based digital currencies.  First appearing in the conversation around New York’s state-specific licensing regime, the BitLicense, technology advocacy groups have begun to more actively lobby for definitions that they believe better fit the technology's design in recent years.

42399143,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVU9,1469034921,Washington State Utility Raises Power Rates on Bitcoin Miners,"A Washington State utility is raising rates on bitcoin miners, months after a dispute with the local industry began over its power usage.  The Chelan County Public Utility District (PUD) announced earlier this week that, effective January 2017, electrical rates will rise for so-called ""high-density load customers"", or those that use 250 kilowatt hours per square foot per year. The definition, as stated by the PUD, is intended specifically to cover server farms and bitcoin mines, or data centers that specifically service network transactions.  The increase won't be immediately felt by the region’s bitcoin miners, however, as the PUD said that a five-year transition period is being initiated for existing customers who can show they’ve made ""substantial investment"" and meet additional criteria.  The process dates back several years, to when the industrial bitcoin mining boom began. At the time, several firms sought to establish a presence in the hydroelectric power-rich Chelan County. A reported influx of phone calls and on-site visits by prospective bitcoin miners prompted PUD officials to put a moratorium on new high-density load customers in late 2014.  Bitcoin miners run high-powered machinery in a race to discover the next block of transactions, a process for which they earn rewards from the network. Cheaper power means more profitability for miners, and some of the least expensive electricity can be found in Washington State, particularly in places like Chelan.  PUD representatives said in statements that they believe the rate increase is a fair one, resulting from months of discussion between utility officials and members of the public.  ""There was a lot of individual and collective effort involved in bringing this proposal forward, and I think it's a good product,"" Commissioner Dennis Bolz said in a statement.  It’s not yet clear how bitcoin miners in the region are taking the news. Phone calls to miners in Chelan County were not immediately returned.  In interviews with CoinDesk earlier this year, miners working both in Chelan and in nearby counties criticized the planned rate increase harshly, with at least one suggesting that the move could put them out of business.

42399156,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiVfx,1469024581,Ethereum Executes Blockchain Hard Fork to Return DAO Funds,"The much anticipated hard fork of the ethereum blockchain has been implemented, giving those building on the decentralized application network at least the potential for stability after weeks of controversy and sometimes terse disagreements in the wider community.  At approximately 14:30 UTC today, China-based ethereum miner BW.com mined the ethereum blockchain's 192,000th block. Seconds later the mining pool also mined the first block on the new blockchain, which returned funds lost in the collapse of The DAO to an account available to its original investors.  The achievement, which returns approximately $40m worth of ether from an account owned by an unknown hacker to a new address, is being met with celebration by many members of the ethereum community. However, the actual implications of the decision, which essentially showed that a supposedly immutable blockchain history can be altered, is yet to be seen.  Co-founder of ethereum startup Slock.it and author of most of the DAO code, Christoph Jentzsch, wrote on his company’s blog to acknowledge those who helped pull off the implementation and execution of the hard fork code.  Jentzsch wrote:  ""What I witnessed during this time was remarkable feedback and support from many different sides. A lot of work needed to be done, and many people came literally out of nowhere and helped in many ways.""  The hard fork of the ethereum blockchain moved the funds tied to The DAO to a new smart contract designed to to one thing: let the original token owners withdraw the funds. The token owners were given the original exchange rate of 1 ETH to 100 DAO tokens.  The original compromise occurred on 17th June when funds from The DAO, a distributed autonomous organization built as a fund for ethereum-based projects, were drained into an account controlled by an unknown hacker or group of hackers. Following multiple so-called white hat attacks designed to move the remaining funds to accounts controlled by the tokenholders, a series of efforts were attempted to recover the funds, or find another course of action.  However, by early this week, the hard fork option had emerged as the clear path forward, a decision that was influenced by the fact that, due to the rules in The DAO's code, the funds would have been made available to those who took the funds from the original contract on 27th July, at which point they could have been potentially sold or otherwise exchanged.  Any extra balance that now remains is expected to be withdrawn and distributed by the DAO curators, individuals appointed yesterday to oversee the distribution. Earlier curators appointed prior to the launch have stepped down, according to Alex van de Sande, who was among the original curators.  Multiple hard fork counters set up leading up to the event had yesterday predicted it would occur almost two hours later than it did, and it’s currently unclear why there was a discrepancy, though one likely possibility is that the ethereum blocks are mined at an inexact period of approximately 14 seconds.  Since the hard fork, an additional 153 blocks have been successfully mined. However, as suggested earlier, the move may not be without continued controversy.  The decision to hard fork was initially met with resistance by some members of the ethereum community who were concerned it might undermine the perception that the blockchain was immutable, and that contract agreements, once settled to the blockchain, would be final.  With major banks and startups alike now building with ethereum, this is a concern that will likely be followed closely.  CoinDesk is following this developing story.

The trialhttps://ripple.com/insights/mizuho-pilot-ripple-cross-border-payments/  will find the Japan-based financial services firm and R3 member, along with SBI Holdings, using Ripple's payment solutions to explore how cross-border payments could be conducted between the financial institutions. R3 will act as the consultant on the project.  Representatives from Ripple said the trial is expected to evolve to the point where real payment information, and eventually, real funds, are moved between the companies. The startup, which has raised $38.6m to date, said the test could become live before the year’s end.  The trial is the latest by Mizuho that will focus on settlement, following a trial announced in March in which it used the Open Assets protocol, a top-level protocol on the bitcoin blockchain, for cross-border securities settlement.  That test included participation from Fujitsu and Fujitsu Laboratories and comes amid a broader exploration of blockchain technologies by Asia-based financial institutions.
