42382478,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ronJ,1565130603,VeChain Tapped to Provide Transparency for China's Wine Trade,"The VeChain-powered wine traceability platform now oversees more than 20 wines in Shanghai’s Pilot Free Trade Zone, according to a company statement on Tuesday.  Launched in 2018  , the Shanghai Wine and Liquor Blockchain Alliance has sought to improve the logistics and quality standards for the growing industry, as middle-class Chinese consumers develop a taste for the supple intoxicant. However, as consumption grows, so does counterfeiting. In a 5 month stint, Chinese authorities reportedly seized nearly 65,000 counterfeit Penfolds bottles, worth upwards of $4 million.  As a means of combating the illicit Chinese wine trade, Shanghai Waigaoqiao Direct Imported Goods Co (D.I.G.), a major importer in the region, partnered with the public blockchain project VeChainThor to develop an authenticating system for luxury wines. The latest wine registered is the Australian cabernet sauvignon Penfolds Bin 407, which retails at around $60 according to Vivino.  The blockchain-strapped bottles are equipped with a near-field communication (NFC) chip to track the vintage’s provenance. Additionally, the wine traceability platform is overseen by two governmental bodies, and the information stored on the blockchain is independently verified by auditors like DNV GL.  D.I.G. reports a 10 percent increase in sales for vintages tracked by the authenticating platform since launch.  This is in line with sales of other blockchain-enabled foodstuffs. The French supermarket chain Carrefour’s reported a jump in sales after tracking the production of their Mousline potato puree with Nestle's blockchain technology.  When announced, the wine traceability system was expected to expand to over 500 retail stores within Shanghai. Currently, three stores carry VeChainThor-enabled Penfolds Bin-407 bottles.  The enterprise-focused VeChain ecosystem aims to improve supply chain management. Several firms such as automobile manufacturers BMW and Renault, and global quality registrar DNV GL, use the management system to track products throughout their manufacturing lifecycle.

42382469,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9roaj,1565123450,Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary Questions Bitcoin's Role as 'Safe Haven',"The debate over bitcoin's role as a ""safe haven"" asset hit mainstream media on Tuesday, following reports that bitcoin's recent price run could be attributed to Chinese capital flight.  Speaking with CNBC on Tuesday, businessman and co-host of NBC’s “Shark Tank” Kevin O’Leary and Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony ""Pomp"" Pompliano took opposing sides in the conversation. Pompliano is a well-known bitcoin bull, while O'Leary played the role of skeptic.  Over the course of the conversation, Pompliano said over half of his net worth now resides in the world's largest cryptocurrency by total value. O’Leary sought to describe the investment strategy as foolish in return.  “In any one stock, never more than 5 percent, in any one sector, never more than 20 percent,” O’Leary said. “I teach this stuff! You never go beyond concentrations of that nature! Fifty percent! Shame on you! That’s nuts!”  Responding to bitcoin’s role as a safe haven, Pompliano said the asset is negatively correlated with every other major asset class.  “[Morgan Creek Digital] has been banging the drum for over a year now saying that this is a non-correlated asymmetric asset. If you look at times of global instability like in May, where we are lobbing tariff threats and the trade wars are going on, bitcoin is up 55 percent. It's got a negative correlation, -0.9 to S&P negative -0.8 to gold.”  O’Leary’s main point concerned alternative cryptocurrencies.  “If this is really such a great idea, why is there really only one Vegas game working?"" he asked.  Two years ago, O’Leary explained, he purchased $100 of various cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, XRP, ethereum, and stellar lumens. His holdings are down about 70 percent.  Pompliano responded by saying no exposure to the asset class was irresponsible for financial institutions, a claim he's frequently voiced via his popular Twitter account.  CNBC’s segment on bitcoin as a safe haven was an extension of the currency discussion occurring around China. Yesterday, the United States labelled China a currency manipulator.  The U.S. announcement fell on the heels of reports between Chinese capital fleeing into alternative investments like cryptocurrencies. A recent report by CoinDesk said between $10 and $30 million Tether daily trade volume is conducted in Moscow from mostly Chinese accounts.

42382476,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rojX,1565118008,The City of Seoul Will Create a Cryptocurrency for Citizen Rewards,"The Seoul Metropolitan Government will establish its first blockchain-based administrative services in November, according to a report in the Korean-language blockinpress.  At a conference held last month and attended by city officials and representatives of the private sector, specifics of the roll out were discussed, with timelines and goals established. The meeting seemed to revive an initiative that had lost some momentum since first being announced late last year.  Three priorities were set for completion by the November deadline. The city's blockchain points system will be introduced and residents of Seoul will receive S-coins for the use of public services. They will be able to redeem those points for rewards. Services that generate the coins include paying taxes and participating in public opinion polls.  Seoul's point system will integrated with ZeroPay, a city-government sponsored QR-code-enabled network established last December. It allows customers to pay for goods and services using their phones and does not charge merchants commissions.  In addition to the S-coin, a blockchain service for submitting qualifications without paper documents is also on the list for completion by November, as is the enhancing of the Seoul Citizens Card with blockchain to enable digital authentication for the use of public services.  By the end of the year Seoul would like to have its part-time workers rights program up and running. The blockchain-based system will allow part-time and temporary employees to sign simple contracts with employers, keep track of their work histories, and maintain time sheets. It will also help them properly register for the county's four major social insurance programs. The aim is to improve trust and relations between small companies and part-time workers.  Other programs mentioned but not with year-end completion deadlines include smart healthcare, donation management and online certificate verification.  While the blockchain services will be controlled by the city, they will be operated by private enterprises.  Seoul has been discussing the implementation of a blockchain strategy for some time. Mayor Park Won-soon has campaigned on a promise to implement relevant solutions for the city, and the Blockchain City Seoul Promotion Plan was announced last October.  When it was introduced, 14 blockchain administrative projects and a 2022 completion date were mentioned. A total of 127.3 billion won ($105 million) was to be committed to the plan.  Since then, very little has happened in terms of actual progress. The July meeting was the first tangible sign that anything material is in the works.

42382444,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rld3,1565114422,Craig Wright's Counsel Rebuts Forgery Evidence in Ongoing Lawsuit,"Craig Wright’s ongoing contempt hearing failed to reach a sanctions verdict on August 5.  As part of a $10 billion lawsuit brought by Ira Kleiman, brother of Wright’s former business partner Dave Kleiman, Wright previously failed to disclose a complete list of his bitcoin holdings acquired prior to Dec. 31, 2013. Judge Bruce Reinhart heard testimony at a U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach to determine an appropriate, possible remedy to this offense.  These holdings may contain bitcoin collectively mined by Wright and Kleiman and may be held in the 1.1 million bitcoin Tulip Trust, at the heart of the case. Wright has claimed his access to the trust is limited through a complicated cryptographic scheme.  Wright’s defense, led by Amanda McGovern of Rivero Mestre, deposed Steven Shadders, Chief Technology Officer of nChain, to lay groundwork why the self-declared inventor of bitcoin, Wright, has been unable to provide complete information regarding his earliest acquired bitcoin.  Shadders, who has publicly affirmed Wright’s claim to be the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, testified that beginning sometime in June he began work on extracting possible holdings. Using six criteria, he winnowed down potential addresses to around 27,000 on Wright's behalf.  Shadders testified he had only examined addresses dated between Jan, 3 2009 and Aug, 21 2010, that were unspent, were used only once, contained a particular pay-to-public script pattern, and showed a nonce field value between 0 and 58. Despite the rigid criteria, Shadders also testified his algorithm contained a “quirk” that may have included addresses that do not belong to Wright. He allegedly made this discovery in the days leading up to the hearing.  As part of the cross-examination the prosecution probed Shadders regarding his travel expenses to and from the June 28 hearing at which Wright testified, seemingly to indicate Shadders may have been paid for his efforts.  Shadders declined a request for comment and Wright did not appear in court.  Emails, invoices, and BitMessages  As part of this civil and criminal hearing the prosecution called Matthew J. Edman, Director at Berkeley Research Group, as an expert witness in metadata and cryptography. According to his testimony, a number of emails and BitMessages purportedly sent between Dave Kleiman and Wright, as well as documents pertaining to the Tulip Trust show evidence of tampering.  Though Edman spoke to inconsistencies found between multiple versions of documents, including in timestamps and email headers, he was unable to speak to the possible motivation behind the changes and therefore could not reasonably assume the documents show evidence of fraud.  Edman frequently spoke to circumstantial evidence that suggests Wright manipulated documents to weave a narrative around the establishment and chain of custody of the Tulip Trust, though the defense was able to push back during a cross examination.  Wright’s counsel argued that though metadata may place an email as having been edited in Eastern Australia's timezone, where Wright was residing at the time, it does not conclusively speak to who or why an edit was made.  Similarly, the defense argued an invoice relating to the Tulip Trust may have been a template after hearing Edman opine the document was inauthentic for showing signs of editing.  As it stands, a hearing has been scheduled for August 26 where both defense and prosecution will give their closing arguments. Judge Reinhart may determine a remedy for contempt of court.

42382450,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rljL,1565103605,tZERO Patents Tech for Recording Trades on Public Blockchains,"Security token trading platform tZERO has been awarded a patent for a way of recording trading data on public blockchains.  The company, a subsidiary of retail giant Overstock, announced Tuesday that the patent for its new tech, dubbed ""Time Ordered Merkle Epoch (TOME) methodology,"" had been awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  The firm explains:  ""TOME is a base-layer technology that uses digital signatures to record and verify time-series data such as trades, executions and settlements. This technology enables low-latency systems, including traditional matching engines or private blockchain ledgers, to be anchored into immutable public blockchain ledgers,"" the company's announcement says.  The technology will allow tZERO to record trades as hashes anchored on a public blockchain, verify previous trades and keep an immutable record of the transactions on its platform, according to the announcement.  The method, tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi said, ""can be used in our suite of products, as well as licensed to companies across various industries that are seeking to maintain a tamper-proof and auditable record of time-series-based data.""  It can also link the settlement of tokenized securities on a public blockchain with legacy trading systems and anchor data about the resulting on-chain settlements into public blockchains, the company said.  ""For example, off-chain trade data and on-chain settlement data occurring on an Ethereum mainnet can be combined and anchored into the Bitcoin blockchain for added resiliency, security and transparency,"" tZERO explained.  TZERO, launched for trading in January, is designed as an alternative trading system (ATS), a limited version of a securities exchange to trading tokenized private equity. It started with its native equity token, tZERO Preferred (TZEROP), with ambitions to be an issuance platform for other companies that want to tokenize their securities.  So far, the second token that was made available on the platform is Overstock's own digital stock, the Digital Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock, previously known as Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred Stock, or OSTKP — an early blockchain experiment by Overstock issued back in 2016.  The platform has so far seen meager trading volumes, as only the accredited investors could register and only one token has been available to trade. However, this month, the lock-up period for TZEROP tokens (issued under Regulation D) expires, at which point retail investors will be allowed access to the asset.  Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne previously told CoinDesk he expected to see a boost in trading activity on tZERO after that point.  On August 8, Overstock will conduct a Q2 earnings call where the Overstock and tZERO leadership will share the company's current state and future plans.  The company has previously won a similar patent outlining how it could merge legacy trading systems with cryptocurrencies and digital asset tech.

Letters requesting lists of customers and transaction data have landed on the doorsteps of at least three exchanges doing business in the U.K. – Coinbase, eToro and CEX.IO – in the last week or so, the sources said. None of the three firms would comment by press time.  “HMRC is looking to work with exchanges when it comes to finding information on people who have been buying and selling crypto. I think they will only go back a couple of years, two or three years,” said one industry insider.  The source pointed out that it would be very difficult to provide ten years' worth of information for any platform, adding:  “If they [HMRC] do only go back two or three years, I think the interesting thing here is, that the individuals who went into crypto very early on in 2012-13 will not be affected. The ones who probably made the largest gains won't be affected, it will be the people who came in around the time crypto peaked.""  In response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) Request submitted by CoinDesk, HMRC said it was withholding details about its demands for information since disclosing them could jeopardize the assessment or collection of tax.  But the agency confirmed such demands are within its remit, saying:  “These exchanges can retain information on their clients and the transactions that they have completed. These transactions may result in potential tax charges and HMRC has the power to issue notices requiring exchanges to provide this information.”  HMRC's move is following a pattern set by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other governments.  Last month, the IRS began sending warning letters to over 10,000 Americans who it says participated in virtual currency transactions but did not report them properly.  In the past, Coinbase has fought against what is known as a ""John Doe"" summons; an attempt by government agencies to gather hitherto unknown customer information, including taxpayer ID, name, birth date, address, and historical transaction records.  In December 2016, the Internal Revenue Service issued the summons demanding that Coinbase produce a wide range of records relating to approximately 500,000 exchange customers. In a partial victory for the company, a court order compelled it to produce records for only 13,000.

42382453,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rln7,1565096438,Cosmos Will Have 3 Coding Languages – Here's Why That Matters,"In a move that could compromise ethereum’s long-held dominance as the world’s top platform for smart-contract development, blockchain interoperability project Cosmos will offer users the choice to code in at least three different programming languages.  The first language to be supported on Cosmos is called Ethermint, a direct replica of ethereum’s smart contract language Solidity. Aimed at making it easier for ethereum developers to port their applications to the Cosmos network, the Ethermint project has been in the works since as early as 2016, said Zaki Manian of Tendermint, the company that built Cosmos.  The second coding language, called Secure EcmaScript (SES), is a version of JavaScript built for secure smart contract deployment by blockchain startup Agoric. Once the native Cosmos Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is fleshed out, the Agoric blockchain and its SES programming language will be easily accessible to Cosmos users, said Agoric CEO Dean Tribble.  Last but not least, JP Morgan blockchain spin-off Kadena announced Tuesday it too would be building a version of its native smart-contract language, Pact, for the Cosmos ecosystem. Its entrant to the Cosmos coding arms race is called Kadenamint.  “We’re committing to getting an industry-level smart contract language on [Cosmos] to give developers more deployment choices,” Kadena founder Stuart Popejoy told CoinDesk.  According to Popejoy, the comparative strengths of Kadenamint outperform that of Ethermint in every way.  “We see Pact as the standard for smart contract languages because Pact is just better than Solidity,” Popejoy said, adding:  “Every single developer that comes to use it gets things done faster. It’s safer. We have formal verification baked into the language. It’s designed for safety.”  In all fairness, ethereum developers are well aware of the limitations of Solidity and the virtual machine built to execute Solidity’s code. Called eWASM, the next major ethereum upgrade dubbed ethereum 2.0 will replace ethereum’s virtual machine and enable developers to code in multiple different programming languages.  Even so, Popejoy remained skeptical about eWASM and ethereum 2.0 saying the criticisms of ethereum’s virtual machine and Solidity “could have been addressed a long time ago” but weren’t – due to poor leadership.  “I wouldn’t consider them competitors but as it is, I consider them legacy,” said Popejoy about ethereum. “They did a good job in getting smart contracts out there and getting people thinking about it but that’s going to be a footnote.”  New competition  The new competitors differ from Solidity by placing a stronger emphasis on security as opposed to immutability and unstoppability.  “We’re building a platform with a security model that normal developers can understand,” said Agoric’s Tribble. “To us, the biggest problem with ethereum and Solidity is they have the wrong security model. Even security experts can’t get it right.”  Unlike Solidity, both Pact and SES employ an object-capability security model. This means that permissions in a smart contract can be dynamically and rapidly updated to give users access to different parts of application data in a safe way.  Tribble describes the model similar to being able to give your car keys over to a valet without also handing over the rights to car ownership.  Said Tribble:  “That’s typical of identity-based access control where the model of security used is such that the authority that I’m able to give you is either too much or too little. It’s not appropriate for the business interaction we’re trying to have.”  In Tribble’s view, porting object-capability security to smart contracts is the kind of innovation that will signal to the rest of the mainstream developer community that the blockchain industry is ready for mass adoption.  “For mainstream folks, having people that are addressing different parts of the market and visibly overlapping as competitors is actually healthy,” said Tribble. “That means there’s a real market.”  From the perspective of Manian, Cosmos is the ecosystem that can support and host this fast-growing market for smart contracts and decentralized application development. At the same time, he warns that in his view, Cosmos will not and simply cannot replace ethereum entirely because ethereum is much more than a technology.  “Ethereum is so much more than software. Ethereum, the ethereum community, the users of the ethereum blockchain, the faith people have in the core developers. All of that is wrapped up into one thing and that is the ethereum user experience,” Manian said, adding:  “We’re just creating new developer possibilities.”  Cosmos founder Jae Kwon via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/06/cosmos-will-have-3-coding-languages-heres-why-that-matters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad25cf025d14ed288c609b6d6f0628076c96b85b-2451x1631.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382468,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rlbn,1565090140,Man Takes Bitcoin Miner Seller to Tribunal Over Electricity Bill and Wins,"A Malta-based bitcoin miner has taken action after getting a shock when he received his electricity bill.  As reported by Malta Today, the unnamed man had bought a bitcoin miner from local IT firm 3 Group, but found that the power costs were greater than the value of the bitcoin earned by mining with the device.  He therefore took his complaint to Malta's Consumer Claims Tribunal, saying the unspecified €2,600 ($2,900) miner was noisy and did not make profit.  Dario Azzopardi, CEO of 3 Group, did not contest the complaint and the tribunal decided that the customer should be refunded €2,000 ($2,240).  However, since the decision, the Consumer Claims Tribunal has issued a warning against Dario Azzopardi of 3 Group, saying he has ""not honoured the decision delivered by the Consumer Claims Tribunal.""  The tribunal said in the statement on Tuesday:    ""The Tribunal noted that even though Mr Dario Azzopardi has been served with the Notice of Claim, the date and the time of the hearing, he did not attend the tribunal sitting. Furthermore, Mr Azzopardi did not submit a written response to this claim. To the Tribunal this meant that the trader was not contesting the claim.      Mr Azzopardi was ordered by the Tribunal to pay the consumer the amount of €2,000. The Tribunal also ruled that the ownership of the engine reverts to the trader after the payment is made.""    The balance between running (mostly power) costs, crypto market prices and the amount of cryptocurrency earned by a mining machine is the fundamental factor that controls the mining of proof-of-work blockchains. As part of the process of securing the blockchain and recording transactions, bitcoin has so-called an automatically adjusting ""difficulty"" that controls how easy it is for miners to crack the mathematical problem that earns them their rewards.  The inbuilt mechanism is designed to keep blocks being produced at roughly 10-minute intervals, regardless of how much computer power is applied to the network.  But that difficulty requires these days powerful processors called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are notoriously power hungry. As such, people and firms entering the mining industry need to take into account whether their miners will actually earn a return on their investment. There are online calculators that will help this process.  Recently, bitcoin has seen a record amount of computing power dedicated to securing its blockchain. According to data from BTC.com, the average bitcoin mining hash rate over the last two weeks has reached 71.43 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s), up from 64.49EH/s on July 23 – a 10.78-percent jump since mid July.

42382455,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rloN,1565084468,Global Regulators Warn on Privacy Risks of Facebook's Libra,"Data protection chiefs from across the globe have united to express concerns over the privacy risks posed by Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency project.  In a joint statement published on Monday by the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), data privacy commissioners from Australia, Albania, Burkina Faso, Canada, the EU, the U.K., the U.S., shared concerns that ""while Facebook and [its crypto wallet-focused entity] Calibra have made broad public statements about privacy, they have failed to specifically address the information handling practices that will be in place to secure and protect personal information.""  Given that Libra is on a speedy timeline for launch (planned for as soon as 2020), the watchdogs added that ""we are surprised and concerned that this further detail is not yet available.""  The privacy commissioners also set out a list of questions that Facebook is expected to address, including how the Libra Network will provide end users with clear information on how their data will be used by project participants and how it will ensure that default privacy setting will ""not use nudge techniques or “dark patterns” to encourage people to share personal data with third parties or weaken their privacy protections.""  In the extensive list of questions, the group further seeks reassurance that Facebook would use ""only the minimum amount"" of personal data as required for the service, and ""ensure the lawfulness of the processing.""  Users' personal data must also ""adequately protected"" and ""simple procedures"" should be provided for Libra users to ""exercise their privacy rights, including deleting their accounts, and honouring their requests in a timely way.""  According to the joint statement, the signees were prompted to air the concerns in part because they have previously had to address events in which Facebook’s handling of users' information ""has not met the expectations of regulators, or their own users.""  The statement comes as the latest call for information on the Libra project. Regulators from nations including Switzerland and Singapore have called for the social media giant to be more open about its plans for the project, while two U.S. Senate committees have hauled Facebook before hearings to discuss the various issues in more detail.  Facebook, for its part, responded that it won’t have access to personal financial information gathered for its planned cryptocurrency. The company's blockchain lead, David Marcus, however, acknowledged that third-parties would potentially be building products such as wallets for Libra.  These third parties would be responsible for how their Libra wallets are built, Marcus said, saying “it will be the responsibility of these providers to determine the type of information they may require from their customers and to comply with regulations and standards in the countries in which they operate.”  In the release of the joint privacy statement, U.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said:  ""I hope this statement will prompt an open and constructive conversation to ensure that data protection is a key part of the design process and that data protection regulators are a key consultative group as the Libra proposals develop.”  Facebook image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/06/global-regulators-warn-on-privacy-risks-of-facebooks-libra,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e956cb95ee109ccbfe832129241eb90d71499696-2560x1708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382459,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rlvv,1565080809,Bitcoin Price Rises Above $12K to Hit One-Month High,"View  Bitcoin's move above $12,000 is backed by an uptick in trading volumes and bullish readings on the daily chart.  BTC could close well above $12,000 today, confirming a falling channel breakout on the daily chart and extend gains toward $13,200 (July 10 high) in the short-term.  The 4-hour chart is reporting overbought conditions and a bearish indicator divergence. So, prices may pull back to $11,800–$11,600 and the bullish UTC close above $12,000 may be delayed till Wednesday.  The bullish case would weaken if prices drop below key average support, currently at $10,545, although that looks unlikely.  Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $12,000 for the first time in four weeks and is reporting gains for the eighth consecutive day.  The top cryptocurrency by market value rose above $12,000 at 06:45 UTC and soon hit a high of $12,298, the highest level since July 10, according to Bitstamp data.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $12,185 on Bitstamp, representing 3.26 percent gains on the daily opening price of $11,800. The cryptocurrency has scored 2–7 percent gains in each of the preceding seven days.  If BTC prints a UTC close above $11,800 today, then the resulting eight-day winning streak would be the longest since June. Back then, prices had rallied for eight straight days, starting from June 19 to June 26. Prior to that, BTC eked out gains for eight consecutive days in December 2017.  The latest winning run looks sustainable as it is accompanied by a rise in bitcoin's dominance rate – the cryptocurrency's share of the total cryptocurrency market. The gauge, as calculated by data source CoinMarketCap, currently stands at 68.5 percent, the highest level since April 2017.  Further, the cryptocurrency seems to have found acceptance above key resistance at $12,000, as seen in technical charts.  So, with the path of least resistance to the higher side, BTC could extend the ongoing rise toward the next major hurdle at $13,200 in the short-term.  Daily chart  BTC is currently trading above the upper edge of the falling channel, currently at $12,000. A UTC close above that level would confirm the breakout and signal a revival of the rally from lows near $4,000 seen on April 1.  The breakout looks likely as the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are rising, indicating a bullish setup. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 print.  Further, the moving average convergence divergence histogram continues to produce higher highs above the zero line, a sign of strengthening bullish momentum.  And, last but not least, buying volumes (green bar) ticked higher yesterday, violating the downtrend line and validating the bullish move in prices.  So, the July 10 high of $13,200 could come into play over the next few days.  4-hour chart  The RSI on the 4-hour chart is reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print, while the MACD has produced lower highs as opposed to higher highs on price (bearish divergence).  So, a brief pullback may precede a rally to $13,200. That said, the bullish case would weaken only if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below the ascending 10-day MA, currently located at $10,545.

42382452,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rllr,1565079312,North Korea Stole $2 Billion in Crypto and Fiat to Fund Weapons Programs,"North Korea is funding its weapons of mass destruction with cryptocurrency and fiat currency stolen from banks and exchanges, according to a confidential U.N. report.  Seen by Reuters, the report – researched by ""independent experts"" and presented to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee last week – says that North Korea has used “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” hacks to collect roughly $2 billion, which is laundered over the web.  Reuters said the North Korean mission to the United Nations did not comment when asked about the report.  The experts are reportedly looking into “at least 35 reported instances of DPRK actors attacking financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges and mining activity designed to earn foreign currency” in around 17 nations. Many of North Korea's hackers operate under the Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency that handles clandestine operations.  The U.N. report said targeting crypto exchanges allowed North Korea “to generate income in ways that are harder to trace and subject to less government oversight and regulation than the traditional banking sector.”  U.S. president Donald Trump has met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un several times in a bid to persuade the country to drop its nuclear weapons program.  Reuters said it asked a U.S. State Department spokeswoman about the U.N. report, and received the response:  “We call upon all responsible states to take action to counter North Korea’s ability to conduct malicious cyber activity, which generates revenue that supports its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs.”  Previous reports have linked North Korea to major hacks at crypto exchanges.  A South Korean agency pointed the finger at its neighbor back in 2018 saying that domestic exchanges had been attacked with the loss of billions of won. It was investigating at the time if the rogue nation was behind the massive hack of Japan's Coincheck exchange, which led to the theft of more than $500 million in cryptocurrency.  More recently, North Korean hackers were said to have been targeting users of the UPbit exchange with phishing email campaign.

Politico reported on Monday the social media giant recruited Susan Zook of Mason Street Consulting, who previously assisted Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), to a team of lobbyists aiming to influence lawmakers on the Libra initiative. Zook told the publication she would work on lobbying Senate Republicans.  The news comes just weeks after the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing over Facebook's controversial Libra cryptocurrency and raised questions about its privacy, data protection, and anti-money laundering issues. David Marcus, the firm's blockchain lead, attended the hearing.  Facebook unveiled the long-anticipated Libra project in June intending to launch a cryptocurrency as a payment tool across global jurisdictions. But several financial regulators have since then raised regulatory concerns over the project's ambition.  According to Politico's report, Facebook has spent more than $7.5 million on lobbying efforts this year. In addition to hiring in-house lobbyists, the company is retaining over a dozen third-party lobbying firms to work on the Libra issue, including the Sternhell Group and the Cypress Group.

42382441,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rlZH,1565064038,A Battle Between Bitcoin Wallets Has Big Implications for Privacy,"Bitcoin privacy wallet Samourai announced last Thursday that its primary competitor, Wasabi Wallet, is the target of an ongoing network attack.  The blog post is the latest in a string of allegations Samourai has leveled against Wasabi since mid-July.  The attack, according to Samourai Wallet, resembles a Sybil attack, where a small number of users falsifies new identities and pretends to be much larger in number. This would mean that the anonymity set, or crowd, in which a user can hide their bitcoin transactions is not actually as large as Wasabi suggests.  “As the Wasabi team has described it, the goal of the Wasabi mixing technique, is to hide your [unspent transaction outputs] in a ‘sufficiently’ large crowd (peers),” Samourai wrote in its blog post. “The current target Anonymity Set in Wasabi mixing is 100 peers.”  That means that if, say, 20 of those peers are actually just one user and the identity of this user is uncovered, privacy levels for all other users in the same mixing pool are reduced.  “With bad user privacy, the crowd gets smaller,” independent bitcoin researcher Max Hillebrand explained to CoinDesk. “If you are one of these other [transactions] that have not been de-anonymized [by an attacker] then your anonymity set is no longer 100.”  Samourai says evidence of Sybil attacks on the Wasabi network dates back to January 2019.  Wasabi has issued its own statements refuting Samourai’s claims, while also issuing allegations of their own against Samourai.  As a result, privacy-minded bitcoin users are questioning the true efficacy of either wallet in hiding the identities of its users.  CoinJoin’ed history  Indeed, the core design of both Samourai and Wasabi actually has more in common than most realize.  Speaking to CoinDesk, the co-founder of Samourai Wallet, who goes by the initials SW, said that at one point in time, Samourai and Wasabi were the same application.  Lead developers TDevD (Samourai) and nopara73 (Wasabi) worked together on building an implementation of long-standing bitcoin privacy tech CoinJoin called ZeroLink.  “We just had a difference in implementation desire,” said SW. “So we split. We forked the project and just implemented it the way we wanted to implement it.”  Samourai’s implementation of ZeroLink (called Whirlpool) has a different pricing mechanism than Wasabi, though this is not the only difference between the two wallet applications. As a result, SW maintains that Whirlpool makes it more expensive for malicious actors in the system to break the anonymity of other users through a Sybil attack.  ‘This is madness’  Wasabi’s Adam Ficsor, who goes by the alias nopara73, counters that divvying up costs later on in the process is actually more “cost-effective” and points out that anonymity using Whirlpool can always be broken given that Samourai relies on a centralized, backend server to process users’ extended public keys.  “Fuck you,” Ficsor wrote in a Medium post on July 21. “How can you take a stupid design decision you made and act like it’d be a significant advantage over another project that clearly has its basics right?”  This issue of sending user addresses to a backend server, Fiscor said in a second blog post, was raised by the creator of CoinJoin, Gregory Maxwell. When Maxwell approached the Samourai team with his concerns, he said on Reddit he was harassed and accused of making false claims.  “When you use the wallet, you send Samourai all of your public keys in the form of an extended public key (XPUB) that let’s Samourai have unique access to all of your current and future addresses,” said Aviv Milner, the community technical support lead for the startup behind Wasabi, zkSNACKs.  This matter of Samourai’s reliance on a backend server is one that SW admits does require the trust of users “that Samourai isn’t trying to sell their public key data to third parties.”  ‘Always mix’  As such, experts say there is no clear winner between Wasabi and Samourai.  “[The two] are based on different assumptions,” Hillebrand said, adding:  “One assumes that the coordinator must not be trusted and that everyone knows what the coordinator knows. The other assumption is that there is an inherent trust in the developers and therefore it’s OK to trust central servers. Now, [what you choose] really depends on the threat model of every individual and each unique case.”  According to Hillebrand, while the basics of the two ZeroLink implementations are the same, in both implementations users are required to take privacy matters into their own hands by ensuring they are abiding by the best practices of the protocol.  Indeed, Kevin Loaec, the managing director of blockchain consultancy Chainsmiths, said any CoinJoin implementation will suffer from the same basic attack vectors.  “Privacy on bitcoin is extremely hard, any mistake from you or other mixing participants will hunt you down in the future as the blockchain is here for all to see,” Loaec told CoinDesk. “The type of wallet you use, the spending habits (time of the day, amounts...) the consolidations you do... everything can be exploited to profile you and reduce the anonymity.”  As such, Loaec, who uses both Wasabi and Samourai wallets, said that for users still deciding on which side of the bitcoin privacy wallet debate to land, there isn’t one right answer.  Concluded Loaec:  “Use CoinJoin, but learn about it and don't assume you are private. Always mix.”  Image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/06/a-battle-between-bitcoin-wallets-has-big-implications-for-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da906d7778f0fbc899a12f3ac1d33c9bdf0b7a1d-1500x1041.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
