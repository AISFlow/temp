42376432,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZSv,1364850906,What is the price of a bitcoin?,"What determines the value of a bitcoin? You might as well ask, “What determines the value of a dollar?” (Or a euro or a yen … or even gold.)  The basic economics of supply and demand helps to account for much of the value of anything: if more people want something than the market is currently supplying, demand outstrips supply and the value of that something rises. Gold, for example, has some inherent value as a relatively rare, shiny metal that can be used to make beautiful jewelry and works of art. However, its perception by so-called “goldbugs” as an inflation-proof commodity often helps to propel its traded value far beyond that inherent worth.  Of course, it’s a bit different when you essentially create a something out of a nothing, which one could argue is the case with bitcoins. What are they, after all, but strings of numbers unconnected to anything in the real world except for algorithms and computing power?  ‘A few million little factors’  But bitcoins clearly have value. Why? This answer from the Bitcoin Forum sums up the reasons well:  “Markets and merchants will in the end keep things flowing. Combined with amount of miners. And a few other million little factors.”  In other words, multiple factors affect the price of the bitcoin virtual currency just as much as they do “real-world” fiat currencies or anything else. We saw that recently, when the value for a bitcoin reached a high of $266 in trading on Mt. Gox in April 2013 before crashing to a low of $50.01 in a matter of days. (Among the reasons: speculators, market-manipulating DDoS attacks on Mt. Gox and other sites, and bitcoin’s sudden “it”-factor appeal.)  From zero to …  According to the historical price data at blockchain.info, bitcoins first showed signs of having a real-life, convertible value in dollars – a whopping 7.4 cents per bitcoin – sometime in the late summer of 2010 … more than a year-and-a-half after the first bitcoins were mined in January 2009.  This doesn’t mean bitcoins weren’t perceived as having any value before that. They were already being exchanged among, spent by and sometimes simply given away by many people in the bitcoin network. (This account in Wired credits Florida programmer Laszlo Hanyecz with the first real-world transaction involving bitcoins, in which Hanyecz sent 10,000 bitcoins to someone in England, who then ordered two pizzas for him using a credit card to pay. At today’s (April 14, 2013) exchange rate of around $140 per bitcoin, that amounts to around $700,000 per pizza! “I don’t feel bad about it,” Hanyecz told Wired in the 2011 article. “The pizza was really good.”)  Which brings us to one more factor that helps, at least in part, to determine the value of a bitcoin: sheer faith.  As another member of the Bitcoin Forum noted in the same thread described above, “Faith in bitcoin determines the price. Whatever increases faith, increases the price, and vice a (sic) versa. This may sound scary, that it is only practically backed by faith and opinion, but the US dollar is based on nothing else as well. It is up to us to supply the faith, and up to the community to support bitcoin to make it succeed.”  The faith and confidence factor  Faith, in the case of bitcoins, though, is backed by well-tested cryptographic techniques and a formula ensuring a predictable, limited supply of the currency. Bitcoin fans would say that gives their choice of currency an edge over traditional forms of legal tender.  In fact, the price of (and, by extension, the faith in) bitcoins has tended to increase when confidence in fiat currencies and the traditional economy has fallen. The most recent bitcoin boom in the spring of 2013, for example, came quick on the heels of news that bank-account holders in Cyprus faced a “haircut” on their savings. To obtain a €10 billion bailout from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Cyprus’ leaders agreed to a seizure of a portion of savings in large, uninsured bank accounts.  Bitcoins, unlike fiat currencies, are also at little risk of inflation or hyperinflation – something that has plagued numerous economies throughout history. With a built-in hard limit of 21 million bitcoins (not expected to be reached until 2140), the virtual currency is instead naturally deflationary … that is, a bitcoin’s value is projected to increase, rather than decrease, over time as each one becomes progressively harder to mine.  While critics warn that a bitcoin economy is at greater risk of a deflationary spiral, supporters argue that’s not the case.  “Everything is the opposite of the popular fractional reserve banking system (because bitcoin isn’t a debt but an asset),” explains the Bitcoin Wiki. “Bitcoins only deflate in value when the Bitcoin Economy is growing.”  Looking for the definitive bitcoin price?

42376426,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZK7,1364847564,How do I buy bitcoins?,"As bitcoins become more widely recognized and used, would-be bitcoin users have a growing number of ways in which they can acquire the digital currency.  In the earliest days, An Introduction to Bitcoins notes, converting a local currency into bitcoins often required a face-to-face encounter with other fans in the same area. Mining new bitcoins into existence was also easier back then, and was possible to do without today’s advanced, energy-intensive (and expensive) mining rigs.  In “The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin,” Wired describes how early adopter Gavin Andresen gave away bitcoins “for the hell of it” via his Bitcoin Faucethttps://freebitcoins.appspot.com/ (now closed). The same article also credits Florida programmer Laszlo Hanyecz with completing the first virtual-currency-for-real-world-stuff transaction: he sent 10,000 bitcoins (around $14 million worth (!) at exchange rates as of April 30, 2013) to someone in England, who then called in Hanyecz’s order for two pizzas and paid for them by credit card.  The exchange route  Nowadays, the most common way for someone to buy their first bitcoins is to go through a bitcoin exchange.  While many bitcoin exchanges handle transactions online, the methods of payment they accept for bitcoin purchases can vary from country to country. This can necessitate the use of an intermediary or two to complete the exchange of a local fiat currency into bitcoins.  This approach can make it difficult to buy bitcoins quickly, as completing a two-, three- or four-step process can take many minutes, hours or even days depending upon the exchange infrastructure accessible to an individual buyer.  For example, Mt. Gox, the most active bitcoin exchange, requires a would-be trader to first deposit bitcoins or a fiat currency into a Mt. Gox account. Because credit cards and PayPal don’t currently use bitcoins, this means using a third-party service such as OKPAY or Dwolla (US only), or initiating an international wire transfer or direct transfer from a verified bank account. Such bank and wire transfers can take anywhere from two to five days to complete. Outside of the US and SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) zone, transfers can take even longer.  All this is likely to change rapidly, however, as the bitcoin economy continues to expand. Mt. Gox, for instance, expects to be able to offer Visa and MasterCard transfers by late summer 2013. Instant bank transfers from some European countries could also be possible by mid-September 2013.  Here’s how …  For now, the bitcoin purchasing process can look something like this:  Lily, a first-time bitcoiner in the US, wants to buy $150 worth of bitcoins. She sets up an account at Bitstamp and – because she doesn’t want to use her bank account information – arranges to transfer funds to her Bitstamp account using the bitcoin payment processor BitInstant.  Choosing BitInstant’s cash deposit option, Lily arranges to transfer her $150 using a local Moneygram station. The BitInstant site directs her to its cash payment partner, ZipZap Inc./CashPayment.com, which sends her to an area retailer from which she can transfer her cash.  Using the Moneygram phone system in the store, Lily provides the customer service representative on the line with the account information she received from BitInstant. Once her details are confirmed, she pays her cash to the store’s cashier and receives a paper receipt that shows her funds have been transferred via Moneygram to ZipZap Inc./CashPayment.com, which then sends the money via BitInstant to her Bitstamp account.  After returning home, Lily checks Bitstamp and sees that she now has $150 (US) in her account. She goes to the “buy” section, selects how much she wants to spend (counting a 0.5 percent Bitstamp fee) and clicks the “Buy bitcoins” link. Within moments, her account shows she is now the proud owner of x number of bitcoins, depending upon the prevailing BTC-USD exchange rate at the time she hit “buy”.  Buying bitcoins in this way is undoubtedly convoluted, time-consuming and inconvenient, making it hard to take advantage in the minute-to-minute ups and downs of the bitcoin market. With the fast changes currently taking place, though, the process is certain to become both quicker and easier over days and weeks, rather than months and years.  More ways to buy … or earn bitcoins  That’s likely to mean not just online, but off. Buying bitcoins face-to-face right now can also be a challenge … not only because there might not be many traders or physical exchanges in your area, but because of the uncertainty of who/what you might be dealing with. One resource to help you locate and research your options is LocalBitcoins.com.  Of course, there’s one more way to acquire bitcoins, and that’s to offer goods or services for sale and accept bitcoins as payment. Sites like CoinWorker.com and Bitquestion (a kind-of ask.com or ehow.com for bitcoins) let users take on small tasks in return for payments via bitcoin, and small-business owners can also arrange to take bitcoin payments via online marketplaces like Etsy or through payment service providers like BitPay.

42376422,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZGL,1364839974,How are bitcoins mined?,"New bitcoins are added to the system about every 10 minutes through a process called “mining.” This involves using computing power to verify bitcoin transactions across the network by solving cryptographic problems called “hash puzzles.”  Bitcoin Mining 101  Here’s how it works:  Every bitcoin holder’s balance is designated by a unique bitcoin address, which is a long string of numbers and letters. Each address features both a private and a public key, together known as a cryptographic key pair.  Bitcoin transactions involve the use of both the private and public keys. A bitcoin holder uses the private key to initiate a transaction; this then makes the public key available to anyone on the network who wants to help verify the transaction.  People on the network who use their computers to verify bitcoin transactions are called miners. Their computers bundle the last 10 minutes’ worth of bitcoin transactions into blocks, then work to solve cryptographic problems to help validate that block.  The cryptographic problem involves producing a hash-based (algorithm-generated set of data) proof-of-work that’s built on the solution to the previous transaction block. In this way, every transaction block is used to validate every subsequent transaction block, producing a blockchain. This makes it essentially impossible to fraudulently manipulate any transaction record, as changing one would change the solutions to all the other transactions in the blockchain built upon it.  The first miner to successfully produce the proof-of-work is awarded a new batch of bitcoins. At first, this was a batch of 50 bitcoins, but the mining reward is halved after every 210,000 transaction blocks to ensure that no more than 21 million bitcoins in all will be generated over time. (This hard limit is expected to be reached in 2140.) As of 2013, the mining reward is a batch of 25 bitcoins; this is scheduled to drop to 12.5 bitcoins in 2017.  The difficulty of solving each cryptographic problem varies according to how many miners are on the network, among other factors. This helps ensure that a new transaction block – as well as a new batch of bitcoins – is generated in a controlled manner every 10 minutes.  Still not got it? Visit the CoinDesk bitcoin information centre article: How bitcoin mining works.  The history of bitcoin mining  The first person ever to mine bitcoins was, of course, the currency’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto designed the bitcoin protocol to deliberately make mining a resource-intensive process, and to adjust the difficulty of that process over time as more miners join the network and as more bitcoins are mined.  The idea behind this was to ensure that new bitcoins are added to the network at a controlled rate and that, over time, the number of bitcoins in each new batch mined is gradually reduced. This helps ensure that the currency ultimately reaches a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins … no more.  Nakamoto’s protocol keeps the brakes on the production of new bitcoins by adjusting the difficulty of mining after every 2,016 new blocks. As more processing power is detected on the network, the difficulty of solving a block is adjusted upward.  In the earliest days of the currency, mining was easier and almost anyone with a CPU (central processing unit) could download the bitcoin client and try their hand at mining. Today, that’s no longer considered a viable option – the power a CPU uses for every hash would end up costing far more than the value of any bitcoins it eventually succeeded at mining.  As the number of bitcoin miners on the network grew and the difficulty of mining increased, hardcore bitcoin fans turned to ever-more powerful and specialized servers called bitcoin miners. At first, these were GPU-driven, but now they’re increasingly using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC).  For now, ASIC technology is basically the “end of the line” in terms of mining power, according to We Use Coins. ASIC-based bitcoin miners might be incrementally improved in terms of hashing power or power usage, the site notes, but no other disruptive technology appears to be on the horizon that could make mining either exponentially more powerful or more energy-efficient.  Want to get involved? Then read our guide on how to setup a bitcoin miner.  Everyone into the pool  For those who don’t want to make a major technology investment but still want to try mining, there’s another option: a mining pool. By joining a mining pool, bitcoin fans can combine their computing power with others in hopes of increasing their chances of solving hash puzzles.  When a batch of coins is successfully mined, members of a pool generally divide the reward in one of several ways, such as according to each member’s share position in the pool or each one’s hashing contribution. Other pools might pay members a flat reward for each share solved.  Participating in a mining pool generally requires a fee of some kind.

42376438,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AZZD,1364836753,Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?,"The bitcoin economy has become a lively and ever-more crowded place since the first batch of 50 bitcoins – the “genesis block” – was computed into existence on Jan. 3, 2009. But one quiet corner remains: the spot set aside for bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.  As the bitcoin currency approaches its fifth birthday, no one yet has managed to pin down the identity of its parent. But it’s not for lack of trying.  Searching for Satoshi  Is/was Satoshi a real person? Was he (she?!) even Japanese, as the name suggests? Or was “Satoshi” actually a group operating under an invented name? No one knows for sure (or, if they do, they’re not saying.) But here are the generally recognized facts:  Someone using the name “Satoshi Nakamoto” first describes the Bitcoin protocol on a cryptography listserv at metzdowd.com on Nov. 1, 2008. He includes a link to a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” The paper is posted at http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf (where it remains posted today).  The paper lists Satoshi’s email address as satoshin@gmx.com. (Writing in the New Yorker in October 2011, Joshua David described both the email address and http://www.bitcoin.org web address as “untraceable.”)  The bitcoin genesis block is mined on Jan. 3, 2009.  Satoshi announces the release of bitcoin on the cryptography list on Jan. 9, 2009. In addition to providing a link and instructions for running the bitcoin client, BITCOIN.EXE, Satoshi notes, “You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on Options->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks. I made the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to generate coins in just a few hours. It’ll get a lot harder when competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.”  Satoshi’s last post to the metzdowd.com list appears on Jan. 25, 2009.  Satoshi’s last message on the Bitcoin Forum is posted at 6:22:33 pm GMT on Dec. 12, 2010. (Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin Foundation board member and lead developer for bitcoin, reportedly last heard from Satoshi in early 2011.)  Beyond that, would-be solvers of Satoshi Nakamoto’s real identity have pointed to various clues over time: Despite the Japanese name, Satoshi writes in “flawless English,” David points out. In some posts, Satoshi uses British-style spelling (ie, “optimisation”) but in others, he chooses US style (ie, “criticized”). The Bitcoin code features a tag that refers to a Jan. 3, 2009, Times of London headline. The bitcoin.org site was created by a user in Helsinki. “Satoshi” in Japanese means “clear-thinking” or “wise”, “naka” means “inside” and “moto” means “foundation.”  Let the speculation begin  Since Satoshi’s disappearance from the online bitcoin community, speculation has abounded about who he could be.  In his New Yorker article, David theorizes Satoshi could be British computer scientist Michael Clear. Clear denies it. (To respond to the rumors, Clear posted a clarification page onlinehttps://www.scss.tcd.ie/~clearm/bitcoin.html, and recently updated it to add a note commenting that some of the libertarian philosophies surrounding cryptocurrencies “make me feel uncomfortable.”)  Clear, meanwhile, has postulated that Satoshi might be Vili Lehdonvirta, a Finnish IT researcher who’s active in the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy organization for online privacy. Like Clear, Lehdonvirta dismisses the possibility, “laughing” at the suggestion.  NYU journalism professor Adam L. Penenberg followed up David’s article with some speculation of his own in Fast Company. Searching for terminology and turns of phrase similar to those used in Satoshi’s original paper, Penenberg tracks down a 2008 patent application related to encryption keys. By “one hell of a coincidence,” he writes, the patent application was filed just three days before the domain bitcoin.org was registered. That leads Penenberg to conclude that Satoshi could in fact be one of the three inventors named on the patent application: Neal King, Vladimir Oksman or Charles Bry. Bry responds, “I am not Satoshi Nakamoto.” “Wrong person,” Oksman tells him. King says he “never heard of Bitcoin until this question came up.”  Quietly sitting on a fortune?  New Satoshi rumors and speculation continue to pop up regularly, generally becoming more numerous when his unique digital currency rises in market value or makes big headlines. While not attempting to guess who Satoshi might be, security researcher and Certimix.com CEO Sergio Demian Lerner recently posted an analysis on his blog describing how he believes the bitcoin creator is probably sitting on a fortune of one million BTC … well over $100 million (US) as of April 2013.  “It is impressive, isn’t it?” Lerner asks on the Bitcoin Forum. “That’s a good reason to stay anonymous!”  Perhaps, if any of those one million bitcoins that have been quietly sitting unused for so long shows up in a blockchain transaction, new clues could eventually help identify who Satoshi Nakamoto is once and for all.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/01/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
