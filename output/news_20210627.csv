In a tweet responding to fellow bitcoin enthusiast and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, the Mexican billionaire said ""me and my bank (Banco Azteca) are working to be the first bank in Mexico to accept #Bitcoin.""  Lee este artículo en español.  Saylor was commenting on a video featuring Salinas that was shared on Twitter by noted investor and bitcoin advocate Anthony Pompliano.  In the video, Salinas explained how his witnessing hyper-inflation first-hand informed his rationale for investing in bitcoin and why he thinks ""fiat is a fraud."" He also explains why he would take the cryptocurrency over any other asset.  Salinas is the founder and chairman of Grupo Salinas, a collection of companies with stakes in telecommunications, media, financial services and retail stores, per Wikipedia.

42387188,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBlq6T,1624827600,Crypto Long & Short: This Bear Market May Not Last Long,"Cryptocurrencies are in a bear market.      It's not a call to be taken lightly. Analysts have already made bear-market calls prematurely on two occasions this year, numbly applying an off-the-shelf rubric (a 20% drop in a market benchmark).      In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is the benchmark for the overall market. Bitcoin dominance, its share of the estimated total market value of all cryptocurrencies, is down to the mid-40s, and it still has no analogy in equities. If Apple, the largest company in the S&P at a $2.2 trillion market cap, commanded as large a share of the S&P 500 total market cap as bitcoin does of cryptocurrencies, it would be a $17 trillion company. As a result, all cryptocurrency returns generally have a strong correlation to bitcoin.    This column originally appeared in Crypto Long & Short, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter for professional investors.    For bitcoin, 20% drops are quite common, on the way to new all-time highs. Earlier this quarter, we identified a simple method for determining whether such a drop (or rise) has ushered in a new market regime: a change of 20% in the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX), followed by at least 90 days in which bitcoin does not return to its previous high (or low).      The chart above tracks cryptocurrency bull and bear markets across the years, using this methodology. The XBX reached its all-time high on April 14 (UTC): $64,888.99. By April 22, it had fallen by more than 20%, to a low of $50,500. (Since that time, it's fallen as low as $28,825.76.) As of Sunday, 24 days remain until that 90-day threshold.      Predicting that bitcoin won't recover to $65,000 in the next three weeks doesn't feel like a particularly bold move. But this is bitcoin. At the time I'm writing this, the XBX is at $33,493.55. Recovering its ATH would be a 93.7% gain. Since XBX's inception in April 2014, bitcoin has made such a 24-day run not less than 25 times.      Here's why I don't think this July will make it 26 times, but I do think this bear market will be short-lived.    Spot market alternatives    Two alternatives are easing spot market buying pressure right now.    1. GBTC discount    Shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the largest bitcoin fund, have traded at a discount to net asset value since February. That's unlikely to change because a large raft of shares in the trust approach their lockup expiry this July. GBTC cannot be redeemed, but some investors who might have bought bitcoin in the spot market are likely to take advantage of the discount instead. (Disclosure: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk; GBTC is benchmarked to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.)    2. ASIC glut    Beijing's crackdown on bitcoin mining looks to be more than just government by press release. Miners are shutting down across China, resulting in a flood of unused mining equipment.      Bitcoin mining is not for the faint of heart or short of capital, but at some scale it presents investors an opportunity to acquire bitcoin below spot market price. It's unclear whether idled machines in China will be viable in North American operations or in other growing mining centers. If they are, hosting space may not be available. Nevertheless, some large investors who otherwise might buy and hold are no doubt eyeing increasingly attractive capital-expenditure projections in a mine-and-hold alternative.    A rudderless market    Evidence points to a retail-driven run-up in April: Volumes in altcoins, including meme currencies like dogecoin, eclipsed that of bitcoin on spot exchanges. Now, retail buying seems exhausted.      Meanwhile, barometers of institutional participation, such as volumes on LMAX Digital and open interest in CME bitcoin futures, are not showing signs of institutional buyers rushing to buy the dip and take retail buyers' place.      These tea leaves can be misleading, but the quick takeaway is that nobody is in the driver's seat right now. Network data bears this out, with active addresses down on both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.    'Fundamentals' say otherwise    A market interregnum may indicate a short-lived bear regime between bull markets. Some network data supports this analysis.      Bitcoin doesn't have true ""fundamentals"" in the sense that a bitcoin doesn't represent a claim on cash flows. However, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a family of metrics that indicate activity over networks. I wouldn't be so naive as to apply Metcalfe's Law (which predicts effect, not value) to the bitcoin price, but network data does provide another layer of insight, especially when combined with market data.      The chart above, from Glassnode earlier this week, shows that a growing share of the bitcoin that has moved during recent sell-offs has been ""young coins,"" i.e., coins that last moved within the past six months. Short-term investors are selling while longer-term hodlers stand pat. As Coin Metrics' Lucas Nuzzi noted last week, hodlers' unrealized gains haven't hit levels that preceded bitcoin's past major crashes.

On Friday, Binance updated its terms of use as follows:  Binance's withdrawal follows publication of a Statement of Allegations last week against Bybit by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), which accused that crypto exchange of failing to comply with province regulations.  In the preceding 30 days, OSC had issued statements of allegations against two other crypto exchanges, Poloniex and KuCoin, claiming they, too, failed to comply with Ontario's regulations.  On March 29, the OSC warned crypto-asset trading platforms that to operate in the province they must contact OSC staff or face potential regulatory action. Platforms were given until April 19 to discuss how to bring their operations into compliance.  It wasn't clear whether Binance had reached out to the OSC. A company representative said Binance doesn't comment on specific matters regarding regulators.  ""We take our legal obligations very seriously and engage with regulators and law enforcement in a collaborative fashion,"" he said.  The company has advised Ontario-based users to close out all active positions and gave them until the end of the year to withdraw their funds, according to the representative.  Regardless of the exact circumstances, the world where Binance is welcome to do business has grown a little smaller of late. On Saturday, a U.K. financial watchdog issued a warning that Binance isn't authorized to operate there; on Friday, Japan's securities regulator issued a similar statement.
