In collaboration with the Stock Exchange of Thailand, the project, known as Kubix, has been set up to run as an initial coin offering portal for digital tokens, according to a report by the Bangkok Post on Monday.      The report cites Chairman Ruangroj Poonpol of KBank's technology arm, Kasikorn Business Technology Group (KBTG), who said DeFi is a ""key exploration"" for the banking group throughout 2021.      Specifically, the project uses smart contracts built on blockchain technology to allow users to lend and borrow funds from others without relying on brokerages, exchanges or banks to provide traditional services.      ""The project is being explored through KBTG under the second phase of the company's digital transformation program,"" said Ruangroj. Phase two is expected to cover the remainder of this year through to 2023 after having successfully completed its first phase throughout 2018-2020, according to the report.

42406183,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesiDz,1618263555,DeFi Governance Needs Better Tokenomics,"The controversy surrounding the launch of the Fei stablecoin protocol last week reveals a lot about decentralized finance's (DeFi) problems with tokenomics. We know what a governance token offers its holders – the right to vote on changes to fees, and the protocol itself. But what should these rights be worth?      The Fei protocol is engineered to maintain stability against the U.S. dollar by charging a penalty for selling and a bonus for buying the Fei token when it is below the $1 peg. It is an innovative design, albeit highly experimental. But as Fei has drifted further and further from the peg since launch, early buyers found themselves in the unfortunate position of being unable to liquidate their positions without taking substantial loss.    Chris Berg and Sinclair Davidson are with the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub in Melbourne, Australia.    By the end of the week, Fei suspended the penalties and rewards to try to stabilize the protocol. Until then, these mechanisms were functioning exactly as intended. Careful investors would have seen everything spelled out in the Fei white paper.      We might say this is a simple “buyer beware” story. But it is complicated by the simultaneous airdrop and distribution of Fei’s governance token, TRIBE, that was intended to allocate control rights over the protocol itself. In practice, buyers were trading an appreciating asset (ETH) for a stablecoin (FEI) to get access to the real prize: TRIBE.      In the crypto and DeFi industry, many think governance is just about voting. Voting is important, of course – it is the governing part of governance. But it is only a part. In the traditional corporate world, governance rights come with a complex and coherent set of rights and obligations clearly tied to the underlying value of the firm.    Read more: Chris Berg - Non-Fungible Tokens and the New Patronage Economy    Share ownership represents a right to the cash flow of the company and a residual claim over the company’s assets if, for whatever reason, it is wound up. The structure of these rights are the result of hundreds of years of evolution in corporate governance.      If voting rights and the rights over the cashflow and the assets of the firm are misaligned, there can be perverse results. In crypto, we shouldn’t just want governance token holders to vote. We should want them to vote well – making governance choices that are shaped by their interest in increasing the value produced by the protocol, and their knowledge that they will benefit directly from those choices.      The initial “investors” in Fei are not really investors in FEI at all. They are customers who spent ETH to buy FEI. And there is an important difference between being a customer and an owner. The difference between being able to complain – to tweet about how you’ve been wronged – and the ability to do something to recover your money. Because of the design of Fei’s “protocol controlled value” pool of ETH, FEI holders have no residual ownership claim over the ETH, just the right to sell their new FEI on a secondary market.      What governance rights FEI holders have is only as a result of being airdropped TRIBE, a fork of Compound’s COMP token. Like COMP and many other DeFi governance tokens, TRIBE gives voting rights but does not allocate cash flow rights.    Read more: $1B Fei Stablecoin’s Rocky Start Is a Wake-Up Call for DeFi Investors    True, TRIBE holders might vote for protocol amendments that allocate those rights in the future. Even so, the token represents at best an option to participate in unspecified governance that might result in cash flow, but might not.      The crisis happened because an unexpectedly large number of people bought into FEI to get TRIBE and then tried to sell out of FEI. That’s understandable: Nobody wants to hold a stablecoin in a bull market. This rush for the exits triggered Fei’s penalty and reward nosedive.      There is a subtle but critical lesson here. If the unique selling proposition of your crypto-economic system is predictability and stability – as it must be for a stablecoin – having the initial demand for that coin driven by a highly speculative governance token that will offer ambiguous future rights is asking for trouble.      Indeed, it is a lesson that ought to be considered by all token designers in the DeFi world, not just stablecoins. The decision not to specify how value accrues to governance tokens is not just risky for investors, it is risky for the protocol itself.    What governance rights FEI holders have is only as a result of being airdropped TRIBE, a fork of Compound’s COMP token.    For example, online chatter suggests that if Fei’s future had been put to a governance vote over the course of the week, there would have been substantial support for distributing its enormous ETH treasury back to FEI buyers. This would have recouped individual losses, but probably also have wound the protocol up entirely.      The Fei protocol is trying to do a lot of innovative work at once. If it turns out to be a success, it won’t have been the only successful protocol that had a rocky bootstrapping phase. But it should offer future protocols a critical lesson in tokenomics.      Governance tokens are one of the most interesting innovations in DeFi. They seem to offer a fast path to decentralization, handing over control from entrepreneurs to a distributed community as quickly as possible, at, after, or even before launch. But the role of governance cannot be an afterthought, a bolt-on that can be pushed to a governance token and left to unknown future decision makers.      Governance is the philosophical and economic heart of the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. After all, decentralization is nothing if not the decentralization of governance. As Fei shows, dumping protocol governance onto a speculative token with unclear cash flow and ownership rights introduces a lot of instability into already ambitious protocols.",NEUTRAL,COMP | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMP | ETH | TRADING,"Chris Berg, Sinclair Davidson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/12/defi-governance-needs-better-tokenomics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3a3c70fd35bc833a03f5d98d9c81419a63e67a6-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386470,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTA8V,1618262648,Wall Street NFTs? New York Stock Exchange Apparently Has an NFT Strategy,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) minted its first set of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Monday with six homages to hot tech stocks that debuted on the world’s largest bourse.      The NFTs memorialize first trade metadata for Unity, Coupang, Snowflake, Spotify, Roblox and DoorDash, according to a blog post by NYSE President Stacey Cunningham. They appear to live atop Crypto.com’s native blockchain.      Crypto.com Chief Marketing Officer Steve Kalifowitz told CoinDesk the crypto app was not paying NYSE to mint NFTs on its weeks-old platform. “They reached out to us,” he said in a Twitter DM.      With its minting, NYSE eases into a wild world of artists, musicians and tongue-in-cheek opportunists all chasing massive payouts in exchange for their digital collectibles. But NYSE is refusing to capitalize on that market; its NFTs are not for sale.      A representative of NYSE parent company ICE was quick to inform CoinDesk the exchange was “minting” NFTs, not selling them.      A source familiar with the project told CoinDesk the NFTs were gifted to their respective companies. The source explained NYSE has no plans to sell NFTs – not now, not ever – though Cunningham has announced that more are on the way.      NYSE's owner, ICE, also owns bitcoin brokerage Bakkt.    NYSE NFTs    It was not clear at press time why NYSE would mint NFTs if not for the usual reason of material gain.      Crypto.com’s marketing team certainly has exhibited a creative streak in publicizing the new wing. They unveiled a bevy of eye-catching NFT collaborators last month – Snoop Dogg, Mr. Brainwash and Boy George – in a bid to spark interest. Adding the world’s largest stock exchange to the invite-only platform could be a coup among a very specific audience of investors.      That audience might show an interest in the nerdy side of NYSE’s NFTs. They feature first trade data from their respective company’s NYSE debut – an indecipherable quote code that seldom sees much light.      “Each message is recorded in our trading platform’s digital ledger,” Cunningham said in the blog post.      Issuing an NFT atop a decentralized digital ledger for the purposes of boosting the prominence of NYSE’s uber-centralized digital ledger is, at the very least, a sign of the times.      For its part, NYSE claims it is issuing NFTs just for kicks: a “fun, new way” to honor companies’ public debuts, said Cunningham in the post.

42386464,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTA5z,1618262524,"Higher US Inflation Expected in March CPI Report, and Bitcoin Traders Are Watching","The March U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report will provide the latest update on inflation as the economy recovers from a pandemic-induced recession.      The report will be of particular interest to cryptocurrency traders, some of whom view bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against inflation and ongoing currency debasement.      The median forecast calls for a 0.5% month-over-month increase in CPI in March, accelerating slightly from February's 0.4% clip. Core CPI, which excludes food an energy, is expected to rise by 0.2%, versus a 0.1% rate previously.      Over the past 12 months, the CPI probably rose 2.5%, faster than the 1.7% increase reported last month.      Consumers are already expecting higher inflation as the cost of medical care and home prices rise, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York conducted in March.      But will the Federal Reserve allow inflation to get too hot before tightening monetary policy? Some analysts think Fed risks falling behind the curve, a possibility traders may adjust to sooner rather than later.    “The Fed will wait for hard evidence of non-transitory inflation before acting; markets can’t wait for that,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.  “Risk is an acceleration in economic growth and inflation of a magnitude economists/the Fed are totally unprepared for,” according to an April 9 report by Bank of America. “In our view, the reality is markets will not wait for the Fed.”    Central banks everywhere are grappling with similar conundrums as the global economy recovers from the deep economic dislocation from the coronavirus.      Some central banks in emerging markets have raised rates this year to combat rising inflation.      “Inflation fears will raise Treasury prices and weaken the dollar to some extent, though if other countries follow suit the effect might be limited,"" wrote Frances Coppola, CoinDesk columnist, in an email.

42386476,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTAHJ,1618260455,JPMorgan Says Bitcoin ETFs Could Shrink CME Futures Premium,"No fewer than nine applications for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund are pending before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including a new filing from Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital.      At the most basic level, the vehicles would give investors a way to bet on the largest cryptocurrency with the ease of buying a stock through a brokerage account.      But JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, has identified another potential benefit to the approval of a bitcoin ETF: helping to normalize the bitcoin futures premium on the Chicago-based CME and other exchanges. The premium represents the difference between the futures-contract price for bitcoin and the current price as traded on major cryptocurrency exchanges.      ""Launching a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. will be the key to normalizing the pricing of bitcoin futures, in our view,"" the U.S. bank's analysts wrote in an April 9 report, adding that the June contract listed on the CME recently traded at a 25% annualized premium.      Read more: What Is a Bitcoin ETF?      The gap has increased since February, when it was below 20%. A carry trader could have locked in the 25% annualized premium as profit by buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market and simultaneously selling a June futures contract on the CME.      According to the JPMorgan analysts, the wide premium might partly reflect the reality that many big investors have yet to set up accounts or processes to buy cryptocurrencies, or they’re prohibited from doing so under regulations or their own mandates. They’re relegated to gaining exposure through CME futures or the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has its own drawbacks in terms of pricing irregularities. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)      So the existence of a physically settled ETF might help to address some of the pricing discrepancies, by bringing extra liquidity into the market.      The CME futures are cash-settled to their bitcoin reference rate (BRR) – a daily reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of one bitcoin as of 4 p.m. London standard time (LST). The BRR represents a one-hour volume-weighted average price across a range of major exchanges as of 4 p.m. LST and not a single observational price at 4 p.m. LST. That way, the exchange ensures that a single large trade or cluster of transactions will only have a limited effect on the BRR.      However, bitcoin's volatility is relatively high compared to traditional assets. Hence, the BRR tends to deviate from the spot market price, leading to a tracking error in a carry trade.      ""Over a longer horizon, using just Coinbase prices, the monthly tracking error of BRR versus 4 p.m. LST mids has at times been 2% or higher over the past year. Backtesting the performance of basis trades [carry trades] against spot levels as of the same time results in an annualized tracking error of more than 10% over the past year,"" JPMorgan analysts noted. ""The richness of bitcoin futures likely reflects in part inefficiencies in replicating the BRR to which they settle, particularly without direct access to the spot market.""      Last year, the legendary trader Paul Tudor Jones’ investment firm took a bullish bet on bitcoin via the futures market instead of the spot market. While corporate treasury money has been flowing into bitcoin via Coinbase, many regulated funds aren't allowed to invest through cryptocurrency exchanges.      Read more: Coinbase and Bakkt Are Behind Paul Tudor Jones’ Bitcoin Bets, SEC Documents Show      “Funds can only access bitcoin via futures on the CME,” Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp call. ”This eventually ends up driving premium on bitcoin futures.”      The tracking error could be much lower once a physically settled ETF tied to the spot market price is launched; the risk premium could be priced out.      Executing so-called carry trades, also known as basis trades – where investors use hedging transactions to profit from the futures premium – would be much more straightforward and cost-effective with an ETF, possibly resulting in more players and low premiums, according to the JPMorgan report.      Also read: Traders Opting for Cash and Carry Strategy as Bitcoin’s ‘Contango’ Widens      ""At the moment, listed basis trades require ~40% initial margin against the futures position in addition to ongoing variation margin and fully funding the opposing long GBTC positions, making the return on cash noticeably less attractive,"" analysts said. Having an ETF would make basis trading ""more efficient and attractive at current pricing, particularly if those ETFs can be purchased on margin.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/12/jpmorgan-says-bitcoin-etfs-could-shrink-cme-futures-premium,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8860e018cde219fcfc3091ef85c20395213dc89-1200x856.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Riding that momentum, ether prices have continued to soar, albeit in smaller daily increments, to reach several new all-time highs of close to $2,100 in recent days.      What is equally noteworthy about ether’s performance this past quarter, outside of its price gains, is the institutional attention the crypto asset seems to be attracting and the market tools that have launched to support its trading as a derivatives product.

The ether options market, while less mature than the bitcoin options market, has grown rapidly nonetheless over the past three months. Aggregate open interest for ether options products on non-U.S. regulated exchanges reached all-time highs of $3 billion at the end of Q1 2021, compared to a mere $27 million at the end of the previous quarter.      Because options markets tend to develop after futures markets start to mature, it’s an area of trading that should be watched to see if deep-pocketed, institutional players jump into the ether investment waters.

42386480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTAL5,1618259916,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Near $60K as Coinbase Listing Stirs Fresh Crypto Hype,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $60,120.82 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 0.68% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $59,428.21-$61,219.72 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin surged early Monday to a four-week high of $61,219.72. Analysts said the largest cryptocurrency might have gotten a boost from the hoopla surrounding U.S. exchange giant Coinbase’s coming direct stock listing Wednesday.      In cryptocurrency circles, the “Coinbase effect” is when a digital token gets a price pump after getting listed on the cryptocurrency exchange. But bitcoin might get the benefit of a different type of “Coinbase effect” – if newbie investors, spurred by mainstream press coverage of the stock listing, decide to put money into cryptocurrencies.      “The Coinbase hype within crypto, in terms of valuation and its domino effect on other markets” means Wednesday’s direct listing might become “a key catalyst event,” Singapore-based crypto quant firm QCP Capital wrote Monday on its Telegram channel.      The cryptocurrency analysis and data site IntoTheBlock wrote in a newsletter last week that “anticipation” of the Coinbase stock listing “has contributed to broader risk-on sentiment throughout crypto.” A week ago, the market value of all cryptocurrencies surpassed $2 trillion for the first time.      QCP noted that bitcoin prices, despite doubling so far this year, have underperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks in the past month, so a successful Coinbase listing might lead to a reversal.      Cryptocurrency analysts also are studying a key blockchain data metric that’s seen as bullish: bitcoin’s liquid supply changes.      According to the analyst Willy Woo, more bitcoins are turning from liquid status to illiquid, meaning they’re getting withdrawn and locked away into long-term holding patterns.      That means there might be less supply to go around for new bitcoin buyers, potentially offsetting what appears to have been a recent slackening of demand.      On the other hand, CoinDesk reported that net inflows to digital asset investment products declined last week by $23 million to $83 million.      Bitcoin’s market dominance at the same time dropped to around 55.6%, the lowest level since April 2019 – potentially an indication that more investors have shifted their focus to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).    Ether and altcoins  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,144.59 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 0.04% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,103.67-$2,199.87 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Ether hit a new all-time high price at $2,199.87 during trading hours in Asia Monday, but exchange tokens including Binance’s BNB and Uniswap’s UNI stole the thunder with staggering double-digit percentage gains.      BNB was up more than 15% in the past 24 hours, while UNI was up more than 20%, according to Messari.      The exchange tokens’ rally in the past month is a “spillover” from Coinbase’s listing, according to QCP, which warned that the fuss surrounding the event could lead to “too much short-term froth” in the crypto market.      Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, announced on Monday it is now offering a zero-commission tokenized stock trading service to its users, with prices settled in Binance’s own U.S. dollar-linked stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD).

42386473,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTAG3,1618257629,How the Coveted 'COIN' Ticker Found Its Way to Coinbase,"When Malcolm Palle, chairman of London-listed blockchain investment firm Coinsilium, saw that Coinbase was to begin trading on Nasdaq using the stock ticker “COIN,” it came as something of a surprise.      Back in 2015, Coinsilium became one of the first crypto-focused companies to go public, and the stock now trades on London-based Aquis Exchange (formerly NEX) – using the ticker symbol AQSE: COIN.      Palle says he remains “relatively sanguine” about Coinbase taking the ticker, but added that conversations with the folks at Aquis, and also contacts at the London Stock Exchange, have left him wondering if this was merely overlooked by Coinbase and Nasdaq, and if any resulting confusion will end up being his problem.      “What we would have expected to happen would have been for checks to be made from their end,” Palle said in an interview. “So either they did their checks and they didn't find us, which I find unbelievable, or they didn't do their checks and just thought, ‘It's available on Nasdaq, so we'll take it.’ Or they did their checks, found us and decided it doesn't matter, for whatever reason.”      Coinbase declined to comment.      Leaving aside the shades of David and Goliath this situation invites, there are cases where the same tickers exist in different jurisdictions, but not many. Underlying the ticker symbol is the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN), the code that uniquely identifies a specific stock. Where the potential for confusion really arises is with media coverage, not to mention the proliferation of social media, said Palle.    Coinsilium, now Coinbase    Coinsilium has been a stalwart of the London crypto community since the early days. The firm is recognized in the U.K. through the “COIN” ticker, but when it joined the OTCQB Market in the U.S. in October 2020, its shares were cross-traded under the ticker “CINGF.”      Palle pointed out Coinsilium’s holdings have grown rapidly in recent months, and the company is busily pumping out news using the COIN tag in its releases.      “It's one thing to say there's a moribund company using the ticker and we'll never hear from them again. It's another thing to say we're going to use that ticker but there's also a ticker that belongs to a dynamic trading company that’s pumping out news,” Palle said, adding:    “We're not going to shy away from using the ticker symbol COIN in all our releases.”    Nasdaq declined to comment.    The Gemini angle    London-listed Coinsilium is not the only firm to have coveted the famous ticker symbol.      In July 2014, Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss updated their exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, so that it would trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “COIN.”      Even when the twins later switched venues for the proposed ETF from Nasdaq to BATS Global Markets, the shares were to be listed under the “COIN” symbol.      Back in 2014, Cameron Winklevoss told CoinDesk in an interview that “identifying the ticker symbol and the exchange are two major events that further demonstrate that we are moving forward as expected.” (Hindsight, etc.)      Gemini declined to comment.

42386458,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBT9yR,1618256280,How to Minimize Your Crypto Taxes,"How far does your U.S. tax address determine the amount you'll pay in crypto taxes?      The answer: A lot.      As a U.S. investor, 25% to 50% of your hard-earned money may go toward taxes, depending on your jurisdiction. That means your tax strategy is every bit as important as your investment strategy.    Clinton Donnelly, the CryptoTaxFixer, specializes in crypto tax return preparation and defending crypto traders from Internal Revenue Service audits. He is the founder of CryptoTaxAudit and Donnelly Tax Law. Dennis Wohlfarth is the CEO and founder of ACCOINTING.com. For a full guide to U.S. crypto taxes, see CoinDesk's post here.    Most governments want to encourage investment, so they offer long-term capital gains incentives. In other words, you pay less tax the longer you hold an asset without selling it.      The U.S. capital gains tax rates are 0%, 15%, or 20%, with most citizens paying 15% for long-term capital gains. In certain countries, tax on capital gains goes down to zero percent, or close to zero percent, rapidly.      A popular strategy for investors is to go for the long-term capital gains incentive on your taxes, which means waiting to reap the benefits from your crypto assets.    Global crypto tax opportunities    There's only one special tax haven reserved for the largest of crypto whales: Puerto Rico. As an American, moving to Puerto Rico allows you to pay 0% capital gains tax, which means you’ll keep all of your profits on crypto assets.      However, this strategy makes more sense for the whales than the shrimps of the crypto world.      Puerto Rico is America's tax haven, but the savings you make on your crypto will be diminished by recent spikes in living costs. Due to the bona fide residency requirement to buy a home within two years under Act 60-2019, real estate on the island has skyrocketed in price.    Read more: Crypto Tax 2021: A Complete US Guide    Therefore, we encourage this option only if you are a significant crypto whale with the means to buy high and sight unseen in Puerto Rico.      For smaller-scale U.S. investors, moving to a crypto-friendly state with moderate living costs can allow you to live large off your crypto gains, even if you are not a whale.      The key is to drive your income up and your expenses down, and you can do that by choosing a tax-friendly ZIP code and/or lifestyle. As a crypto investor, you want to look at the end-of-year expenses and make some lifestyle choices pronto.      Moving to a state without income tax is a smart tax move and is an attractive option for investors who are able to work remotely. Nine U.S. states have no income tax as of 2021: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.    There's only one special tax haven reserved for the largest of crypto whales: Puerto Rico.    Even if you can’t hack the move to a crypto-friendly state with zero income tax, moving to a ZIP code with lower living costs could save you a bundle on taxes that eat into your crypto gains.      It's key to remember that if you jack up your lifestyle costs at the same time your income shoots up, then you are no better off except for having more giant toys than you had before.      Moving to an area with low property tax is an obvious way to save big-time.      The second biggest expense is a house, and home-ownership comes with an array of tax implications. Property taxes have risen astronomically in many U.S. states, particularly in California, with people shelling out tens of thousands of dollars a year.      Here's the thing about a property tax: A property tax is a wealth tax. It's a tax you have to pay because you have the wealth to own that asset and the amount is arbitrarily determined by ZIP code.      If you were living in Colorado, your property tax on a $350,000 home might be no more than $1,700 for the year. So that starts to look attractive compared to the $10,000-$20,000 property tax each year, say, back in New Jersey.      Someone paying $25,000 a month on property tax in California could have bought another house with the money he or she ends up spending on property taxes in California over 10 years.      So, your property tax address is a key area where you could change your tax picture.      Based on data from ATTOM Data Solutions, states with the lowest effective property tax rates were Hawaii (0.36%), Alabama (0.48%), Colorado (0.52%), Utah (0.56%) and Nevada (0.58%).      Other states in the top 10 for lowest effective property tax rates were Tennessee (0.61%); West Virginia (0.61%), Delaware (0.62%), Arizona (0.63%) and Wyoming (0.65%).    Where to pay your taxes    Depending on your income level and the state where you live, U.S. crypto investors will end up paying about 33%-40% of their income in both federal and state taxes.      For an American, there are some attractive options to consider when it comes to crossing state lines to avoid high rates of income tax that eat away at your crypto gains.      Your lifestyle is another consideration. You want to be careful about increasing your expenses because you'll squander the wealth you have.      This is the time to look at your lifestyle costs attached to your ZIP code.

42386467,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTA7F,1618250945,"There's Certified Fair Trade Coffee, So How About Certified and Persistent NFTs?","Now that the frothiness seems to be coming out of the art-collectibles-gaming corner of the crypto space, it's probably a good time for the non-fungible token (NFT) industry to focus on fixing some of its core issues.      We previously reported on how the underlying content in NFTs (the image or the music or the video of which a token ostensibly proves ownership) isn't always stored reliably. ""I always tell people there are two major points when launching a NFT project: own your smart contract and know where your NFT metadata lives. If any one of these platforms die, you don't want your token to disappear,"" Carolin Wend, chief operating officer at Mintbase, told CoinDesk by email.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Conscientiousness about the persistence of NFT content has grown but there's still not a clear best practice in the industry. There's no easy way for a buyer to verify his or her NFT content will persist into the future, and there should be.      In the analog commercial space there's a long history of self-regulating industries that help users feel good about the things they buy. For example, an Underwriters Laboratories seal on an electronic product shows it has been checked against reasonable danger of shock and fire. Various consumables opt to be certified as Fair Trade or Organic.      Digital art and collectibles need some sort of Authentic & Persistent Data Certification. A seal that could be posted on NFT marketplaces to show that a given NFT has stored its data in a way that will persist predictably for some reasonable length of time, or that gives the user agency in further ensuring the underlying data will continue to exist.      There are two issues here: the existence of the data and verifying its authenticity.      As Kyle Tut, CEO of Pinata, a firm working on NFT storage, put it in an email, ""The value of an NFT doesn't start with persistence, it starts with authenticity. A counterfeit Nike sneaker can persist for just as long as an authentic Nike sneaker can.    Why this matters    If you already understand this issue, you can skip this section.      Imagine that I make some great drawing and I sell an NFT of a PNG file that shows the work on the OpenSea marketplace. Now, imagine the place where that image lived was on the CoinDesk website, such as at coindesk.com/bradysgreatdrawing.jpg.      Like any NFT, mine would have a TOKENURI field, but if the only documentation I left of my brilliant creation was that web address, my buyer might be in trouble.      If he loved it so much that he downloaded the file to his computer, would his (very wise) investment be safe?      Not really.      Imagine our IT team finds that drawing and thinks: ""Why the heck is Brady storing his drawings on our servers?"" And they delete my masterpiece! Rude, obviously, but not unreasonable.      The downloaded copy isn't that helpful. All you've got is a web address, so how could you prove to the teeming masses of Brady Dale art fans who want to buy it later that your downloaded file was that drawing on your computer? The only proof you have is a URL that doesn't work anymore.      So it's not enough to store a copy. You need to prove the copy is authentic.      Fortunately, cryptography provides a solution for this. It just needs to be used. The solution is called hashing.    How the standard would work    It's fairly easy to take a piece of data and run a cryptographic hash on it that spits out a string that will always correspond to just that one chunk of data. So if someone makes a copy of any file and doesn't change it in any way, each copy will spit out that same hash when checked with the same hashing function.      So all someone needs to do is put that hash into the NFT metadata and you can forever prove that copies of a file are authentic. You've got a way to say, This is mine.    It's not enough to store a copy. You need to prove that the copy is authentic.    Or maybe not forever? Tut wrote, ""We think creators and collectors should have the opportunity to define how long an NFT should persist. NFT persistence isn't just zero or one. It can also be everything in between."" Just like copyright isn’t forever (though Disney has certainly tried to make it so).      On the Clubhouse audio chat app Thursday, participants from organizations like the NFT marketplace Rarible, decentralized storage startup Filecoin, digital art company Asynchronous Art, the decentralized web services provider Fleek and others discussed this issue of persistence and how the industry could collaborate to solve it.      ""The call was pretty productive,"" said Harrison Hines, the founder of Fleek, told CoinDesk. He felt folks were coming to consensus that the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) would be a good way to standardize authenticating content with its hashing functionality, while still allowing flexibility around storage.      He also said the Clubhouse participants discussed a ""Data DAO"" model to check that NFTs are stored on one or more trustless storage networks. This could be a good way to run some kind of ""Certified Authentic & Persistent"" seal.      Wend said Mintbase has been working to inspire confidence by showing an Arweave logo on all its NFTs. Arweave endows files to be stored forever, and the logos link to a copy of the file on that permanent storage system.      See also: Mark Cuban on Bitcoin, NFTs and What Comes Next: ‘The Upside Is Truly Unlimited’      There's a website that lets users check NFTs to see if they are safely stored, but it's still new and developing. That said, its existence helps push for some kind of unified thinking here.      Now that the pressure is off to mint every possible NFT imaginable in hopes of a giant payday, the industry has an opportunity to come to consensus about what boxes an NFT needs to check in order for trustless authentication of digital property to be trustworthy over time.      Authentic & Persistent Data Certification is a natural solution that would be simple enough to implement online, and it would benefit the entire space.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIL | MINING | AR,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/12/theres-certified-fair-trade-coffee-so-how-about-certified-and-persistent-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7629ba1196606699fd0b2cac314836b4057284bb-2400x1478.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386465,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTA2D,1618250491,Canaan Plunges as Inventory Issues Slashed Q4 Bitcoin Mining Machine Sales,"Talk about a bad time to not have product to sell.      Shares of bitcoin mining machine maker Canaan (Nasdaq: CAN) plummeted after the company reported a 75% drop in Q4 revenue on Monday as supply-chain issues prevented the company from capitalizing on a roaring bull market and a resulting surge in demand for mining machines.      “The outbreak of COVID-19 caused supply chain disruptions and thus negatively impacted our revenues in the fourth quarter,” according to CEO Nangen Zhang.  For the Q4, the Hangzhou-based firm posted Q4 revenue of $5.9 million, down from $24 million in Q3 of the same year. Total computing power sold was 0.2 million Thash/s, representing a year-over-year decrease of 93.1% from 2.9 million.  The market didn’t respond kindly to the report, with American Depositary Receipts of the maker of ASIC mining machines dropping 34.2%, down $6.41, to 12.25 in recent trading.  The company’s adjusted loss, however, narrowed to $11.2 million from $28.6 million as the company reported drops in R&D expense, selling & marketing costs, and general and administrative costs.      Looking ahead, the mining machine maker said it already had $174 million of contracted orders with $66 million of cash advance from customers as of Dec. 31, 2020. The company forecasts at least $61 million in revenue for the ongoing Q1.      Canaan's supply hangup comes at a time when demand from mining farms couldn’t be higher. North American mining firms Marathon Patent Group and Blockcap, for example, are entering 2021 with aggressive plans to expand their hashrates as much as ten fold into 2022. Both Blockcap and Marathon purchased their machines from Canaan rival, Bitmain.

Jones’ investment firm, QueensBridge Venture Partners, got into Coinbase’s Series B round back in 2013 when it raised $25 million. Around that time Coinbase was valued at about $143 million, according to PitchBook.      The Nas news shows just how far Coinbase’s public listing will ripple across the world of venture capital, with everyone from Wall Street veterans to A-list celebrities all standing to win big when the chips fall this week.      QueensBridge, which was also a backer of Robinhood in 2013 and later Lyft and Dropbox, makes early-stage investments of between $100,000 and $500,000, according to Jones’ QueensBridge co-founder Anthony Saleh.      Dividing the firm’s $100,000–$500,000 stake by the share price at the time of Coinbase's Series B ($1.00676) points to QueensBridge owning around 99,329 shares on the low end or 496,642 on the high end, according to an analysis by CoinDesk.      At the price that Coinbase shares last traded on private secondary markets – $350 per share – Jones’ firm would have a pot of somewhere between $34.76 million and $173.8 million. If Coinbase shares trade at investment bank DA Davidson's new price target of $440, QueensBridge could see the value of its Coinbase stake rise to $43.7 million and $218.5 million, respectively.      Saleh and Jones did not return requests for comment. Coinbase declined to comment.      But a source familiar with the matter confirmed QueensBridge remains on the Coinbase cap table.      The source added that Jones is a friend of Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Silicon Valley venture giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of Coinbase’s main backers, who may have told the musician the then-fledgling bitcoin exchange was a promising investment. QueensBridge had raised a $10 million fund in 2012, according to “A-List Angels” author Zack O'Malley Greenburg.      In addition to the well-picked startups QueensBridge backed between 2012 and 2014, Jones and Co. reportedly bagged around $40 million in 2018 after Amazon acquired the doorbell company Ring.

42386466,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTA4j,1618246729,"Telegram Is Nearly Done Paying Back TON Investors, Eyes IPO Next","Messaging app Telegram is close to fully repaying investors in its TON blockchain effort nearly a year after settling allegations it violated U.S. securities law in raising over $1 billion for the project. Its next step might be an initial public offering (IPO).      On Monday, Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported that Telegram is preparing to launch an IPO in 2023, aiming for a $30 billion to $50 billion valuation, according to a source close to the company's team. The IPO will benefit the buyers of Telegram's bonds, which the company sold in February to raise $1 billion.      The debt sale, in turn, came right in time for earlier Telegram investors' pay day, as the company is closing the book on its $1.7 billion token sale three years ago. According to Russian publication The Bell, Telegram started to pay back the last investors who didn't withdraw their investments right away in 2020.      Two sources familiar with the token sale confirmed to CoinDesk that the process had started. According to one of them, non-American investors lent Telegram $500 million to $600 million back in 2019 following the news the company no longer planned to launch TON.    The ICO that went awry    Last May, Telegram announced it discontinued the work on its TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain project. The project started in 2018 with much fanfare, secretly raising $1.7 billion from qualified investors and pledging to develop a proof-of-stake blockchain with a native token. Telegram planned to build TON into the messaging app, potentially exposing some 200 million (at the time) Telegram users to TON's native crypto token, gram.      The project attracted prominent investors from all over the world, including funds Sequoia, Ribbit Capital and Lightspeed Ventures, plus Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and former Russian government member Mikhail Abyzov.      However, right before the planned launch in October 2019, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Telegram, saying the company had been struggling financially and was planning to issue unregistered securities disguised as utility tokens to fund its operations. The legal battle essentially lead to Telegram shutting down the project in May 2020 after striking a settlement with the SEC and agreeing to pay $18.5 million in penalties and return the money it raised.      The project was open source and later launched independently without Telegram's involvement, at least officially.      After shutting down TON, Telegram offered investors to either take 72% of their money back right away or lend the funds to Telegram for one year and get back 110% in 2021 – the latter, however, was not available to U.S. investors. Back in 2019, some investors hoped that at some point they could get paid back in Telegram's equity (and invested in TON as a proxy for Telegram's equity), they told CoinDesk, but Telegram quickly made clear that splitting ownership was not on the table.      “Telegram may need to sell some equity later to get the money to repay the loan, but repayment in equity was not offered as an option,” Telegram's spokesperson told CoinDesk at that time in an email. Apparently, instead of the equity sale, Telegram ended up doing a bond sale to pay back gram token buyers.      The IPO will be a different situation compared to Telegram giving out equity to TON investors back in 2020, a source close to the project told CoinDesk. The difference is that the IPO, supposedly, will give shareholders less control over Telegram. Telegram founder Pavel Durov is said to be famously allergic to the idea of sharing Telegram ownership with anyone after the dramatic fallout with shareholders of its previous project, the social network Vk.com.      ""If you let in investors with a big share and active attitude, they would obviously try to control the company,"" the source said.      EDIT (April 13, 10:55 UTC): This article previously mistakenly said Telegram valuation for an IPO was expected to be between $30 million and $50 million, instead of $30 billion and $50 billion.

42386468,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTA9l,1618246015,"Predicting the Future Is Easy, Profiting Is Hard","A question I am often asked is how an individual can invest in the future of blockchain technology and ride the growth of this great emerging technology. The truth is, I’m not completely sure I know. However, as always, I like looking at analogies from other industries and times to see if I can glean some insights. This isn’t investment advice and my aim here isn’t really to provide investment advice. This is an opportunity to step back and think about which companies and strategies might be winners if we can generalize some good lessons from the past.      The most obvious approach to investing in the future of blockchain technology is to buy into the blockchains you believe will be successful, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. On the surface, that may seem like a direct and simple plan but it may not be that easy. In thinking about this topic, I’ve come up with two key analogies from history and, unfortunately, they both suggest there’s no easy answer.    Paul Brody is EY's Global Blockchain leader.    In the case of Ethereum, this blockchain is increasingly becoming an ecosystem of complex business networks. The network effects that drive growth and innovation are clearly visible in the way the decentralized finance ecosystem has exploded and the degree to which DeFi services interoperate with each other. Growing demand for transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem has, in turn, led to soaring transaction costs and a rising value for ether, which is needed to fund transactions on Ethereum, as people compete for a limited transaction capacity.      Superficially, it’s easy to predict the value of ether will soar as demand for transactions rises. In fact, there is no guarantee that will happen. In Ethereum, the fees that are required to process transactions are called gas, and the analogy with gas prices in the real world is a very good one: As gas prices go up, people quickly turn to engineering more efficient engines. The same is happening in Ethereum. We see multiple paths with different technologies that will likely raise the network capacity by a factor of over 1,000. That’s a lot of extra capacity.      If Ethereum does become the foundation of a new digital global economy, the value of ether will certainly appreciate relative to other currencies, but perhaps not enough to satisfy a typical investor who is used to thinking about the 7%-10% annual returns you get in the stock market. The U.S. economy surpassed Britain’s in 1916. At that time, you needed nearly five U.S. dollars to buy one British pound. Today you need fewer than two dollars. That’s appreciation, yes, but not much over the course of a century. In that context, buying U.S. dollars as an investment in the U.S. economy would not have turned out very well.    Superficially, it’s easy to predict that the value of Ether will soar as demand for transactions rises.    A better analogy might be to think of Ethereum as a digital version of the global economy or the internet and ether as the foundation currency. And again, that doesn’t give us a good easy answer. The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, has been growing around 2%-3% annually for decades. And while the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power has declined an average of 2.2% a year due to inflation, the U.S. stock market has risen by around 7%-9% a year (after inflation) during the same time period.      The lesson here: A stable medium of exchange (the dollar, on in this case, ether) is a necessary condition for growth and value to be created, but if you want to participate in that growth, you will need to buy into the companies that create it.      The internet gives us another take on this. In the go-go days of the late-1990s, internet startups raised money nearly as fast as blockchain startups do today. Enormous amounts of money flowed into high-risk ventures. Often these startups had great ideas about how the internet would transform our daily lives – and they were often right.      Same-day delivery of essentials? Kosmo.com. Home grocery delivery? Webvan. Social networks and streaming music: Myspace. Every single one of them was right about the future, and it didn’t save them from failure. There’s a good chance that many of the brilliant blockchain startups we see today will see the same end: being completely right about the future and frustratingly unable to cash in.      See also: Paul Brody - This Isn’t the Revolution I Signed Up For      One theme cited frequently in Silicon Valley in the 1990s was that of Levi Strauss, a local San Francisco company still in business. The original Levi Strauss set up shop selling jeans and clothing to local miners lured to California by the gold boom. Most of those gold mines went broke and nearly all the miners did, too. But those selling clothing and equipment did just fine. Applied to the internet of the 1990s, that meant investing in networking companies and servers, a bet that seemed a good one.      You can apply the same logic today to those companies looking to scale up Bitcoin and Ethereum. We don’t know how these layer 2 applications will finally be used, but we know there will be enormous demand for them. However, a quick survey of the layer 2 business suggests it’s every bit as crowded as every other segment in this space, which makes picking winners very difficult. Indeed, our view that selling jeans and tools to miners may be informed by survivor bias – we only know about the companies that survived the end of the mining boom, not all the outfitters that perished along the way.      There is one investing strategy that has stood the test of time: passive index investments. Picking winners is hard, even when you are right about what the future may look like. What you can do is pick the broad category for your investments. Decades of research has shown that it’s nearly impossible to beat the market as whole. All of that research was done on the stock market, but there’s no reason to think that blockchains as the next big digital engine of growth and innovation will be any different. As philosopher Georges Santayana said, “Those who don’t learn history are condemned to repeat it.”      The views reflected in this article are the view of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the global EY organization or its member firms.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/12/predicting-the-future-is-easy-profiting-is-hard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c0b0a1af40aec0909dab8edc23ddfc429ee70d0-1400x935.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386472,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTAEn,1618244605,BitRiver Is Selling Tokens to Build More Bitcoin Mining Farms in Siberia,"BitRiver, a key player in the Russian cryptocurrency mining market, aims to raise up to $35 million by selling tokens that entitles holders to space in its data centers.      The company, which operates several mining farms in Siberia for 150 megawatts in total, would use the proceeds from the sale to open more such facilities. The token runs on the Ethereum blockchain, the main launchpad for fundraising tokens since the heady days of the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom.      While ICOs have largely faded, BitRiver’s token offering, announced Monday, is one of several to hit the market this year tied to the mining sector.      In late March, Blockstream launched a token representing the value of hash power at Blockstream’s mining facility and offered buyers an indirect exposure to bitcoin. Tau Protocol recently launched a token pegged to bitcoin hashrate and backed by Genesis Mining, Binance Pool, Atlas Mining and others.      BitRiver, however, takes a different approach. Instead of indirect exposure to bitcoin, it offers clients a form of tokenized contracts for mining services, with a bonus income in tokens.      “It’s a utility token and it ideally fits our goal: to raise funds from people who will be using our future infrastructure,” BitRiver CEO Igor Runets told CoinDesk.    More farms in Siberia    BitRiver, registered in Gibraltar but with a home base in Siberia, operates so-called mining hotels, or data centers for miners who place their ASICs there. Clients pay for the units of power their equipment uses to mine crypto, with the price including other expenses like machine maintenance.      The demand for BitRiver’s services has been significantly exceeding the company’s capacity, Runets said. In addition to the main data center in Bratsk, the company has several smaller venues that together comprise 50 more megawatts, but that’s still much less than prospective clients want, Runets said.      “We now see demand for 400 megawatts of power,” he said. “It’s a huge amount of construction work. We’re now looking to buy more land, buildings [and] start to build more data centers.”      Investments for that, as Runets expects, will come from the token sale. BitRiver is aiming to sell 100 million tokens for more than $35 million.      The demand for BitRiver’s services comes mostly from Asia, Runets said, especially from China, South Korea and Japan. BitRiver even opened an office in Seoul earlier in April to cater to that region, and the token sale will be on the Korean exchange Bithumb.      Growing demand has been also coming from Persian Gulf countries, namely Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE, Runets said: “Over the recent months, the market there has been growing, people have a lot of money to invest, and the surging price of bitcoin drew attention [to mining].”      Some of the expansion has been ongoing. BitRiver recently founded a joint venture with a Russian hydropower giant En+ to build a new mining venue of 10 megawatts. According to Runets, that farm is now operational.      Another venue, of 100 more megawatts, is currently under construction in the special economic zone of Buryatia, Russia’s East Siberian region on the border with Mongolia. In the neighboring Krasnoyarsk region, BitRiver will arrange another venue using the building of an electric boiler now rarely in use, with a ready-to-use capacity of about 82 megawatt, the token sale white paper said (read the white paper at the bottom of this story).      Read also: Bitcoin Mining Farms Are Flourishing on the Ruins of Soviet Industry in Siberia    Mining tokenomics    The BTR token sale is set to go live on April 19 on Bithumb. BitRiver is planning to sell 100 million tokens with a price starting at 35 cents. Each token would provide a buyer with an allocation of 1 watt of power for a full year. Given that there is on average 720 hours in a month and 8,640 hours in a year, one kilowatt-hour would cost 4 cents to a token holder.      Token holders will be able to get their ASICs installed and serviced in BitRiver’s warehouse in three months upon purchase. Users will also be able to pay up to 10% of their bills to BitRiver in tokens, and have their ASICs repaired for free in that case.      The company will also pay bonus tokens to the token holders, at a rate of 10% per year, using its own stash of 65 million tokens that won’t go into public circulation. In another step to make BTR attractive, BitRiver promises to buy back all the tokens by April 12, 2026, at the nominal value of 0.3504 USD per token.      BitRiver is not limiting the offer geographically, unlike many token issuers that would wall off American users to avoid running afoul of the U.S. regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Blockstream, for example, restricted its token sale to non-U.S. qualified investors.      Runets explained that, as BitRiver isn’t selling the tokens directly, it’s up to Bithumb to run due-diligence on potential buyers.      Crypto regulations in Russia have been in flux recently, with a crypto taxation bill currently awaiting passage in the national parliament. The uncertainty led many of BitRiver’s clients in Russia to establish foreign legal entities and operate through them, Runets said.      However, when asked about potential regulatory risks for a large-scale mining farm construction, he sounded moderately optimistic: “We don’t see any prerequisites for an all-out ban,” he said.

It does not appear Wright responded with the requested proof by the Feb. 19 deadline COPA set.      “COPA is about truly empowering the crypto community with innovation and removing blockers to innovation,” said a spokesperson on behalf of the COPA board. “This is not the last thing we're going to take up on behalf of the community.”      The complaint asks the court to resolve the question as to whether Craig Wright has copyright ownership rights over the Bitcoin white paper.    Read more: What Is the Bitcoin White Paper?    Pursuing a legal case on behalf of the cryptocurrency community is the first instance of COPA throwing its money and weight behind a cause that has plagued the space for years, and it could have widespread ramifications. If a court rules that Wright does not have ownership rights over the Bitcoin white paper, it would be a serious blow to his legal argument that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.    Wright’s long legal trail    Wright, notorious for having an itchy legal finger, had sent his latest round of cease-and-desist orders to Bitcoin core developers, causing the Bitcoin white paper to be taken down from Bitcoincore.org, a “canonical repository for the Bitcoin software and educational resources like Satoshi’s 10-page thesis,” CoinDesk wrote at the time.      Regardless of whether they’re accurate or not, legal claims take time, energy and, importantly, finances to contest.      COPA is stepping in on behalf of the community to protect those small parties, particularly Bitcoin developers, who are essential to the community but don't have a ton of resources, according to a spokesperson for the COPA board familiar with the matter.      Beyond that, in late February Wright also filed a lawsuit demanding Bitcoin developers give him access to stolen Mt. Gox funds. As CoinDesk reported at the time “even though Bitcoin Core contributors have no control over the network’s wallets, Wright wants Bitcoin’s developers to hand him the keys.”    Read more: Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?    Following Wright's initial filings against Bitcoin core developers, but prior to the paper being removed, a number of companies, including Square Crypto, crypto venture fund Paradigm, policy think-tank Coin Center and Facebook stablecoin subsidiary Novi, among others, decided to host it themselves. The action was meant to be a sign of solidarity.      The letter accompanying COPA’s response laid out a number of simple questions for Wright’s representatives to answer regarding his claims. These included the general basis of the claim, where he was when he wrote the white paper, what dates he wrote it and what copyright laws apply, among a number of others.      Wright has a long legal paper trail of using the law to try and silence his critics and even filed a copyright claim in May 2019 with the U.S. Copyright Office over the original Bitcoin code and the Satoshi white paper.      None of his legal attempts to assert he is Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto have been successful.    The new COPA board    The board of COPA, which helps determine the organization's actions and will guide the course of the lawsuit, is also being updated.

Four more board members from COPA organizations will be added in the future.      Three additional independent members will round out the COPA board.

Ant Group whose $37 billion initial public offering (IPO) was suspended by China’s regulators in November, will restructure as a financial holding company, according to a CNBC report.  The terms of the restructuring are expected to curb Ant Group's profitability and valuation.  Two days ago, Chinese regulators hit Alibaba with a $2.8 billion fine as part of its anti-monopoly investigation of the tech giant, claiming the company had abused its market dominance. The restructuring of Ant Group is part of the terms of the settlement of those claims, CNBC said.  The PBoC said that under a “comprehensive and feasible restructuring plan” Ant Group would cut the “improper” linkage with payments services including AliPay, Jiebei, and Huabei, said the report.  In February, it emerged Chinese regulators had agreed on a restructuring plan with Ant Group that would combine all its business segments, including its blockchain arm, into a financial holding company, according to a Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter.  Ant Group is known for its major subsidiaries including Alipay and Kakao, but it also has a blockchain arm offering services based on its own AntChain technology.  The outspoken billionaire Jack Ma is the founder of Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Group, and has been keeping a low profile since October when he publicly criticized China’s financial system and its state-dominated banking sector at a Shanghai event.  Recently, PBoC Digital Currency Research Institute director Mu Changchun has been openly discussing the central bank's own digital currency and the need to address privacy issues, stating “a completely anonymous central bank digital currency is not feasible” as it would violate anti-money laundering regulations.

42386469,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTAB1,1618240249,Zcash Announces 'Halo Arc' and Timeline for Protocol Privacy Update,"Electric Coin Company (ECC) has announced the next suite of upgrades to privacy coin Zcash – Halo Arc.      Halo Arc includes updates to Zcashd (Zcash’s consensus node), an ECC wallet prototype and the ECC wallet software development kits (SDKs). The wallet will enable shielded-by-default transactions, something that is merely optional for Zcash right now.      Previously planned for release this summer, Halo Arc will now launch on Oct. 1, 2021, in coordination with the activation of Zcash’s Network Upgrade 5 (NU5). NU5 will be the first mainnet activation of the Halo proving system, furthering the development of zero-knowledge-proof cryptography.      The October protocol upgrade will also introduce unified addresses, a feature that creates a single Zcash address that is compatible across all Zcash value pools, including shielded and transparent ones, so that users no longer have to juggle multiple address types. At present, protocol upgrades at times required new address formats.    Eliminating Zcash's trusted setup    Halo is a “trustless recursive” version of zero-knowledge proofs that allows greater scalability and removes the controversial “trusted setups” involved.      A trusted setup creates a secret number, and a derivative of that number is used by the Zcash protocol. This number is created in multiple parts by multiple actors. They all must then destroy what’s known as “cryptographic toxic waste” without revealing what it was. A trusted setup would have had to occur at each hard fork.    Read more: Zcash’s Halo Breakthrough Is a Big Deal – Not Just For Cryptocurrencies    But if no one destroys that waste, possibly through intentional planning, or if the secret number is figured out, then it would provide a fundamental flaw in the protocol and even let the individual or individuals that discovered it to create zcash arbitrarily and without anyone’s knowledge.      “This is all built on top of Halo, which will usher in a new era of zero-knowledge cryptography and means, for this first release, increased confidence in the money supply by removing the trusted setup necessary for current zero-knowledge proving systems,” said Josh Swihart, ECC's Vice President of Growth.    Halo Arc and wallets    Halo Arc includes a number of products, but the most tangible takeaway for users will be the ability to ensure that their transactions are private, right from the outset.      “With Halo Arc, we’re making it easy for wallets to support shielded Zcash by default,” said Swihart. “Users of supporting wallets will be able to give counterparties a single address and know that funds will be sent to their shielded address, regardless of whether the sender supports shielded addresses.”    Read more: You Can Now Prove a Whole Blockchain With One Math Problem – Really    In addition to the automatic shielding feature that’s part of the NU5-compatible wallet SDKs, Halo Arc also includes auto-migration. This allows wallets to move funds to the most modern shielded pool supported by the wallet. This feature will also make it easier to deprecate (or recommend against using) older pools.      Halo Arc also includes ""improved note management” according to a blog post announcing the release. This will reduce the time users need to wait between sending transactions, so they’ll be able to send one transaction immediately after another.      Going forward, ECC will bundle upgrades, products and features into regular releases, rather than relying on intermittent or one-off instances.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | REGULATION | ZEC | FORKS,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/12/zcash-announces-halo-arc-and-timeline-for-protocol-privacy-update,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c680d8cbc8fff8f09965263594f409eaa17d0e31-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The product is marketed and distributed by HANetf.  “Litecoin has grown by 342% in the past 12 months and is the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $14.6 billion with growing interest from institutional and retail investors,” said Bradley Duke, CEO of ETC Group.  Earlier this month, asset manager CoinShares launched a new physically backed litecoin ETP on the Swiss SIX exchange.

It's unclear when Disparte, who was a part of the diem stablecoin project since its origin in June 2019 (when it was referred to as libra) left the initiative, but his LinkedIn profile said he joined Circle in April 2021. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire announced the hire on Monday in a blog post.      ""The standards that we’ve helped bring into the world are taking on a new life, as dollar stablecoins become one of the most critical new infrastructures of the internet and commerce. This technical innovation converges with heightened regulatory and policy maker focus,"" Allaire wrote.      Disparte is only the latest high-profile Diem executive to leave the project, which has faced strong regulatory headwinds since it was first announced. Morgan Beller, one of the Facebook employees who spearheaded Libra, joined venture capital firm NFX in September. Disparte was hired in June 2019 as one of the very first Libra Association staffers.      Meanwhile, David Marcus, the Facebook executive running its Novi wallet subsidiary, was placed in charge of the social media giant's new ""Facebook Financial"" wing, which has been tasked with integrating payments into its different messaging applications.      Christine Smedley, who ran communications around Novi for Facebook, joined Robinhood last year as its chief marketing officer.      Allaire said in Monday's blog post that Disparte would be part of Circle's global expansion effort.      In an opinion piece submitted to the Diplomatic Courier, Disparte wrote:    ""Designing first principles into digital financial services and importing sound monetary policy and market conduct from independent central banks into stablecoins and trusted digital currencies, like USDC (now used by some of the most exacting and trusted financial institutions in the world), are adding crucial optionality, competition and reach to today’s financial services.""",NEUTRAL,USDC,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/12/circle-brings-on-former-libra-vice-chair-dante-disparte-in-potential-blow-to-facebook-stablecoin-effort,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ece7b64993582add46e7e9b103c416fe43f9cf21-710x458.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Initiated by community vote, the RLY token sale garnered more than 40,000 participants, a record for CoinList, organizers Mike Zajko and Alex Topchishvili told CoinDesk. They said it was the first time CoinList conducted a sale for a liquid token.      The big numbers highlight how social tokens, which are cryptocurrencies that support online communities, are growing in prominence as a means for influencers – especially Twitch streamers – to connect with their fans. The RLY rally comes weeks after a wallet hack sent social tokens on rival platform Roll spiraling.      Rally lets influencers create fan engagement tokens that sometimes unlock loyalty perks, like behind-the-scenes access or limited edition swag. Most of Rally’s top “Creator Coins” are live-streaming gamers with the occasional musical act thrown in. The platform had 95 creators on board at press time.

But Rally community members began debating the idea in late February and ultimately voted to hold the distribution event through CoinList.      Rally founder Kevin Chou told CoinDesk the project didn’t do the sale for the money. Rather, it was angling to raise its profile and boost the number of people personally involved.      “Really, very few people had heard about Rally” before the token sale, Chou said, pointing to Etherscan records that indicated just 1,500 prior token holders.      “The token sale has allowed us to add another 44,000 people to the project,” Chou said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/12/social-token-platform-rally-raises-22m-in-rly-sale-on-coinlist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdaf9eb212ea6833a7532d0f1192a767eeb99ef8-1836x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a blog post Thursday, an outage on April 6 caused non-validating Horizon nodes and validating nodes, including those run by the Stellar Development Foundation, to go offline for a short while.      An upgrade was introduced April 10 after it was reported that certain organizations had difficulty recovering network access. The new Protocol 16 upgrade is said to have fixed the issue, which was affecting multiple nodes but did not affect the stability of the network; there were enough validators to process transactions.      A company FAQ explains that the Stellar Foundation's validator nodes had ceased processing ledgers while the public Horizon instance stopped recording them. ""For a brief period of time it was unable to serve requests or submit transactions to the network,"" the FAQ reads.      See also: Stellar Development Foundation Invests $5M in Crypto Payments Firm Wyre      To rectify the issue, the foundation said engineers worked on a fix and rolled out a patch later in the day.

The market dominance of bitcoin, or the largest cryptocurrency's value as a share of the overall market, has dropped to about 55%, the lowest since April 2019, according to cryptocurrency research firms Messari and CoinGecko. That's down from about 70% at the start of the year.      The decline iwas driven in recent weeks by powerful rallies in the likes of binance coin (BNB) and XRP (XRP), since bitcoin's market value has held steady at around $1 trillion or slightly above. The trend offers a reminder of just how much money is flowing these days into digital assets beyond bitcoin, even as the big exchange Coinbase prepares this week for a public stock listing aimed at traditional-market investors.      The largest cryptocurrency's price has doubled this year to about $60,000, but other tokens have surged by many multiples. BNB, a utility token used on Binance's platforms, has jumped 22% in the past 24 hours, leaving the price up 15-fold in 2021, for a market value of about $90 billion.      XRP, the digital token used in Ripple Labs’ payment network, doubled in the seven days through Sunday, its best weekly performance in more than three years. The market value is between $50 billion and $140 billion, depending on how one calculates it.      Meanwhile, ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall, recently climbed to a new all-time near $2,200, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

The 83-year-old card company, which announced plans to go public last week, revealed Monday it will issue its flagship baseball cards as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in partnership with the MLB and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA).      Although a handful of ballplayers have issued their own digital collectibles in recent weeks (albeit without team logos), the new project, set to debut on the Wax blockchain on April 20, marks MLB’s official entrance into the NFT space.      Topps’ baseball NFTs are positioned to capitalize on two booming markets at once. NBA Top Shot has seen hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions in 2021 for its basketball equivalent. Meanwhile, baseball cards, an industry in which Topps is all but synonymous, have rocketed in value during the pandemic as collectors park their stimulus checks in cardboard nostalgia.      Topps’ pivot from cardboard to blockchain was a long time coming, Topps Digital Vice President Tobin Lent told CoinDesk in an interview.      “This was absolutely the plan all along,” he said. “We knew we were going to do [baseball NFTs] at some point, and we just needed to get that experience and wanted to make sure that we did it right.”      (Topps began selling lower-profile NFTs last year in what company executives called a test run for the main event.)    Read more: Topps, Going Public at $1.3B Valuation, Charts NFT Future    The buy, sell and trade platform will give Topps an easy route to capitalize on the lucrative secondary market for NFTs. If NBA Top Shot is any indication, however, the market for blockchain-based trading cards isn’t as robust as it once was.      According to data site Evaluate.market, the Top Shot market peaked in late February but has still clocked multiple millions in daily sales in subsequent weeks.      Topps hopes its licensed MLB play will also be able to capture collector interest.      ""This is the first step with our longest-term partner into this new space, and it’s just the beginning,"" Lent said.      And – should Topps’ late-April NFT launch also suffer from the overwhelming demand that intermittently ground NBA Top Shot to halt in March – Lent says his team is poised to deliver.      “We try to learn from our competitors in the space like Dapper,” he said.

The border designs move but the players stay put.      WAXP, the native token of the Wax blockchain, is the 165th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinGecko. Wax runs on a fork of EOSIO, the software behind the EOS blockchain.      Topps, which was bought for $385 million and taken private by former Disney CEO Michael Eisner in 2007, is going public in a SPAC deal that values the company at $1.3 billion.

42386441,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBT6aL,1618187265,Biden Administration Concerned Over Long-Term Effects of Digital Yuan: Report,"President Joe Biden's administration is reportedly troubled by the long-term effects a digital yuan may have on the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.      According to a Sunday report by Bloomberg citing unnamed sources, officials at multiple government departments are increasing efforts to better understand possible threats posed by China's initiative.      Officials at the U.S. Treasury, State Department, Pentagon and National Security Council are reportedly unfazed by the short-term impacts a digital yuan, or China's digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system, may have on the dollar.      Challenges to the U.S. global reserve currency status over the long-term, however, are a major concern. Officials have begun ramping up their efforts to understand how the digital yuan will be distributed and whether it works around trade sanctions, according to the report.      China began developing its DCEP system with the involvement of the country's largest state-owned banks as well as payments giants Tencent and Ant Financial in 2019, as CoinDesk reported at the time.      The project has since gone through multiple test runs including gifting digital red packets of money to citizens via a lottery that was then spent at participating stores in select cities across China.      Because of these moves, China's central bank is positioned to be the first major central bank to issue a digital currency, giving the DCEP a headstart, an advantage that U.S. officials are starting to worry about as well, the report said.
