42382927,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tRAx,1572382843,"Polychain, Web3 to Back Polkadot Projects With New Ecosystem Fund","Polychain Capital is partnering with the Web3 Foundation to launch a new investment fund for projects building atop the Polkadot network.  The creators of the Polkadot Ecosystem Fund wouldn’t specify how much was committed but did characterize it as “in the millions” in an interview with CoinDesk.  Expected to formally launch later this year, Polkadot is envisioned as an interoperable proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network. It is being developed by the Swiss Web3 Foundation in close collaboration with blockchain startup Parity Technologies, which is led by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood.  As previously reported, the Web3 Foundation sought a $1.2 billion valuation for the project through multiple token sales from investors (including Polychain Capital). How much was ultimately raised by the project has not been disclosed.  “There's a track record of successful collaborations [with Polychain] that we want to continue,” Web3 Foundation communications lead Zeke Turner said via email, adding:  “The investment committee is looking for projects that will add long-term value to the Polkadot ecosystem.”  Speaking to the size of the fund, Turner said it’s “in the order of millions and can be recapitalized at any stage depending on the supply of investment targets.”  He also said that unlike grant funding, where payment is strictly one-way, investments from the Polkadot Ecosystem Fund may require a percentage of equity from participating startups.  “It’s safe to assume there’s some transfer of value in both directions to align long-term incentives,” said Turner.  Other initiatives  Since last December, the Web3 Foundation has been issuing grants to projects using Polkadot’s blockchain application framework, Substrate.  Now on its fourth wave of grants, over 40 projects have been funded in total by the non-profit with amounts ranging from $3,000 to $100,000 per grant.  In August  , Web3 Foundation launched an experimental version of Polkadot called Kusama for early application developers and validators to test out. Kusama most recently enabled staking, that is, the ability for users to earn rewards for validating transactions and processing blocks on the network.  In a statement, Wood, who is also president of Web3 Foundation, said he sees the Polkadot Ecosystem Fund as “an important outlet for teams at all stages to get the support they need.”  To this, Polychain Chief Investment Officer Olaf Carlson-Wee added:  “We are excited to invest and partner with hardcore engineers and entrepreneurs to catalyze the development of economic software built for Polkadot.”  Polychain Capital's Olaf Carlson-Wee image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | TOKEN SALE,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/29/polychain-web3-to-back-polkadot-projects-with-new-ecosystem-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77f594ffa2d594865db31524f3512e0e6b54b1b8-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382914,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tQx7,1572377451,'Clicks and Bricks' Strategy to Drive Korean Users to Terra's Blockchain,"A South Korean mobile payments dapp is rolling out a back-to-basics ""clicks and bricks"" growth strategy to boost retail adoption.  Rather than an advertising blitz or sending an army of bots to make their case on social media, Terra Blockchain's CHAI dapp is focusing on where customers actually transact to buy stuff.  Co-founder Daniel Shin told CoinDesk said customers are drawn to a network of popular online merchants accepting CHAI, including one of Korea's largest e-commerce sites TMON, which Shin founded and chairs, along with online craft market Sinsang Market and music streaming service Bugs.  The app claims some 500,000 registered users, with two-thirds returning monthly, and repeat customers averaging $19 spent per visit. Since launching in June, CHAI has posted daily figures averaging 40,000 users, Shin said, with total spending over the app exceeding $54 million.  “It’s not like we’ve captured these users who tried it once, thought it was nifty and went back to their existing products.""  Online is set to become in-real-life when the Korean convenience store CU begins accepting CHAI payment at all its 14,000 locations in December.  Designing better payments  Terra's payment rail is built on two separate cryptos: the terra stablecoin for moving funds across the network and a token, luna, held by miners entitling them to small transaction fees – between 0.1 and 1 percent, according to the Terra white paper.  “Terra and CHAI were meticulously designed from day one to drive mass adoption and deliver the right kind of value, to be able to drive millions of customers to use it,"" Shin said.  Giants are coming, however. The stablecoin needed to outmaneuver leading digital payment rails in Korea such as Kakao and Samsung Pay. Koreans may be embracing digital payments more than others, yet a report from the Asian Development Bank Institute says 70 percent of mobile point-of-sale payments are still linked to credit cards.  For Terra, Shin says the advantage lies in credit card fees that charge vendors as much as 3 percent per transaction. By routing those payments through the Terra blockchain, Terra has lowered merchant fees to 1 percent or less, saving vendors an aggregate $810,000 in its first four months.  “Our value proposition is exactly what these merchants are looking for,” Shin said.  Terra received $32 million in funding in the summer of 2018.

42431130,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Axh,1572374702,SEC Blasts Kik's 'Void for Vagueness' Defense of 2017 ICO,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Kik’s August defense of its $100 million initial coin offering (ICO) was “untenable” and is asking judges to toss it.  A discovery motion filed Monday further raised the stakes, following the SEC's 49-page filing Friday – the latest play in a legal chess match with sweeping potential ramifications for tokens and securities law, and one seeking, more specifically, to determine whether Kik’s 2017 ICO was lawful.  In Friday's filing, the SEC ridiculed Kik’s defense that vagueness shields them from legal woes:  “This defense asserts that, notwithstanding 70-plus years of well-settled jurisprudence, the term ‘investment contract’ in the securities laws is void for vagueness as applied to Kik’s investment scheme. This claim is untenable and should be dismissed.”  Kik has bet the farm on a “void for vagueness” affirmative defense, and wants to depose high-ranking SEC officials to prove the regulator was not in a position in 2017 to give clear guidance on token sales.  Rebecca Rettig, a partner at FisherBroyles, told CoinDesk:  “Kik is obviously using the void for vagueness defense as a way to try to peek behind the curtain at the SEC to figure out if the SEC really had a plan all along.”  But the SEC argued in the same discovery motion that Kik’s affirmative defense is without legal merit. The regulator tied their argument to Friday’s flaying of the ""void for vagueness"" question, arguing Kik’s deposition's motions “should be quashed.”  If the judges agree, Rettig says the SEC will “kill two birds with one stone.”  What is an investment contract, anyhow?  The SEC’s quarrel with Kik is more than semantics. It drives into decades of legal wrangling over what constitutes an “investment contract.” Kik claims vagueness precludes it from applying to their sale; the SEC says just the opposite.  But what is an investment contract?  Investment contracts are not actually defined in Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 – the backbone of U.S. securities law. But in the 1946 Supreme Court case SEC v. Howey, Justices set a legal framework for the phrase.  They created what is known as the “Howey test.” If a transaction invests in a common enterprise (i.e. a business) with the expectation of profit primarily from the effort of others, it is an investment contract. And therefore: a security. And therefore: it falls under the scope of the SEC.  In its June complaint kicking off this legal saga, the SEC argued Kik’s 2017 ICO was an investment contract sale and therefore fell under agency’s remit to regulate. They further claimed Kik executives knew the sale might catch the SEC’s attention and ire – even before the ICO was publicly announced.  In August, Kik argued the opposite. Denying that their tokens were “investment contracts,” Kik said the term did not apply to their ICO, and if it were, then it would be self-defeating because its vagueness makes it unconstitutional:  “As applied to Kik’s offer and sale of Kin in 2017, the definition of ‘investment contract’ (as urged by the Commission) is hopelessly vague, and leaves the Commission free to engage in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement in this space.”  Void for vagueness  Kik’s affirmative defense – and the SEC’s recent response – spar over whether the “void for vagueness” doctrine of American constitutional law applies here. “Void for vagueness” is the doctrine that laws must not be indecipherable to people of “ordinary intelligence,"" or encourage “arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”  Put another way, laws must be easy to understand and precise enough to not apply to everything under the sun. Fail either bar, or both, and a court may well rule the law “void for vagueness” and strike it from the books.  But that might not matter in a business context, the SEC argued, citing the Supreme Court’s 1982 ruling in Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.  “[E]conomic regulation is subject to a less strict vagueness test because its subject matter is often more narrow, and because businesses, which face economic demands to plan behavior carefully, can be expected to consult relevant legislation in advance of action.”  In Kik’s August defense they argued that they did not have “adequate notice” that the SEC would consider Kin an “investment contract.”  The SEC, however, says that is not so. The DAO Report was released in July 2017 – two months prior to Kik’s September 2017 ICO – setting the ground rules for on-chain investment contracts and thus “provided Kik constitutionally sufficient notice to Kik that the Offering and Sale might violate the Securities Act.”  Rettig said that the SEC sees their July 2017 DAO report on digital asset securities drew a “bright line” for ICO issuers, said Rettig.  “The SEC says DAO was the line: ‘We issued our DAO report and after that everyone in the digital assets space is on notice that if they were issuing tokens, they better do a Howey analysis and make sure that they weren't investment contracts. You, Kik, didn’t do that and therefore you violated section 5 of the Securities Act.”  What happens next  Until the court rules on these arguments, and the case, these legal back and forths are mere jousts.  A decision could take weeks, or even months, lawyers said. And it took years for the SEC to pursue action against token sales, Kik argues, saying the wild west ICOs of 2016 and 2017 “contributed to the confusion” of this case.  Kik’s strategy is to force a lengthy discovery process with depositions from a range of SEC officials; they argue that documents, and depositions, are relevant to their void for vagueness affirmative defense.  Conversely, the SEC argues that their discovery requests are irrelevant, cover privileged material, and target officials usually exempt from being deposed.  Lawyers representing Kik did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.

Shhgit, a webapp and downloadable tool by Paul Price aims at least to reduce the chance of that happening.  The app, which is open source, scans code repository GitHub for dangerous files and data. As a beginning coder, you may have left your password data or private keys inside public repository without realizing. When this happens, hackers and other nasties can easily access your stuff.  ""Finding these secrets across GitHub is nothing new,"" wrote Price, a programmer and security expert who goes by the handle Darkport. ""There are many open-source tools available to help with this depending on which side of the fence you sit. On the adversary side, popular tools such as gitrob and truggleHog focus on digging in to commit history to find secret tokens from specific repositories, users or organizations.""  Sshgit is more public about these secrets: it offers a front-end that simply displays them as they appear on GitHub. This means hackers could watch it for potential places to exploit. But it also encourages safe coding because users know their public repositories are insecure.  Not everything sshgit uncovers is dangerous information but you can also set it to search for signatures that you're particularly interested in, like, say, ethereum wallet addresses.  As someone who once committed the private keys for a bitcoin wallet to a public GitHub account, let me tell you: I could have used this a few years ago.  The product is free, downloadable here.

Announced in a tweet by the firm's CEO Sam Bankman-Fried Tuesday, the Dragon Perpetual Futures Index (DRGN-PERP) tracks a basket of coins including BTM, IOST, NEO, NULS, ONT, QTUM, TRX, and VET, based on a weighted average of their respective prices.  FTX is also offering traders exposure to the coins in the form of perpetual futures contracts based on the index.  Traders will be able to leverage these contracts up to 101 times, Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk.  While widely known within China, the country does not permit crytpocurrency trading, with all of the promoters of this coin now operating from friendlier shores since the ruling in 2017.  The exchange – which operates out of Antigua and Barbuda – has a history of providing less orthodox indices, having launched the amusingly titled Shitcoin Perpetual Futures Index in August. That offering covers a basket of 58 low-market cap cryptocurrencies.  The timing of the DRGN-PERP launch probably couldn't have been better, coming days after Chinese President Xi Jinping urged his country to “seize the opportunity” afforded by blockchain technology and proposed adoption across a wide range of sectors.  Chinese blockchain and tech stocks saw a massive spike in interest after Xi's comments, prompting authorities to urge investors to avoid speculative behavior.    ""China recently voiced support for the blockchain industry, causing a bunch of cryptocurrencies developed there to skyrocket in price and driving intense user interest in Chinese cryptocurrency projects,"" Bankman-Fried said.

42431129,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Avh,1572356113,Samsung Adds Support for Tron Network to Blockchain Dapp Store,"Tron founder Justin Sun will appear on stage at the Samsung Developer Conference on Wednesday to announce a new partnership between his crypto company and the telecom giant.  Tron will be integrated into the software development kit (SDK) of the Samsung Blockchain Keystore, which helps users manage private keys. The SDK allows coders build with the Tron network by giving them direct access to the blockchain via Samsung devices.  It’s still unclear how this partnership changes anything for TRX token users, beyond wallet support. In the days leading up to the announcement, Sun tweeted about a partnership with a “megacorporation” that would “broadly distribute $Tron Dapps [decentralized applications] and tokens to billions of customers.”  The Pew Research Center estimated that 5 billion people currently have access to mobile devices, only half of which are smartphones. Considering Samsung is among the top hardware sellers alongside Apple and Huawei, which have both captured significant market share, it would be a stretch to imagine even 1 billion users gaining access to the Samsung Blockchain Keystore. (CoinDesk was unable to reach Samsung for comment. We will update the article if we hear back.)  Beyond mobile wallets, Samsung devices should have the same direct access to Tron blockchain data. This could, in theory, make it easier for dapp developers to make products for Samsung users that don’t rely on third-party wallets.  As such, Sun heralded this new conduit as a “milestone” for Tron. According to Tron’s latest report, there are roughly 3.9 million Tron wallet accounts and 611 dapps.  In a WhatsApp message, Sun told CoinDesk the partnership would make it easier for “millions of users of Samsung devices” because developers can build applications using Samsung devices.  ""One of the biggest frictions in the dapp user experience is the wallet,” Sun told CoinDesk, adding:  “With the Tron/Samsung integration, users won't need any third party wallet anymore. And develops can just focus on the content they are building and provide a seamless experience to end users.”  Justin Sun image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,TRX,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRX | RESEARCH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/29/samsung-adds-support-for-tron-network-to-blockchain-dapp-store,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5c5dc1de6b012b9bb43bb3e35ccd3e6b33791916-1140x792.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431133,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0B1h,1572354052,"Lock BTC, Get DAI: Lending Firm Bridges Bitcoin-DeFi Divide in Latin America","Canadian startup Ledn, which offers bitcoin-backed fiat loans, now also offers dollar-pegged DAI loans, connecting bitcoin users with ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  Ledn co-founder Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, a Venezuelan expat, told CoinDesk this new partnership with stablecoin promoter MakerDAO was driven by customer demand.  Out of “thousands” of users, more than half of Ledn’s users are in Latin America, Di Bartolomeo said, where ethereum-backed DAI is increasingly seen as an alternative to strictly regulated dollar transfers. In fact, this past weekend the central bank of Argentina restricted civilians to buying only $200 in USD per month, down from the previous $10,000.  “In Argentina, if you receive a bank transference in USD they convert it immediately to ARS (Argentinian Nuevo peso), and you lose money,” Nadia Alvarez, MakerDAO’s head of business development in Latin America, told CoinDesk. “We know BTC hodlers don't want to sell their BTC, but they need liquidity, for their daily expenses. That is why we think this is relevant for Latin America.”  Ledn isn’t the first company to notice that bitcoiners are eager for access to the ethereum community’s experimental loan products. Silicon Valley startups in the Cross-Chain Working Group are also working on a different solution to allow wrapped bitcoin tokens directly on the ethereum blockchain.  Plus, later this month Maker token holders, who govern the stablecoin ecosystem, will vote on whether to include bitcoin among the upcoming multi-collateral version of DAI. (Currently, DAI tokens are only made by locking up ether tokens in smart contracts that monitor ether prices and automatically liquidate the ether collateral if the price plummets.)  In the meantime, Ledn will buy ethereum-backed DAI from over-the-counter traders and manage bitcoin custody for loan clients. Di Bartolomeo said clients across Latin American have reported banking issues comparable to Argentina, although unique for each context, which is why they are turning to DAI. He added Colombians make up 16 percent of Ledn’s user base, the largest demographic in Latin America, followed by Venezuelans at 12 percent.  “Several users have expressed that they would like to use stablecoins like DAI to purchase additional digital assets and others to access more financial services,” he said.  DeFi boom  Ledn users will soon be able to lock up their bitcoin and spend DAI at 750 merchants across Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil, according to MakerDAO’s Alvarez.  Separate from the loan startup, MakerDAO is partnering with product-provider Pundi X, and planning to install point-of-sale devices across Latin America so that DAI users can spend crypto directly on goods and services. In addition, brick-and-mortar locations will enable a user in Argentina to send fiat or DAI to Venezuela, for example, with Pundi X’s debit card–esque Xcard.  “The [Ledn] DAI loan gives bitcoiners the opportunity to enter into the DeFi world, and all the projects inside the ecosystem,” Alvarez said.  Di Bartolomeo told CoinDesk he’s excited to work with MakerDAO precisely because they have “boots on the ground” where his customer base lives. Dozens of people have attended DAI meetups in Mexico City, Bogota and Buenos Aires over the past year. Globally, MakerDAO records currently show more than 60,000 DAI wallet addresses in October 2019.  “While we don't yet explicitly hear from our users that they are spending DAI for their day-to-day expenses like they do with dollars,” Di Bartolomeo said, “we expect stablecoin adoption to increase in the region because they solve important problems for users.”  Disclosure: CoinDesk contributor Diana Aguilar is Ledn's digital content director.

As reported by Global Times, Tencent’s blockchain invoice project was backed by multiple countries including the U.K., Switzerland, Sweden and Brazil, as well as China's State Administration of Taxation, at the ITU-T international meeting on e-voice standards Tuesday.  Originally an anti-tax fraud initiative in Shenzhen, the company's work on using blockchain tech to provide transparency in business reporting was announced last year.  For the standards effort, Tencent is joined by The China Academy of Information and Communications Technology and the Shenzhen Taxation Bureau for the initial drafts, which Tencent and the related firms claim to be a step forward in realized blockchain business applications.  Blockchain-based invoices aggregate and distribute information for commercial transactions typically between permissioned parties.  Li Ming, director of blockchain research at the China Electronics Standardization Institute, told Global Times that the the move to develop standards demonstrates the importance of business applications for blockchain technology:  ""E-invoicing is an appropriate field for blockchain application [investigations] and trials currently, which could in turn promote tech development.""  The standards drafting announcement comes hot on the heels of a flurry of blockchain-related news out of China.  The nation's president, Xi Jinping, told Communist Party constituents last week that the government will begin a top-down approach on blockchain implementation, with the aim being to adopt the tech across a wide range of use cases. While, on Monday, a Chinese central bank official asked commercial banks to investigate blockchain adoption for digital finance applications.  In a more curious use case for the tech, the country's Communist Party has just announced a decentralized app (dapp) that will allow members to pledge their loyalty for all to see.

The exchange will support USDT pairs including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), EOS, XRP, bitcoin SV (BSV) and Tron (TRX) with leverage between 1 and 100x when trading commences on Nov. 6, according to a press release issued Tuesday.  The firm claims its linear futures contracts will be easier for newbie traders to handle, as holders do not have to hedge the margin risk as they would with inverse contracts.  “Most of the time, users are not willing to hold altcoins as margin, and they also see inverse contracts itself are complicated to understand. We see this linear contract would be an open door to many new retail traders,” said OKEx's financial market director, Lennix Lai.  A stablecoin linked (or supposed to be) to the U.S. dollar, tether hasn't yet been widely used as the basis for futures contracts, though CoinFLEX announced a similar product in January.  OKEx said it will continue looking into adding more stablecoin-based trading products in the near future. ""We would continue to research and add stablecoin-based derivatives so to offer a simpler hedging instrument for traders who normally book their profit and loss in USD value,"" Lai added.  To ensure price fairness across the market, OKEx's tether futures contracts will be an average of cryptocurrency exchanges Huobi, Coinbase, Bittrex and Binance's tether spot prices.

42431135,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0B7h,1572346805,Key Indicator Turns Bullish as Bitcoin Struggles to Break Above $10K,"View  The three-day chart MACD's first bullish turn in over three months could bode well for bitcoin's price, according to historical data. The cryptocurrency may challenge 2019 high above $13,800 before the year's end.  The immediate outlook, however, is bearish and prices could drop to $8,800 in the next day or two, with the daily chart reporting buyer exhaustion. Further, China's state media has asked investors to avoid speculative behavior which could dampen trading.  A pennant breakout on the hourly chart could yield a re-test of recent highs above $10,000, although that looks unlikely.      A widely-tracked bitcoin (BTC) price indicator has turned bullish for the first time in over three months, hinting that a move to yearly highs lies ahead.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram – an indicator used to identify trend reversals and trend strength – has crossed above zero on the three-day chart, confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change. A positive reading was last observed in the first half of July.  Seasoned traders may argue that the MACD's bullish turn cannot be trusted, as it is based on moving averages (MAs) which are lagging indicators.  While that sounds logical, the histogram has a strong track record of predicting trend changes and big moves, as seen in the chart below.  The MACD crossed above zero in late December 2018, confirming a bottom had been made near $3,100 and remained in the bullish territory throughout the first quarter, even though bitcoin's recovery rally remained capped above $4,000.  The cryptocurrency broke into a bull market on April 2 with a convincing move above a bearish lower high of $4,236 created on Dec. 24.  The histogram fell below zero on Nov. 14 as prices breached the long-held support of $6,000. What followed was a sell-off to $3,100.  Going further back, the indicator's bullish turn in Oct. 2017 was followed by a meteoric rise from $7,000 to $20,000. Meanwhile, a drop below zero in early January 2018 fueled a deeper slide in bitcoin's price from $13,000 to $6,000.  So if history is a guide, the MACD's latest bullish turn could see bitcoin breaking out of a four-month falling channel and challenging yearly highs above $13,800 before the year's end.  Supporting the bullish case is another piece of historical data that says BTC picks up a strong bid six months ahead of the mining reward halving due in May 2020.  So far, however, the MACD's move above zero has failed to be reflected in price gains. BTC is currently changing hands at $9,470 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, having faced rejection near the 100-day MA resistance at $9,625 during the Asian trading hours.  Notably, bitcoin failed to close above the 100-day MA for the third straight day on Tuesday, having faced rejection above $10,000 over the weekend. as seen below.  Daily chart and hourly charts  The repeated failure to hold onto gains above the 100-day MA indicates buyer exhaustion. A similar sentiment is echoed by Tuesday's red candle with a long upper shadow.  As a result, the odds of BTC diving out of the contracting triangle, or pennant pattern, on the hourly chart are high. At press time, the lower edge of the pennant is located at $9,260.  A breakdown, if confirmed, could yield a sell-off to the former resistance-turned-support of $8,820 (formerly a bearish lower high).  On the other hand, a high-volume pennant breakout, if confirmed, would imply a resumption of the rally from Friday's low near $7,400 and will likely yield a quick break above $10,000.  China influence  China's state media has called investors to stay rational and avoid speculative behavior. The warning has come after Monday's sharp rise in blockchain-related stocks in China.  Investors poured money into bitcoin and blockchain-focused stocks after President Xi Jinping said last week that the world’s second-largest economy should accelerate its adoption of the blockchain technology.  The comments by China's state media may force investors to scale back lofty expectations, leading to a price drop. A pennant breakdown, therefore, looks likely.  The overall outlook would turn bullish if and when the cryptocurrency invalidates the four-month bearish trend, as discussed on Monday.

FATF’s former executive secretary, Rick McDonell, was added to the blockchain firm’s board, along with the former head of the Canadian delegation to the FATF, Josee Nadeau. Both held their respective positions at the FATF – a global money-laundering watchdog – for about a decade each.  Shyft operates a digital identity protocol for permissioned and permissionless blockchains in both private and public ecosystems. The firm is currently working with Bermuda’s government to roll out the first phase of a digital ID solution for citizens of the island nation, as well as visitors and enterprises.  In July, Shyft teamed up with CipherTrace on an initiative that aims to help cryptocurrency exchanges comply with tough new rules announced by the FATF in June. The new “travel rule” guidance for FATF member nations sets out that ""virtual asset providers"" (VASPs) must obtain, hold and share know-your-customer (KYC) information with other VASPs – and potentially governmental bodies – for cryptocurrency transfers above a certain threshold.  While CipherTrace's solution (known as TRISA) is distinct from Shyft's, a source with knowledge tells CoinDesk ""they're not competing solutions, they're inherently collaborative.""  Still, observers say the race is on to establish a global standard for FATF compliance.  Shyft said it has teamed up with some of the ""top 10"" cryptocurrency exchanges to develop its solution to a vexing problem: VASPs currently lack a compliant way to share KYC data that also maintains user privacy.

42431132,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Azh,1572339617,Deloitte Adds Privacy Tech to Its Education-Credentials Blockchain,"Professional services giant Deloitte has added zero-knowledge proof privacy tech to its enterprise blockchain offering.  Announced Tuesday at the ZKProof Community Event in Amsterdam, Deloitte has teamed up with Israeli zero-knowledge proof experts QEDIT, to help users control how a blockchain shares data about the certificates and qualifications they have earned.  Deloitte’s Eduscrypt platform allows organizations to track, share and validate qualifications, using a private, permissioned version of ethereum. But there are instances where it is critically important to have control over what is shared, and with whom. This could be the case in Europe where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forbids information about individuals being shared willy-nilly.  One way around this is by avoiding putting data on a blockchain at all and instead replacing it with proofs about that data. This is what zero-knowledge proof technology does: one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know some secret information, without conveying anything at all about the information.  “You can have a person prove their credentials and reveal them to the right people and fully retain control of who gets to learn what, and still have that in a notarised blockchain with all the security that it provides,” said Jonathan Rouach, co-founder and CEO at QEDIT.  Antonio Senatore, chief technology officer of Deloitte’s EMEA Blockchain Lab, said that validating, managing and recording the education qualifications of staff and prospective hires can be a very onerous and costly process for most organizations, with regulatory fines for non-compliance.  “Integrating QEDIT’s Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy solution ensures that organizations can trust in the authenticity of qualifications, while preserving the full privacy of the underlying data, and upholding regulatory compliance,” he said in a statement.  Need-to-know basis  As well as complying with GDPR, Rouach pointed to particular instances where ZKP would be helpful, such as an individual who has switched careers might want to be selective in what information can be shared about them.  “For example, a person is going to prove that they have a security certification from some IT school, but then they also learned statistics for gamblers. So when they go to apply to a bank, they would like to show that they are proficient in security but not anything else they might have acquired in their education,” Rouach said.  The event in Amsterdam, billed as Europe's first dedicated zero-knowledge event, is being organized by QEDIT and Deloitte and taking place in the latter’s offices. Also appearing are the likes of ING Bank and Facebook’s Calibra.  The goal is to bring the ZKP community together with industries looking to use the technology and drive standards.  “ZKPs are moving fast and companies that want to deploy it don’t have experts to say what are the most mature and trusted implementations,” Rouach said.

It will be the third year of such support from the KISA, which is under the Ministry of Science and ICT, according to the announcement from the agency on Monday. The plans were discussed at a meeting held in Seoul on Friday last week.  About 10 projects will be chosen for next year while one or two of them will receive funding over a number of years. The maximum funding will be $1.2 million per project, according to Min Kyung-sik, head of KISA's blockchain center, as quoted by Coindesk Korea.  Both public sector and private sector projects will be eligible to apply and application will be taken through Nov. 11 with results to be announced on Dec. 20. The public sector includes any of the 400 government and government-related entities, such as central agencies, regional organizations and public institutions  While KISA ruled out the support of cryptocurrency projects and crypto exchanges, it does leave the door open for the projects pursued by major financial institutions that may involve tokens.  That said, the 2020 plan is a step back from the commitment this year. In 2019, 12 projects were supported with a total of $11 million of funding.  The program this year included a direct funding of $6 million and expense reimbursement of $5.4 million. However, the average funding per project will remain the same in 2020, KISA notes.  Projects this year included a donation platform, Hyundai Autoever's used car service platform and the Initial blockchain ID platform--which was supported by all the major phone companies in the country.  Other projects in 2019 included a records-management system for the National Archives, a network for the sharing of medical information, a system for food safety, an electric-vehicle battery record system and a carbon-emissions record system.
