42403124,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeoI4,1564772440,Nexo Launches a Debit Card That Lets You Not Spend Your Crypto,"Arrington XRP Capital-backed financial startup Nexo has unveiled a crypto card with a line of credit backed by the user's crypto holdings.  Nexo partnered with an unnamed intermediary to issue the card, which offers a way for users to “spend the value of their crypto without actually spending it,” said firm partner Antoni Trenchev.  Unlike other crypto credit cards like TenX and Crypterium that convert cryptocurrencies to fiat for every transaction, Nexo collateralizes users' crypto and supplies them with a fiat loan. Since its founding, the startup has extended more than $700 million in crypto-collateralized loans to over 200,000 clients. Now, the loans can be used to make purchases at merchants that accept MasterCard, through a co-branding.  After swiping, an oracle confirms the user has enough collateral to cover the purchase, instantaneously executes a loan, and settles the transaction in fiat. Trenchev claims the card's issuer is licensed within the European Economic Area.  Through additional partnerships with intermediaries, Nexo aims to expand to the U.S. and Asia by the end of the year.  Collateralized loans  The cards are available independent of a client's credit history, as the staked collateral reduces default risk. Likewise, interest rates are set between 8 and 24 percent APR based on the loan structure and local regulations.  Users can repay their loans in either crypto or fiat, though using Nexo's token will reduce interest rates to 8 percent. Additionally, minimum payments will be eliminated if the value of bitcoin increases. This is because the credit line is ""dynamic,"" meaning as the value a client's collateralized assets increases relative to the market, their fiat debts decrease.  In fact, crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce mortgaged a house in Amsterdam through a $1.2 million line of credit through Nexo, and hasn’t made a single repayment due to the rising value of bitcoin since he took the loan, Trenchev said.  Conversely, if cryptocurrencies crash, users will either have to “deposit more crypto, pay a part of their loan to reduce exposure, or sell a portion of their collateral to restore the loan-to-value ratio,” Trenchev said.  The company complies with know-your-customer ustomer protocol, follows international sanctions, and has integrated with blockchain investigators Chainalysis to check if collateralized crypto has been ill-gotten, it says.  Nexo has previously paid out dividends of 30 percent on $3 million of profit made during its first 7 months in operation to token holders.

The custodian, which Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says already holds $1 billion in assets, will act as the custodian for Grayscale's single-asset and diversified investment products.  Grayscale claims to hold $2.7 billion in total assets under management, according to its most recent quarterly reporthttps://grayscale.co/digital-asset-investment-report-2019-q2/, more than doubling its Q1 holdings of $1.2 billion.  Grayscale holds bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, ethereum classic, litecoin, Stellar lumens, XRP and zcash. Coinbase Custody also intends to hold Grayscale's horizen (ZEN) token, pending regulatory approval to support the asset.  Most of the assets are being transferred to Coinbase Custody from Grayscale's existing security provider, Xapo. The private keys for Grayscale's horizen are also currently being held by the Digital Asset Custody Company, which bitcoin futures platform Bakkt acquired earlier this year.  Coinbase Custody  began holding Grayscale's assets on July 29, according to a press release. Coinbase Custody is regulated through the New York Department of Financial Services, and is a regulated fiduciary under New York's banking law.  In a statement  , Coinbase Custody CEO Sam McIngvale explained that the business is ""held to the same fiduciary standards as national banks. We also offer some of the broadest and deepest insurance coverage in the crypto industry.""  He added:  ""Grayscale and Coinbase have led the way in providing safe, secure, trustworthy, and regulated access to digital assets. Grayscale is an established, trusted, and valuable partner to its clients and its service providers should be the same.""  Under the agreement, Coinbase Custody will hold Grayscale's assets for three years at the outset, charging a fee based on the assets under custody.

42422912,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qzBh,1564756222,South Korea Declares Partial 'Regulation-Free' Zone for Crypto Companies,"Busan has been declared a “regulation-free” zone for blockchain development by South Korea's national government, a move long expected but now formalized as part of a larger liberalization push.  Zug, Switzerland is said to be one of the models for the zone.  The Ministry of SMEs and Startups announced on July 24 that the second largest city in the country by population will host a wide range of blockchain offerings related to finance, public safety and tourism, though it stopped short of fully opening the market and allowing for international-level crypto initiatives, according to the Korea Herald.  A total of eleven regulations have been lifted for the project. It is expected that investors will move 29.9 billion won ($25 million) into the region by 2021 and development will be spread between the Munhyeon Innovation District, the Centum Innovation District and the Dongsam Innovation District.  BNK Busan Bank, a Korea Exchange-listed local institution, will supervise blockchain management as it relates to finance and might be developing a stablecoin pegged to the won.  Hyundai Pay is supporting payment solutions and advances in tourism. The company, which was established in 2016 by the CEO of Hyundai BS&C (also grandson of the founder of the Hyundai Group), signed a memorandum of understanding with the city in February in which it said it would move its headquarters to Busan and help it develop blockchain infrastructure utilizing the Hdac blockchain platform.  Other elements of the program include a public safety offering by Gyeonggi Province-based Coinplug, which claims to be Korea's largest holder of blockchain patents. The development will include an app which allows citizens to video natural disasters and crimes and send the files to the appropriate authorities, complete with location information. A rewards system will encourage the use of the app. The next stage will involve a database that will allow for the storing and sharing of information.  BP&Solution, a Busan-based computer company, will work on blockchain as it relates to fisheries.  The region won't be completely ""regulation-free,"" however. ICOs will not be allowed, and the project is still decidedly conservative in terms of cryptocurrency. The stablecoin envisioned will be highly limited in terms of its use. It will mainly be a component of a rewards system incentivizing participation in the other local blockchain offerings and will only be redeemable at certain establishments, making it more a voucher than a coin. Busan has explicitly said that the reforms are not designed to be cryptocurrency-related.  While the government move has been billed as an exemption from regulation, it is more a controlled experiment with certain defined goals and is evolutionary rather than revolutionary and fitting with Korea's general and persistent suspicion of crypto.  The plan was initially mentioned in April, when Busan was reported to have won out over Jeju, a province already known for its relatively liberal policies. Jeju developed an ambitious and rather aggressive vision in 2018 to become a crypto island.  Busan has long been a center for trading and finance as well as a hub for innovation, and it is the home of the Korea Exchange. The city has been working for some time on blockchain-related developments, including the use of the technology at the port.  The recent designation of Busan as Korea's blockchain capital is connected to a broad policy drive by Korea's current administration. President Moon Jae-in has been promoting so-called regulatory sandboxes, which allow for the temporary suspension of rules so that new technologies and services can be tested outside the complex legal and bureaucratic environment in the country.  A goal of 100 such sandboxes was set for 2019, and as of mid July, 81 had been approved.  In line with the sandbox push, the government has named seven areas (cities and provinces) that will receive blanket sandbox privileges in certain technologies. South Jeolla Province, for example, will focus on e-mobility, Daegu on smart wellness and Sejong on autonomous driving.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Richard Meyer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/02/south-korea-declares-partial-regulation-free-zone-for-crypto-companies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f95a2055cf07a50f7c9bfc6743ef9367d05b4c5-1400x788.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Only 2% Were Labeled 'Illicit'","Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic collaborated with researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and IBM to publish a public dataset of bitcoin transactions associated with illicit activity.  The group’s study detailed how researchers at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab used machine learning software to analyze 203,769 bitcoin node transactions worth roughly $6 billion in total. The research explored whether artificial intelligence could assist current anti-money laundering (AML) procedures.  Only 2 percent of the 200,000 bitcoin transactions in the data set were deemed illicit as part of Eliptic's initial work. While 21 percent were identified as lawful, the vast majority of the transactions, roughly 77 percent, remained unclassified. (To date, there have been an estimated 440 million bitcoin transactions since the network's launch in 2009.)  To be clear, the 2 percent comes from an Elliptic data set that was previously not public and the figure was merely affirmed by the MIT researchers' analysis. The data point is in line with a study from competing analytics firm Chainalysis, which estimated just 1 percent of bitcoin transactions in 2019 were known to be associated with illicit activity.  Since Elliptic is frequently hired by law enforcement agencies around the world to identify illegal activities using cryptocurrency, this research aimed to identify patterns that can help distinguish illicit usage from lawful bitcoin usage, especially among unbanked individuals or other unknown entities.  “A big problem with compliance, in general, is false positives. A big part of this research is minimizing the number of false positives,” Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CoinDesk. “The key finding is that machine learning techniques are very effective at finding transactions that are illicit.”  Sometimes, Robinson added, software was able to find patterns that would be difficult to describe yet still matched with known entities, based on pre-existing data from darknet markets, ransomware attacks and other criminal investigations.  Following the academic study, Elliptic made the same dataset public to encourage open-source contributions.  “On the AML side, we are sharing our early experiments with domain experts to solicit feedback,” IBM researcher Mark Weber told CoinDesk, adding:  “We are also hoping the release of the Elliptic Data Set inspires others to join the effort to help make our financial systems safer by developing new techniques and models for AML.”  CNBC  reported in April that surging demand for U.S. $100 bills was likely driven by a rise in global criminal activity. A 2017 report by the American Institute for Economic Researchhttps://www.aier.org/article/sound-money-project/how-much-cash-used-criminals-and-tax-cheats, estimated that ""more than a third of all US currency in circulation is used by criminals and tax cheats.""  Update (22:00 UTC, Aug. 6): The title of this article has been modified and language has been added to clarify that the 2 percent figure was calculated in Elliptic's initial work, and not in the subsequent analysis involving MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.

42430814,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxxHh,1564750814,ConsenSys-Backed Truffle Is Taking Its Dev Tools Beyond Just Ethereum,"The company behind a popular suite of tools for ethereum developers is expanding to three new blockchain networks.  Truffle CEO and founder Tim Coulter will announce Friday at the startup’s TruffleCon event in Seattle that additional tooling would be built for Hyperledger Fabric, Tezos and R3’s Corda.  “Last year at TruffleCon, we celebrated 1 million downloads,” said Wesley McVay, Truffle’s vice president and head of global strategic partnerships. “I said the next million downloads are going to be focused around enterprise. This year at TruffleCon, we are announcing two incredible enterprise integrations and one really amazing open-source public integration.”  Both Hyperledger Fabric and the Corda network are marketed as enterprise-focused, permissioned blockchains. Developers for these platforms are backed by large enterprise organizations such as IBM and SBI.  Tezos, on the other hand, is a public blockchain network that at one point amassed a total token supply value of over $1 billion. It too has been used and developed upon by major companies including Brazil’s fifth-largest bank, BTG Pactual.  With the expansion of Truffle developer tools to these blockchain networks, Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf see these formerly divided technical communities being able to better cooperate and work across chains.  ""This integration marks another step towards compatibility and interoperability in blockchain and smart contract development,"" said Behlendorf in a press statement. “We believe the Truffle integration will bring even more energy and ideas from the Ethereum developer community into Hyperledger.""  Interoperability is also a stated goal of Truffle’s as it looks to grow beyond the 3.4 million downloads it has clocked to date. The ConsenSys-backed company was recently spun out of the Brooklyn-based venture studio, though it continues to receive support from ConsenSys. An internal ConsenSys document from early 2019 pointed to Truffle as one of the firm’s standout successes.  “We’re called Truffle and we have all this chocolate branding because we want the experience for developers to be as delightful as eating a chocolate truffle,” Coulter said, adding:  “Truffle’s the start of the development experience. You start building with Truffle, then build your application and deploy it to whatever platform you want. … This multi-chain future I’m talking about has a lot of people working to have the many protocols themselves integrate with one another.”  Truffle's Wes McVay (left) and Tim Coulter (right) speak at TruffleCon 2018 (photo via ConsenSys)",POSITIVE,BTG,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | BTG,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/02/consensys-backed-truffle-is-taking-its-dev-tools-beyond-just-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8ee9462cb5228953f97cb7a2a4324b06558b5dd-1024x860.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The highly technical conundrum has been posed to coders in a competition supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that aims to ""change the face of blockchain,"" as well as how hardware is designed and made.  Launched by the VDF Alliance, the competition aims to solve how to calculate something called the verifiable delay function (VDF) in the shortest time.  In its announcement, AWS paraphrases Justin Drake, a researcher with the Ethereum Foundation, explaining that ""VDFs are a low-level building block in cryptography, barely more than a year old. It’s the “V” or ‘verifiable’ in VDF that makes the approach so unique.""  “It’s trustless,” according to Drake. “For the first time, it adds this notion of time with which you can build all these cool things.”  Included in the ""cool things"" promised by VDF tech is ""unbiased proof of randomness."" Effectively, it could enable trustless, truly random number generators on blockchains. Currently, these are pseudo-random and can be exploited by bad actors by effectively being able to guess the number. With true randomness, that wouldn't be possible.  If the tech can be advanced sufficiently it could help to move blockchain such as ethereum from the energy-intensive and hence costly proof-of-work algorithm to one called proof-of-stake.  “The Ethereum ecosystem alone currently uses on the order of 850 megawatts to extend blocks. That’s about $460 million in running costs per year,” said Tim Boeckmann, senior startup business development manager for AWS in the U.K. “With VDFs in Ethereum, there is an opportunity to bring down that cost to less than $0.13 million for the 0.25 megawatts of energy to power the hardware random beacons.""  In fact, the competition is being held in partnership with the Ethereum Foundation, as well as other alliance members, the Interchain Foundation, Protocol Labs, Supranational, Synopsys, and Xilinx, which are sponsoring the event ""with support from AWS.""  As reported by CoinDesk previously, the Ethereum Foundation is already working on the VDF problem, revealing in February that it was considering spending $7.5 million in the search for true randomness.  VDFs are envisioned for use in ethereum's much-anticipated proof-of-stake system called Serenity, to which the ethereum network will migrate in the next few years.  The first round of the competition will run till the end of September, and will award prize money to the fastest design that solves the problem at the top of this article.  In the initial round of the competition, successful entrants will be awarded $3,000 for every nanosecond improvement. Full details can be found here.  Drakes suggests that those entering will need a blend of skills.  “You are going to need people who are really good at hardware design, but also people with algorithmic skills,” he said. “My guess is the winning team will have a combination of that expertise.”  AWS image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/02/aws-backs-100000-competition-to-change-the-face-of-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a0dc0dd7d4dbd1bdcd163a1ecc7a7ccdc3b4913-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish if BTC prints a UTC close above $11,120 on the back of high volumes.  Prices may pullback to key supports at $10,318 and $10,172 first, as the hourly chart is reporting bearish divergence of key indicators.      Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing green for the fourth consecutive day and could test key resistance above $11,000 over the weekend.  The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $10,530 on Bitstamp – up 1.10 percent on the daily opening price of $10,417. Prices rose 1, 5 and 3 percent on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.  Bitcoin’s repeated rebound from sub-$9,400 levels in the 13 days to July 29 likely indicates seller exhaustion. Another strong sign of bearish exhaustion emerged in the form of a long-legged doji candle on July 28, as discussed earlier this week.  Hence, BTC’s $1,000 rise seen in the last 48 hours is hardly surprising. The bullish move could be extended further as short duration technical studies are beginning to align in favor of the bulls.  Daily chart  The 14-day relative strength index seems to have found acceptance above 50.00, a sign of bull market conditions.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, an indicator used to identify trend change and trend strength, has crossed above zero, confirming bullish reversal. The MACD is indicating that the pullback from June’s high of $13,880 has ended and the path of least resistance is now to the higher side.  So, BTC could test the bearish lower high of $11,120 (July 20 high) over the weekend. A high-volume UTC close above that level would further confirm bullish revival and open the doors to $13,000.  The widely followed 50-day moving average (MA) is currently located at $10,570 may cap upside for the next few hours, though, as BTC is looking heavy on the intraday charts.  Hourly chart  Both the RSI and the MACD have produced lower highs, contradicting the higher highs on price.  The bearish divergence of key indicators suggests scope for minor pullback to support lines located at $10,318 and $10,172.

42430812,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxxFh,1564738071,Walmart Wants to Patent a Stablecoin That Looks a Lot Like Facebook Libra,"Retail giant Walmart has applied for a cryptocurrency patent that bears some similarities to the Libra token proposed by Facebook in mid-June.  In its application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Walmart touts the concept of a digital currency ""tied to a regular currency"" – that is, what's commonly known as a stablecoin. Libra will be a token pegged to a basket of fiat currencies and government bonds, according to Facebook.  Over and above that, the filing suggests that the proposed coin could help provide finance for those with limited access to banking services – one of the major claims Facebook has made for Libra, most likely in an effort to appeal to the public (and regulators) over the token.  ""Using a digital currency, low-income households that find banking expensive, may have an alternative way to handle wealth at an institution that can supply the majority of their day-to-day financial and product needs,"" Walmart states.  Facebook's offering is expected to create a system whereby its social media platforms could use Libra for payments, allowing advertisers to earn Libra and pay Facebook in the token for ads. Although it could also be used more widely in time in remittances and other use cases.  Walmart's filing, too, indicates its coin could have features that apply to a token being used within the ecosystem of a high-street retail company:  ""The digital currency may be pegged to the US dollar and available for use only at selected retailors or partners. In other embodiments, the digital currency is available for use anywhere. The digital currency can provide a fee-free, or fee-minimal place to store wealth that can be spent, for example, at retailers and, if needed, easily converted to cash.""  A notable difference is that users of a ""Walmart Coin"" could ""even earn interest,"" the application suggests. With Libra, interest earned on the scheme's potentially vast reserve funds would go to Libra partners that back the company to the tune of around $10 million.  More closely applying to a commerce giant, though, Walmart says its token could store user's purchasing histories on the blockchain, and then apply related savings to their subsequent purchases in a similar way to loyalty points.  Other novel features suggested in the very broad filing include the ability to remove the need for credit cards, and acting as a ""pre-approved biometric (e.g., fingerprint or eye pattern) credit.""  ""A person is the 'credit card' to their own digital value bank,"" the firm says.  The token could also be used to restrict what product categories can be bought and by whom, for example blocking minors from purchasing cigarettes, alcohol, or an R-rated DVD.  Walmart is already using blockchain for tracking products like fresh greens and pharmaceuticals. It's also has been investigating various use cases of the technology, with projects including connecting automated delivery drones. In June, Walmart China launched a live scheme aimed to improve the nation's poor food safety record.  It also has a host of other patents applied for, including some relating to tracking packages, power supply payments and delivery fleets.

Blockade Games  announced on July 31 that it has successfully bridged the two networks by sending a bitcoin lightning transaction in such a way that it can cause an ethereum smart contract to run.  The company has run its code on the Rinkeby testnet and plans to deploy it on mainnet (using real ether) in the next couple of weeks, Blockade Games CTO Ben Heidorn told CoinDesk.  All of these tests feed into plans to add lightning network support to Neon District, its upcoming role-playing game built on top of ethereum.  Heidorn explained in a new blog post released Wednesday that it moved forward with the test is because it believes both bitcoin and ethereum will play an important role in the future. (The company believes ethereum, in particular, is the future of ""non-fungible assets,"" or digital assets that are provably unique from all the others).  The blog post goes on:  ""We also believe that bitcoin is the future of money, and many of our players will prefer to hold most, if not all, of their funds in bitcoin. We want to make it possible to serve our biggest supporters and players on the bitcoin network while utilizing all of the infrastructure present on ethereum and other blockchain networks.""  As such, they want users to be able to send lightning bitcoin payments to trigger ethereum events.  ""By integrating bitcoin lightning network payments, we are able to accept instant payments in bitcoin directly, and instantaneously kick off a series of events on any other chain, such as minting a brand new Neon District asset to a buyer’s ethereum or Loom Network wallet,"" the blog continues.  The code for this unique type of lightning transaction is not yet public, but ""we will open it once we're sure it's ready and secure for people to pull down and use,"" Heidorn told CoinDesk.  Regarding the frequent tension between bitcoin and ethereum enthusiasts, Heidorn argued that the two cryptocurrencies are ""two sides of the same coin,"" adding:  ""When it comes down to individuals maintaining sovereignty, privacy and autonomy, especially as crypto grows in popularity and faces greater social and political attacks, the infighting will be a thing of the past.""

42430811,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxxDh,1564707640,Coinbase CEO Armstrong Says Crypto Is Path to Financial Inclusion,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=HQaegigv6jU  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wants to build an open financial system.  As part of the company’s roadmap outlined during an open house, Armstrong said his firm would continue to take a leading role in the development and dissemination of blockchain technology to get “100 million or more people to start [using] cryptocurrency.”  Referring to a line chart showing slow improvements in global economic freedom since 1995, Armstrong said:  “We can actually change the line, actually bend this curve and materially change the economic freedom of the entire world by what we're going to build. … The vision for Coinbase is creating more economic freedom for every person and business in the world over the next ten years.”  To this end, Coinbase will continue to invest in industry startups through its incubator program, Coinbase Ventures. It will also roll out a suite of products aimed at lowering barriers to entry and expanding the ways people can earn cryptocurrencies.  “Coinbase can’t do it alone, there needs to be thousands of companies out there,"" he said.  While his firm has already invested in 50 or 60 startups, Armstrong pointed out there are new investment strategies like security tokens and initial exchange offerings that will propel the industry forward.  While the upstarts of today will enjoy the benefits of being crypto-native, Armstong also pointed out that Coinbase grew to be “the largest custodian out there … by really focusing on compliance” and forging relationships with traditional financial institutions.  He believes it’s this emphasis on financial and cybersecurity that enabled “people to really trust us.” Ultimately, Armstrong wants to leverage his brand’s image of convenience and safety “to have a billion people, in say five to ten years, accessing an open financial system through our products every day.”  Armstrong is not the only Bay Area-technologist looking to reshape the global financial system. Though, in his 16-minute speech, there was no reference to Facebook’s Libra project.  Update (Aug. 2, 19:01 UTC): Corrected a transcription error in the first pullquote.
