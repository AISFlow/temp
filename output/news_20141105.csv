42377744,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73UbF,1415230293,6 Top Responses from Bitcoin Foundation Head Patrick Murck's Reddit AMA,"Newly elected executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation Patrick Murck participated in an ask-me-anything (AMA) session on Reddit today, engaging the bitcoin community in a wide-ranging discussion to mark his new appointment.  Murck assumed his new position last week following the resignation of Jon Matonis, who will serve on the foundation's board through the year. Under its new direction, Murck indicated that the organisation will continue to defend bitcoin to policymakers and policy-focused groups while maintaining an open channel of discussion with the bitcoin community – goals he echoed throughout the AMA.  In his initial post, Murck introduced himself as a lawyer with 10 years of experience in policy and technology, before continuing to more advanced subject matter. Although some questions were unanswered at press time, his most memorable responses reflected his personal interest in payments innovation and professional interest in keeping open dialogue with banks and regulators.  Here are some of the top questions and answers from the AMA session. You can find the AMA session in full here.  1: Washington and Wall Street  Q: (AKWAnalytics) – Do you plan on engaging the new Republican-controlled US Congress with regards to bitcoin, and more broadly cryptography? Any shift in strategy given the changes?  Additionally, any course of action with regard to Wall Street, or is regulation a prerequisite (hence my first question)?    A: I've found that bitcoin plays well with both political parties in US. Sometimes for different reasons. For us, the strategy is to be a resource on the technical rules that govern bitcoin and the social contract that allows the bitcoin network to regulate itself. We can be that resource for politicians or other groups and associations doing work on the ground.      For a lot of the traditional financial companies (banks and other investors on Wall Street), regulation is seen as validation. Whether you agree with that or not, some level of appropriate regulation will bring in new participants to the bitcoin ecosystem and seems inevitable.    Keeping that regulation sane and focused on actual risks is important.    2: The New York BitLicense  Q: (BTC123RN) – Hi Patrick, thank you for doing this so early in the morning. What do you think the impact of NYDFS regulation will have on other states? Any chance the foundation is working with states to build something less onerous?    A: We have had plenty of discussions with state regulators and they are watching how things unfold in New York. That doesn't mean they are interested in following New York's approach per se, but the ""BitLicense"" proposal has garnered a lot of attention both here and abroad.      What state regulators seem most concerned with is consumer protection and what happens if the citizens they are charged to protect lose their life savings in a bitcoin exchange meltdown. I think they would love to hear constructive thoughts on how they can do their job without getting in the way.    But, if you do reach out to your state regulator keep this in mind. As you pitch this cool new technology (or your business), you will tend to highlight all the ways that technology is different from everything out there in the market. When a regulator hears that something is ""different"" they think about how much work it's going to take them and their staff to understand how to deal with it. It's usually better to tell your friendly regulator all the ways that this new technology (or your business) is the same as something they already know how to deal with. That puts things in a useful context for them and let's you focus on the consumer benefits.    3: Payments  Q: (vemrion) – What's your take on CurrentC? Does the Foundation have any plans to assemble a coalition of retailers to embrace an open standard like bitcoin?    A: Sounds like a good idea. Not sure the Foundation would best suited to take it on though. Maybe it's something that BitPay, BitNet, GoCoin, Coinbase, etc. would be able to rally around.      Certainly we'd love to support that type of initiative.    4: Crypto 2.0  Q: (FrancisPouliot) – Do you consider the rise of cryptocurrency 2.0 platforms as positive, neutral or negative for bitcoin?  A: Very positive. The first killer app for the blockchain is money and payments. More apps will bring more people to the network and benefit everyone in the community. This is particularly true with the advent of sidechains.  5: Tipping point  Q: (alphamystic007) – What do you worry about most?  A: The community pulling itself apart before bitcoin reaches a tipping point in adoption.  6: A technology platform  Q: (barkerw) – You mention the idea of bitcoin reaching a tipping point of adoption. What do you think that point is and how can the average user help it happen?    A: I think the best way to view bitcoin is as a technology platform. Platforms aren't really that interesting from a business or consumer standpoint when you only have around 5 million users (most not daily or even monthly actives), where bitcoin is at today. Email, wireless communications, social networking all get much more useful and interesting once there are 50 million or 500 million active users.      Getting the next 50 million people actively using the bitcoin network seems pretty critical over the next couple of years.        Note: Reddit comments have been edited for clarity.

42377757,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73UqL,1415227509,Buttercoin Bids to Take US Business From Global Bitcoin Exchanges,"Buttercoin officially launched today, bringing what it calls a ""reliable, domestic bitcoin marketplace"" to the US, one it believes provides the first advanced foundational service to the ecosystem's largest, and perhaps most complex market.  Boasting Centralway Ventures, Google Ventures, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Rothenberg Ventures and Y Combinator among its investors, Buttercoin claims to allow US bitcoin businesses to sell bitcoins and receive payout in just one business day.  At launch, Buttercoin also lists impressive names from the US bitcoin ecosystem as clients, including bitcoin merchant processor BitPay and decentralized industrial mining company MegaBigPower.  Founder and CEO Cedric Dahl framed Buttercoin as a competitor to major international bitcoin exchanges, which he argues are ill-equipped to satisfy the needs of a business clientele that includes merchant processors and mining facilities, companies that may need to sell 200,000–500,000 BTC at a time to ensure their finances.  Dahl told CoinDesk:  ""We're the only option that wallets and other bitcoin businesses have to quickly get out between USD and bitcoin here in the US. We don't compete with wallets or merchant processors, we offer a safe domestic alternative to exchanges. We operate in the daylight here in the US, and we have some fantastic backers.""  Throughout the interview, Dahl stressed that Buttercoin is not an exchange, but rather an eBay-like service that connects buyers and sellers and that does not hold customer funds.  Buttercoin declined to provide details about its banking partnerships, or how it is able to offer a faster settlement for its customers, citing competitive interests.  Speculation to inspiration  According to Dahl, the history of Buttercoin began shortly after the original bitcoin white paper was released by Satoshi Nakamoto. At the time, Dahl said Buttercoin co-founder and CTO Bennett Hoffman became intrigued by bitcoin as he wasn't able to break its security features.  Encouraged by bitcoin's potential, Dahl and Hoffman began investing in the currency, buying bitcoin for $10 and celebrating its rise to $270 thereafter.  Dahl indicated that the genesis of Buttercoin was the night the price of bitcoin crashed back down to $55, a development that lead him to investigate issues in the bitcoin ecosystem further.  ""We reverse engineered what had happened and we found that Mt Gox was really having a lot of issues because it had more demand for orders than it could actually solve in real time,"" Dahl said. ""There was this trade execution lag that was causing there to be a discrepancy between the prices people thought they were getting and what they were actually paying.""  With this in mind, Dahl and a team of participants set out to create an open-source trade execution engine that could be marketed to exchanges like Mt Gox. The first version, he said, garnered attention and then investment, but he framed today's launch as a vindication of the hard work of his team. Buttercoin, he said, is a name that emerged from the company's informal beginnings and that has stuck with the project.  ""It takes a long time to build a reliable bitcoin marketplace. You know, there's security, technology, liquidity, compliance issues, these are all big complex issues that require real sophisticated solutions,"" he said.  Open to anyone  Dahl suggested that while the Buttercoin marketplace is open to both consumers and merchants, its primary target is the US bitcoin business sector, which he contends is underserved by overseas exchanges.  Indeed, Buttercoin offers a simple and intuitive interface for customers, with clearly marked features that emphasize usability. Both business and consumer clients also interact with the same version of the marketplace.  Calling Bitstamp the ""only alternative"", he said that the service can't compete with Buttercoin as its geography prohibits it from one-day settlement. Further, he argued that time will show how Buttercoin can compete against the European exchange giant in terms of liquidity.  ""We have a hedge fund that makes our markets, so the marketplace is fully liquid,"" Dahl said. ""For people who want to buy less than 20 BTC at a time, we generally have the best price worldwide, and we're competitive with Bitstamp up to approximately 50 BTC at a time, depending on several factors.""  MegaBigPower CEO Dave Carlson said that he chooses to use the Buttercoin marketplace because of its ability to handle large-volume bitcoin trades, adding: ""With Buttercoin, I can get payouts in one day, overseas exchanges can take two-plus weeks.""  Onboarding clients  Dahl said that while Buttercoin had been selective about its early clients, it now intends to work with any consumer or business that meets its anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) and know-your-business (KYB) standards.  He said that Buttercoin asks businesses using its platform to validate they are who they claim to be, adding that certain types of businesses such as money services businesses (MSBs) may need to meet additional steps.  Dahl said that Buttercoin doesn't intend to advertise its businesses to consumers, but he expressed his personal hope that the next generation of innovators will take advantage of resources his company will now make available.  ""For people who are thinking about starting a businesses or seeing what's possible, we have an excellent set of APIs,"" he said. ""We want Buttercoin to be open to them, and for them to be able to build on top of Buttercoin.""

42377760,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Usr,1415218365,Coinverse Bucks Brazil's Speculative Trading Trend With Consumer Bitcoin Solution,"Coinverse has launched a new bitcoin banking platform that aims to bring consumer and merchant bitcoin transactions and bitcoin bill payment to the broader Latin American market.  The Brazil-based startup sees an unmet demand for user-friendly bitcoin solutions, asserting that its domestic competitors are better catered to experienced bitcoin users and speculative traders.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Coinverse financial director Safiri Felix estimated that more than 90% of Brazilians that buy bitcoin view the technology as an investment. As such, he argues there are few existing services that seek to utilize bitcoin’s underlying technology as a way to transfer value.  “We wanted to create something that let would us reach the regular user – not just the speculative users and traders,” he said, adding:  “We’re trying to make bitcoin accessible to mainstream people.”  Settling boletos in bitcoin  The Coinverse platform gives users in the Brazilian market buy and sell utility, but also provides them the opportunity to pay off their boletos bancários using bitcoin.  A boleto bancário is a government-issued financial document comparable to an invoice. Consumers may select this payment option when making online purchases. The boleto specifies an amount of money owed to the merchant, to be paid within a certain period of time.  Boletos can be paid through online banking, or in person at any bank, banking agency, supermarket, post office or other merchant client registered to accept boleto payments.  Now, customers can also submit their boletos to Coinverse and pay them in bitcoin. In turn, Coinverse will pay the issuing merchant the owed amount in fiat currency.  Solving merchant adoption  Felix also views merchants as essential to wider bitcoin adoption in Brazil, and aims to offer a processing solution to these customers.  “Here in Brazil, we have the need to encourage merchant adoption,"" he said. ""That’s the reason we decided to implement the solution with boleto. Because with this solution, the Brazilian consumer can buy almost anything over Internet commerce and pay using bitcoins, if not directly.”  Until the recent entrance into this market by competitor BitInvest and now Coinverse, however, he said that there had yet to be a compelling service that could encourage these businesses to get involved with bitcoin.  He added that he believes Latin American merchants are curious about adopting bitcoin, but surmised that many are waiting for bigger companies to move first on the initiative.  A consumer-friendly approach  Felix pointed to spending statistics that suggest Brazilians do much of their shopping abroad as evidence that bitcoin could become a compelling solution for domestic commerce.  Further, he believes that when bitcoin is more broadly accepted as a currency worldwide, users will begin to buy it before traveling or purchasing goods and services abroad, creating demand in Brazil.  Before the launch of its universal service, Coinverse operated a bitcoin ATM manufactured by Genesis Coin. However, the company has no immediate plans to launch a wider network of these machines.  Rather, Coinverse sought to use its ATM a means of meeting and becoming acquainted with bitcoin community members, with whom they could discuss how to best position a bitcoin solution for the general consumer market.  Felix said:  “Our focus is to expand the market and to make digital currencies more friendly.”  Additional reporting contributed by Pete Rizzo.

42377752,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Uin,1415212217,Micropayments Tool Dogetipbot Wins $445k From Investors,"The team behind dogetipbot, the popular tipping tool for the alternative digital currency dogecoin, has raised nearly $500,000 in a seed funding round.  The fundraising was led by Blackbird Ventures, a venture capital group based in Sydney, Australia. Additional investors, including angel investors Scott and Cyan Banister, also took part in the round. In total, $445,000 in new capital was raised for the project.  Dogetipbot  enables microtipping, allowing users of its service to pledge dogecoin tips that can then be redeemed for the currency. Users can tap dogetipbot when pledging money on Reddit, Twitter and Twitch. To date, the service says it has processed more than 650,000 transactions.  CoinDesk spoke with Blackbird Ventures managing director Niki Scevak, who said that he and his team are interested in how digital currencies can be leveraged to make microtransactions economically viable.  Scevak explained:  “What's most fascinating to me about cryptocurrencies is enabling new transactions that never happened before. The credit card fee structure means that it's not economical to accept payments of less than $1. So, we asked the question of what transactions can now happen for a few cents that can use bitcoin or dogecoin, and that's how we got to know [creator] Josh Mohland and the team.”  Funding to fuel user upgrades  Mohland said the funding will be used to support the team over the next 12 months as it continues to develop the service. Specifically, Mohland expects that the money will be used to improve the service's user experience in order to attract a wider audience.  “One of the things we’re really looking at is the user experience,"" Mohland said. ""A lot of our traction initially was on Reddit, but we’re seeing a lot of demand on Twitter. So, what we’re working is our user experience, making it seamless.”  With a median tip of around 3 cents, dogetipbot is as much about the social experience of tipping as it is a rail for small payments.  According to Scevak, the fact that the system can be used to both express public appreciation for content and exchange value makes it a powerful combination. He noted that the grassroots development of the dogecoin community is a big part of that success as well.  Correction: A previous version of this article indicated the project had raised $446,000 in funding.

42377758,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Urb,1415208155,BitPay Aims to Speed Up Bitcoin Checkout with 'One-Tap' App,"BitPay has released a new merchant app that aims to cut queues at the till with 'one-tap' bitcoin payments.      Bitcoin Checkout, which debuted at the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas this week, makes BitPay the first bitcoin merchant processor to offer one-touch payments at the point of sale.      In what the company describes as a “seamless” experience, customers can hold their tablet or smartphone over the merchant’s point-of-sale device and – using NFC (near-field communication) technology – submit their digital cash by tapping ‘send’.      Mobile apps by Mycelium, Bitcoin Wallet and Hive are all compatible with the contactless functionality, following testing by BitPay’s team.      However, in conversation with Gigaom, executive chairman Tony Gallippi said that many bitcoin wallet developers have not yet enabled NFC, so the company expects this list to grow.    QR Codes still standard    While NFC-ready devices are available from a number of leading consumer brands, including Samsung, BlackBerry, Nokia, HTC and now Apple, BitPay's lead UX engineer Jason Dreyzehner told CoinDesk that the technology's position as the bitcoin standard is still far off.      He added:      ""For now, the majority of our merchants' customers will likely continue to use QR codes — the reigning standard in bitcoin transactions.""              For this reason, Bitcoin Checkout caters to customers using QR code payments as much as those choosing to go contactless. Even so, depending on the customer's wallet preference, Dreyzehner says this process can even be streamlined further – to one tap of a finger, just like NFC.    Apple Pay vs bitcoin    Among those opting for QR code payments will be users of Apple's new NFC-enabled products, as the company has currently locked down the technology to in-house developers working on its mobile payment solution, Apple Pay.      The tech giant's disruptive offering has already proved itself to be more successful than all other smartphone payment services combined, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. However, Gallippi remains confident bitcoin can compete, and innovate, in the payments arena:      “For retailers, accepting mobile payments is a growing trend, but none of today’s industry offerings can provide a lower risk or lower cost than swiping a credit card.”              On the development side, Dreyzehner is equally bullish that bitcoin can outpace what he describes as Apple's ""one-size-fits-all"" approach.      ""Where Apple Pay has a single team of developers working on ... NFC payments, bitcoin has dozens of teams working on a variety of use cases,"" he said, adding:      ""This is the world’s first truly open, NFC-enabled payment system. We can expect this fast-moving ecosystem to continue to out-innovate Apple’s closed system.""            Scaling up    The app is a step up from BitPay's previous merchant support system, which catered to small businesses as a functional, no-frills product. Now, multiple employees can use the app at a time and users can send them tips too.      The app can be used as a standalone product or alongside existing systems – including BitPay's own retail point-of-sale partners: Soft Touch, Visual Touch and DC POS. Using their existing BitPay account, merchants can pair as many point-of-sale devices to the system as they need.      Introducing this new functionality is likely a move to attract bigger, fast-moving businesses with a large roster of part- and full-time staff, namely shops, bars and restaurants – a growing number of which already accept the digital currency.      BitPay's 'freemium' model means that merchants can also use the more advanced features of BitPay’s online service, including integration with accounting software QuickBooks.      The company says it is rolling out the app to every mobile market worldwide in 40 languages, with the option to price orders in more than 150 different currencies.    Near-field, far reach    Although BitPay's is by far the biggest, it isn't the first NFC-enabled bitcoin project. A growing number of developers are looking to NFC to simplify and secure payments made on-the-go.      Earlier this year, the University of Zurich trialled CoinBlesk, a contactless bitcoin payment solution devised by its students, as part of a two-week trial.      Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Diamond Circle also installed its first contactless kiosk at a cafe in Queensland, Australia, back in September. Like BitPay, the company is also planning a new NFC point-of-sale system that will allow users to pay with bitcoin from a wide range of devices.

42377759,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Uu7,1415203957,Exchange Roundup: Traders Gain Tools and Bank Woes for Justcoin,"With bitcoin adoption rising healthily, and trading proving a popular way to profit from the digital currency's volatility, many exchanges are going from strength to strength, signing up new users and rolling out new services on a frequent basis.  In this roundup, CoinDesk looks at the latest announcements from the world's cryptocurrency exchange platforms over the last few days.  OKCoin adds 'trigger orders' for futures traders  OKCoin's futures traders can now get some sleep without needing to close their positions, safe in the knowledge that new 'trigger orders' will help insulate them from risk. The addition is likely to come as a welcome relief for OKCoin's professional traders, who have up to 10x leverage at their disposal.  These orders work both ways: stop-losses to prevent a position falling too far, and limit buy orders to enter into contracts at an optimal price point. Users can also set the quantity of units to trade.  OKCoin added the trigger order feature after popular demand from its customers for stop-losses, adding them just days after seeing user requests posted on social media outlets.  There are some limits to using trigger orders, however. For buy orders, the preset 'order price' cannot be more than 105% of the trigger price, while, for sell orders, the order price cannot be lower than 95% of the trigger price.  Therefore, users still need to be wary of heavy volatility: if the market moves against a trader too quickly, OKCoin says it cannot guarantee the order can be completely filled at the specified price.  Quantities set should be within a trader's 'available to close' limits, which are reduced once a trigger order is placed. If a trader closes the positions at market price, the trigger orders will be canceled.  Corporate accounts and market makers  OKCoin says that, since launching its futures trading platform in August, 24-hour volumes have reached 757,000 BTC ($257.2m at press time).  It also recently added support for corporate accounts, offering its corporate clients dedicated account managers, round-the-clock personal support, and a customized setup process to suit their needs. Corporate accounts may trade on either the CNY or USD exchanges.  The exchange has also launched a 'Maker World Champion' promotion for its new 'maker-taker' fee model. For market makers (those who add orders to the order book, thus increasing liquidity) on spot and futures trades, OKCoin will double whatever income they earn from those trades until 23rd November.  A special competition in the same period will also reward the top daily market maker with 0.1 BTC, the week's winner with 1 BTC and the winner for the entire period with 10 BTC. An individual trader may only win each category once, and rankings are listed on the site.  BTC.sx partners with Bitfinex for increased liquidity  Trading platform BTC.sx says its new partnership with Bitfinex will offer liquidity improvements for both exchanges, as BTC.sx traders become able to enter leveraged BTC-USD positions on Bitfinex's higher-volume order book.  BTC.sx now allows trades to be placed on three exchanges within its platform. With the liquidity this offers, traders could enter long or short positions without having to wait, especially with the addition of Bitfinex's 851763.66 BTC monthly trading volume (roughly $283m at press time).  Customers at London-based BTC.sx have traded about $50m-worth of bitcoin in the past 12 months, according to the company's own information.  BTC.sx co-founder and CEO Joseph Lee said:  ""Our professional bitcoin traders are continually demanding better access to high-volume markets and our team has been able to deliver upon their requests.""  Lee also cited Bitfinex's commitment to regulatory compliance in making the partnership a ""logical choice"". The Hong Kong-based exchange also claims to have the world's highest volumes for USD-BTC trading.  Full trading capability with data charts are available as of now, while deeper integration between the two exchanges is planned for the future.  BTC China introduces margin trading  BTC China  this week introduced margin trading features to its exchange, giving both Chinese and international users the chance to leverage their account balances in the hope of greater returns.  It allows margin traders to borrow up to two times the net value of all assets in their accounts, combining any CNY, BTC and LTC holdings.  To mitigate the risks associated with margin trading and lending, BTC China has developed a risk management system that includes real-time monitoring and alerts, allowing traders to seek ""adequate remedies"" to alleviate at-risk situations.  Director of software engineering Mikael Wang said:  ""BTC China’s risk management apparatus minimizes risk by actively managing the loans to borrowers and automatically issuing margin calls when necessary to ensure that the borrower maintains a sufficient balance.""  Bitstamp launches new 'TradeView' interface  Major EU-based exchange Bitstamp has unveiled a new live, graphical trading interface called 'TradeView', with promises of future enhancements.  TradeView's vivid user interface features live and detailed market information with the ability to trade directly from the charts. Users can set their desired price by dragging and dropping a slider bar on the graph (see below). Hotkeys enable traders to zoom in on a particular piece of information, or execute trades from the keyboard.  Bitstamp also offers conditional orders ('if orders') which mean traders can set two conditions that must be true in order to execute an order. They could, therefore, execute simultaneous buy and sell orders for identical amounts, keeping any profit earned. This is useful if the price is moving in a favorable direction.  Justcoin suspends operations  While other exchanges continue to grow and expand their services, the news was less favorable for some. Norway-based exchange and Ripple/Stellar gateway Justcoin abruptly announced it was closing down on 28th October with a one-line message posted to its blog and an email issued to customers.  The email suggested Justcoin's banking partner had unilaterally terminated its relationship with the company and the exchange had been unable to find another banking partner in Norway.  The email, signed by co-founders Klaus Bugge Lund and Andreas Brekken, read:  ""This event demonstrates the need for decentralized payment networks.""  The company posted in April that it had reached a milestone of 20,000 customers, 16,000 of whom were located in countries other than Norway.  A Justcoin user on Bitcoin Talk claimed to have received an email from the company on 11th October announcing a partial 'hold' on all stellar (STR) deposits and withdrawals, reportedly due to the 'partial payments' vulnerability affecting the Ripple and Stellar networks. It is not known whether this was related in any way to Justcoin's closure.  Representatives from Clevercoin, a Netherlands-based bitcoin exchange that had sought to provide assistance Justcoin in the wake of its banking issues, suggested to CoinDesk that the exchange is in the process of refunding users, and that it may explore options for reopening.

42377753,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73UmZ,1415197726,Google Search Study Hints at 'Shady Truth' of Bitcoin Users,"Researchers at the University of Kentucky have published a new paper examining the characteristics of US bitcoin users based on an analysis of Google search data.  The paper, titled ""Characteristics of Bitcoin Users: An Analysis of Google Search Data”, resulted in some rather controversial conclusions about the types of people that appear to be using the digital currency. However, even the researchers admit little is known about the average bitcoin user due to the lack of systematic data collection and blockchain pseudo-anonymity.  Dr Aaron Yelowitz and Matthew Wilson, who carried out the study, also emphasised that search query interest does not necessarily imply active participation.  “Our research finds that two Google search terms – related to computer programming enthusiasts and possible illegal activity (“Silk Road”) – are statistically related to search interest in bitcoin. With any search query, it is not possible to conclusively figure out the underlying motivations of the audience, or the exact composition of the audience,"" Yelowitz told CoinDesk.  Who uses bitcoin?  The researchers collected Google Trends search query data from January 2011 to July 2013 for all US states, looking for terms related to bitcoin and its possible clientele.  Based on this data, the researchers constructed four possible categories of users for bitcoin: programming enthusiasts, speculative investors, libertarians and cybercriminals.  Illegal activity and computer programming were positively associated with bitcoin use, but there was no association for libertarian ideology or investment motives.  Previous research was also referenced, leading to the conclusion that the three main motives driving bitcoiners were curiosity, profit and political ideology. Yelowitz and Wilson warn that some of the correlations were “inherently difficult” to measure due to the sensitivity of bitcoin activity.  Yelowitz explained:  ""We do, however, end our analysis in July 2013, before Silk Road was shut down and exploded in interest among general public. Nonetheless, a variety of users – such as law enforcement, journalists, and even academics like me – also type in such terms as Silk Road or bitcoin with no intent of illegal activity. Given the paucity of data on bitcoin, I view our study as a first step – but certainly not last step – into understanding this market.”  Geographic variation and price interest  In terms of regional distribution, the data showed that most bitcoin users were grouped in the states of California, Utah, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, New Hampshire and Vermont.  The data also pointed to correlations between various searches, so users with an interest in computer science or for example Silk Road were associated with interest in bitcoin. The team also included a ‘placebo clientele’ in the form of users searching for the singer Miley Cyrus, with no effect on the results.  Researchers also observed the effect of price swings on search volumes:  “Profit-motivated clientele – such as speculative investors – may find bitcoin more intriguing when prices are high. However, we again observe a positive association between bitcoin interest and our two clientele groups of computer programming enthusiasts and those possibly engaged in illegal activity.”  Earlier this year, researchers at ETH Zurich published a study into the effect of search traffic on the price of bitcoin. The paper focused on feedback cycles between search traffic, public interest and the bitcoin price.  Contrary to the Kentucky team's work, they found that, rather than being a mysterious cryptocurrency for geeks or criminals, bitcoin has transformed into a much wider phenomenon.  Libertarians and gainfully employed geeks  Yelowitz and Wilson found some evidence libertarian activity also drives interest in bitcoin, but the association appears to be limited.  Higher unemployment rates are negatively associated with interest in bitcoin. Researchers concluded that “fluctuations in computer science and illegal activity” continue to drive bitcoin interest, along with the traditional business cycle.  Contrary to many misconceptions, political and investment motives were found to be less significant than expected:  “We find robust evidence that computer programming enthusiasts and illegal activity drive interest in bitcoin, and find limited or no support for political and investment motives.”  Research paper image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/05/google-search-study-hints-at-shady-truth-of-bitcoin-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd2b13c4da66c33855d9248c575c9e0666d2ad9b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377756,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Up5,1415194120,Bitcoin ATM Goes Live at Google's London Co-Working Space,"Following the launch of its new bitcoin ATM, visitors to Google's 'Campus London' co-working space will now be able to buy bitcoin and spend the cryptocurrency on a coffee or muffin.  Conveniently, the UK's first BitAccess-made machine is located in the centre's basement cafe, which uses an app developed at Campus called Wyre to accept bitcoin payments for refreshments.  Operated by a company called Bitbuddy, the ATM performs two-way transactions between fiat and bitcoin, taking its prices from the Bitstamp exchange. Users are charged a 5% fee for the service.  While the machine does not collect identity information currently, it is equipped to do so should future regulation demand 'know your customer' data.  Bitbuddy  is run and self-funded by Myles Cirjanic-Edwards, a recent economics graduate and early investor in bitcoin, who said he is planning to install a second BitAccess machine in London in the coming months.  Cirjanic-Edwards added he is also planning a mobile app to cut down or eliminate the time users must take to input their wallet information at the ATM.  Easing the purchase process  The Wyre app, used by the Campus cafe to accept bitcoin payments, is aimed at merchants and their customers.  When a user buys, say, a cup of coffee with bitcoin, the transaction receipt appears on the Wyre app for both the merchant and the customer.  To set up, merchants must to set up a wallet and download Wyre for their store. They are then listed on a map included in the app, that allows potential customers to see which establishments in an area take bitcoin.  Wyre is pitched as the ""Foursquare for bitcoin"" by its co-founder Edward Moyse, who said:  ""We want to make [paying with bitcoin] as easy as checking in to a place.""  Novelly, perhaps, Moyse and partner Harry Huang plan to build 'gamification' elements into the payment process. This would allow customers to earn points or badges for completing certain actions, such as buying coffee from five cafes in a given area – much like Foursquare offered before its recent revamp.  Wyre is less than three months old and currently has only one merchant signed up: the Campus cafe. However, Moyse said more merchants will be added soon.  Bitcoin centre  Google Campus is open to registered users, who can pay to rent dedicated space in the seven-storey building located in Shoreditch, the part of East London known as 'Silicon Roundabout'.  Google Campus had more than 22,000 registered users last year and more than 100,000 visitors, who attend the regular events held there, according to its 2013 annual report.  While bitcoin ATMs are fairly rare across the rest of the UK, Shoreditch can now boast four machines run by various operators, including SatoshiPoint and Cointrader.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/05/bitcoin-atm-goes-live-at-googles-london-co-working-space,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8a56a019df1e44039146c44778e5a8ffce7f6d8-1920x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
