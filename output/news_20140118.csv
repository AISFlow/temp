42376826,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecih,1390062496,Israeli Regulators Take “Wait and See” Approach on Digital Currencies,"Over the past two months numerous regulators have issued warnings against the use of digital currencies, and some have even taken concrete steps to halt trading, most notably China and India.  Israel, however, appears to be taking a different approach.  Israeli regulators are not ignoring digital currencies, they are simply waiting to see what the rest of the world does about them.  Certain Israeli financial institutions are engaged in bitcoin transactions, and they would like to see clear guidance from regulators. However, the Bank of Israel, the Israel Securities Authority and government ministries have not said a word on the matter. Yet, this may be about to change.  Lack of applicable legislation  According to Haaretz, regulators do not feel the need to prohibit transactions related to digital currencies at this time. Attorney Shiri Shaham, who specializes in banking law, told reporters that there is no legislation in Israel today that could address bitcoin and similar digital currencies.  Therefore, the use of digital currencies remains legal, or 'unregulated' to be more precise. Shaham said:  “Bitcoin brings with it a lot of innovation that has not existed until now. Consequently, it’s no wonder that it was not in the wherewithal of lawmakers in Israel and around the world to foresee this development and address it.”  Lawyer Guy Lachmann points out that currency is defined as the country’s legal tender and since bitcoin is not recognized as legal tender anywhere in the world, it should not be seen as a currency.  Taxation concern  Although Israel can apply existing money laundering legislation to questionable bitcoin transactions, there are still a number of issues that need to be addressed.  Taxation is perhaps the biggest problem. Traders must report their trading income to tax authorities, but there are some exceptions that might attract tax dodgers. In addition, value-added tax does not apply to the purchase of bitcoin.  Shaham believes the Bank of Israel should not ignore digital currencies, but she cautions that it should not adopt a conservative position either. She argues that there is nothing lawmakers can do to prevent trading in bitcoins, even if such trades are outlawed. She said:  “People who want to get their hands on bitcoin will always succeed, and it would be a pity if it were to occur in the shadows and not under the supervision of the banking system.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/18/israeli-regulators-take-wait-and-see-approach-on-digital-currencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2394d8d2f9c51dd903f4bd14d9cbe075e71d97a2-1000x583.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376837,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ecu1,1390055404,How Bitcoin Makes Transactions Cheaper,"There are many reasons to be excited about bitcoin: it could enable totally new business and technology models; it resembles the internet in the early ‘90s in the sense that it is a network that no-one owns and everyone can contribute to; it could revolutionise legal concepts of ownership; it could disrupt the payments industry; it could even become a tax haven. It could also flop.  In an earlier post, I described the thinking behind my first angel investment in the digital currency space: CoinDesk. In this post, I discuss what first got me excited about bitcoin — the solution to the so-called “double spending problem” — and why this could drastically reduce the cost of non-cash transactions.  The double spending problem: why it costs so much to transact electronically  The double spending problem is the risk that a person could pay for two different things with the same unit of currency. This problem really only arises if you want to make a purchase electronically (i.e. with something other than cash).  Say I make t-shirts and you want to buy one. In the offline world, we could transact with cash. You give me a $20 bill, and I give you a t-shirt. As I’m now in physical possession of the $20 bill, I can be certain that you won’t spend it on something else. My only risk is that you’re a professional counterfeiter, but that’s pretty unlikely… Now, say you want to buy one of the t-shirts from my online e-store. As it happens, my shop is overseas.  Wouldn’t it be cool if we could replicate the offline experienceby you simply sending me a digital version of a $20 bill? Until recently you couldn’t: you needed at least one financial institution involved and either you or I (or both of us) had to pay them a fee to facilitate things. A credit card payment is a good example. You would send me your card details and, in order to process it, I would involve the credit card provider, a merchant services company and my bank.  We needed the financial institutions because, unlike physical bills, digital information is super easy to copy. If you try to send me a unit of digital money directly, how can I know that it is real — or that you haven’t sent the same thing to someone else? To be certain, I’d need to access your bank account to check that your balance actually decreased. And there’s no way you’d give access to your bank account to someone selling you a t-shirt!  The role financial institutions play here is to serve as a trusted third party to identify you and me, to ensure that the money is spent only once, and to process the payment. In order to retain their trusted status, financial institutions also become involved if there is a dispute between us. This takes time and resources, for which financial institutions charge fees.  In the example of the t-shirt sale, I (the merchant) would incur a cost of 0.5-2.5% to process the credit card. You (the purchaser) would probably be charged a currency conversion fee by your credit card provider (who would no doubt make additional money by giving you a crappy exchange rate). These fees and charges add up. Some smart management consultants I used to work with estimated that transaction-specific fees amounted to nearly $140bn in 2012.  Bitcoin’s fundamental innovation is to obviate the need for a 3rd party to be involved in the transaction. It allows you to securely and anonymously transfer money to anyone, anywhere in the world. Going back to the t-shirt example: if you had paid me in bitcoin, I would have paid much much less than the c. 2.5% it cost me to process your credit card. And you would have paid no currency conversion fee whatsoever.  How does bitcoin deal with the double spending problem?  I can sense your skepticism. How does bitcoin cut out the financial middlemen? Bitcoin is a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash”. It allows you to securely send money directly to me. The bitcoin network is decentralised, which means there is no central financial body overseeing things. That sounds bad, right? Well, actually no — bitcoin’s inventor developed a clever mechanism to ensure that bitcoins couldn’t be copied and spent more than once.  Each bitcoin has a history attached to it — essentially a log of digital signatures showing the transactions it has been involved in. In bitcoin-speak, these logs are called ‘blocks’ and, when you put them all together, they form the ‘block chain’. The block chain contains a record of all the transactions ever made using bitcoin. [post-quote] But what if someone alters a block? Couldn’t they ‘erase’ a transaction and spend a coin twice? The nifty thing about bitcoin is that the blockchain is publicly available. Anyone on the internet can see it (don’t worry — the names of the parties to specific transactions remain hidden).  There is a huge amount of computer power that goes into recording transactions and verifying the blockchain. This is what all the computers mining bitcoins around the world are doing and its why bitcoin transactions take an average of 10 minutes to complete. (To incentivise miners to undertake this work, they can ‘earn’ bitcoins along the way — but mining is a story for another post ...)  If someone were to alter a block, all the other computers on the bitcoin network would notice it and ‘vote’ to reject that alteration. In short, in order to hack the system and spend a coin twice, you’d need more computer power than everyone else on the whole bitcoin network combined. And that’s virtually impossible nowadays.  So should I start buying things online with bitcoin?  You might not want to just yet. At the moment, not many merchants accept bitcoin and the huge price volatility outweighs the benefits of lower transaction costs. However, this is likely to change as the bitcoin ecosystem matures.  In the long term, the ability to securely transfer money on a peer-to-peer basis could be hugely disruptive. I’m not saying bitcoin will completely replace other methods of transacting money. It won’t. But $140 billion in transaction fees is a big pie, and bitcoin has the potential to take a large slice of it.  What’s more, there are many other pies out there. I’ll discuss some of them another time, but as an example just consider the potential impact on the $550bn remittance market… Originally posted on Medium.com.

42376846,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ed45,1390048233,Italian Amendment Would Treat Bitcoin Like Cash,"Italian Parliament member Sergio Boccadutri took to Twitter yesterday to reveal an amendment to a proposed law that would define bitcoin and initiate a process to recognise and regulate the cryptocurrency.      The amendment, an addendum to a larger budget proposal called Destination Italy, would seek to trace bitcoin transactions exceeding €1,000 by requiring the identification of the sender in such exchanges. The move would also bring bitcoin transactions in compliance with the nation's anti-money laundering laws, and calls for the Bank of Italy to propose a method of enacting the measure within six months, sources say.      Boccadutri says he is advocating for ""a proactive path on Bitcoin,"" adding that he believes the sector cannot be left without observation and regulation.    Who is Sergio Boccadutri?    The Palermo native is far from a central player in Italian politics, having served as the Treasurer of the Left Ecology Freedom party, and as a member of the Communist party. However, Boccadutri has been active on financial issues, including issues related to party financing.      Past blog posts on Boccadutri's official website address topics such as his 2008 commission of inquiry into the sale of Alitalia, as well as the ""historical revisionism"" threatening Italian monuments. Boccadutri has more recently blogged about Italy's reliance on cash, suggesting that fees on debit card and credit card use be reduced to 0.2% and 0.3% respectively.      ""The use of electronic money would be so very beneficial for traders and consumers,"" an English translation of a 9th December blog post reads.      Boccadutri continued to field questions from the community following the tweet, clarifying that his amendment does not intend to tax bitcoin transactions, and stating his belief that even the early misunderstandings of the law and its intent will help further positive discussions in Italy.    Early Feedback on the Proposal  Members of Italy's bitcoin community expressed skepticism for the proposal to CoinDesk, stressing that the amendment is part of a larger bill on wider economic matters that is still being debated. As of press time, the full text of the proposal is not yet available online.  Franco Cimatti, an Italian bitcoin entrepreneur and miner, suggested the community has so far adopted two opposing viewpoints, with some strongly opposed to the law and others thinking the exposure will be beneficial to the community, potentially leading to more constructive discussions, even if it is unclear how such a regulation would be enacted.  Italian bitcoin merchant and a co-founder of the Clipperz password manager Marco Barulli falls into the former category, as he was openly critical of Boccadutri and the proposal.  ""He claims to support digital money, but he fails to grasp that credit cards are not digital money,"" Barulli told CoinDesk.  Barulli further went on to label Cashless Way a lobbying group supported by major banks and credit cards, and said that the amendment as written was confused and misleading in respect to how it referred to digital currency. He suggested the amendment may not even end up being admitted for formal discussion.  Are Italians predisposed to bitcoin?    Italians have a demonstrated love of cash, in part because an estimated 7.5 million Italians have never had a bank account, prohibiting access to more complex financial instruments.      In accordance with this, it's perhaps not surprising that Italy ranks 12th in terms of official downloads of the bitcoin client and wallet, behind the Netherlands but ahead of Australia and Brazil.    However, additional research suggests there may be a technology gap that impedes further bitcoin adoption. Reports from the US Commercial Service indicate that Italy has lagged behind other European countries when it comes to mobile payment usage.  The 2012 report indicated that mobile payments were inhibited by a lack of consumer trust, a shortage of mobile-equipped points of sale and the lack of NFC-equipped devices in the country.

42376849,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ed5L,1390041031,Could Bitcoin Transform America's Political Fundraising?,"At a New Year's Eve event in the NYC Bitcoin Center, congressional candidate Steve Stockman went all out for bitcoin.  A Republican representative in the Texas 36th District, Stockman wore a QR code associated with a bitcoin address, encouraging BTC donations for his Senate campaign.  Stockman needs the money. According to USA Today, his campaign lacks the financial resource of his incumbent opponent, Senator John Cornyn, whom he will face in a district Republican primary battle.  USA Today also reported that Cornyn's campaign account contains $7m, while Stockman has $32,000. It’s no wonder that the candidate was comfortable wearing a QR code at this end-of-year soiree.  And Stockman will surely not be the last political figure to promote the ethos of bitcoin. The currency can be an intriguing notion for politicians.  On one hand, a virtual currency like bitcoin could threaten a political figure’s constituents, because of its unregulated nature. On the other hand, bitcoin could be a veritable moneymaker for campaign fundraising. Let’s take a deeper look.  The bitcoin committee  The Bitcoin Voters Political Action Committee is a recent example of how the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) is just one part of the regulatory puzzle for bitcoin. Although the political action committee (PAC) was an interesting idea, ultimately it did not last long. Its official website states:  “Due to the new compliance issues at the state level, we are unable to continue operations at this time. We would like to thank the FEC for their acceptance of bitcoin addresses instead of a bank account for deposits.”  In November, the FEC deadlocked on a resolution regarding how PACs could treat bitcoin donations. However, the Commission was able to offer some guidance that bitcoin should be treated as an instrument of value such as a stock or a bond.  Yet compliance issues are still murky at state level. This can be attributed to the fact that each state is responsible for a number of regulatory issues in terms of campaign finance laws.  This lack of regulatory clarity mirrors the problems that bitcoin still presents at state level. Bitcoin businesses that act as money transmitters can easily register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to obtain federal regulatory compliance.  But the fact remains that money transmission businesses still need to comply with the laws of 48 different states that each have their own enforcement rules.  It appears that the Bitcoin Voters PAC was quickly confronted with the same compliance problems that bitcoin-related businesses have been dealing with for some time.  Take, for example, the differing regulations for state limits on contributions to candidates provided by the National Conference of State Legislatures. That's just a starting point in how much work must be done to properly regulate the financial matters of something like the Bitcoin Voters PAC.  Could bitcoin influence politics?  Ever since the USA's housing bubble burst (causing a domino effect on the global economy) the political zeitgeist of America has changed dramatically.  This can be seen in the following Gallup Poll chart. After 2008 most US citizens have increasingly identified themselves as independent voters with no party affiliation.  This data can also be attributed to the fact that libertarianism is on the rise in the United States, especially among young Americans.  Generally of the ilk that a sizeable government is inherently bad, this political ideal could be one of the key motivations behind the creation of distributed systems of money, like bitcoin.  Libertarians are often skeptical of the Federal Reserve, the central authority that prints and controls money circulation in the United States.  The libertarian movement's largest icon, past presidential candidate Ron Paul, has long talked about putting an end to the Fed. It comes as no surprise, then, that there are plans to launch a Ron Paul cryptographic currency.  Decentralized currencies have been a favorite of libertarians ever since bitcoin hit the scene. Attend any bitcoin meetup and you’re likely to come across a libertarian who has believed in bitcoin’s decentralized properties from early on. In fact, many were early adopters before even those in the tech scene caught on.  Wrapping it up  Going forward, bitcoin could play a vital role in future election campaigns. For politicians, the currency may offer a key tool in campaign fundraising that can help them get elected.  Interestingly enough, the Congressional Research Service recently published a report for members of Congress stating that bitcoin could undermine the US dollar. But if constituents give politicians bitcoin for campaign donations, it may influence this kind of thinking.  Politicians may even adopt a libertarian to attract the expanding population of self-identified independent voters.  After all, if it brings in the donations, why not? There are a number of people who are clearly libertarian, independently minded and possibly possess a lot of bitcoin.  It’s a smart demographic for political figures to target in order to raise some game-changing funds.
