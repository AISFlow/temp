The account suggested that someone within the team might have used insider information to buy the token before the project announced a delay in its native token unlock schedule.

31498644,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631348,1721863820,"Ethereum Whales Take Over, ETH Stuck Below $3,500: What’s Going On?","Ethereum prices are stable at spot rates, moving horizontally even after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the list and trading of spot Ethereum ETFs on July 23. Ethereum is trending below the crucial resistances at $3,500 and $3,700 at press time. However, buyers have kept prices above $3,300 as price action moves horizontally. Though there are expectations of volatility, reading from options data, now that spot Ethereum ETFs are available for trading, one analyst picked out a critical development that might affect the BTC-ETH dynamic. Ethereum Whales Taking, ETH Outperforms BTC In a post on X, Santiment data reveals an uptick in whale activity ahead of the spot Ethereum ETF in the United States. The analytics platform said multiple high-value ETH transfers have outpaced those ordinarily seen on Bitcoin and USDT since July 17. Related Reading: Institutional Adoption Accelerates For Solana as Hamilton Lane Launches Blockchain-Native Fund The unusual increase in this kind of transfer could show growing confidence in Ethereum and ETH’s long-term prospects. This has even been accelerated with another crypto derivative product, providing an alternative to Bitcoin. Looking at the ETHBTC price chart, it is evident that ETH bulls have the upper hand. After the drop in late June, the coin continues outperforming Bitcoin, sharply rising on July 23. Evident in the daily chart, there is a double-bar bullish formation signaling the presence of ETH buyers keen on funneling capital and extending gains. ETH is finding support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the May 2024 trade range, confirming the uptrend. Even so, for May buyers to take charge, bulls must clear 0.057 BTC, setting the base for further gains toward 0.08 BTC recorded in 2022. Over $1 Billion Worth Of Spot ETF Shares Traded Inflows into spot ETFs will fuel the bull run. As seen in Bitcoin, price performance will largely depend on interest from institutional players. Barely 24 hours after the product launched in the United States, various issuers bought $1.1 billion of ETH. Inflows will likely rise when ETH prices break above the immediate resistance level, ideally last week’s high and $3,700. As prices stall for now, the launch of this product, a Bitwise analyst said, cements Ethereum’s role as a foundational technology in web3.

The newly-launched spot Ethereum ETFs follow the fee structure and custody choices of their respective spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitwise Ethereum ETF stands out with its commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem, transparency, and competitive fees, attracting potential growth. Launching the spot Ethereum ETFs does not eliminate Ethereum's inherent volatility. The ETFs, however, bolsters ETH's upside potential. It's no longer news that the spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs have gained the SEC’s approval and have started trading on various exchanges. Approval of a second crypto spot ETF after the first, just about six months apart, shows the slow but undeniable regulatory acceptance of crypto assets. Kucoin The funds are drawing from the spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF playbook in terms of fee structure and early fee waivers to woo investors. With this pattern we are witnessing, the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs will likely become the “template” for future crypto ETFs in terms of fee structure and custody choices. Just like the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the nine spot Ethereum ETFs have maintained their asset custody choices, fee structures, and initial fee waivers, save for Grayscale which created a spin-off of the converted Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ). The spin-off fund is called the Grayscale Mini Ethereum ( ETH ). The Grayscale Mini Trust currently has the lowest fee among the spot Ethereum ETFs at 15 bps. Both of Grayscale’s ETFs use Coinbase ( COIN ) as their asset custodian. Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF ( CETH ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), and Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF ( QETH ) all use Coinbase for asset custody. VanEck Ethereum ETF ( ETHV ) asset custodian is Gemini, while Fidelity Ethereum Fund ( FETH ) is sticking to a self-custody approach. Highlights from the First Spot Ethereum ETFs Trading Day One of the vital lessons from the spot Bitcoin ETFs is that the expense ratio is one of the determining factors in investors’ choice of spot ETFs. Grayscale retained its 2.5% fee in its converted spot BTC ETF fund and has seen the most outflows and narrowed AuM since its launch. Drawing lessons from the BTC ETF, Grayscale created the 10% mini fund spin-off with much lower fees to attract investors seeking affordable entry points. The spot Bitcoin ETFs have also shown the yearning for crypto exposure among institutional and traditional retail investors. On the first day of the Bitcoin ETF launch, trading volume was $4.46 billion and inflows were around $655 million. In just a little over a week after launch, the Bitcoin ETFs surpassed traditional silver ETFs market cap, becoming the second largest ETF commodity by AuM in the U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF first trading day data (Farside Investors) The spot Ethereum ETFs have equally performed well from the get-go Yesterday July 23 (the first trading day), the spot Ethereum ETFs recorded around $1 billion in trade volume , about 22% of the spot Bitcoin ETF's first trading day volume. Grayscale’s ETHE accounted for nearly half of the volume on the first trading day. Remember that Grayscale’s converted fund was created in 2017 and before the spot ETF conversion, the fund held about 2.2% of the total Ethereum supply, worth around $9.6 billion. This easily explains why ETHE saw about 50% of the volume. ETHE had traded on a discount to NAV earlier this year, trading around a 24% discount to NAV in April. Investors are likely seeking arbitrage gains while reallocating funds out of ETHE into their preferred spot ETF now that there are a handful of options for direct Ethereum exposure. ETHE recorded $484.1 million of outflows on the first trading day. The spot Ethereum ETFs, however, saw $107 million net flows on the first trading day despite ETHE massive outflows. ETHA led the inflows with $266.5 million and the ETHW recorded the second largest inflows at $204 million. ETHW: Bitwise Ethereum ETF is my Top Pick Bitwise is not a newbie when it comes to launching and managing crypto-related ETPs, having launched a few crypto ETPs, including the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ), Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF ( OTC:BITW ), Bitwise Web3 ETF ( BWEB ), and Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF ( AETH ), and thus earning the “crypto specialist” status. Bitwise has maintained a fee structure in ETHW similar to the fee structure of its spot Bitcoin ETF at 20 bps and an initial six-month fee waiver. Transparency has become a key focus and one of the main selling points of blockchain technology, as the movement of funds is easily traced on the blockchain. Among the Ethereum ETF funds, Bitwise is the first to publicly publish the on-chain addresses that will hold the ETHW ETF funds; more so, using the Ethereum Name Services alias addresses. This shows beyond-the-surface commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, Bitwise has pledged 10% of its fees for the open-source development of Ethereum. I believe these early ecosystem commitment moves will create strong brand differentiation for the Bitwise ETF and potentially bolster investor appeal. Based on this level of commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem coupled with the competitive fee of the ETHW ETF, I see a situation where crypto-focused hedge funds in particular will naturally gravitate towards Bitwise’s spot Ethereum ETF. Crypto-focused hedge fund Pantera Capital has indicated an interest in purchasing $100 million of the Bitwise spot Ethereum ETF shares. I think that is just the tip of the iceberg. Bitwise's commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem growth will attract more crypto-focused hedge funds over time. Crypto-focused hedge funds could likely choose to go the “values-based” investing route, aligning their investments with the principles and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. It all Hinges On ETH Yes. The success of the spot Ethereum ETFs hinges to a very large extent on the success of the underlying asset Ethereum. BTC Spot ETF Aggregate Inflows vs BTC Price (Bloomberg) The spot Bitcoin ETFs have shown us that demand for the ETFs has created a buying pressure on Bitcoin and the ETF inflows have strongly correlated with Bicoin’s price movement. As seen in the preceding chart. The first trading day of the spot Ethereum ETFs could be considered very impressive, with $107 million in net inflows and $1 billion cumulative trade volume. The Bitwise CIO refers to the first trading day as “exceeding expectations.” Ethereum is currently the only altcoin with a spot ETF approval and I think in the near term, there will likely not be another altcoin spot ETF approval due to the ambiguity in the regulatory classification of most altcoins as securities or commodities. This gives Ethereum a market advantage in the meantime. This also means that the demand for Ethereum ETFs will likely grow as institutional investors seek to diversify between the only two available crypto ETFs - Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. In a piece I wrote yesterday covering Ethereum, I went into detail about how the spot Ethereum ETFs serve as a major catalyst for Ethereum moving forward. Data compiled by Galaxy shows the existing institutional demand for existing Bitcoin ETPs (excluding spot ETFs) in the U.S. to be about 3.24x of ETH's ETP demand. In other words, ETH sees about 31% of Bitcoin’s demand. Plugging this ETP demand data into the ~$17 billion inflows the spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded so far in about six months, suggests that the spot Ethereum ETFs could potentially see around $10.5 billion of net inflows per year, or $900 million per month. I arrived at this estimate by first annualizing the ~17 billion six-month net inflows of the spot Bitcoin ETF, which is around $34 billion yearly. Considering Ethereum’s ETP demand is around 31% of Bitcoin’s, that gives a rough estimate of $10.5 billion - if the institutional demand for ETPs mirrors the demand for spot Ether ETF. Excerpt from my latest Ethereum coverage Risks The launch of the spot Ethereum ETFs doesn't eliminate the inherent volatility of the underlying asset ETH. Grayscale’s converted ETHE fund still commands a significantly high AuM. As witnessed on the first trading day, the fund could see serious outflows. Considering the high AuM, the ETHE shares could become an overhang. Takeaway The spot Ethereum ETFs have been well received and performed beyond expectations on the first trading day. The spot ETFs place Ethereum at an advantage over major altcoins for now. The buying pressure that we’ve seen on BTC because of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, demand would likely be witnessed in Ethereum also due to its spot ETFs. The nine newly-launched spot Ethereum ETFs all have unique prospects, ranging from competitive fees to self-custody to high AuM. However, I consider the Bitwise Ethereum ETF a top pick because of its brand differentiation approach, its day-1 commitment to transparency, and its commitment to the progress and development of the Ethereum ecosystem. ETHE will potentially attract crypto-focused institutional investors and see the fund grow its AuM immensely. ETH has upside potential, and so do the spot Ethereum ETFs. Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF is a stand-out ETF and a top pick to gain direct exposure to ETH’s imminent upside.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4706342-bitwises-ethw-stands-out-among-the-spot-ethereum-etfs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31496436.jpeg

The initial surge was not enough to push it into the coveted $1 level. However, this has not deterred bulls, especially with bullish formations on the chart and multiple predictions that the XRP price is set to hit a new all-time high. XRP Price Flashes Golden Cross A pseudonymous crypto analyst who goes by @Nico369K on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has pointed out an interesting formation on the XRP price chart. This formation is known as a “Golden Cross” and is an exceptionally bullish formation on the chart of any digital asset. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Is Still On Course To Rise To $150 Golden crosses usually emerged when the short-term moving average of an asset crosses over a major long-term moving average of that asset. The moving average could be from any timeframe, ranging from daily to weekly, and according to the crypto analyst, the Golden Cross has appeared on the weekly chart. The Golden Cross, on its own, signifies long-term bullish momentum for an asset, suggesting that the XRP price could be moving toward a rally. However, it is not the only bullish thing that has appeared on the chart as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also bullish. According to the crypto analyst, the RSI is currently sitting at around 44.31, which is a significant drop over the last few months. The RSI signifies if an asset is overbought or oversold, with higher values indicating overbought territory, which is bearish, and lower values indicating oversold territory, which is bullish. Usually, RSIs of around 30 mark oversold territory, and the XRP price is still higher than this level. However, the decline in the RSI suggests that the altcoin’s price has already descended toward oversold territory and a rally could erupt due to this. Other Factors That Could Drive A Rally The Ripple Vs. SEC lawsuit has been the obvious culprit when it comes to why the XRP price has failed to perform like the rest of its peers over the last four years. The lawsuit, which began in 2020, has raged on for almost four years now, and in that time, the XRP price has fallen below $1 and stayed there. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Final Wave 5 As World Events Signal Massive Surge However, the lawsuit is expected to come to an end this year after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that programmatic XRP sales on secondary exchanges did not qualify as securities. As a result, Ripple is now locked in settlement talks with the regulator to determine a comfortable outcome for the parties involved. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently said he is confident that the case will be over soon. Once the lawsuit is over, expectations are that the XRP price will finally have the freedom to move. In this case, the XRP price could surge past $1, with some analysts predicting that the price could cross $10 by the time the rally is done.

""This may come in subsequent sessions.""  The moves came amid a drop in the U.S. stock market, with the Nasdaq plunging 3.6% and the S&P 500 slumping 2.1% amid disappointing earnings results from market bellwethers like Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA).

31492216,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631354,1721853017,Will PEPE Climb 30% This Week? This Analyst Thinks So,"Traders are becoming drawn to the meme-inspired crypto PEPE, after a technical study by the famous crypto expert World Of Charts shows it has some surprises under its sleeves. As shown on X, PEPE is forming a positive pennant, which is a common technical sign for big price increases. According to World of Charts, the price of the meme coin could go up by 25 to 30%. Related Reading: Cosmos (ATOM) Set For 50% Rally After Recent Plunge, Analyst Eyes $12 Target Converging trendlines following a significant price gain, commonly called the flagpole, constitute the bullish pennant, which often indicates a halt before the market continues its upward trajectory. Pointing out a successful break from this pennant, World of Charts indicated a significant PEPE momentum. This breakout represents a turning point when the token breaks free from the consolidation period inside the convergent trendlines. $Pepe Breaking Bullish Pennant Successful Breakout Can Lead 25-30% Bullish Wave #Crypto #Pepe pic.twitter.com/o2Z9G6nWRV — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) July 23, 2024 PEPE was trading at $0.00001263 at the time of writing, suggesting a 4.60% increase; forecasts show a probable climb to $0.00001600, therefore reflecting a possible jump of up to 27%. Technical Indicators Display Positive Sentiment For PEPE, the technical signals a cautiously hopeful picture. Now showing a positive trend, the token is trading above both its 50 EMA ($0.000011) and 100 EMA ($0.00001029). At $0.00001288, it immediately encounters opposition nevertheless. A good breakthrough of this level may drive PEPE towards all-time highs. On the other hand, should PEPE lose its present momentum and below the 50 and 100 EMAs, prices would perhaps drop to the support level of $0.00000842. Currently at 56.16, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) points to a neutral to somewhat positive attitude lingering over the middle. Forecast Highlights Long-Term Possibilities Over the next seven days, an upswing is expected, thereby reflecting a positive short-term momentum for PEPE. The asset is selling at 228% below its expected value right now, implying notable undervaluation. For traders hoping to profit on the anticipated price movement, this gap offers a solid buy possibility. Technical signs pointing to rising purchasing pressure and market bullish mood line up with the expected upswing. Related Reading: Is The US Emulating Germany? $4 Million Bitcoin Movement Raises Questions Reflecting considerable medium-term promise, PEPE’s price is expected to rise by 245% over the next three months in the mid to long term. With a predicted rise of 180% in six months, this growth trajectory keeps on, therefore supporting the asset’s great upward momentum. Based on a one-year projection, which indicates 166% increase showing long-term value appreciation and continuous optimistic attitude. These forecasts imply that PEPE is likely to show notable increases, so it appeals to both long-term and short-term investors.

31489429,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631411,1721848365,"Ethereum ETFs Debut: BlackRock Reigns With $260M Inflows, Grayscale Bleeds","Nine spot Ethereum ETFs commenced trading on the US stock market on Tuesday, marking a pivotal moment for the crypto industry following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) green light on Monday. Ethereum ETFs See $1B In Trading Volume On Debut James Seyffart, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, described the Monday ETF launch as a “pretty big success,” according to a Fortune report. However, the initial enthusiasm was tempered by a stark comparison to Bitcoin’s ETF debut earlier this year, which garnered $655 million in inflows on its first trading day. Related Reading: Mt. Gox Creditors Opt To HODL Bitcoin Rather Than Sell, CryptoQuant Data Shows Diving into the specifics, the Ethereum ETFs collectively amassed $10.2 billion in assets, with trading volumes surpassing $1.1 billion on day one. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) led the volume race with $469.7 million. Among the key players, BlackRock led the charge with $266 million in inflows, followed closely by Bitwise with $204 million and Fidelity with $71 million. Despite these figures, the ETFs collectively witnessed net inflows of $107 million, overshadowed by Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust’s outflows of $484 million, as per Bloomberg data. However, the market response to the ETFs did not translate into a noticeable impact on Ethereum’s price, which experienced a marginal 0.8% decline since trading commenced. Currently, the second largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $3,420, with a 27% decrease in trading volume in this area, amounting to $16 billion in the last 24 hours, and no significant changes to Tuesday’s price value per coin. Bright Future Despite Challenges Given that Ethereum’s market cap is a fraction of Bitcoin’s, the comparatively smaller inflows were somewhat to be expected. In addition, the Fortune report noted that the lack of a staking feature in the ETFs, which is prohibited by the SEC, also drove some investors to buy Ethereum directly, bypassing the new Ethereum ETFs mechanism. Another strong reason for the outflows on the first day of the ETHE fund is Grayscale’s 2.5% fee compared to competitors charging 0.25% or less, a factor that is believed to have influenced investor behavior and contributed to ETHE’s outflows. Related Reading: Forget $10,000, Crypto Analyst Says Spot Ethereum ETFs Will Drive ETH To $14,000 Despite the lack of market response, Seyffart remains optimistic about the reception of the Ethereum ETFs, citing the strong performance of “smaller players” such as 21 Shares’ Core Ethereum ETF, which attracted $8.7 million in inflows. Seyffart said to Fortune: Very successful launch day by any standard ETF’s first day of trading. On top of this, the volume numbers were very strong. Adding to the optimistic outlook for the Ethereum ETFs, it is noteworthy that Bitcoin (BTC) surged to an all-time high of $73,700 on March 14, just two months after the approved ETFs started trading. Although ETFs investing in ETH’s price may not attract as much inflow and trading volume as BTC, this could lead to a sustained increase in ETH’s price in the long term.

31488968,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631346,1721847612,"Bitcoin Price Prints Rare Buy Signal With 84% Win Rate, $80,000 Coming?","After rising by more than 28% over the 16 days, the Bitcoin price was rejected at key resistance at $68,500 on Sunday. Since then, the BTC price is displaying a slight pullback, but according to Charles Edwards, the founder of Capriole Investments, investors can expect the bullish momentum to continue. Edwards shared the chart below and stated via X, “BREAKING: Hash Ribbon buy signal just fired.” Why The Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Matter This statement is significant, as the hash ribbons have historically been a reliable indicator, with an 84% accuracy rate in predicting Bitcoin’s major price bottoms. The hash ribbons are predicated on the interplay between the Bitcoin hash rate—the total computational power used to mine and process transactions—and Bitcoin’s market price. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Recent ETF Inflow Surge a Setup for a Fall? What Traders Need to Know Analysts observe that a drop in Bitcoin’s price or an increase in operational costs, such as electricity, may cause miners to halt operations temporarily. This period, known as ‘miner capitulation,’ is crucial because a resumption in mining activity is typically viewed as a bullish signal for Bitcoin’s price. The indicator itself is derived from the moving averages of the Bitcoin hash rate; specifically, the 30-day and 60-day moving averages. A ‘Buy’ signal occurs when the shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term average after a period of miner capitulation, indicating that the worst of the sell-off may be over and a recovery phase is likely imminent. Crypto analyst Jelle, known on X as @CryptoJelleNL, commented, “Hash ribbons are showing that minor capitulation is over! This signal prints after every halving event, and after major corrections — and suggests the next leg of expansion is just around the corner. Time for 80k+?” Related Reading: Mt. Gox Creditors Begin Withdrawing Owed Bitcoin And BCH Funds Via Kraken Further supporting the bullish sentiment, the account @DaFinancialPage noted on X, “Miner Capitulation. The Hash Ribbons indicator’s blue buy signal has appeared 19 times. Of those, 16 marked Bitcoin’s macro low, giving it an 84% win rate. The 3 times it didn’t, a major correction followed.” Thus, the appearance of the hash ribbon ‘Buy’ signal can be interpreted as a strong indicator for the next bullish phase in Bitcoin’s market cycle. However, the three instances when the signal failed to predict a significant rise highlight the inherent risks and uncertainties with every indicator. Notably, technical analysis aligns closely with the anticipated target of $80,000 discussed by Jelle. The 1.272 Fibonacci extension is sitting at approximately $79,337. However, before a new all-time high can be explored, Bitcoin must secure support at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $65,943 in the daily chart, which could act as a critical juncture. Subsequent levels at the 0.786 Fibonacci at $69,384 and the 1.0 Fibonacci at $73,767 serve as potential interim targets. At press time, BTC traded at $66,403.

31486860,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631397,1721844028,"Mt. Gox Creditors Opt To HODL Bitcoin Rather Than Sell, CryptoQuant Data Shows","Amid the recent recovery from a significant price correction of over 25% that sent the Bitcoin price to a 6-month low of $53,500, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has since recovered to trade in the $66,000 to $68,000 range despite the start of Mt. Gox creditor repayments. Investors, buoyed by prospects of continued price appreciation, have adopted a HODL stance, opting to retain their assets rather than selling them off following the alleged hack suffered by the Bitcoin exchange in 2011. BTC Hodlers Stand Firm Data from market intelligence platform Arkham reveals that Mt. Gox initiated a significant movement of $2.47 billion worth of BTC to new wallets, facilitating the distribution of 5,106 BTC worth $335 million to four distinct Bitstamp addresses on Wednesday. Concurrently, creditors have commenced receiving their owed Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) through the US-based crypto exchange Kraken, as previously reported by NewsBTC on Thursday. Despite initial concerns of a sell-off akin to the June events, where the German police’s wallet sold over $3 billion in BTC, impacting Bitcoin’s market performance, analytics from CryptoQuant indicate a positive shift. Related Reading: Road To $200: Crypto Pundit Reveals Key Levels To Watch For The Solana Price A notable increase in Bitcoin withdrawals from Kraken post-Mt. Gox reimbursements suggest that affected users opt to hold onto their coins, moving them from exchanges to cold wallets. On-chain data compiled by the firm shows that in the past 24 hours alone, more than 5,000 BTC worth $329 million have been withdrawn from exchanges, contributing to the current consolidation price action and stability for the Bitcoin price over the past few days. Arkham’s data further illustrates Mt. Gox’s ongoing efforts to repay creditors, with over 50,000 BTC transferred from the exchange’s wallet out of a maximum of 142,000 BTC while retaining 90,344 BTC valued at approximately $6 billion in BTC. Echoing the sentiment of CryptoQuant’s findings, Alex Thorn from Galaxy Digital highlights that most creditors are long-term Bitcoin proponents with a profound understanding of the technology. Thorn asserts that their preference to reclaim Bitcoin rather than opt for a USD payout signifies a strong inclination towards holding their assets rather than triggering a sell-off. Moreover, Thorn points out that the substantial capital gains implications of selling Bitcoin could dissuade creditors from liquidating their holdings. Bitcoin Price Analysis At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at the $66,400 milestone, as it is a key support level for the Bitcoin price on its way to retesting the upper resistance walls with an eye on the all-time high of $73,700 reached on March 14th. Adding to the bullish sentiment surrounding BTC’s price performance over the past week, the price may find notable support levels that could prevent further declines in the event of a sell-off by some Mt. Gox creditors in the coming days at $65,000. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Set To ‘Wake Up’, According To Legendary Trader’s Forecast Another key level for the bulls to watch is the $63,500 area, where the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) is located, which, as seen in the daily BTC/USDT chart below, has previously accompanied the price on further gains and acted as a strong support for BTC. Ultimately, it remains to be seen what stance creditors of the failed Mt.

42407795,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5fpE,1721842785,Is Donald Trump Insulating Bitcoin’s Price From the Tech Stock Slide?,"Since the market opened yesterday, the S&P500 has lost 1.8%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 is down 3.0% and tech darling Nvidia (NVDA) has bled 5.3%. Normally, bitcoin follows stocks (especially tech stocks) on their daily moves, but this time, as of writing, bitcoin (BTC) is up 0.5%. What gives?  It’s a small window of time, sure, but in a week where we are seeing Mt. Gox-related selling pressure and underwhelming spot ether ETF inflows, it’s surprising how well bitcoin has held today, considering especially how it usually moves.  Market commentators have long pointed out that Bitcoin is just a tech stock given its strong correlation to them. Bitcoin optimists, myself included, have been preaching about the impending decoupling when bitcoin sheds all asset correlations and becomes an uncorrelated macro asset that belongs in every balanced portfolio. But it hasn’t always seemed that way.  Narrative drives the day-to-day market moves, so what narrative does Bitcoin have that the stock market doesn’t have right now?  Donald Trump.  Donald Trump is not speaking at the biggest Stock Market Conference this week; mainstream investors aren’t eagerly awaiting what the former U.S. President might say on Nvidia; there are no rumors that a Nasdaq-100 strategic reserve will be announced.  But Trump is speaking at the Bitcoin Conference this week; bitcoin supporters are eagerly awaiting what the former U.S. President might say in a Saturday speech there; there are rumors that he’ll announce a Bitcoin strategic reserve.  It appears that, absent any other strong narratives, Trump is insulating bitcoin from the price action of tech stocks. Trump may be making a bid for the U.S. presidency and perhaps he deserves a new title: bitcoin’s decoupler-in-chief.  Whatever happens Saturday, Trump’s speech is shaping up to potentially be a “sell the event” event, as some market analysts have predicted. Trump could say or claim any number of things about bitcoin during his speech; who knows what. What’s for sure, though, is that his words will have wide sweeping effects on the crypto market.

42407787,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5fOm,1721842200,The Evolving Efficiency of Bitcoin Markets,"Despite rapid growth and increasing attention from investors and regulators, cryptocurrency markets remain largely inefficient. Although the market has become more efficient over time, studies show that even large-cap cryptocurrencies do not always fully reflect available information, leading to significant inefficiencies.  Reasons Behind Crypto Market Inefficiencies  Several factors contribute to persistent inefficiencies in cryptocurrency markets:  Low Liquidity: Compared to traditional financial markets, crypto markets have lower liquidity, making them more susceptible to large price swings and manipulation.  Regulatory Uncertainty: Inconsistent and evolving regulations across different jurisdictions create uncertainty, impacting investor behavior and market stability.  Market Fragmentation: Numerous exchanges with varying prices and trading volumes lead to inefficient price discovery and arbitrage opportunities.  Speculative Behavior: A significant portion of crypto trading is driven by speculation rather than fundamental value, leading to volatility and inefficiency.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Mental Biases in Crypto Investing  Unlike stocks, which can be analyzed based on well-established valuation methodologies, cryptocurrencies tend to be less driven by fundamentals in the short- to medium-term. Since much of the value derived from cryptocurrencies is based on future assumptions, the asset class is susceptible to large swings based on market sentiment and liquidity. Empirical studies show that cryptocurrency investing is closely associated with speculation and mental biases. Here are some prominent biases in crypto-investing:  Overconfidence Bias: Investors often overestimate their knowledge and predictive abilities, leading to excessive trading and risk-taking.  Herding Behavior: The tendency of investors to follow the crowd can result in buying into cryptocurrencies when prices are rising, and selling when prices are falling, contributing to market bubbles and crashes.  Anchoring: Investors may fixate on specific price points, such as all-time highs, and make decisions based on these anchors rather than considering broader market conditions.  Loss Aversion: The fear of losses can cause investors to hold onto losing investments for too long or sell winning investments too early.  Leveraging Inefficiencies with a Systematic Momentum Index  Technical analysis can work if assets do not behave in a random-walk fashion. A systematic momentum index can effectively capitalize on market inefficiencies while mitigating the psychological biases that plague individual investors. Here's how:  Exploiting Market Inefficiencies: By systematically analyzing price trends and momentum, the index can identify and exploit inefficiencies in the market. This approach is grounded in the observation that assets with strong recent performance tend to continue performing well in the short term.  Overcoming Psychological Hurdles: A systematic approach helps to avoid common biases such as momentum chasing and loss aversion. Instead of following the herd, a momentum index relies on objective data to make investment decisions. This reduces the emotional impact of market fluctuations on investment choices.  Added Value for Investors  For the average investor, a systematic momentum index offers several benefits:  Consistency: By adhering to a rules-based approach, the index ensures consistent investment decisions, reducing the impact of human error and emotional bias.  Risk Management: The systematic nature of the index allows for better risk management through predefined entry and exit points, improving overall portfolio stability.  Enhanced Returns: By taking advantage of market inefficiencies and avoiding common psychological pitfalls, a momentum index has the potential to generate superior returns compared to a purely passive investment strategy.  In conclusion, while cryptocurrency markets are inherently inefficient due to various structural and behavioral factors, these inefficiencies present opportunities for systematic investment strategies. A momentum index not only leverages these opportunities but also helps investors overcome the cognitive biases that often lead to suboptimal investment decisions. By doing so, it offers a valuable tool for navigating the volatile and rapidly evolving world of digital assets.

However, the price action shows that BTC's price seems more range-bound while miners, which are a key component of the ecosystem, continue to consolidate in the post-halving landscape. Also, more than six months after the emergence of several spot ETFs, BITO seems to be standing its ground when looking at total returns. I continue to lean towards a cautious Hold, as more supply hits the market. Some indications of how miners are performing should be obtained from the Nashville Conference in a few days. Since I last covered the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) on June 5 in my piece entitled: "" Wait for the end of turbulence before investing"", it lost more than 20% in light of crypto volatility. One and a half months later, things are improving as shown in the chart below, and it trades at around $23. Data by YCharts However, in the highly dynamic digital asset market, this thesis aims to show that this upside is not likely to be sustained, meaning that BITO is not a buy, and, for this purpose, I provide an update on the demand and supply factors that are driving Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) performance. To start with, seven months after the approval of eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), I provide an update on how BITO which bears an expense ratio of 0.95% has performed against emerging competitors charging much lower fees. BITO Versus Spot ETFs First, in the same way as spot ETFs, it allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to manage digital assets directly, but the difference is that BITO invests primarily in Bitcoin futures contracts rather than the physical coin itself. These futures are traded on the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), a regulated market, which adds an element of security and transparency for investors​. BITO's Holdings (www.proshares.com) Making a comparison of the AUM (assets under management) as per the chart below, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) saw record inflows since its launch, as shown below. On the other hand, BITO initially suffered as it saw net outflows in January but eventually recovered, in sharp contrast to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) which is still experiencing outflows. Data by YCharts This shows that the launch of cheaper spot Bitcoin ETFs did have some effect, but did not erode BITO's value. On the contrary, the January 10 approvals coincided with the interest in CME's future contracts hitting an all-time high as more investors were attracted to the crypto world. This has also improved liquidity conditions in the futures market​. Next, looking at capital appreciation, IBIT has beaten BITO by a hefty margin of nearly 40% as charted below, but, the total returns, which include the dividends provided they are reinvested show a different picture. Thus, despite attracting 200% more inflows than dividend-paying BITO, IBIT has only outperformed the futures ETF by around 5% when considering total returns. Data by YCharts However, the ProShares ETF does not pay dividends in the same way as equity-based ETFs holding income-producing stocks. Instead, as mentioned earlier, BITO invests in futures, or agreements to trade (buy or sell) an asset on a future date at an agreed price. Thus, the income part is mainly derived from fluctuations in the price of futures, and, as such, should not be expected to generate a regular cash flow like dividend ETFs. Still, despite missing some monthly dividend payments, as of January this year, its yield of 35% remains far superior to the median for all ETFs covered by Seeking Alpha. Next, since BITO's price performance is linked to Bitcoin, it is important to identify the supply and demand-led catalysts that can influence the path going forward. Identifying the Catalysts for the Price Action In my previous thesis , I had detailed how miners were adjusting to the post-halving landscape, which saw their rewards for adding a block to the blockchain cut in half to only 3.125 BTC. This led to less efficient miners halting operations, and those with not strong enough balance sheets selling their HODLed (accumulated) coins, causing supply to outstrip the demand from spot ETFs, thereby impacting prices. Another factor that could have pressured digital asset prices was the German government's disposal of over 50K Bitcoins previously seized from a piracy website and valued at around $3 billion considering a unit BTC price of $60K. This sell-off started on June 19 and lasted for over 24 days and coincided with the world’s largest former Bitcoin exchange, Mt.Gox (which was based in Japan) started to return over 140K Bitcoin or about $9.1 billion to victims of the 2014 hack from July 1. Thus, with an additional supply of crypto assets reaching the market, Bitcoin dipped to under $56K on July 7. Since then, Bitcoin rebounded to the $68K level as shown below due to demand-led catalysts, one of which is inflows into spot ETFs. Data by YCharts Thus, net inflows of $386 million were recorded on July 19 in contrast to outflows of $13 million at the beginning of this month. Also, the fact that all ETFs (including GBTC) cumulatively accumulated net inflows of $17 billion while GBTC alone experienced an outflow of $18.7 billion, shows that this is not only about investors rotating away to cheaper funds, but there is also fresh demand. One of the reasons for this is Republican candidate President Donald Trump being viewed as crypto-friendly, implying regulations could be loosened, considering he is voted into power. Moreover, some speculation the U.S. government would consider Bitcoin as a reserve currency in case he is elected has also influenced BTC's value. Now, including BTC as part of a reserve currency in the same way as gold is not that difficult considering the Department of Justice holds about 200K units of bitcoin, making America one of the largest HODLers. By transferring these digital assets to the Department of Treasury instead of disposing of them on the open market as the German government has done, $13 billion worth of Bitcoin could find its way to its balance sheet. Such a move would potentially restrict the supply of Bitcoin. Therefore, after supply-led catalysts pressured digital asset prices in June and the first week of July, it was mostly speculation-fueled demand that pushed prices up. Still, with the elections more than three months away, there is uncertainty as to the outcome, and this is what has mirrored in Bitcoin's value which retrenched from its $68K peak on Tuesday. Post-Halving Mining Industry Consolidation Ongoing Hence, in a volatile market still looking for direction, it is crucial to obtain a clearer idea of the path digital asset prices are likely to follow. For this purpose, it is better to assess how miners, as key stakeholders in the ecosystem, are performing, and such information can be obtained during the Nashville Conference from July 25 to July 27. Looking deeper, miners are not only facing cost pressures due to lower mining rewards, but it is also more difficult for them to refinance with interest rates above 5%. Also, as I had detailed in an earlier thesis on the consolidation of the mining industry, except for the larger players like Marathon Digital ( MARA ), smaller ones need cheaper electricity without forgetting AI data centers on the lookout for alternative power sources. To provide investors with a sense of how miners have suffered from the halving, the charts below show how the hash rate or the total computing capacity on the Bitcoin network sloped downwards in April, soon after the halving, reflecting lower miner participation. Data by YCharts Conversely, this resulted in lowering the mining difficulty or the time it takes to add a block (to the network) in the highly competitive industry, from its peak of 88 to 82. This has in turn resulted in the hash rate jumping to 730 (above chart) showing more miners are back in production mode. Noteworthily, its impact on BTC's price depends on how many of the minted coins are HODLed versus being sold and incrementing supply. In this connection, while trending lower, BTC has been trading in a narrow range (chart below), gaining support at $55.8K and reaching a resistance of $68K, as the mining industry consolidates following halving. Chart prepared using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) Key Takeaways As a result, BITO's support level has come down to $23 from $28.47 and there is a possibility of again testing the $19.8 level and even lower because of the following factors. Chart prepared using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) Firstly, the newly launched U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs has attracted investment worth more than $667 million. Now, while these are expected to be far less popular than their Bitcoin peers, their effect on the crypto ecosystem cannot be underestimated due to the diversification rationale they provide. To this end, it will ultimately depend on whether inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs continue next week. Second, ongoing Bitcoin repayments worth around $2.85 billion linked to Mt.Gox this week could also result in additional supply reaching the market. In conclusion, by going through the price action, this thesis has shown that volatility should continue as demand versus supply catalysts, including some politically driven ones, continue to unfold. This is happening as the industry consolidates in the post-halving landscape and the Nashville conference should provide some visibility into this area, but depending on how news updates are interpreted, there could be further volatility, which explains my Hold position. In this context, miners could greatly benefit from the Federal Reserve starting to cut rates in September, resulting in a surge in Bitcoin's price. This said, more BTC fluctuations in the three months before the elections should allow for more returns or dividend income for shareholders, depending on the futures contracts held and how they perform when traded.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4706195-bito-expect-continued-volatility-as-miners-consolidate?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31485413.jpeg

Industry experts and enthusiasts are looking at how the effects could play out on Ethereum’s price action in the coming months. Renowned crypto analyst Doctor Profit has made a bold prediction. According to him, Ethereum’s value is set to break through the $10,000 barrier, with the potential to reach a peak of $14,000. The catalyst for this anticipated surge is none other than the Ethereum ETFs, which are expected to act as a major catalyst for the cryptocurrency’s upward momentum. Doctor Profit’s Ethereum outlook was highlighted on the social media platform X, where he shared his insights in a post titled “The Big $ETH ETF Report.” Notably, the report echoes a general consensus amongst market participants, which is a parabolic ETH price move this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters Final Wave 5 As World Events Signal Massive Surge The report draws a parallel between the potential price action of Ethereum and Bitcoin’s performance following the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. According to Doctor Profit, if the newly launched Ethereum ETFs attract the same level of investor inflows as Bitcoin did, the impact on Ethereum’s price could be a staggering 209% greater compared to Bitcoin. Furthermore, Doctor Profit predicts that Ethereum might soon outperform Bitcoin, a noteworthy claim given Ethereum’s recent downtrend against Bitcoin since September 2022. However, recent market dynamics indicate that Bitcoin’s dominance is beginning to show signs of a corrective phase, while Ethereum’s dominance is on the rise. Many market participants are now looking up to Ethereum to lead other altcoins into the “altseason.” Price Targets Following Spot Ethereum ETFs Launch The most crucial part of Doctor Profit’s ETH report analyzes different price targets for Ethereum for the next 12 months. His initial projection for Q3 2024 places Ethereum’s price in the range of $4,500 to $5,500. This is followed by an expected rise to $5,500 to $8,000 in Q4 2024, a steady forecast of $5,500 to $8,000 for Q1 2025, and a final ambitious target of $8,000 to $14,000 for Q2 2025.

He started his analysis by highlighting his successful past ETH price predictions. He first identified Ethereum’s potential at $80 in 2020, accurately called the bottom at $900 in 2022, projected a target of $1,500 in 2023, and most recently, anticipated a dip to $2,800 just two weeks ago.

Investors are eagerly anticipating a break above $3,500 by the end of today and potentially reaching $4,000 by the end of the week. Doctor Profit advises his followers to remain unfazed by short-term price manipulations.

42407806,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5gCN,1721840400,Dispersion Is Defining the Current Crypto Market,"One of the most interesting features of the current crypto markets is the elevated level of dispersion, or range of returns across different parts of the market.  In today's liquid markets, sectors focused on infrastructure and technology have significantly outperformed more consumer-oriented categories like gaming, metaverse, and entertainment-related tokens.  CoinDesk sector indices' performance since November 2021 (the peak of the last bull market) reveals this trend.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The ""range"" value, which shows the difference between the maximum and minimum cumulative returns at each point in time, highlights the level of dispersion. Dispersion started high in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to a surge in culture and entertainment-related developments. It then dropped in 2022 as the market collapsed, correlations rose, and assets largely traded in sync.  However, dispersion has been rising since 2023, picking up meaningfully in the fourth quarter of last year, with Currencies and Smart Contract Platforms (infrastructure) breaking away from the rest of the market. In 2024, dispersion is at a high over this period, with tokens in the Culture & Entertainment sector continuing to draw down, while BTC, ETH, and other smart contract platform tokens are outperforming.  Take a few examples to illustrate this last point. The overall market’s current maximum drawdown (using the CoinDesk Market Index) was -33% over this period. Compare that to some of the largest consumer tokens in the Gaming and Culture & Entertainment sectors, including Axie Infinity (game), Decentraland and The Sandbox (metaverses), and Apecoin (token associated with the NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club). These tokens’ maximum drawdowns were -96%, -94%, -96%, and -96% respectively. They have not participated in the market’s recovery this cycle.  Another way to view dispersion is through the rolling 30-day average of the daily standard deviation of returns across the CoinDesk sector indices. Since the fourth quarter of last year, sector dispersion has mostly been above average. This elevated level of dispersion indicates that the market is no longer moving in unison, and individual sectors are experiencing different growth trajectories based on their underlying fundamentals and investor interest.  To delve deeper, we examine the number of billion-dollar-valued tokens in each sector (sectors are defined by Hack VC) as of five years ago compared to today. In 2019, Currencies dominated the market: BTC and BTC competitors. Today, half of the tokens are in the infrastructure sector (layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains). This sector has seen massive growth over the past five-plus years. We also see new sectors emerging. AI, for example, is a relatively new part of the market that brings together two of the most exciting emerging technologies: crypto and AI. While there is a lot of hype and promise, real benefits exist today. In the next five years, we expect additional sectors and sub-sectors will emerge.  This dispersion and development of new sectors over time is positive for active managers. It indicates growing market sophistication, with value being rewarded and fundamentals becoming increasingly important. Dispersion also offers significant opportunities for generating alpha. It makes it easier for active managers with alpha to outperform the market, though it also increases the risk of underperformance without a strong strategy.  In this environment, investors must be more selective and knowledgeable about the sectors and projects they invest in. Active management becomes crucial as the market rewards those who can identify and capitalize on trends. These markets are also particularly favorable for investors with a deep understanding of technological advancements and the ability to discern long-term value from short-term hype.

(ZackXBT/X)  ETH ETF LAUNCH: Newly approved spot Ethereum ETFs started trading on Tuesday, hauling in a net $107 million of fresh investment – including $484.1 million of outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), and $590.9 million of inflows into vehicles launched by managers including BlackRock, Fidelity and Bitwise. While analysts have predicted a far-lower uptake for the new funds than bitcoin spot ETFs that started trading about six months ago, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart described the first day of trading for the Ethereum ETFs as ""very solid.""  BOOTY OR BOUNTY? A $230 million exploit of the Indian crypto exchange WazirX got blockchain sleuths pointing fingers at North Korea-linked hackers, and various parties blaming each other for the security lapse. The funds were allegedly stolen from a WazirX multisignature wallet, or ""multisig""– one that requires two or more private keys to execute a transaction. ""Despite us taking all necessary steps to protect the customer assets, the cyber attackers appear to have possibly breached such security features, and the theft occurred,"" the exchange wrote in a preliminary report. WazirX identified the multisig wallet's provider as crypto custody firm Liminal in a follow-up post, hours after the initial confirmation. It later deleted the post, and Liminal said in a blog post that ""there is no breach in Liminal's infrastructure, wallets and assets."" The loot included shiba inu (SHIB) tokens along with ETH, MATIC, PEPE and USDT. A gallows-humor-meets-geekdom moment arrived when blockchain records appeared to show that the exploiter had created a token called ""WazirX Hacker Sends His Regards."" The exchange filed a police complaint, and the matter is under investigation. But as of Friday, tokens on WazirX were trading at deep discounts to their prices on other global crypto exchanges, a sign of immense local selling pressure. Earlier this week WazirX announced that it would pay a bounty of as much as $23 million, or 10%, to the hacker in exchange for the return of the funds. On a running blog post chronicling the incident day-by-day, WazirX updated that it's now ""actively contacting projects associated with the stolen tokens to seek their support in the recovery process."" One poster on X responded by noting that the looter had apparently already ""converted almost all of the stolen crypto to ETH,"" inquiring, ""Don't you think it's too late?""  'COPYCAT WEBSITE' Decentralized crypto-exchange giant dYdX said Tuesday that the website for dYdX v3, an older version of its trading platform, was ""compromised,"" and warned users against visiting dydx.exchange until further notice. ""The attacker has taken over the v3 domain (dydx.exchange), and deployed a copycat website that when users connect their wallets to it, it asks them to approve via PERMIT2 transaction to steal their most valuable token,"" a member of dYdX's community team said in the project's Discord server. The attack did not appear to impact funds traders already have on dYdX, as only the web domain, and not the underlying smart contracts, appear to be being targeted, according to statements in dYdX's Discord server. The larger dYdX v4 venue (which last week saw $6 billion in trading volume) was said to be unaffected.  ALSO:  Vitalik Buterin argued against supporting candidates just based on their ""pro-crypto"" stances.  Ryan Selkis stepped down as CEO of Messari, the crypto data and research firm he co-founded, following a series of inflammatory tweets about politics, civil war and his desire for an immigrant to get expelled from the country.  With U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris securing widespread endorsements as the presumptive replacement for Joe Biden atop the Democratic 2024 presidential ticket, crypto lobbyists are scrambling to assess whether she might look for a ""reset"" in policies toward digital-asset regulation. (Her memecoin soared to an all-time high, fwiw.)  Ethereum-Based Protocol Alkimiya Creates Market for Hedging Bitcoin Fees  Akimiya founder and CEO Leo Zhang (Alkimiya)  Blockchain protocol Alkimiya launched, introducing a tool that allows users to hedge against volatile Bitcoin transaction fee rates.  The hardest part might be getting hardline bitcoiners – sometimes known as ""maximalists"" or ""maxis"" – to use the new protocol, since it's built atop theEthereum blockchain. Target users for the platform, described as a ""blockspace markets protocol,"" could include traders, mining pools and foundations.  ""While we recognize that Bitcoin maxis may initially hesitate to use an Ethereum-based solution, our primary focus is on creating the most robust and efficient marketplace for trading Bitcoin transaction fees,"" Alkimiya founder and CEO Leo Zhang said in an email interview with CoinDesk.  There may be little doubt about the usefulness of a solution like Alkimiya's: In April, when Casey Rodarmor's Runes protocol for minting fungible tokens atop Bitcoin went live, the Bitcoin network fee rate shot up to $125 per transaction from $4.80.  Click here for the full article by Bradley Keoun  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.  Ephemera Kit (Inscribing Atlantis)  1. Inscribing Atlantis, led by Hell Money podcast co-host Erin Redwing, announced that its ""Ephemera"" auction will be launching for the first time at the Bitcoin Nashville conference, and will run from July 18 through Bitcoin block height 854,784 (approx. Aug. 2). According to the team: ""This project ties Bitcoin block time to astronomical time by inscribing planetary ephemeris data on satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) from the exact moment they were mined. Through Ephemera, participants can select dates they want to memorialize on Bitcoin, creating a unique digital archaeological record. This initiative explores the concept of Deep Time, aiming to leave a lasting legacy by linking our digital age with the cosmos."" The planetary data is inscribed using Bitcoin's Ordinals protocol, created by the independent Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor, who is Redwing's fellow co-host on Hell Money. ""It's basically my gamified way of trying to get people to participate in my community archeological project,"" Redwing told CoinDesk in an email.  2. Hemi Labs announced the Hemi Network, ""a modular layer-2 blockchain network focused on delivering superior scaling, security, and interoperability between Bitcoin and Ethereum.""According to the team: ""Hemi Labs was co-founded by early Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik and blockchain security pioneer Max Sanchez, who was the principal developer behind Hemi’s unique method for inheriting Bitcoin’s unique security characteristics – the Proof-of-Proof (“PoP”) consensus protocol.""  3. Avail, a blockchain ""data availability"" project spun out of Polygon in early 2023 that has raised $75 million of funding, is finally launching. The project's main network was set to go live on Tuesday, along with a native token, AVAIL, according to a press release. ""The launch of Avail DA marks the first step in Avail’s mission to give developers the tools they need to boost blockchain scalability, enhance liquidity and provide seamless usability across any blockchain ecosystem,"" according to a press release.  4. Lightning Labs announced the release of Taproot Assets on Bitcoin's Lightning Network, claiming to be the ""first multi-asset Lightning protocol on mainnet."" According to a blog post by Lightning Labs' Ryan Gentry: ""With this release, assets can be minted on bitcoin and sent via the Lightning Network instantly for low fees. As such, we now have the ability to make bitcoin and Lightning multi-asset networks in a scalable manner anchored in bitcoin's security and decentralization. This step forward will give users access to the world's currencies on an open, interoperable payments network while routing through bitcoin liquidity, making bitcoin the global routing network for the internet of money.""  5. Base, the layer-2 network backed by the publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase, said that fault proofs are now live on the Base Sepolia testnet. According to a blog post: ""Today’s launch paves the way for bringing fault proofs securely to mainnet, and completing other milestones to reach Stage 1 decentralization... In Stage 1 decentralization, or 'limited training wheels,' the chain state is verified with fault proofs but there is an override mechanism that can act in the event of a bug. The override mechanism requires consensus from both chain operators and a designated number of external stakeholders, which reduces the dependence on chain operators alone.""  Money Center  Fundraisings  Caldera, a ""rollup-as-a-service"" platform that helps developers quickly spin up layer-2 blockchains, has closed a $15 million Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. CEO Matt Katz said in an interview with CoinDesk that the new funds will help him expand Caldera's 15-person team so they can build out the Metalayer, an interoperability ecosystem meant to simplify the process of launching applications across multiple blockchains. The fundraise was led by Founders Fund, with participation from Dragonfly, Sequoia Capital, Arkstream Capital, Lattice.  Bitcoin layer-2 blockchain Bitlayer Labs said it raised $11 million in a Series A funding round at a valuation of $300 million. The investment was led by ABCDE and Franklin Templeton, one of the issuers of a spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund in the U.S. Bitlayer's layer 2 is based on the BitVM paradigm, which was unveiled last October, laying out a path for Ethereum-style smart contracts on the original blockchain.  NPC Labs, a developer looking to build a GameFi ecosystem on the Base protocol, has closed an $18 million funding round led by Pantera Capital.  Zivoe, a real-world asset credit protocol atop Ethereum, raised $8.35 million in their last round, aiming to broaden credit access by connecting blockchain liquidity with real-world borrowers, according to the team.  Omnichain data network Chainbase has raised $15 million in Series A funding with Tencent Investment Group, Matrix Partners and Hash Global among the investors.  Data platform Allium Labs, which provides enterprise-grade blockchain data to companies like Visa, Stripe and Uniswap Foundation, has raised $16.5 million in a Series A funding round, it announced Thursday.

42407794,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5fic,1721837939,"Coinbase Asset Management Plans Tokenized Money-Market Fund, a Hot Area After BlackRock's BUIDL Success: Sources","Coinbase Asset Management is creating a tokenized money-market fund, according to four people familiar with the plan.  Tokenization of real-world assets is a hot corner of crypto. BlackRock's tokenized U.S. Treasuries fund quickly grabbed $500 million of assets this year.  The asset management arm of U.S.-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) is creating a tokenized money-market fund, jumping into one of the hottest crypto-powered corners of finance, according to four people familiar with the plan.  Tokenization, or representing ownership of real-world assets (RWAs) through blockchain-based products, has become one of the big trends in crypto of late. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, introduced a fund called BUIDL that holds U.S. Treasuries. That fund quickly hit $500 million of assets following its introduction in March.  For investors, tokenized funds provide numerous potential benefits, including the transparency provided by blockchain-linked assets and the possibility of greater liquidity. For issuers, there are efficiency gains.  For Coinbase Asset Management specifically, this would represent an expansion of the company's already publicly known attempt to break into the tokenization space. In December, the company received in-principle approval from an Abu Dhabi regulator to start tokenizing traditional assets on Base, the exchange's Ethereum scaling network.  Two of the people familiar with the matter said Coinbase Asset Management has been working with Bermuda-based Apex Group to help facilitate its tokenized fund. Apex services over $3 trillion of assets across custody, administration, depositary and managed funds.  In March 2023, Coinbase acquired One River Digital Asset Management, which led to the creation of Coinbase Asset Management.  Coinbase declined to comment. Apex Group did not comment by publication time.

31482564,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631307,1721836804,"Solana Hits $170, Bullish Channel Formation Indicates Possible Rally","The cryptocurrency market has witnessed significant fluctuation, with Solana (SOL) experiencing a notable retracement to $170.27, creating a bullish channel in the process. This recent market behavior happens after a period of a potential rally that has previously pushed the price of SOL above the $170.27 level. As the price of this digital asset continues to trend within the channel, the question remains whether bulls will regain control and push the price above the bullish channel or will the bears maintain their dominance and drive the price below it. In this article, we will examine Solana’s recent price movements using technical indicators to forecast future trends and highlight key levels to watch. Technical Examination On The Current Price Movement Of Solana On the 4-hour chart, Solana’s price is currently above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggesting a potential resurgence of bullish momentum for SOL. Additionally, the price has faced resistance at the $170 mark, as indicated by two bullish candlesticks signaling this rejection. The signal line of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, which recently dipped slightly below 50%, is now attempting to cross back above the 50% mark. If successful, this cross could indicate a potential price increase for Solana. On the 1-hour chart, Solana is climbing toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating a potential upward movement as it may attempt to break above the level. Also, SOL’s price has established a bullish channel pattern on the 1-hour chart. A breakout and close above the channel’s upper line could ignite positive sentiment, as the bulls may regain control. Lastly, the signal line of the RSI indicator on the 1-hour chart is also currently approaching the 50% mark, suggesting possible upward momentum. Key Levels To Watch In The Event of A Breakout Considering the current positive rebound at $170, if the price of Solana breaks and closes above the upper boundary of the bullish channel, it may continue its rally toward the $188 resistance range. Should Solana manage to surpass this resistance level, it could lead to an additional upward move, pushing towards $205 along with other resistance points beyond. Nonetheless, if Solana’s price breaks and closes below the channel’s lower boundary, it could decline to the $160 support level. Should the price break and close below $160, it might trigger further bearish momentum, pushing the price toward the $118 support range or even lower. As of the time of writing, Solana’s price has decreased by 0.72%, trading at approximately $173 over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has a market capitalization of over $80 billion and a trading volume exceeding $3 billion. There has been a 0.71% decline in SOL’s market cap, accompanied by a 7.10% increase in trading volume over the last 24 hours.

The funds in bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}} and bitcoin cash {{BCH}} were received from the Mt. Gox trustees today, Bitstamp said in post on its website. U.K. customers will not be included in the first set of distributions, the crypto exchange said.  Bitstamp's action came after multiple Mt. Gox creditors reported receiving assets via Kraken.

Investors were worried the creditors would sell the reclaimed assets, realizing the profits of 10 years of price appreciation, and flood the market.  Bitcoin fell slightly to $66,200 on the news, while BCH dropped nearly 2%.  Read more: Crypto Markets to See Selling Pressure in July From Mt.

The company is aiming to go public through a merger with SPAC Emerald Acquisition.  Bitcoin rewards app Fold is planning a public listing on Nasdaq through a merger with special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Emerald Acquisition Corp. (EMLD).  New York-based Fold offers a cashback debit card which provides bitcoin rewards instead of traditional rewards one would expect from other related products. Fold's cards have processed over $2 billion in volume and distributed more than $45 million worth of rewards, according to an announcement on Wednesday.  The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of both firms, will have a pre-money equity valuation of $365 million. The post-transaction entity will also have more than 1,000 BTC ($67 million) on its balance sheet.  Fold has not yet disclosed the expected closing of the merger nor the ticker it will trader under on Nasdaq.  SPACs were a popular way for crypto firms to attain public listings during the last bull cycle. However, the onset of the crypto winter in 2022 saw several muted SPACs cancelled.  It is unclear as yet whether this bull cycle will see more of such deals come to fruition. Bitcoin financial services firm Swan cancelled its SPAC plans on Monday, amid a reorganization which also saw it discontinued its managed mining unit and cut staff across several units.

Litecoin’s past shows a consistent performance, despite its recent slow down. Often referred to as the “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold,” the cryptocurrency had already peaked on May 10, 2021 at $414. Litecoin’s price has been much below its high in the current market environment, which offers investors a possible purchase chance. With short-term and long-term estimates showing significant increase, CoinCheckup’s newest study and forecast point to a positive picture. Technical data and Bollinger’s professional analysis support this hope by implying that the altcoin could be about ready to climb from its present plateau. Litecoin Price Forecast Looking ahead, Litecoin has a quite bright future. LTC is expected to climb 11.73% over the next three months, according to CoinCheckup; this might create conditions for a more spectacular surge of 211.52% during the following six months. With an expected increase of 143% during the next year, the long-term projection is even more hopeful. This projection highlights the possibility for large returns, therefore presenting Litecoin as a good investment choice for anyone ready to negotiate the erratic bitcoin market. Litecoin could possibly be about to enter a new phase of expansion based on technical signs pointing to an impending spike and professional opinions supporting the prognosis.

The move marks a major pivot compared to the company's medical technology business. The stock price direction is now tied to the direction of Bitcoin, but core operating trends should keep shares volatile. Semler Scientific ( SMLR ) has made headlines by adopting a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury strategy, allocating more than $57 million from its balance sheet to the digital asset this year. The open market purchases represent a big bet on the cryptocurrency as a store of value and its potential to generate outsized returns. The move is even more significant considering the medical technology company only commands a current market capitalization of just $242 million, essentially tying its fortunes to the future of Bitcoin. The market reaction since the May announcement has been positive, but also underscores a new layer of uncertainty over the company's long-term outlook. While the core business is profitable and generates positive cash flow, weak growth remains a concern. Ultimately, we're not convinced buying Bitcoin was the company's best use of capital. Here's why we expect the stock to remain volatile. Data by YCharts What Does SMLR Do? Semler Scientific is recognized for its flagship QuantaFlo product, a rapid point-of-care test that measures arterial blood flow in the extremities and represents an alternative to the traditional Ankle-Brachial Index ((ABI)) test. In this case, QuantaFlo has the advantage of being paired with a software interface that can more accurately diagnose cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial disease ((PAD)), including at a pre-clinical stage and with a wider range of patients. Semler believes QuantaFlo is the industry benchmark utilized in diverse healthcare settings across hospitals, private practices, and specialized clinics as key customers. QuantaFlo is currently Semler Scientific's only revenue driver, targeting an estimated +80 million people with cardiovascular risk factors and 550k primary care providers in the United States as its market opportunity. source: company IR Semler Scientific by the Numbers In terms of the latest trends, Semler reported Q1 earnings back in May (for the period ended March 31) with EPS of $0.78, up 24% from $0.63 in the period last year. On the other hand, revenue of $15.9 million represented a decline of 13% from Q1 2023. In this case, the company is citing an ongoing adjustment to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ((CMS)) coding, which is phasing out the reimbursement for certain PADs without complications. Even as this particular category is a relatively modest part of the overall business, management anticipates ongoing headwinds in what is a three-year regulatory process. The plan is to pursue new FDA-cleared indications for the detection of broader heart dysfunction that can help drive a new round of growth, expected in the second half of the year and into 2025. Profitability and cash flow have been supported by an effort at cost controls and generating internal financial efficiencies. Semler Scientific ended Q1 with $63 million in cash against effectively zero financial debt. Data by YCharts Semler Bitcoin Strategy With that corporate setup since the Q1 earnings report, Semler Scientific made the surprising announcement in late May it had 581 Bitcoins for $40 million in a press release covering the virtues of the cryptocurrency and digital asset. The company cited the SEC's January 2024 decision to approve the trading of Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded products as adding to the legitimacy and institutionalization of the crypto asset class. According to the company's published Bitcoin Treasury Strategy policy , the company intends to adopt Bitcoin as its primary balance sheet reserve, considering it a superior alternative to both fiat currencies and gold. We are in the fortunate position of being a company that has consistently generated cash and has a strong balance sheet with substantial net cash. Our board of directors and senior management have been examining potential uses of cash, including acquisitions and stock repurchases. After studying various alternatives, we decided that investing in bitcoin is currently the best use of our excess cash. Subsequently, Semler Scientific announced a separate $17 million purchase of Bitcoin in May and now holds 828 Bitcoins in total with an implied market value of $55 million at the current price. Overall, Semler joins an otherwise select group of publicly traded companies not directly connected to the crypto industry that have made a commitment to Bitcoin, including MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), Block ( SQ ), and Tesla ( TSLA ), which all hold larger amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheet. At the same time, Semler's Bitcoin holdings which represent nearly 23% of its entire market value stand out as an outsized position compared to SQ at just 2% of its market cap or Tesla at under 0.0004%, only surpassed by MSTR at closer to 30%. What's Next for SMLR? Naturally, if there is a scenario where the price of Bitcoin will appreciate materially, those gains should be captured by Semler Scientific stock through its measurement at fair value. At the same time, the risk is that the price of Bitcoin could fall, further pressuring shares of SMLR beyond its core financial trends. In contrast to MicroStrategy which has pioneered the process of utilizing convertible debt and equity offerings to leverage into increasingly larger Bitcoin holdings over the last several years, the main difference is SMLR's currently smaller scale and that it has begun its journey with the price of Bitcoin near an all-time high. We do know that Semler launched a mixed-shelf, allowing it to raise $150 million . While noting the intention to use a portion of those proceeds for Bitcoin purchases, it remains to be seen how aggressive the company will be in its strategy going forward. Simply put, Semler's success from these latest efforts will entirely depend on the ability of Bitcoin to keep climbing in price, which is subject to market risk like any other investment. There is also a thought that Semler Scientific is foregoing interest income by not allocating its balance sheet cash to high-yielding money market accounts or even Treasuries. Finally, the market will continue to watch the company's regular operating trends, including how sales of QuantaFlo proceed. Typically, a company with declining sales as is the case this year warrants a valuation discount, but we sense the positive sentiment towards crypto works to at least provide a floor for the stock. SMLR is trading at around 3 times its book value or 18x as a forward P/E ratio is reasonable all things considered. The more difficult question is whether shares of the stock are a better bet compared to buying Bitcoin outright or undervalued relative to other stock market opportunities. We're skeptical on this point. Data by YCharts SMLR Q2 Earnings Outlook Looking ahead to the company's Q2 earnings report set for August 5th, the expectation is for a continuation of the Q1 trends for the core medical technology business, with sales still under pressure. This view is based on comments Semler Chief Financial Officer Renae Cormier made during the Q1 earnings conference call : For the remainder of 2024, we anticipate our revenues could follow a similar cadence that we saw in 2023, with H1 more heavily weighted versus H2. According to consensus, the forecast is for Q2 revenue approximately flat year-over-year, while EPS of $0.53 represents a decline of -25% compared to Q2 2023. Overall, the pivot towards Bitcoin is the bigger story. We'll want to hear from management some indication of how far they intend to take the treasury strategy in terms of quantitative benchmarks for future purchases. Risks to Consider As a small-cap stock, despite underlying profitability, investors should be aware that Semler Scientific remains in a high-risk category based on its concentrated business profile. Any sort of regulatory setback related to new QuantaFlo indications or weaker-than-expected results could open the door for a repricing lower in the stock. In our view, holding a volatile asset such as cryptocurrencies as a balance sheet reserve adds to those risks and doesn't improve the company's long-term potential in the field of medical technologies. Final Thoughts We rate shares of SMLR as a hold, balancing the company's overall solid fundamentals against some skepticism towards the company's new Treasury strategy. It's unlikely the stock is the best vehicle to express a bullish view on Bitcoin while also noting concerns over the core business outlook amid weak sales this year.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4706115-semler-scientific-stock-big-bet-on-bitcoin-doesnt-change-big-picture-smlr-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31478468.jpeg

31475769,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631324,1721826009,Road To $200: Crypto Pundit Reveals Key Levels To Watch For The Solana Price,"Solana (SOL) is currently one of the high-flyers in the crypto market. The crypto token recently recorded one of the most gains following the market-wide rebound. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital, however, suggested that the crypto token is just getting started, revealing key levels to watch as Solana eyes higher prices. Key Levels To Watch For Solana’s Price In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Rekt Capital highlighted $180 and $202 as key price levels to watch for Solana’s price. The analyst claimed that a successful retest of the $180 price level as new support could continue an upward trend over time for Solana. SOL could rise above $200 in the short term as it moves further to the upside. However, the crypto token would need to break the resistance at $202 as it looks to break its all-time high (ATH) of $260. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Reach A New All-Time High? Crypto Analyst Reveals Why $90,000 Is Possible Following the recent market-wide rebound, Solana had risen above $180, a three-month high for the crypto token. Although the crypto token has dropped below this price level again, another rise above $180 will help SOL establish that price range as new support and prime it for further moves to the upside. As highlighted by Rekt Capital, the $135 and $122 price levels have already been established as solid support for the crypto token. Rekt Capital’s analysis follows crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s recent prediction that Solana could skyrocket and rise to as high as $1,000. Martinez stated that early signs of a breakout from a bull pennant suggest a potential 900% rally ahead for Solana. Crypto analyst Javon Marks also offered a bullish prediction for Solana, stating that the crypto token will rise to $233 and then $450. He made this prediction based on SOL’s bullish structure, which he noted also recently confirmed a hidden bullish divergence. Marks explained that this divergence could send Solana’s price back above $204 and lead to a price rally of over 40% to $233.8 as prices “hold broken out of a much larger resisting structure.” The analyst also suggested that this bullish divergence will cause Solana’s price to rise to $450. Enough Reasons To Be Bullish On Solana There are enough reasons to be bullish on Solana, especially considering how the crypto token has earned the status of being among the ‘big 3’ alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in this bull run. Solana’s dominance in this market cycle is one reason market participants anticipate that a Spot Solana ETF will likely be approved next. Solana’s price appears to be reacting to such expectations, with fund issuers VanEck and 21Shares filing to offer Spot Solana ETFs. If they eventually launch, these funds could contribute to more parabolic price gains for SOL, considering the Spot Bitcoin ETFs’ impact on BTC’s price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Falling Wedge Pattern: Crypto Analyst Predicts Breakout To $0.22 The steady rise in Solana’s total value locked (TVL) also paints a bullish picture for the crypto token. Data from DeFiLlama shows that Solana’s TVL has been rising significantly since the start of the year and has continued to hit new highs. The network’s TVL currently stands at $5.21 billion, the third highest among all chains. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at around $173, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The company was founded by former Airbnb, Anchorage and Coinbase executives.  It is aimed at businesses, which will pay a monthly fee.  Dakota, which describes itself as a crypto bank that is attempting to right the wrongs of centralized lenders such as Celsius and BlockFi, emerged from stealth on Wednesday.  The company, which was founded by a group of former Airbnb, Anchorage and Coinbase Custody executives, offers treasury management, lending and payment services to businesses that pay a monthly fee and gain access to a platform that allows them to lend out their deposited crypto across a selection of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  The model differs from earlier, centralized crypto lenders such as Celsius Network, which filed for bankruptcy in July 2022, and BlockFi, which followed suit four months later, said CEO Ryan Bozarth. In those cases, the companies stood at the center of the process: receiving deposits, lending them out and taking a fee from the interest payment.  At Dakota, the clients make the lending decision and choose which decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol they wish to use. The monthly fee ranges between $150 and $1,500, and clients who choose to lend their deposits can earn returns of up to 9%. Stablecoin holders will receive a yield based on U.S. Treasuries.  ""The biggest difference for us is that we only lend out through DeFi protocols and so there is no centralized lending,"" Bozarth, who was previously the CEO at Coinbase Custody, said in an interview. ""DeFi protocols there is, admittedly, some risk with that, but it's at least a transparent risk, it's smart contract risk.""  While Dakota appears to be a novel idea that is solving a problem, the crypto industry is still tending to the scars earned during the collapse of companies including Celsius, BlockFi and FTX.  Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 despite having $12 billion in assets under management two months prior. The company's plight was caused by setting an overambitious yield of 17%, which led the firm to use newer and riskier blockchains like Terra. The eventual bankruptcy, like BlockFi's, left hundreds of thousands of creditors in the dark over whether their deposited funds would ever be returned.  With DeFi, there's a greater degree of transparency, Bozarth said, pointing to DeFi lending protocol Aave.  ""If you look at the last downturn, [Aave] performed perfectly as everyone knew there was nothing to negotiate with, you will be liquidated if you hit this marker and so they worked phenomenally well whereas centralized lenders did not.""  Dakota also caters to the fiat currency market dollar transfers, deposits and withdrawals. These services are designed for treasury-management purposes, with all dollars deposited to the platform being backed by U.S. Treasuries.  One of the largest hurdles for U.S.-based crypto firms is building a product that can comply with varying levels of regulation across jurisdictions. Last year Coinbase (COIN) had to roll out an offshore sector of its company due to restrictions in the U.S.  Dakota's dollar-based services typically require money transmitter licenses (MTL) in every state. The company will bypass that in the U.S. by using a third party that has an MTL where needed. In Europe, it plans to secure a Virtual Asset Service Provider License (VASP) and each region will have its own regulatory and compliance requirements, some of which will be built in-house by Dakota and third parties will be used for the rest.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/24/dakota-emerges-from-stealth-to-provide-bank-like-services-to-crypto-depositors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8997e4c8842f626b1d36f4acbaf128a6063c343-3480x1767.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407788,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5fS5,1721826000,Rollup-in-a-Box Startup Caldera Raises $15M From Peter Thiel's Venture Fund,"Caldera, a ""rollup-as-a-service"" platform that helps developers quickly spin up layer-2 blockchains, has closed a $15 million Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund.  CEO Matt Katz said in an interview with CoinDesk that the new funds will help him expand Caldera's 15-person team so they can build out the Metalayer, an interoperability ecosystem meant to simplify the process of launching applications across multiple blockchains.  Today, Caldera provides a simple interface for launching layer-2 ""rollup"" chains that record data to Ethereum but offer quicker and cheaper transactions. The Caldera product suite plugs into popular rollup-building frameworks like those from Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon; developers can select a rollup ecosystem and then swap out components to support whatever use case they're building for.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  ""Many blockchain projects face growing challenges in deploying and maintaining rollups due to the high costs, slow processes and risks associated with hiring protocol and site reliability engineers,"" Caldera explained in a statement. ""Caldera solves this by enabling projects to deploy a rollup with a single click, eliminating the need for an in-house engineering team.""  Caldera's Series A round included participation from Dragonfly, Sequoia Capital, Arkstream Capital and Lattice. It brings the total funding of the firm, which was founded in 2022, to $25 million.  The new fundraising comes amid a period of rapid expansion for Ethereum's layer-2 ecosystem, with rollup chains rapidly outpacing the layer-1 Ethereum chain in terms of overall network activity. ""Everybody's launching a chain right now,"" said Katz.  Builders have raced to respond to the demand from Ethereum's layer-2 boom: Early rollup teams, like those behind the popular Arbitrum and Optimism chains, have released readymade templates for developers to build their own interoperable blockchains. New ""data availability"" layers, like Celestia and EigenDA, have emerged to warehouse the massive troves of transaction data generated by all the new blockchains.  More recently, as liquidity has become fragmented between myriad disparate layer-2 ecosystems, Polygon's AggLayer and the Elastic Chain from zkSync have launched to help capital flow more efficiently between different networks.  Katz says Caldera and its new Metalayer initiative are designed to complement the growing world of layer-2 infrastructure components rather than compete with them head-on.  ""If you're developing for multi-chain, you're developing for a million individual chains all at the same time,"" he explained. ""We want Metalayer to be an entry point for folks who are developing apps and developing infrastructure to basically get deployed onto all Caldera chains – and hopefully all rollups on Ethereum – at the same time.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | ARB | TIA,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/24/calderas-rollup-in-a-box-platform-raises-15-million-from-peter-thiels-venture-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39fd61665947645004efa6e0c090ee3db1b495d9-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

D8X estimates that this will launch on mainnet in August.  D8X, a decentralized exchange (DEX) for crypto perpetuals said it's working on bringing leverage to Polymarket's prediction markets.  D8X launched on Polygon's zkEVM, a zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup scaling solution, in January this year after closing a $1.5 million pre-seed round in August 2023. It then expanded to OKX's X Layer in May and Arbitrum in June.  In an interview with CoinDesk, D8X co-founder Caspar Sauter explained that the system works through a mechanism that fetches spot prices from Polymarket using oracles, similar to traditional perpetual contract approaches, which use commodities prices.  Sauter believes leverage is important in prediction markets because it enhances trading efficiency and potential gains.  Leverage helps with risk management by allowing traders to hedge their positions more effectively.  Sauter explains that leverage enables users to ""temporarily hedge away uncertainty"" by taking positions that offset their existing bets, marrying their prediction market bets to existing crypto positions.  For example, if a trader holds a long position on a prediction market and becomes uncertain about the outcome, they can open a short position with leverage to mitigate potential losses.  ""You can use that for risk management purposes, which is also the key use case of these types of products in traditional finance.""  The wide availability of leverage has been a prior concern in crypto markets. In 2021, most major crypto exchanges pledged to reduce the leverage available, with many moving it down from 100x to 20x.  Sauter explained that with D8X, the maximum leverage available depends on the state of the market. This approach, he said, prevents destabilization by ensuring that leverage limits are in line with current market dynamics, thereby maintaining stability and preventing any single trader from disproportionately affecting liquidity.  After all, derivative markets are orders of magnitude larger than spot markets, Sauter says that introducing leverage could enhance market efficiency rather than deplete liquidity.  But for all this talk of market efficiency, in the end, leverage lets Polymarket's core traders, those with conviction, have a higher return on their beliefs, which is something that the market has been asking for.  ""You can use less capital to make a potential larger gain compared to what you can do on the spot side,"" he said. ""People that like to bet, and like to bet hard.""  D8X doesn't have an exact date for a mainnet launch of leveraged prediction market trading, but Sauter said they are targeting August.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | ARB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/24/crypto-exchange-d8x-to-bring-tool-for-trading-polymarket-contracts-with-leverage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24ddc938f49f5337e1700d5942e8ae53ce30e66f-1439x809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

JPMorgan noted that Riot will have the second-largest capacity of the U.S.-listed bitcoin miners.  The bank has an overweight rating on Riot stock with a $12 price target.  Riot Platform’s (RIOT) acquisition of rival bitcoin {{BTC}} miner Block Mining makes sense because it diversifies the company’s power supply and increases its capacity to over 2 gigawatts (GW), JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.  Riot will have the second-largest capacity among U.S. listed bitcoin miners following the acquisition, and the deal also “serves as the latest appraisal of undeveloped power assets,” analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.  Still, the announcement is surprising, given the expansion potential at Riot’s Corsicana site in Texas, the report said.  The Block Mining acquisition is not the company’s only attempt at M&A in recent months. Riot recently dropped a proposal to buy peer Bitfarms (BITF) and is looking to overhaul that target's board before engaging in further takeover attempts.  JPMorgan notes that the Block Mining deal will add 1 exahash per second (EH/s) to Riot’s hashrate, a measure of its computational power, and may contribute up to 16 EH/s by the end of 2025. The hashrate is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  The bank has an overweight rating on Riot shares with a $12 price target. Riot was trading 0.5% higher at $11.65 in early trading on Wednesday.  Broker Bernstein said Riot was best suited to consolidate the bitcoin mining sector, in a report in May.

In May 2024, AgriDex raised $5 million with investments from Endeavour Ventures, sub-Saharan African agricultural group African Crops and South African vineyard group Oldenburg Vineyard.  In recent times, real-world assets (RWAs) have become the buzz word in crypto, reflecting a global desire to see practical use cases emerging from blockchain and Web3. A report by CoinGecko found RWAs to be the second most profitable narrative in the first quarter of 2024.  AgriDex aims to bring more of their stock on-chain to reduce time taken to receive payments and transaction and remittance costs.

The token will reward users based on their past activity and fees paid.  DBR token holders will be able to vote on future strategies and implementations of the deBridge protocol.  Cross-chain transfer service deBridge plans to issue a governance token, DBR, on the Solana blockchain in the coming month, the project’s head of marketing told CoinDesk in a release on Wednesday.  Allocations will depend on points earned by users in the past several months based on the fees paid to the protocol and funds moved through it since April. DeBridge took a snapshot at 21:00 UTC on July 23. Snapshots are a record of a blockchain at a particular time and are used by projects to gauge usage and reward users.  DBR will allow holders to vote on future strategies and implementations of the deBridge protocol. The project has tentative plans to introduce staking features in the future.  Staking typically involves users locking up their tokens on a protocol or blockchain in exchange for a cut of fees. Cross-chain services allow users to transfer tokens between different blockchains, allowing for funds to be utilized on networks where they weren’t originally supported.  Data shows that deBridge is widely used to transfer funds between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana and Base, among other blockchains. Since April, it has recorded over 2.3 million transactions and $2 billion in bridged volume, which generated 1.4 billion points for users.  Once released, DBR will join the rising cohort of bridge tokens that are cumulatively worth over $2.2 billion as of Wednesday.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | SOL | TRADING | ARB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/24/cross-chain-service-debridge-to-issue-governance-token-completes-activity-snapshot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9b4f8339e0e120d8314a346a72d2882d23dc0be-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gox Selling Pressure Persists","This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin regained $66,000 following Tuesday's dip below $65,500, but ongoing Mt. Gox-related selling pressure has tempered chances of a sustained rally. Mt. Gox moved over $3 billion worth of BTC between different wallets, according to Arkham data. It ultimately sent $130 million to crypto exchange Bitstamp. There's an expectation that creditors will immediately sell their BTC on receipt, which is why the coin movements tend to weigh on bitcoin's price. BTC sits at around $66,500 at the time of writing, little changed from 24 hours ago. The wider crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) was also little changed.  Ether ETFs in the U.S. saw net inflows of around $107 million on their first day of trading, with volumes surpassing $1 billion. The BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) led with inflows of $266.5 million, followed by Bitwise's Ethereum ETF (ETHW) at $204 million. Total trading volume was around one-fifth the bitcoin equivalents experienced on their debut in January. Many market observers had speculated that volume and flow for the ETH ETFs would be underwhelming due to a lack of staking mechanism. Ether traded just below $3,500 during the Asian and European mornings, around 1.3% lower than 24 hours ago.  There are few bitcoin miners with the same power at their disposal as Iris Energy, Canaccord said in a report on Tuesday. “The company is building 510 MW of data centers in 2024, secured 2,160 MW of power capacity, and has a 1 GW plus development pipeline,” analysts wrote. The broker raised its target for the company to $15 from $12 while maintaining its buy rating. Iris Energy was trading 3% higher at $11.23 in pre-market trading on Nasdaq. Earlier this month, Iris shares slumped 14% after a short seller said its Childress, Texas site was not suitable for hosting AI or high-performance computing. ""We think management will be opportunistic in expanding the use case for its data centers beyond bitcoin mining and is well-prepared from a power, cooling, and network perspective,” Canaccord wrote.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows an annualized three-month basis in ETH futures, or the gap between futures and spot price prices.  Futures are currently trading at a significantly lower premium than in the first quarter.  That might demotivate the ""carry or basis traders,"" resulting in a weak uptake for the U.S.-listed spot ETH ETFs.  Spot BTC ETFs, which debuted in January, have been preferred by carry traders, who are looking to profit from price discrepancies between spot and futures markets.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  What Does Kamala Harris' (Presumptive) Nomination Mean for Crypto This Election?

Germany has recently offloaded an astounding 49,850 BTC within a few weeks. Executed across many exchanges including Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp, the transactions helped to reduce possible value loss. Related Reading: Chainlink Inches Closer To $18 Despite Bearish Pressure – Analyst Apparently, the German government started these sales because of worries about a notable drop in the value of Bitcoin. With the average price for a Bitcoin about $57,000, the total earnings came to a little over $2.8 billion. Fascinatingly, Germany lost out on an extra $400 million in possible gains while Bitcoin is presently valued at $66,425. Germany now only holds less than one BTC. Strategic Bitcoin Moves By The US Government? The US government has been making news with its own smart BTC moves as the dust settles following Germany’s huge Bitcoin sell-off. Blockchain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence found on July 22, 2024 a noteworthy transaction involving the movement of 58.742 BTC from a government wallet to Coinbase Prime Deposit. Valued at about $4 million, this move has generated interest and worries among the crypto community. The US’ possession of around 213,200 BTC, with a valuation of approximately $14.4 billion, consists mostly of assets confiscated from criminal entities. The seizure of 69,370 BTC from the notorious Silk Road case in August 2023 was the most publicized of these seizures. Adding to the intrigue is this most recent move, which comes after a previous transaction that took place on June 26 and saw the US government transferring 4,000 Bitcoin to the same Coinbase wallet. Some people are concerned that the United States may follow Germany’s example and begin a large sell-off as a result of these developments. Germany & US Bitcoin Moves: Market Effects Investors and market experts have not missed the significant changes governments have made on Bitcoin. Already, Germany’s sell-off illustrated the significant influence such policies may have on investor confidence and market stability. The worry of a comparable US government action has added even another level of uncertainty to the market.

These changes are causing reevaluation of investor tactics. Although some view the government sell-offs as a sign of caution, others view them as possibilities for market corrections.

42407793,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga5fsX,1721819426,Ether's BTC-Denominated Price Flirts With 9-Year-Long Trendline Support: Technical Analysis,"The area around the bullish trendline served as an accumulation zone in 2019-20.  A widely-tracked momentum indicator suggests downtrend exhaustion.  Ether's {{ETH}} bitcoin {{BTC}}-denominated market price, the ETH/BTC ratio, is flirting with a bullish trendline drawn from 2016 and 2017 lows, offering hope to bulls on the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  Since January, the trendline has consistently restricted the pair's downside in a pattern reminiscent of 2019-20. Back then, it served as an accumulation zone, eventually leading to a renewed bull market in the first half of 2021, as shown by a chart sourced from TradingView.  A monthly chart of moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and changes, favors continued defense of and renewed upswing from the trendline. The histogram has produced shallower bars below the zero line since December 2023, indicating a downtrend exhaustion.  Sophisticated traders, however, do not see ether outperforming bitcoin in the coming months. That's evident in Deribit's options market, where ether call options, or bullish bets, expiring in six months trade at a 5.5% premium to put options, or bearish bets. A slightly higher call premium is seen in bitcoin options, a sign of traders being extra bullish on BTC, according to Amberdata.  The continued bias for bitcoin stems from concerns that demand for ether spot ETFs, which debuted in the U.S. on Tuesday, will be weaker than for bitcoin ETFs and slow network activity on ETH's parent blockchain, Ethereum.  ""Market has already priced in this news as ETHBTC price has been in downtrending range since announcement in May,"" Pankaj Balani, CEO and co-founder of Delta Exchange, said in an email. ""The market is expecting lower inflows in ETH ETFs compared to inflows witnessed by BTC ETFs this year.

31469637,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631263,1721815256,Ethereum Price Flatlines As Spot ETF Launch Fails To Spark Rally: Full Recap,"The much-anticipated launch of several Ethereum-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to ignite a significant Ethereum (ETH) price rally. Despite considerable trading volumes and large inflows for the “newborn” ETFs on their first day, the Grayscale outflows have been too massive (once again) to propel the Ether price upwards. Ethereum ETFs Start Strong, But Grayscale … Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, shared via X (formerly Twitter), “DAY ONE in the books for Eth ETFs who did $1b in total volume, which is 23% of what the spot bitcoin ETFs did on their first day and ETHA did 25% of IBIT’s volume.” He also noted that “The gap between ETHE and The Newborn Eight is a healthy +$625m.” However, despite these healthy volumes, the price of Ethereum only increased marginally by 1% yesterday. At press time, ETH stood at $3,437, down 0.4% over the past 24 hours. In contrast, Bitcoin (BTC) price declined by 1.6%, and other altcoins also faced downward pressure, dropping between 4% and 10%. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stays Flat Despite Today’s ETF Debut: QCP Explains Why James Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF expert, commented the first day of inflows, “First full day of flows for the ETHness stakes are in. The Ethereum ETFs took in $107 million. BlackRock’s ETHA led the way with $266.5 million followed by Bitwise’s ETHW with $204 million. Very solid first day.” Despite these positive inflows, the day was not without its challenges. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which transitioned from a traditional trust to a spot ETF, saw substantial outflows amounting to $484.9 million, representing about 5% of the fund’s value. Eric Balchunas commented on this movement, “Damn. That’s a lot. Like 5% of the fund. Not sure The Eight newbies can offset w inflows at this magnitude. On flip side maybe its for best to just get it over with fast, like ripping a band aid off.” The introduction of these ETFs is part of a broader trend following the launch of similar Bitcoin ETFs in January, which also experienced a mix of inflows and significant outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The Ethereum Mini Trust, another Grayscale product, however, reported $15.2 million in new inflows. Related Reading: Ethereum Retraces: Here’s Why ETH Bulls Must Decisively Break Above $3,500 Other notable Ethereum ETFs like Franklin Templeton’s (EZET) and 21Shares’ Core Ethereum ETF (CETH) saw inflows of $13.2 million and $7.4 million, respectively, indicating varying levels of investor interest across different funds. Overall, the first day of trading for these Ethereum ETFs brought in significant volumes and a complex flow of funds but did not translate into a significant price rally for Ethereum. As with Bitcoin, the Grayscale outflows for Ethereum seem to need to be cleared out of the way before the ETFs could have a significant impact on the price. At press time, ETH traded at $3,442.

With the recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, that clarity is starting to take form. Former President Trump has already taken a pro-crypto stance publicly and will speak at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. When I last covered the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) in May, I rated the fund a ""hold."" Among a few other points, I highlighted the fact that transaction volume through platforms like Coinbase ( COIN ) has been primarily driven by institutional investors buying Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rather than retail investors in recent quarters. In my closing summary, I mentioned the regulatory environment as something to pay attention to as well: In my opinion, Bitcoin bulls can be patient and pick their spots to add to core positions. Crypto is quickly becoming a political issue in the United States, and I suspect asset managers may want more clarity on what the regulatory environment is going to look like in 2025 before adding too much more exposure to Bitcoin or any of the other ""blue chip"" digital assets in the market. Just two months later, we are starting to get some of that clarity, but not in the way that I had assumed back in May. Political Pivot Rather than certainty regarding who will be sworn in next year, we are instead seeing a softening from the current administration's regulatory apparatus, as evidenced by recent pivots from the United States Securities & Exchange Commission: In mid-July, the agency opted not to pursue an enforcement action against Paxos Global for issuing a Binance-branded stablecoin ( BUSD-USD ) about a year after serving the company a Wells Notice. More recently, the SEC approved spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs just weeks after approval seemed to be off the table for the foreseeable future. According to reporting from The Block , the recent pivot from the agency to the spot ETH products is attributable to a shift in political strategy. It is no mystery to those paying attention to 'Crypto Twitter' that there has been a noticeable movement toward former President and Republican Presidential Nominee Donald Trump this election cycle from many crypto supporters. Mark Cuban recently theorized that wealthy tech founders and investors are growing increasingly supportive of Trump due to possible deregulation of the industry and more pro-Bitcoin/crypto policy stances should Trump win in November. Beyond that, Trump's campaign has positioned him as the pro-crypto candidate, and he is reportedly planning to speak at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. As of article submission, there is now also a possibility that presumptive Democratic Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris may speak at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville as well. While I'm not going to speculate on Harris' crypto leanings one way or the other, I am of the view that the actions from the SEC this month are indicative of an administration that is aware it needs to appeal to younger voters. And pivoting from a combative stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to a more friendly one could potentially win back voters who have grown disgruntled with the SEC's track record of regulation by enforcement under Chair Gary Gensler. Rates and Deficits In my BITO article from May, I also made note of the difference between the current Bitcoin cycle and previous cycles. The largest of which is arguably the 5% risk-free rate on T-bills. That is still the case today, though the market believes the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in September. September Rate Probabilities (CME) The market is currently pricing in a 93.6% chance the Fed provides a 25 bps rate cut in September. While this is by no means a liquidity spigot that would rival ZIRP, there is a case to be made for BTC as a system-hedge asset similar to Gold or Silver. This may be an unpopular viewpoint with some readers, but my opinion on the fiscal side of things is the outcome of the election will probably not matter all that much if the last two decades are any guide: Data by YCharts We've seen both political parties spend and operate at a deficit while the federal debt outstanding quickly approaches $35 trillion, interest payments on that debt are going parabolic due to higher rates, and all with a debt to GDP ratio that has already eclipsed WW2 levels. Debt to GDP (Longtermtrends.net) In a world that lacks certainty, the US government continuing the spending spree at the expense of the currency's purchasing power seems about as safe a wager as any. Given this, it's perhaps interesting that the US Government still holds more than 213k BTC valued at $14.5 billion: US Gov Seized BTC (Arkham Intelligence) These are assets that were acquired through various dark web seizures over the years. Unlike Germany's recent purge of nearly 50k BTC seemingly without consideration for price, the United States has taken a far more nuanced approach to how it has sold seized BTC funds. To this point, the total stack has only been reduced by about 22k BTC in the last two years. None of this means the government will keep holding these assets. From where I sit, a coin dump from the federal government is clearly still a risk. But in an election cycle where both major party candidates may have a presence at Bitcoin 2024, I think aggressive selling of this BTC is much less likely than it may have been before politicians started openly courting the pro-crypto voting block. There Are Still Concerns Bitcoin itself has evolved through the years. Once an asset intended to be a medium of exchange, BTC has become more of a hoarded asset that benefits from a capped supply and diminishing emissions. Monthly DAUs vs Fees (Token Terminal) One could certainly take issue with the collapsing user base due in part to spiking transaction fees, pricing out a large cohort of on-chain wallet holders from regular usage. But if an investor takes the view that BTC is better served as a hedge against currency debasement, then BTC probably has a place in a balanced portfolio, even if it's through a spot ETF or just wagering on price via a futures ETF. Data by YCharts From the standpoint of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, there are certainly cheaper ways to get exposure to Bitcoin as an investable idea. The 0.95% expense ratio is higher than every spot ETF with the exception of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) due to the constant rollover of futures contracts. Furthermore, the fact that BITO pays out a monthly dividend looks attractive on the surface. But the total return of the fund in the 6 months since spot ETFs were approved has lagged those products by about 700 basis points. That's not insignificant and implies that BITO will underperform the spot funds over time. However, as a tradeable asset with over $2 billion in AUM and solid daily liquidity, BITO will work well for shorter to medium term speculation. Final Thoughts I'm calling BITO a buy today purely because it's a Bitcoin price proxy and I think Bitcoin's price is poised to go higher. We are at a very interesting crossroads in America, and 2024 is going to be remembered for a variety of reasons. What happened in Butler County, Pennsylvania, could have been much worse than it was. The sitting president is no longer seeking a second term. Debt is high, rates may have peaked, and the surest thing after death and taxes is arguably deficit spending in the US. This is all happening while at least one major party presidential candidate is openly courting the Bitcoin vote, and it's possible we'll see the other candidate do the same. Even the SEC is playing nicer than it was earlier this summer. I like buying Bitcoin directly or through the ETFs more than via futures ETFs, but if I'm right about BTC going up between now and the end of the year, BITO should do just fine as well.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4706056-bito-bitcoins-role-in-the-2024-election?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31469149.jpeg

Traders say price action will remain subdued until U.S. presidential candidates comment on cryptocurrency regulation.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke a 12-day inflow streak on Tuesday as investors withdrew a net $78 million from the U.S.-listed products, data from SoSoValue shows.  Bitwise’s BITB led with $70 million in net outflows, followed by Ark’s ARKB at $52 million and Grayscale’s GBTC at $27 million. BlackRock’s IBIT was the only product with a net inflow, $72 million, lifting its net assets under management above $22 billion for the first time.  The activity came as ether {{ETH}} ETFs went live, racking up $107 million in net inflows as trading volume topped $1 billion.  The bitcoin ETF outflows came after strong inflow days on Monday and Friday, when they took on more than $420 million each day.  Despite the outflows, BTC prices remained steady above $66,000, losing just over 0.5% in the past 24 hours. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the largest tokens, minus stablecoins, lost 0.6%.  Traders said they expect the current lull in price action to continue until fresh commentary from U.S. presidential candidates, which may shed light on the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the country.  ""The market is still awaiting a few key catalysts to take effect,” Alice Liu, research lead at CoinMarketCap, said in an email. “The market is in 'wait and see' mode ahead of Trump's speech at the Nashville Conference on July 25th, where it is anticipated that he may announce BTC to be used in the national reserves.”  “If this does happen, it will trigger a parabolic rise in Bitcoin's price,” Liu said.  Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast on Wednesday that “prices may remain subdued until momentum builds up leading to the elections” as sentiment was dented with the “potential selling pressure from the US Government and Mt Gox.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/24/bitcoin-etfs-break-inflow-streak-as-traders-look-to-trumps-nashville-appearance-for-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fea2f0bc34b29b7d09d13688e9e2a7bc780cd718-1012x569.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31467718,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631230,1721811648,Institutional Adoption Accelerates For Solana as Hamilton Lane Launches Blockchain-Native Fund,"In a move highlighting the growing intersection of traditional finance (TradFi) and blockchain technology, Hamilton Lane, one of the world’s largest asset managers, has announced the launch of a private credit fund on the Solana (SOL) blockchain. The fund, named Senior Credit Opportunities Fund (SCOPE), will now be accessible to investors through the Solana network, according to a recent report by Fortune. Institutional Fund Directly On The Solana Blockchain Hamilton Lane, which has over $290 billion in assets under management, has partnered with Libre, a Web3 protocol developed by Brevan Howard’s WebN Group and Nomura’s crypto firm Laser Digital to facilitate this initiative. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Witness Stellar Start As Trading Soars; Analyst Sees ETH’s Price Reaching $8,000 In Q4 According to Fortune, Libre will serve as the “backbone infrastructure,” enabling the issuance and distribution of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain. With this, Hamilton Lane aims to expand its distribution channels and reach a broader range of investors, including the “mass affluent” and crypto-native traders. Dr. Avtar Sehra, CEO and founder of Libre, emphasized that Solana’s “low latency and high throughput capabilities” make it an ideal network for tokenization. Interestingly, this move marks a significant milestone for the Solana ecosystem, as it is the first institutional fund to be launched directly on the blockchain, with the potential for more to follow as RWAs have been an increasing investment vehicle for institutional investors to capitalize on crypto technology over the past year. Financial Inclusion Through Tokenization? Hamilton Lane’s foray into blockchain technology is not entirely new, as the firm previously tokenized SCOPE and an equity fund using the digital securities issuance platform Securitize. Victor Jung, Head of Digital Assets at Hamilton Lane, expressed satisfaction with the inflows generated by these efforts. However, he heralded the launch of Solana as a critical step forward for the company, enabling the tokenization of collateralized lending. Jung said: This is for the decentralized finance natives. We believe that this is just a start of a portion of the financial asset class that will be available to a new audience with a different risk return profile. Related Reading: Dogecoin Falling Wedge Pattern: Crypto Analyst Predicts Breakout To $0.22 Similarly, proponents of these initiatives argue that the tokenization of financial assets will modernize and democratize conventional financial markets. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, for instance, has expressed his belief that the next step in the industry will involve tokenizing every stock and bond, envisioning a future where all financial assets reside on a unified ledger. While tokenized private credit has gained traction, Fortune reports that some challenges remain. Startups like Maple and Centrifuge have faced difficulties selling to crypto investors due to factors such as long lock-up periods and the varying risk appetite of this particular audience. Additionally, some crypto investors prefer higher returns offered by meme coins, which can overshadow the more modest returns from traditional assets over a longer time horizon. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $173, down nearly 5% in the 24-hour time frame, led by Tuesday’s broader market decline.

42417618,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZHq9,1721811285,Iren Is Positioned to Become One of the Biggest Listed Bitcoin Miners: Canaccord,"Canaccord raised its Iren share-price target to $15 from $12.  The bitcoin miner has ample power supplies and high-performance computing options, the report said.  Iren can monetize the infrastructure it is building for bitcoin mining, cloud computing and AI colocation, the broker said.  Iren (IREN) is positioned to become the most efficient and one of the biggest publicly listed bitcoin {{BTC}} miners, with options in high-performance computing (HPC) as it starts its pilot in Childress, Texas in the second half of the year, broker Canaccord said in a research report on Tuesday.  As the Sydney-based company, formerly known as Iris Energy, scales its business, there are very few bitcoin miners with the same amount of power at their disposal, the report said.  “The company is building 510 megawatts (MW) of data centers in 2024, secured 2,160 MW of power capacity, and has a 1 gigawatt (GW) plus development pipeline,” analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote.  The broker raised its share-price target for the company to $15 from $12 while maintaining its buy rating. Iren was trading 1.6% higher at $11.06 in early Wednesday trading on Nasdaq.  Mining stocks have rerated in recent months following Core Scientific’s (CORZ) artificial intelligence (AI) deal with cloud computing firm CoreWeave. This suggests that the market thinks AI and HPC opportunities could offer alternative and more accretive use cases for bitcoin mining sites, Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) said in a report last week.  Earlier this month, Iren shares slumped 14% after a short seller said the Childress site was not suitable for hosting artificial intelligence or high-performance computing. They are still priced well below the pre-slump level of almost $14.  Given that Iren is primarily an infrastructure company, “we think management will be opportunistic in expanding the use case for its data centers beyond bitcoin mining and is well-prepared from a power, cooling, and network perspective,” Canaccord wrote.  Bitcoin mining is a proven value proposition for Iren and also helps to pay for infrastructure build outs, the note said.  There are several ways the company can monetize the infrastructure it is building, “including bitcoin mining, AI cloud, and AI colocation,” the report added.

Miners face revenue challenges from the reduced block reward, especially if bitcoin’s price does not rise quickly, compounded by high electricity costs and the need for specialized hardware. The mining industry is adapting through mergers, improving operational efficiency, and diversifying revenue streams, with well-capitalized firms better positioned to thrive. By Christopher Gannatti, CFA & Blake Heimann We just passed the 20th of July 2024, and approximately 90 days have passed since the pivotal bitcoin halving event in April. As a reminder, when we say ""halving,"" we are referring to the reward paid to miners for correctly solving the proof-of-work algorithm. Roughly every four years, the bitcoin protocol specifies that the reward paid to miners is cut in half (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, etc.). Why is the block reward reducing? Well, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, so for that statement to be true, there needs to be a mechanism to create the new supply, but not to do so indefinitely, and to ultimately wind down as the system gets closer and closer to this level. While Bitcoin was flirting with all-time high price levels earlier in the year, nearing $74,000, it is clear that the near-term trend in the price of this asset has changed. The hypothesis: If there is less new supply coming online, but the demand remains at a similar level, then there is a rationale-as is the case with any commodity-for the supply/demand balance to exert upward pressure on the price. Historically, there has been significant price appreciation following halving events, but this has not been ""immediate."" We have seen three halving events so far, and we also caution any investor that the past is not an exact guide to the future-we recognize that we do not know with certainty what may happen after this fourth halving. Two of the last three halving events saw delayed price appreciation in bitcoin. In figure 1, there is a reason why the chart is showing the behavior of the bitcoin price over a period roughly 1,000 days post-halving, which would equate to something like 2.5 years. We do this predominantly in recognition that bitcoin's price volatility is very high, so looking at things over any short-term horizon makes it difficult to glean any worthwhile insights. Over the short term: Many different macroeconomic variables can influence the price of bitcoin. For example, in 2024, many riskier, more speculative assets are trading in a manner where prices appreciate when interest rates are expected to fall, and prices fall when interest rates are expected to rise. Over a longer time, the fact that bitcoin is known as a ""hard"" asset-meaning no entity can increase the supply on a whim-can have a bigger influence. We know that the supply of fiat currencies can be increased whenever the respective governments decide to do so-so the further printing of money plus the degree of debt and deficits currently employed by Western governments can have a bigger impact on driving bitcoin's price higher-but these details would likely have little to no influence in shorter time horizons. To keep things in context, bitcoin closed just under $67,000 on the halving date of April 20, not too far from the current price of $63,000 as of the time of writing. Figure 1: Bitcoin Price Performance Post Historical Halving Events Sources: Glassnode, WisdomTree, as of 6/26/24. Rebased to 1 in from halving date. The vertical red bar indicates where we are as of June 26, 2024. Each halving date is different, but the chart is measuring roughly 1,000 days after each halving event, except for the most recent, where we are limited only to what can be seen up to June 26, 2024. Bitcoin is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the potential for loss of the entire investment. An investment in bitcoin involves significant risks (including the potential for quick, large losses) and may not be suitable for all investors. Challenges for Miners Bitcoin is a network, and bitcoin miners perform an important function to secure the network and ensure its capability to run effectively as designed. If one is looking at bitcoin, one should also understand the basics in terms of how miners are incentivized. It is often reported that the bitcoin network requires a lot of electricity. It is the miners who are paying for that electricity in order to run specialized hardware designed to solve the bitcoin protocol, securing the network and creating the new blocks in the blockchain. In a sense, the electricity or energy is the cost, and the block reward is the revenue. A halving of the block reward for the general miner, all else being equal, means potentially less revenue per block mined. We say ""potentially"" because if bitcoin's price is appreciating quickly, the value of 3.125 bitcoin (the reward) can be higher. The number of bitcoin in the reward is constantly up until the next halving, but the price per bitcoin is not. On the other hand, the price of electricity is market-driven and largely dependent on where the mining operation is located. If bitcoin's price is not appreciating quickly and electricity is expensive, it is possible that the general miner, with a lower block reward, will see their profit margin compress or even disappear. This does not mean that miners immediately go out of business, but it is important to keep the general economics in mind as we all continue to watch how the market evolves. Post-Halving Mining Industry Developments May's bitcoin production saw a decrease compared to April due to the reduction in rewards resulting from the halving. Breaking this down in figure 2: Bitdeer ( BTDR ), Marathon Digital ( MARA ), Iris Energy ( IREN ), CleanSpark ( CLSK ), Bitfarms ( BITF ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and Terawulf ( WULF ) are all major mining operations. When we see that Bitdeer is associated with a -31%, this means that the supply of bitcoin that Bitdeer was able to mine in May 2024 relative to April 2024 was 31% lower. Each of the other numbers in figure 2 can be interpreted analogously. Figure 2: May 2024 Month-over-Month Production of Bitcoin (BTC) Sources: WisdomTree, Blockworks, https://blockworks.co/news/who-mined-most-btc-since-bitcoin-halving. These seven miners were shown due to data availability. Bitcoin is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the potential for loss of the entire investment. An investment in bitcoin involves significant risks (including the potential for quick, large losses) and may not be suitable for all investors. The miners are responding to the challenges that they are currently facing. Mergers and Acquisitions Activity: The sector is seeing increased M&A activity, best exemplified by Riot Platforms' attempted hostile takeover of Bitfarms. 1 This is arguing for the path of greater scale leading to a better ability for miners to weather the storm of greater pressure on their potential profit margins. Operational Efficiency Focus: Mining firms are investing in improved computing infrastructure to improve their hash rate , 2 increasing their chances of success in receiving block rewards. If we think of M&A activity leading to individual miners with bigger operations-more systems designed to generate those new blocks-then increasing the hash rate could be interpreted as getting more out of each piece of hardware. Diversification of Revenue Streams: Companies like Terawulf and Iris Energy are exploring new avenues, such as offering their computing infrastructure for AI model training, capitalizing on high demand in this sector.3,4 This is very interesting, recognizing that bitcoin mining is really just one application for an accelerated computing platform, and it could be interesting if certain firms can dial up or dial down their exposure to something like training AI models during times when this could be a better source of revenue than bitcoin mining. There is a notable divergence in performance within the mining space. Well-capitalized and efficient firms are better positioned to thrive in an increasingly competitive ecosystem. Those that have been nimble and quick to adjust to the changing market dynamics have so far outperformed their peers. In figure 3, we see how the miners shown in figure 2 have done in terms of share price performance over the past three months. Bitcoin mining company share price performance, we should note, can be extremely volatile, but we show these figures predominantly to emphasize that different miners have been able to respond differently to a challenging set of circumstances. Figure 3: Three-Month Share Price Performance of Respective Bitcoin Miners Source: Bloomberg, as of 6/26/24. These seven minders were shown due to data availability. Bitcoin is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the potential for loss of the entire investment. An investment in bitcoin involves significant risks (including the potential for quick, large losses) and may not be suitable for all investors. Conclusion As we navigate the post-halving landscape, consider a long-term perspective. Historical patterns suggest that significant price appreciation may not be immediate but has tended to evolve over several months following the halving event. Bitcoin's deflationary nature and transparent monetary policy make it a compelling, in our opinion, with each halving event presenting an opportunistic entry point into the asset class due to the supply constraints it introduces, which has historically led to upward pricing pressure over the course of the following two-and-a-half years. As a result of this event, the bitcoin mining industry is adapting, with efficient and innovative firms poised for growth ahead, amidst increased pressure from reduced bitcoin block rewards. While patience is required in the short term, the long-term prospects for bitcoin and the mining sector remain promising.

Crypto assets are frequently referred to as crypto ""currencies,"" but they typically operate without central authority or banks, are not backed by any government or issuing entity (i.e., no right of recourse), have no government or insurance protections, are not legal tender and have limited or no usability as compared to fiat currencies. Federal, state or foreign governments may restrict the use, transfer, exchange and value of crypto assets, and regulation in the U.S. and worldwide is still developing. Crypto asset exchanges and/or settlement facilities may stop operating, permanently shut down or experience issues due to security breaches, fraud, insolvency, market manipulation, market surveillance, KYC/AML (know your customer/anti-money laundering) procedures, noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations, technical glitches, hackers, malware or other reasons, which could negatively impact the price of any cryptocurrency traded on such exchanges or reliant on a settlement facility or otherwise may prevent access or use of the crypto asset. Crypto assets can experience unique events, such as forks or airdrops, which can impact the value and functionality of the crypto asset. Crypto asset transactions are generally irreversible, which means that a crypto asset may be unrecoverable in instances where: (i) it is sent to an incorrect address, (ii) the incorrect amount is sent or (iii) transactions are made fraudulently from an account. A crypto asset may decline in popularity, acceptance or use, thereby impairing its price, and the price of a crypto asset may also be impacted by the transactions of a small number of holders of such crypto asset. Crypto assets may be difficult to value, and valuations, even for the same crypto asset, may differ significantly by pricing source or otherwise be suspect due to market fragmentation, illiquidity, volatility and the potential for manipulation. Crypto assets generally rely on blockchain technology, and blockchain technology is a relatively new and untested technology that operates as a distributed ledger. Blockchain systems could be subject to internet connectivity disruptions, consensus failures or cybersecurity attacks, and the date or time that you initiate a transaction may be different than when it is recorded on the blockchain. Access to a given blockchain requires an individualized key, which, if compromised, could result in loss due to theft, destruction or inaccessibility. In addition, different crypto assets exhibit different characteristics, use cases and risk profiles.

31465657,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631218,1721808024,Ethereum ETFs Launch About To Kickstart The Altseason? Analysts Weigh In,"The long-awaited Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are finally live, registering over $100 million in volume in the first 15 minutes. Investors expect to see the launch’s impact on the crypto market, while some market watchers believe ETH ETF’s performance will kickstart the Altcoin season. Related Reading: PolitiFi Memecoin Shakeout: BODEN Plummets 55% While KAMA Skyrockets 150% Following Biden Dropout Ethereum Spot ETFs Are Officially Live On Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the final nod to Ethereum spot ETFs, setting the launch date for Tuesday, July 23. After the approval, investors raised the alarm following some online reports. Per Whale Alert, Grayscale has transferred $1 billion in ETH to Coinbase Institutional. This led many investors to fear that the digital asset manager’s transaction would add selling pressure to the asset and affect its price performance ahead of the launch. However, ETF expert Eric Balchunas offered some relief to investors after pointing out that Grayscale didn’t move the tokens to dump them. The firm transferred the 292,262 Ethereum “from $ETHE to its mini-me = $ETH.” Balchunas considers it “a new variable in this race that we didn’t have in the btc race.” The initial numbers have been released now that the highly anticipated products are live. Balchunas shared on X that the Ethereum ETFs saw $112 million in the first 15 minutes of trading. This number increased to $361 million total after 90 minutes. The Bloomberg expert praised the volume, calling it a “solid showing” regardless of being 20-25% of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs numbers. Despite the healthy performance, ETH remains hovering between the $3,440 and $3,540 price range. Are ETH And Altcoins About To Take Off? Ahead of the launch, some market watchers anticipated that the ETFs’ performance could kickstart an upswing for Altcoins. According to several analysts, the Altcoins chart shows similarities to the 2016-2017 performance, suggesting that the Altseason is “brewing.” To Crypto Jelle, “Altcoins are still following the traditional bull market preparation playbook.” Per the macro chart, altcoins broke from the accumulation zone and chopped around key support levels during previous cycles. The “pre-bull market consolidation” was followed by a take-off that propelled cryptocurrency prices to new highs. Jelle pointed out altcoins are currently in the consolidation zone, similar to past cycles. He also suggested a new take-off “shouldn’t take long” after Ethereum ETFs’ launch. Crypto trader MikyBull also highlighted the similarities between the previous cycles, which suggest that a “huge Altseason is brewing.” To the trader, the recent “fake out” made investors believe that this cycle’s Altseason “has been written off,” but he expects altcoins to “pull a 2017 kind of explosive” rally that follows the same PA path. The trader considers Ethereum’s price might be positively affected by ETH spot ETFs. This performance will be the primary driver for the “huge rally in the coming months.” Additionally, he set a band price target of $10,000 for ETH. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stays Flat Despite Today’s ETF Debut: QCP Explains Why Other market watchers suggested that investors must remain serene if a price drop occurs. Pseudonym analyst and trader Moustache called for patience as “it’s only a matter of time.” “Ethereum chart looks like it did in the last cycle, just before the Altcoin bull market started,” he added. As of this writing, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $3,419, a 1.1% decline in the last 24 hours.

42417632,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZI3Z,1721805219,Bitcoin Bulls Beware as 'Doctor Copper' Slides Against Gold,"The Copper-to-gold ratio has tanked to lowest since November 2020, offering bearish cues to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The sliding ratio also means lower interest rates ahead.  Suppose you have been following the crypto market for some time. In that case, you might have heard market participants say that the debut of bitcoin {{BTC}} spot ETFs in the U.S. has unlocked mainstream demand worth billions of dollars, setting the cryptocurrency on a long-term bullish trajectory.  However, traders should recognize that the expected billions are still dependent on economic developments. Hence, traders need to pay close attention to critical macro indicators like the copper-to-gold ratio. The ratio is falling fast, a negative sign for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The ratio, representing the division of the market price per pound of copper by the per ounce price of gold, has dropped over 8% this month, reaching the lowest since November 2020, according to data tracked by TradingView and MacroMicro.  Demand for copper, a metal deeply embedded in the manufacturing sector, is closely tied to industrial activity. Hence, the metal is widely called ""Doctor Copper,"" a proxy for economic health and investor risk appetite. Meanwhile, gold is considered a haven.  As such, their relative valuation reflects investors' appetite for risk and growth-sensitive assets like technology stocks and bitcoin relative to havens like gold and Treasury notes. Traditional market giants like DoubleLine Funds are known to track the ratio for cues about demand for risk assets.  ""The ratio of copper to gold rises as the global economy expands, and the stocks rise, too. When economic uncertainties increase, demand for gold for hedging rises, and copper-to-gold declines,"" the data tracking website MacroMicro said in the chart explainer.  In a nutshell, bitcoin could see downside volatility if the falling copper-to-gold ratio is a guide.  Lower interest rates ahead  Historically, the sliding copper-to-gold ratio has portended a renewed downward trajectory in interest rates, more specifically, the 10-year Treasury yield, or the so-called risk-free rate, according to Double Line Capital.  According to Morningstar, the U.S. Federal Reserve's benchmark interest is expected to fall from the present 5.35% to 5.5% range to 4.75%- 5.00% at the end of 2024, 3.00%- 3.25% at the end of 2025, and 1.75%- 2.00% by the end of 2026.  So, bitcoin and risk assets could find their footing once the initial shock from potential economic weakness signaled by the copper-told-ratio is priced in. Low interest rates eventually trigger search for yields and renewed inflow of money into risk assets, as observed following the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/24/bitcoin-bulls-beware-as-doctor-copper-slides-against-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab5ba024c1ed5e346c78b3aef4ea9bdbfed37951-1278x719.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

His analysis, noted for its depth and precision, provides a balanced view with three bullish and bearish indicators that could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory shortly. Related Reading: Bullish on Bitcoin: Glassnode’s Latest Indicators Point to ‘Growing Optimism’ What are The Bullish Bitcoin Signals? Willy Woo pointed out one of the most significant bullish indicators is the end of miners’ capitulation. This is a classic indication of an imminent bullish scenario that has worked well in the past. According to Woo, the Bitcoin hash rate (the computational power used in mining and processing transactions) is surging back. This resurgence occurred concurrent with new mining hardware, such as M66s and S21 Pros, beginning their operations. These developments allow miners to do more with less, positively impacting BTC price and profit. Woo added: Puell Multiple measures miners relative profit to past revenues. It’s a 1-2 punch macro signal. 1) Macro bottoms happen when profitability is at a minimum 2) A signal bottom happens when BTC halving cuts miner earnings by 50%, leading to the proper bull run. We are at (2). Miners will be making good money from here. Publicly listed miner stocks should breakout. Now is a good time to buy into mining. Accompanying these trends is the rise in global liquidity, which further underpins market optimism. In times of increased money supply, sectors like Traditional Finance (TradFi) will allocate to risk-on assets such as Bitcoin. Preliminary signs suggest a breakout in this department, paving the way for larger investment inflows into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This setup can offer plenty of space for any value appreciation within Bitcoin while attracting investors from more traditional markets to the crypto sphere. The Bearish Signals However, it’s not all clear skies ahead. Willy Woo also pointed out some pretty chilling bearish signals in his analysis. Of particular note has been a large increase in Bitcoin flowing into spot exchanges – a phenomenon commonly seen before sell-offs. A particular point of interest is the 50,000 BTC recently transferred to the Kraken exchange from Mt. Gox, which may be part of an imminent dump. Moreover, there is also the launch issue for an Ethereum spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Related Reading: Last Week’s Crypto Inflows Surge to $1.35 Billion: Which Digital Asset Led the Charge? According to Woo, this event is a potentially bearish development for Bitcoin, as it could temporarily siphon away some of the capital from various Bitcoin spot ETFs into Ethereum. Regardless, Willy Woo concludes his analysis on an optimistic note. Woo stated: In summary we have a tug-o-war happening on demand and supply. IMO the bullish factors overpower the bearish factors. In the short term BTC only needs to break 73k in order to light the fuse to short squeeze to 77k, above that it’s nothing holding it down for price discovery.

TRX is outperforming Bitcoin and could rise further above $0.1350. Tron is moving higher above the $0.1300 resistance level against the US dollar. The price is trading above $0.1320 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1330 on the hourly chart of the TRX/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to climb higher toward $0.1380 or even $0.1420. Tron Price Eyes Fresh Increase Recently, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw a fresh decline below $66,500 and $3,500 respectively. However, Tron price remained stable above the $0.1300 support and climbed higher. There was a decent move above the $0.1320 resistance zone. TRX price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1371 swing high to the $0.1311 low. The price is now trading above $0.1320 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1330 on the hourly chart of the TRX/USD pair. The pair is signaling more upsides unless there is a move below $0.1320. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $0.1350 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1371 swing high to the $0.1311 low. The first major resistance is near $0.1358, above which the price could accelerate higher. The next resistance is near $0.1380. A close above the $0.1380 resistance might send TRX further higher toward $0.1400. The next major resistance is near the $0.1420 level, above which the bulls are likely to aim for a larger increase toward $0.1450 in the near term. Are Dips Supported in TRX? If TRX price fails to clear the $0.1350 resistance, it could start a downside correction below the 100-hourly simple moving average. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1335 zone. The first major support is near the $0.1320 level, below which it could test $0.1310. Any more losses might send Tron toward the $0.1300 support in the coming sessions. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for TRX/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for TRX/USD is currently above the 50 level.

42417637,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZI7h,1721795700,What Does Kamala Harris' (Presumptive) Nomination Mean for Crypto This Election?,"Vice President Kamala Harris is now the presumptive Democratic Party nominee for President of the United States, after President Joe Biden abruptly announced he was withdrawing from the race. With her ascent to the top of the party ticket comes questions about how a potential Harris Administration might differ from the Biden Administration's approach to crypto.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Vibe shift  The narrative  Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee for president after President Joe Biden announced he would no longer seek the seat led to a definite vibe shift. ActBlue, a Democrat-focused fundraising service, reported $160 million in inflows since Biden announced he would be stepping down according to an open-source tracker, while Harris's campaign said it received $81 million by Monday afternoon.  Why it matters  For the crypto industry, the real question is whether and how much Harris diverges from Biden, and how she might contrast with former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump. Harris has been the presumptive nominee for less than a day, and it's only been about two days since she took over the campaign, so it's really hard to say just yet. What is clear is that there is a possibility for a reset of sorts – entrepreneur Mark Cuban told Politico the Harris campaign has expressed interest in crypto (among other issues), while David Bailey of Bitcoin Magazine said the campaign is considering speaking at BTC Nashville later this week.  Breaking it down  While it is difficult to assess how presidential nominee Kamala Harris might approach crypto, the mere fact that she's now the new standard bearer for her party suggests the crypto industry can take a new approach toward the 2024 election.  ""You play the hand that you're dealt, and now we have a new set of cards,"" said Sheila Warren, the CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, an industry interest group.  It's unlikely that Harris will pivot the Democratic campaign to being immediately and overtly appealing to crypto, but multiple people tell me that her taking over the campaign will be a reset.  A Congressional staffer told CoinDesk that the new campaign provides ""an opportunity to reset,"" pointing out that industry groups have already written open letters to the campaign and Democratic Party about crypto.  And, in their view, the new campaign may be more receptive to these issues.  Something both the staffer and Warren pointed out is Harris being from California implies she may already be more comfortable with technology and related issues.  ""She is certainly not unfamiliar with the importance of technology, it's critical in her state,"" Warren said. ""She's a person who has markedly always been open to thoughtful arguments.""  Harris' pick for vice president will also be telling. Many of the names currently in the mix – including Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly or Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg – are ""pretty pro business for the most part,"" Warren said. Harris choosing anyone in that mold would be a meaningful move.  This isn't a one-sided conversation. Industry groups and individuals have already drafted open letters to the Democratic Party and Harris' campaign specifically, asking for less ""hostility"" toward the crypto industry.  ""We urge you to sit down with leaders in the digital asset and blockchain industry to discuss policies that support and nurture this technology. Open dialogue with industry experts will provide valuable insights and help craft policies that encourage growth while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability,"" one such letter from the Digital Chamber read.

What Traders Need to Know,"Amid rising institutional engagement in Bitcoin, a sharp spike in exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows over the past few days has sparked interest from traders and analysts alike. Earlier today, a noteworthy analysis from the popular trader Skew on social platform X highlighted a potential risk for Bitcoin amidst its current influx of capital. Skew pointed out the phenomenon he dubs the “headline curse,” noting that while the significant inflow of over $500 million into United States spot Bitcoin ETFs signifies growing institutional confidence, it may also foreshadow a looming price correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Could Be On The Verge Of a 30% Gain, Here’s Why Record High Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Market Shifts The recent resurgence in popularity for Bitcoin ETFs, particularly spotlighted by the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which alone saw $526 million in inflows on June 22, brings with it a history of similar occurrences that often led to price sell-offs. Bitcoin ETF Flow (US$ million) – 2024-07-22 TOTAL NET FLOW: 533.6 (Provisional data) IBIT: 526.7 FBTC: 23.7 BITB: ARKB: 0 BTCO: 13.7 EZBC: 7.9 BRRR: 0 HODL: -38.4 BTCW: 0 GBTC: 0 DEFI: 0 For all the data & disclaimers visit:https://t.co/4ISlrCgZdk — Farside Investors (@FarsideUK) July 23, 2024 Skew emphasized that such high inflow days usually correspond to market supply zones, where sellers historically start moving back into the markets looking for price weakness. This spike in inflows represents a critical juncture for the cryptocurrency, potentially setting the stage for either a bullish continuation or a bearish retreat, depending on several market factors that Skew outlined. Skew further proposed in the analysis that sustaining the current bullish momentum hinges on a few key indicators. These include a consistent passive spot bid, which involves limiting spot buyers capitalizing on price dips, and the ability of spot takers to continue bidding through existing spot supply, which is necessary to breach the five-month supply barrier. Additionally, the absorption of sellers plays a crucial role; it is a fundamental aspect that needs to be addressed to reach new all-time highs. Although the influx of funds into Bitcoin is a sign of positivity, Skew points out that it will test the market’s ability at these crucial levels to keep demand strong and absorb selling pressure. Another large inflow day👇$BTC As bullish as this is each other time IBIT reported mid – high 9 fig inflow days it occurred around market supply zones somewhat a headline curse lol So in terms of actually trading this, the obvious part is now does the market sustain this… https://t.co/qdGwMAvVjl pic.twitter.com/iZ921tpKHW — Skew Δ (@52kskew) July 23, 2024 Impending Sell Pressure Speaking of sell pressure, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence recently revealed that the US government has transferred $3.96 million from the seized Bitcoin to Coinbase.

The analyst explained why the crypto token will still rise to as high as $150 in this bull run. Why XRP Is Still On Course To Reach $150 Marks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that XRP looks right on the brink of a “massive bullish breakout,” having recently tested one. He claimed that XRP could successfully achieve this bullish breakout with such continued market strength. He added that this successful breakout and a Full Logarithmic Follow-Through would allow the crypto token to enjoy a price rally of over 41,400% and reach and even climb above $150. Related Reading: Don’t Get Shaken Out, Analyst Says Bitcoin And Altcoins Rally Is Just Starting Marks has continued to predict that XRP can reach such heights for a while based on his Full Logarithmic Follow-Through analysis. Before now, he mentioned that XRP could rise to as high as $200 and noted that such a parabolic rally was indeed possible for the crypto token since it has done it before during the 2017 bull run. Marks has also received support from other analysts like CryptoBull, who have predicted that XRP will rise to triple digits. CryptoBull once predicted that the crypto token could rise to $154 based on an ascending broadening wedge, which he expects XRP to break out from soon enough. Crypto analyst JackTheRippler also predicted that XRP will rise to triple digits when the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple ends. In a more recent analysis, JackTheRippler asserted that a new all-time high (ATH) was on the horizon. He stated that XRP’s multi-year bullish pattern is ending and suggested that it won’t be long before the crypto token enjoys that rally that will see it surpass its current ATH. The crypto analyst is also bullish on XRP because he believes the case between the SEC and Ripple is about to end. About To Break Out Of Six-Year Consolidation Triangle Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also recently offered a bullish narrative for XRP, stating that the crypto token is about to break out of the six-year consolidation triangle. The analyst claimed the breakout will be “massive,” followed by a “long sustained enormous rally.” He hinted at his plans to invest in XRP, remarking that he won’t be sidelined for the upcoming move. Mikybull Crypto previously mentioned that XRP might replicate its 2017 rally, considering its current price action path. He stated that the crypto token could rise above $4 if it follows a similar path to 2017. Related Reading: Polygon Network Active Addresses Just Hit A New Yearly High, But Why Is MATIC Price Down? Meanwhile, crypto analyst Alex Clay also echoed a sentiment similar to Mikybull Crypto, stating that XRP is breaking out of a symmetrical triangle that it has been consolidating inside for about 2,275 days. The analyst expects XRP to rise to between $1.2 and $1.5 in the mid-term, while he predicts that the crypto token could rise to $3 in the long term.

However, there is good news: While ARB holders “suffer” in the face of unrelenting bears, positive on-chain developments reveal a platform that is not only the largest by total value locked (TVL) but also brimming with potential. Over 48% Of Ethereum Bridged Assets End Up In Arbitrum Taking to X, one analyst notes a surge in user activity on Arbitrum and that the platform leads across multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). Related Reading: Analyst Says Solana Price Will Surge 1,000% To $1,800, Here’s When Of importance, the analyst observed that though there are other Ethereum layer-2 solutions to choose from, including Base–which is backed by one of the world’s largest exchanges, Coinbase, and Optimism, over 48% of all assets bridged from the mainnet find their way into Arbitrum. Having users opt for Arbitrum, and not Base or other competitors, is a huge confidence boost. It also indicates its technical ability to address scaling challenges plaguing the mainnet. Beyond this dominance, the analyst, citing Token Terminal data, also notes that Arbitrum, as mentioned, reigns supreme regarding TVL. According to on-chain asset flow from the blockchain analytics platform, Aave, a lending and borrowing platform, is the major contributor. At the same time, Arbitrum is the most active network, looking at the number of daily active addresses. Gauging from activity levels, the analyst notes that Arbitrum is even more busy than the mainnet. Interestingly, while activity could be a factor to consider, Arbitrum, the analyst also said, leads other layer-2s in the number of unique token holders. It indicates that layer 2s also lead in depth and breadth, indicating high engagement. Will ARB Rise After Falling By 68% In 7 Months Considering these impressive on-chain statistics, it remains to be seen when ARB will recover. The token dropped by 68% in seven months. The token remains under immense selling pressure and is a shadow of its former self. As Ethereum recovers, ARB could follow suit. Platform-led initiatives will also support the token. For instance, the team recently launched the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) to accelerate the building and deployment of GameFi platforms in its ecosystem.

This has been a multi-year process for the custodian, but will be well worth it as regulation is the future, its CEO Alessio Quaglini said in an interview.  Crypto custodian Hex Trust announced on Wednesday that it has received in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for a Major Payment Institution license.  Major Payment Institution licenses allow firms in Singapore to conduct multiple payment services and deal with Digital Payment Tokens (DPTs). The licensing regime was created under the Payment Services Act of 2019, and was updated in April 2024 to include custodial services for DPTs.  MAS' license has been one of the gold standards for crypto licenses in Asia, with many major crypto firms vying for it, such as BitGo and Ripple.  Alessio Quaglini, the CEO and co-founder of Hex Trust told CoinDesk in an interview that the space for unlicensed crypto entities operating in a gray area is shrinking, and licensure is an eventuality for any serious player in the industry.  ""Companies, at a certain point, very soon, will really need to make a choice. Do I want to be on the white part of the spectrum, in the right, obtain all the licenses, and operate a completely regulated business? Or do I want to be on the other side of the spectrum, outside of regulation?"" he said during an interview with CoinDesk.  Quaglini said that getting to this stage in MAS' licensing process was a multiyear process that began in 2020. Despite the expense and effort required, it's well worth it for the firm.  ""The commitment for us is clear. We want to be on the right side of the spectrum. We are committed. We want to be compliant. We want to get the licenses in the key jurisdictions,"" he said.  This announcement follows Hex Trust's recent success in expanding its licenses in Dubai, which now permits its markets arm to offer comprehensive Virtual Asset services, including acting as a broker-dealer and regulated Staking Services, it said in a release.
