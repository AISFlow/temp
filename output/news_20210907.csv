Randell believes these marketing campaigns towards cryptocurrencies are getting out of control, leading to irreversible problems. Regarding Ethereum Max, Randell clarifies that the crypto was developed a month before the promotion and had only speculative purposes in its value. However, Randell adds that he does not have enough evidence to charge the token as a scam.

New crypto investors should get into context about Solana and its huge influx in prices. Although the crypto looked vulnerable and would not reach an attractive value at its creation, it could surprise most speculators.

While there is no significant indication that price can only go downward from here, the price volatility swirling in a wide range of $26 to $38 is a cause for concern. With this uncertainty, it is hard to predict whether an upward extension is on the cards or a downturn reversal.

42412073,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otdByC,1631055896,Who Are the Main Opponents and Supporters of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law?,"El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law establishing the world’s most popular cryptocurrency as legal tender faces a host of opposition within the country and beyond, while at the same time garnering plenty of support outside its borders.  One of the fiercest opponents of bitcoin is the country’s most important leftist party, FMLN, which in June filed a lawsuit before the Supreme Court of Justice arguing the law is unconstitutional.  The creator and main proponent of the law is El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, who founded and heads Nueva Ideas, a center-right political party.  FMLN parliamentary coordinator Jaime Guevara said the reason for filing the lawsuit was the public’s “resounding rejection” of the bitcoin law, based on polls showing that 65% of Salvadorans surveyed were against the bill.  Indeed, from the time the Law passed through now, Bukele has had to face several populist demonstrations against it in the streets. The most recent one occurred on Tuesday, the day the law was enacted, with an estimated 1,000 people marching in San Salvador, according to Reuters. Protesters burned a tire and set off fireworks in front of the Supreme Court building.  FMLN’s lawsuit went unanswered and on Sept. 5, the FMLN filed the lawsuit again, calling the bitcoin law unconstitutional and lacking support.  Meanwhile, on Tuesday, El Salvador’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry asked its 200+ members – 90% of which are small and medium-sized businesses – not to use bitcoin because of its volatility.  “There is not a single person I have talked to that tells me they are going to keep the bitcoins. Everyone is going to seek to convert them to dollars immediately and deposit them in a bank in the financial system,” said Jorge Hasbún, president of the Chamber, in a Twitter space organized by local newspaper elsalvador.com.  “The recommendation we are giving to the members is that, understanding their profile and their business model, they should not think about speculating with the money they need for payroll and to pay bills. They should transfer it to dollars because they pay salaries in dollars and that is the way it should be and should continue to be done,” Hasbún added.  Bukele’s plan has also faced opposition at the regional level. Before the law was implemented, the Guatemala-based Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (ICEFI) argued that it should be repealed.  Ricardo Castaneda, ICEFI’s coordinator for El Salvador and Honduras, said on Sept. 2 that adequate time should be taken to conduct technical studies on the implications of adopting the law.  “From the ICEFI, we consider that the best thing to do is to repeal it,” Castaneda said.  At a global level, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was one of the heavyweights that expressed its concerns with the Bitcoin Law after it was passed, issuing a statement in June that “adoption of bitcoin as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues that require very careful analysis.”  The IMF added that it was “following developments closely and will continue our consultation with authorities.”  The IMF warned more recently, saying the law could add to bitcoin’s price volatility. Bukele cheekily thanked the organization for providing an opportunity for El Salvador to buy more bitcoin at a discount on Tuesday.  “Thanks for the dip @IMFNews. We saved a million in printed paper,” Bukele tweeted after El Salvador bought 150 more bitcoins following the drop in its price.  Support for Bukele  Much of the support for El Salvador’s plan has come from bitcoin enthusiasts outside the country.  One of the supporters is Jack Mallers, CEO of payments platform Stripe, when he announced Bukele’s bitcoin plan in June at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami. Mallers said then his company was working with Bukele to implement the plan.  “As of now, El Salvador is set to be the first bitcoin country,” Mallers said at the time, “and the first country to make bitcoin legal tender and treat it as a world currency and have bitcoin on their reserves.”  Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, which has been amassing huge amounts of bitcoin on its balance sheet, said in June that what is happening in El Salvador “is the future model of the 21st century digital economy.”  At the institutional level, the Honduras-based Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) began working with El Salvador to assist it in the implementation of bitcoin as a legal tender.  El Salvador’s decision is something “innovative that creates many spaces and opportunities,” CABEI’s president, Dante Mossi, said at then, adding that a technical advisory group was going to be created.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/07/who-are-the-main-opponents-and-supporters-of-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88a71d02157a6bbe448b823aee3aed642d97b998-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The digital asset has hit multiple new all-time highs as the rally raged on. Only now slowing down but still well above its last all-time high set in May of this year. The slowdown has seen the price of the asset lose its footing over $3, causing it to crash down below $2.70 for the first time in over a week. This loss of momentum has led the market to believe that the asset might be nearing the end of its rally. But not everyone thinks so. Analyst Jason Pizzino has predicted that the altcoin still has a bit of fight left in it, predicting a 290% move before the end of this current bull cycle. An increase of this magnitude would put the price of ADA at nothing less than $7, solidifying its claim as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The Theory Behind The Prediction Jason Pizzino took to his YouTube channel to share his prediction with his over 200K subscribers. The prediction completely rests on the back of a single theory, the Elliott Wave theory. A theory that predicts the future price action of an asset by looking at extremes in investor psychology which comes in waves. So this is basically looking at investing patterns of the market.

According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin&apos;s slump from Monday accelerated as the crypto failed to hold its $50,000 price level — sliding from $51,000 to $44,700 within a single hour. The sudden sell-off resulted in $1.44 billion in futures liquidations of Bitcoin trades in the past 24 hours, according to data from ByBt. The single largest reported liquidation occurred on Huobi-BTC — worth $43.7 million at the time. As expected, the vast majority of the liquidations were longs, representing about 88% of the total liquidations. Since dropping to weekly lows, the price of Bitcoin rebounded up to as high as $47,500. At press time, BTC is hovering at $46,500 across major exchanges Binance, Coinbase, and Huobi.

42421043,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBLDh,1631048248,"As El Salvador Enacts Bitcoin Law, Locals Remain Confused About Implementation","El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law takes effect today – and yet, many locals still don’t know how the cryptocurrency works or how they’ll be able to use it.  El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law stipulates that bitcoin must be accepted as a form of payment everywhere in the country. The nation’s legislature passed the bill shortly after President Nayib Bukele introduced it three months ago, but it’s unclear just how much effort the government has put into preparing its populace for the law to take effect.  Jessica Dominguez, the owner of a flower kiosk in San Salvador, said she has not yet had the time to learn about the matter.  “However, in due course I am willing to use bitcoin,” she said, adding that clients have already offered to pay with bitcoin.  Francisco, who asked that his full name not be cited, runs a laundromat in Sensuntepeque, a town located 83 kilometers from San Salvador, and said his business has not yet made arrangements to receive payments in bitcoin.  “In case you need to charge with bitcoin, we will do it with the wallet of a person who works in the establishment,” said Francisco, saying that his interpretation of the law means businesses are required to have the app, despite Bukele saying in mid-August it was not necessary to have one.  “One thing is what the president says, and another is what the law establishes,” he said.  A branch of the hardware store chain Disensa, located in San Salvador, told CoinDesk that for the moment there is a total lack of knowledge about using bitcoin.  “Nobody knows how it will be acted upon. Neither the banks nor the suppliers know anything about it,” an employee said.  In the mass retail sector, the adoption process seems to be different. A branch of Almacenes Siman, a leading retail chain, told CoinDesk that bitcoin will be implemented as a payment method, although there is no definite starting date. One of the branches of Súper Selectos, a supermarket chain, also told CoinDesk that it will use and accept bitcoin.  Then there is the coastal area of El Salvador known as Bitcoin Beach, where there has been more of a willingness to use cryptocurrency among businesses and local residents.  An example of that trend is Olas Permanentes, a beach site in El Zonte that includes a hotel and restaurant managed by Carlos Ortiz Novoa.  “We have been using bitcoin for more than a year now and have had very good additional income through it,” Ortiz Novoa told CoinDesk.  Widespread uncertainty  Bukele’s proposal has generated too much uncertainty, according to Francisco.  “I think having established bitcoin as legal tender has not been a good idea. There are too many variables that are intended to be controlled, and that never ends well. The idea should have matured more,” Francisco added.  However, some people already see the benefits of bitcoin for sending remittances to the country, one of the reasons why El Salvador was pushing for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization to become legal tender along with the U.S. dollar.  Jose Santaneco, a Los Angeles-based Salvadoran who works in juvenile crime prevention, will begin using Chivo, the government’s crypto wallet, on Tuesday.  “I see the benefit of sending money from my cell phone to my family. I have two family members I send money to, and before this I had to pay two separate fees,” he told CoinDesk.  Santaneco used to send money through MoneyGram and Western Union, which charged transaction fees of up to $18. Then he used Ria Money Transfer, at a cost of $7, and finally Xoom and Boss platforms, both of which cost $4.99 per transaction.  “But I had a lot of problems and once had my account suspended,” he said.  Santaneco’s grandmother, 69, has been learning for months to use a smartphone to communicate with her grandson through social networks to avoid spending on phone calls.  “We know that these electronic remittance services like Chivo can also save us money,” he said.  Although he knows it will be cheaper to transact with bitcoin, Santaneco does not quite understand how the currency transfer ends up being free. He said he will send remittances in dollars through the new wallet.  “I know there is a cost to exchange bitcoin to [the] dollar but not if the government will assume that cost or in what way they make that exchange cost free for us,” he said.  Last week, El Salvador’s government agreed to create a $150 million bitcoin trust to facilitate exchanges between bitcoin and U.S. dollars in the country, according to local media.  “I think there is not enough information from official sources on how bitcoin will work in the country,” said Santaneco, who has money invested in bitcoin that has generated profits.  Deeper reasons  According to Ortiz Novoa, it will be essential for the population to use the $30 in bitcoin the government is giving each citizen in order for bitcoin adoption to grow. Additionally, easy and simple convertibility to dollars will be very important, he added.  Jorge Colorado, a Salvadoran anthropologist living in New York, also warned about the lack of information locals received about the implementation of the Bitcoin Law.  “The bitcoin thing was presented by Bukele at a meeting of bitcoiners in Miami several months ago. It was a presentation in English. The following day all the information was in English and was [not] communicated to the people [of El Salvador] until many days later, with very little information, almost superficial,” he told CoinDesk.  Colorado has sent financial aid to friends in El Salvador using RIA or Western Union services, and does not plan to use bitcoin to do so, despite holding investments in bitcoin, ether, litecoin and cardano.  He said he was also concerned about how Chivo was built.  “The Chivo wallet contracts are secret, there was no bidding, public money has been used as if it were private money. I cannot support that,” he said.  Colorado believes that to avoid bitcoin volatility the government of El Salvador will at some point use a stablecoin of its own that will maintain parity with the U.S. dollar.  “The government has not been clear with that, but that is what will happen,” he said.  In July, local media published a report that El Salvador’s government was planning to launch a native cryptocurrency that consumers would be able to use to pay for services.  In August, Bukele’s administration announced an agreement with Koibanx, a Latin American asset tokenization and blockchain financial infrastructure company, to develop the country’s blockchain infrastructure on top of the Algorand blockchain.  Koibanx CEO Leo Elduayen noted that Algorand’s blockchain could support a national stablecoin for El Salvador, but said there are no plans for that at the moment.  Colorado also does not trust the quick approval of the bill, which had a qualified majority in the Legislative Assembly, with 62 out of 84 votes.  “The deputies approved the law in an [expedited] manner. I am absolutely sure that none of them understand it,” he added.  He is also concerned that El Salvador could become a center for money laundering.  “Terrorists or international hackers who have received payments in bitcoin could go to the country and get clean dollars,” he added.  “I am afraid that the Salvadoran economy will collapse. The implementation of bitcoin is a very risky bet. The problem is that a mistake is going to be a great tragedy that will cost dearly and affect the lives of many people,” Colorado said.  On the risk of using bitcoin, Dominguez, from her flower shop, said, “In this life everything is a risk, and he who does not risk does not win.”  According to Colorado, journalists who have covered the implementation of bitcoin have been subjected to harassment, attacks and insults from the government. “The very visceral reaction against the press is because the government has big loopholes and hides a lot of things,” he said. He cited the case of Mario Gomez, a computer specialist and active critic of the implementation of bitcoin, who was arrested and released last Wednesday for possible bank fraud.  “He was threatened to be accused of a crime he did not commit, now the prosecutor’s office has ‘recommended’ that he cannot speak in public, nor communicate through social networks, nor give interviews to the media.”  Colorado says he is not afraid to give his name and surname.  “I live outside the country and here at least they won’t come looking for me at night.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/07/as-el-salvador-enacts-bitcoin-law-locals-remain-confused-about-implementation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00c4096125ee380369377a6fc90974b549934e96-3816x2544.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412080,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otdCRt,1631048157,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Plummets as El Salvador Buys the Dip,"Bitcoin was sharply lower on Tuesday, at one point declining nearly 19% from the $52,000 resistance level. The drop occurred after El Salvador bought 200 BTC on Monday ahead of the Central American nation’s Bitcoin Law going into effect. Under the law, bitcoin is now accepted as legal tender.  The sharp BTC decline triggered about $3 billion of trading position liquidations, with about $1 billion of selling around 10 a.m. ET. Bitcoin was trading around $47,000 at press time and is down 10% over the past 24 hours.  “It’s this volatility that has made many in El Salvador less than optimistic about the currency’s (BTC) adoption,” British financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Making transactions in the currency when the future price is so uncertain is risky,” the firm wrote.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,896, -9.7%  Ether (ETH): $3,432, -13.1%  S&P 500: -0.3%  Gold: $1,818, -0.6%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.371%  El Salvador President Nayib Bukele tweeted on Tuesday that “150 new coins added,” and “buying the dip.”  Crypto proponents were reportedly buying $30 worth of bitcoin each to commemorate El Salvador’s move, known colloquially as “Bitcoin Day.” But it appeared that much of the good news had been priced in over the past month.  “The market’s been overextended for the last six weeks without any significant pullback,” Kevin Kang, founding principal of crypto hedge fund BKCoin Capital, wrote in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.  When alternative cryptocurrencies rally, it is typically a sign of frothiness in the market, according to Kang. Bitcoin cash, litecoin, and EOS “typically make their move towards the end of the cycle,” he wrote.  Liquidations and broker glitches  At 16:55 UTC (12:55 p.m. ET), Coinbase noted that it was investigating a “partial outage where some orders are failing due to high volume” and resolved the issue by 17:46 UTC. Earlier on Tuesday, Kraken experienced delays in funding because of issues it was having with ACH online banking purchases, which was later fixed, reported CoinDesk’s Nate DiCamillo.  Analysts also pointed to signs of exuberance led by retail traders to explain the decline.  “Funding rates are not alarmingly high compared to what we saw throughout most of Q1, although history has shown that optimistic short-term traders often lead to increased volatility as long liquidations ramp up,” Arcane Research wrote in a newsletter on Tuesday.  From a technical perspective, bitcoin briefly dipped below the 200-day moving average and found support just above the $42,000 breakout level. The sell-off occurred after multiple signs of upside exhaustion and slowing momentum ahead of the $52,000-$55,000 resistance zone.  DeFi market value reached a new high before sell-off  The total market value of decentralized finance (DeFi) reached an all-time high near $140 billion shortly before Tuesday’s crypto sell-off. Some analysts pointed to Ethereum’s London network upgrade as a source of the bullish enthusiasm that extended to DeFi tokens over the past two months.  Bitcoin fund flows turned positive  Investors are easing back into digital asset investment products after several weeks of outflows. For the third consecutive week, crypto funds have seen inflows totaling $110 million, according to a report by CoinShares.  Bitcoin in particular saw inflows totaling $59 million, “marking a potential turnaround in sentiment amongst investors,” CoinShares wrote.  Solana-focused funds attracted $13.2 million of inflows last week as the cryptocurrency’s price rose nearly 74%. Ethereum products also saw inflows last week, now commanding a record market share of 28% of all digital asset investment products.  Altcoin roundup  Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection fetches $19 million bid at Sotheby’s: The highest bid for a non-fungible token (NFT) collection of 101 bored-looking apes has fetched $19 million at Sotheby’s, surpassing the auction house’s original estimate of $12 million to $18 million. Individual Bored Apes are currently selling at a “floor price” – the minimum for which one can be had – of 40 WETH, or approximately $140,000 on OpenSea. Next, the BAYC will be featured in the rival auction house Christie’s No Time Like Present online auction running from Sept. 17 to Sept. 28.  Litecoin Enthusiasts Can Now Create NFTs: Litecoin introduced OmniLite, a second-layer protocol that would enable the creation of stablecoins and smart contracts on the blockchain. The rollout would also enable non-fungible token (NFT) creation. OmniLite is based on the earlier Omni protocol, which acted as a secondary layer on the Bitcoin blockchain, reports CoinDesk’s Christie Harkin. According to the announcement, “The tokens created via OmniLite can be considered to be an extension of Litecoin and, as a result, the transactions from these tokens are recorded on its blockchain.”  Cardano marks Sunday, Sept. 12 for mainnet smart contract upgrade: IOHK, the developers behind Cardano, officially submitted an update proposal today to the Cardano mainnet to trigger a hard fork combinator event on Sunday, Sept. 12.

Announced Tuesday, Flexa, sometimes called the “Stripe of crypto,” has added super-fast Lightning payments using bitcoin, which will power crypto payments in El Salvador using wallets such as Strike and the government-run Chivo.  Following the June 9 passage of legislation, El Salvador has become the first country to make bitcoin a national currency, and as such the country becomes a testing ground for making volatile cryptocurrencies and the rails they run on usable for everyday payments.  And Flexa is not alone: Lightning firm OpenNode is powering a McDonald’s integration that briefly went viral on Tuesday.  The Lightning Network is a technique of aggregating bitcoin payments and settling them instantly, with the net transaction later added to the Bitcoin blockchain.  How Flexa got there  Flexa has built wallet and payment infrastructure in the U.S. that allows users to spend multiple cryptocurrencies for point-of-sale purchases at merchants such as Nordstrom, Barnes & Noble, Express or Lowe’s.  “When this El Salvador regulation got put in place, we actually got approached by merchants and other entities in El Salvador asking for us to set this up for them in a compliant way, because they’re working with our counterparts in the U.S.,” Flexa co-founder Tyler Spalding told CoinDesk in an interview. “So there ended up being a really great opportunity to help merchants, and now banks particularly, to be able to process these sorts of digital payments.”  Read more: Robot Ventures, Others Back ‘Crypto Stripe’ Flexa in $6M Raise  Spalding said a full list of merchants, partners and banks that Flexa is working within El Salvador would be announced shortly. Flexa General Counsel Daniel McCabe worked closely with the legal and compliance team at Crowell Moring in New York City and certain regulatory authorities in El Salvador to make the launch possible, Spalding added.  Behind the scenes, Flexa provides instant crypto payments at point of sale by sending the merchant authorization that the payment is being paid and cleared, while collateralizing the transaction until the crypto eventually comes to Flexa.  “Flexa enables any Lightning channel to be used, and we collateralize getting that Lightning channel back on-chain,” said Spalding. “So, to a merchant, we can now guarantee that any Lightning payment will 100% be settled with you in the future.”  In the meantime, El Salvador is still working out the kinks.  In the early hours of Tuesday morning, technical errors were registered with the Chivo wallet and the government interrupted its use to reinforce “technical aspects,” according to a government statement published on Tuesday.

42412075,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otdCFA,1631045279,Former Libra Director Joins Polkadot Builder,"Bertrand Perez, the former chief operating officer (COO) of the Facebook-backed Diem stablecoin project, is joining the Web3 Foundation, a backer of the Polkadot blockchain, as COO.  Perez, who joined Diem (Libra as it was then known) as COO in early 2019, said he resigned from his position this summer as a result of the decision to move the project from the regulatory auspices of FINMA, the Swiss financial watchdog, to U.S. soil and supervision.  Perez wore two hats at Diem, one as COO and the other as managing director of the Libra/Diem Association, which he set up from scratch. Prior to spending two years at Diem, he was a senior director at PayPal for close to eight years.  “Diem has a great team in the U.S. which has started working with the U.S. regulators,” said Perez in an interview. “At this stage it wasn’t possible for me to move to the U.S., so it was time to look for my next move. I got into blockchain back in 2014 while at PayPal, and, of course, I wanted to stay in the space, and decided on the Web3 Foundation, which has incredible technology and a great future.”  Web3, helmed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, is known as the leading firm behind the Polkadot blockchain. Polkadot is currently allocating coveted slots to projects on its 100 “parachains” via an auction process. Parachain auctions for its Kusama “canary” network have fetched large sums, as teams look to build on base layers unburdened by Ethereum’s high fees.  Diem mafia?  Given the considerable headwinds Diem has faced, it’s not surprising there has been an exodus, which has included other high-profile departures including Dante Disparte, Diem’s head of policy, who left the project to join Circle in April of this year.  Diem’s struggle to appease global regulators after announcing a global stablecoin backed by a basket of currencies has been well documented. As a managing director, Perez had to stand on the front line and defend the project.  Perhaps then, as a technologist who was brought in to make sure the blockchain and stablecoin operated correctly, there was a feeling that he hadn’t signed up for this?  “Yes, it was tough at times, but it was part of the job,” said Perez. “We were there to defend the project because the vision is powerful and relevant: cheap and fast payments for people worldwide who need it the most.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/07/former-libra-director-joins-polkadot-builder,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/439a988d0c3aa53267c44deb6ae860e057d00fa1-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412064,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otdBYk,1631045072,"Bitcoin Now Legal Tender in El Salvador, Marking World First","Bitcoin is now officially legal tender in El Salvador, three months after the Bitcoin Law passed the country’s legislature.  While the move marks a world first, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele said in a tweet the “bitcoin process” in the country comes with a “learning curve.”  “We must break the paradigms of the past,” Bukele said. “El Salvador has the right to move toward the First World.”  Bukele tweeted on Monday morning, however, that the Chivo digital wallet the government had set up for citizens to use had been temporarily disabled in order to increase server capacity. At 16:35 UT, Bukele tweeted that the Chivo wallet was ready to be downloaded again from Apple’s App Store for a large-scale test.  El Salvador is using cryptocurrency wallet company BitGo to provide Chivo’s underlying technology.  “This is an historic day and a great opportunity for the people of El Salvador to build financial freedom,” said Mike Belshse, BitGo’s CEO, in a statement.  El Salvador’s legislature passed the Bitcoin Law on June 9 by a supermajority, with 62 members voting in favor of the bill, while 19 opposed and three abstained. The crypto officially became legal tender on Tuesday.  Bitcoin is now on equal footing with the U.S. dollar, which has been in circulation throughout the country since 2001.  Goods, services and even taxes can now be paid using the world’s oldest crypto. “Every economic agent” must accept the use of bitcoin as a legal form of payment under the law.  The law has not been without controversy or opposition, with some calling it unconstitutional. In June, the International Monetary Fund said El Salvador’s move raised a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues.  Similarly, JPMorgan has suggested El Salvador’s economy could face headwinds, suggesting a potential “limitation” on its use case as a medium of exchange may emerge.  In a show of support, crypto proponents are buying $30 worth of bitcoin to coincide with Salvadorans getting the same amount preloaded onto a government-sanctioned digital wallet.  Of 75,489 votes on a poll put out by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, 82% of respondents said they would each buy $30 worth of bitcoin.  On Tuesday, presidential legal adviser Javier Argueta confirmed in an interview that it is mandatory to have an electronic wallet to receive payments in bitcoin, despite the fact that the payment may not be received in that cryptocurrency but in dollars.  A day before the law came into effect, El Salvador purchased its first 200 BTC, with Bukele saying the country’s brokers would be buying a lot more. On Monday, Bukele tweeted that El Salvador had purchased 150 more bitcoins on its recent price drop, bringing its total holdings to 550 BTC.  The price of the world’s largest crypto by market cap is up more than 2.3% over a 24-hour period and is currently changing hands for around $52,600.  Andrés Engler contributed to reporting.

The NFTs will be built cross-chain on Solana and Ethereum, Bankman-Fried said. Deposits, including those of NFTs not built on FTX.US, and withdrawals will open up in a couple of weeks, he tweeted.  The move deepens the exchange’s competition with NFT-focused platforms like OpenSea and Rarible, which have seen their daily trading volumes soar in recent months, as well as Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.  FTX’s U.S. and global sites previously included NFT marketplaces, but did not allow users to mint their own tokens. To list NFTs, creators would have to get in touch with the exchange.  A few NFTs have already been minted on the FTX.US platform, including one that asks whether NFTs are a “tulipmania,” referring to a speculative market bubble in the Netherlands in the 17th century.  The platform subsequently introduced a one-time fee of $500 after being spammed by pictures of a fish.

As of press time bitcoin was changing hands around $46,7561, down from over $52,000 earlier in the day. At one point during the selloff the largest cryptocurrency tumbled as low as $42,900.  The “[market] had been getting ahead of itself, lots of complacency,” Fredrick Collins, an options trader and researcher at Glassnode, told CoinDesk.  The sell-off triggered liquidations of billions of dollars of trading positions due to margin calls, across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. According to the website Bybt, about $3 billion of liquidations were recorded in the past four hours.  One perspective is that the correction might help to reset cryptocurrency markets, with excessively leveraged trading positions getting shaken out.  “This was a healthy event today,” Collins said.  All major cryptocurrencies were in the red.  Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, tumbled 20% to $3,138, while Cardano’s ADA token lost 23%. Uniswap’s UNI token fell 27% and XRP was down 28%.  El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele, whose push to adopt bitcoin as legal tender took effect this week, tweeted that he was “buying the dip” with “150 new coins added.“  In traditional markets, U.S. stocks fell as investors returned from the three-day Labor Day holiday weekend.

The auction – set to close in just under two days – features NFTs from Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). They’re among the 10,000 algorithmically generated images on the Ethereum blockchain featuring cartoon apes with a range of traits, outfits and accessories, from bunny ears to fezzes and 3D glasses. The lot also contains six rare “serums” that, when applied to an existing Bored Ape, will mutate its characteristics, thereby increasing its uniqueness and value. (Think face-melting.)  The Sotheby’s auction also includes a second lot of Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC) NFTs, a collection of unique digital dogs bred as companions to the Bored Apes. At press time, the highest bid for the BAKC collection reached $550,000, below Sotheby’s estimated $1.5 million to $2.0 million.  The Bored Ape Yacht Club took the NFT world by storm earlier this spring, selling out all 10,000 original Bored Apes upon launch and touting celebrities and athletes as collectors.  The project highlights the community-building aspect that has become increasingly important to new NFT projects. Each Bored Ape doubles as a “Yacht Club” membership card, granting the holder to members-only benefits, including access to the BAYC Bathroom, a “dive bar bathroom” where each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the digital bathroom wall every 15 minutes. BAYC envisions the Bathroom as “a members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.”  Read more: The Value of NFTs Is Belonging  “The power of the Bored Ape Yacht Club is in its members and how relentlessly creative, supportive, aligned, and f**king funny our community is,” a Yuga Labs founder who goes by Gargamel wrote in a Discord post. “It’s what has made it possible to go from inception to the biggest auction houses in the world in just four months.”  Individual Bored Apes are currently selling at a “floor price” – the minimum for which one can be had – of 40 WETH, or approximately $140,000 on OpenSea.  It’s not just Sotheby’s. Next, the BAYC will be featured in the rival auction house Christie’s No Time Like Present online auction running from Sept. 17 to Sept. 28.

42412077,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otdCW8,1631041616,BTC Briefly Dropped Below $40K on Huobi Amid Massive Liquidation,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, sank below $40,000 on the crypto exchange Huobi, the lowest point of any major exchange during Tuesday’s crypto market correction.  The latest market sell-off sent bitcoin’s price to as low as $42,921.27 over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data. But according to TradingView and Huobi, bitcoin dropped to a shockingly low $39,818.18 on Huobi.  One trader told CoinDesk the BTC/USDT pair on Huobi fell below $40,000 briefly because Tuesday’s correction triggered liquidations of billions of dollars of trading positions, the result of margin calls on major centralized exchanges.  At the time of publication, Huobi had not responded to a CoinDesk request for comment.  According to the crypto trading data site Bybt, centralized exchanges offering crypto futures liquidated more than $3 billion in long positions on Tuesday, as bitcoin’s price started dropping sharply earlier in the day.  Forced closure of long positions, or bullish trades, account for $3.22 billion, or over 90% of total liquidations, which shows the leverage skewed excessively bullish across the market. Liquidations happen when trades cannot fulfill margin requirements for holding long/short positions and often exacerbate bullish or bearish price trends.  It “looks like it was a standard de-leveraging event,” Rahul Rai, co-head of market neutral at crypto investment firm BlockTower Capital, told CoinDesk. “Huobi had the second most liquidations after Bybit ... more liquidations [means] spot bitcoin selling [and] bitcoin trades lower on Huobi.”  Data from Skew shows that more than $290 million worth of bitcoin futures positions were liquidated on Huobi, the second most behind Bybit.  The large forced closure of long positions also pushed bitcoin futures into backwardation – a market condition where futures trade at a discount to the spot price. As seen in the chart below, bitcoin futures traded at discounts on every major centralized exchange earlier Tuesday.

42412079,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otdCJP,1631039582,"Litecoin Enthusiasts Can Now Create NFTs, Tokens With OmniLite","As more blockchain projects embrace non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Litecoin is joining the fray with the introduction of OmniLite.  Created as a fork of Bitcoin back in 2011, Litecoin’s token litecoin was once described as “the silver to bitcoin’s gold.” Since then, it has iterated on many of Bitcoin’s technical developments, including the early adoption of Segregated Witness (SegWit) in 2017.  Now, in a move to keep up with the times, it is offering Litecoin users the opportunity to create decentralized tokens and smart contracts, along with NFTs and stablecoins.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  OmniLite is based on the earlier Omni protocol (originally known as Mastercoin), which acted as a secondary layer on the Bitcoin blockchain. Powered by the OMNI token, Bitcoin users could create custom tokens and early precursors to NFTs.  Tether tokens first launched on Omni in October 2014, and the protocol remained the only one to support tether for over three years until the stablecoin launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum in November 2017. In less than two years, however, Ethereum’s share of tether’s total circulating supply eclipsed Omni’s. Since then, Omni’s popularity has steadily declined.  Developed by Omni and Litecoin developer Loshan with assistance from the Omni Foundation, OmniLite is an effort from the Litecoin Foundation to let users to create and manage assets on the Litecoin blockchain.  According to the announcement, “The tokens created via OmniLite can be considered to be an extension of litecoin and as a result, the transactions from these tokens are recorded on its blockchain.”  Just as Omni utilizes the Bitcoin network, OmniLite will use OP_RETURN to record token transactions on the Litecoin blockchain.  Currently, OmniLite supports a wallet mode via Litecoin Omni and is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS. The application programming interface (API) is available here.  Scalability  At least for the moment, Litecoin isn’t seeing the constant pressure that higher volume blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum experience. Consequently, its transaction speeds are faster, and fees are lower. But should OmniLite grow in popularity, the ability of the blockchain to scale will be key to maintaining these performance metrics.  And since all of OmniLite’s transactions will be recorded on Litecoin, the blockchain would need to address those issues of scalability.  Litecoin Foundation representative Jay Milla said, “Litecoin has the capacity to handle higher transactions per second (tps) at lower fees compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. So currently we don’t expect any issues. In the meanwhile, there is ongoing research and work going [toward] enabling the assets created on the Omni layer to be transactable on the Lightning Network.”  The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin base layer that offers a way to shift transactions off the main chain, thereby offering a scalable, low-cost, nearly instantaneous way to transact with Bitcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | LTC | BTG,Christie Harkin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/07/litecoin-enthusiasts-can-now-create-nfts-tokens-with-omnilite,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9f66d8831bff8478a2a53c166dafab370c69f783-5906x4724.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424669,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVk5h,1631033029,El Salvador’s Bold Bet on Bitcoin Could Inspire the World,"The tiny nation of El Salvador will soon take a giant leap into the future of finance, as it will become the first country ever to recognize bitcoin as legal tender. Last week, President Nayib Bukele announced in a national address that the law will take effect on Sept. 7. As of this coming Tuesday, all Salvadoran businesses will be required to accept payment in Bitcoin.  As I mentioned during my conversation with Michael J. Casey last week, it’s vanishingly rare for a country as small as El Salvador to find leverage where they can actually play a leading role on the world stage. So while this is a ridiculously gutsy move for the country, especially given the pushback they’re receiving from world powers like the IMF, it’s an asymmetrical bet that is likely to garner huge rewards.  Edan Yago has most recently contributed to bitcoin-native DeFi platform Sovryn. Previously, he founded Cement DAO and Epiphyte to provide global remittance with bitcoin.  All it risks is the nation’s reputation. As an overlooked, poor and violent country that rarely registers on the international radar, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for El Salvador to try something new that could positively impact its future. It’s a simple case of no risk, no reward. Were the country to play it safe and continue to follow standard rules, it would experience the same outcomes: no progress.  While human beings are naturally averse to the unknown, El Salvador has taken measures to reduce uncertainty, decrease the crypto currency’s volatility, and incentivize its use: The finance commission of the Legislative Assembly has set up a $150 million trust fund in an effort to insure bitcoin is a sound currency.  Although protestors can be seen marching down the streets of San Salvador, this is nothing more than your standard knee-jerk reaction of fear, which the opposition is weaponizing. What these protesters fail to glean is that this move – and the trust which backs it – is fundamentally in their best interests.  Read more: El Salvador Residents Are Split on Bitcoin Adoption Bill  El Salvador’s economy depends on money sent back from workers abroad. As such, it suffers greatly from predatory bank and wire transfer fees. World Bank data showed remittances to the country total nearly $6 billion, roughly a fifth of the nation’s GDP in 2019. This presents one of the most lopsided ratios in the world.  Decentralized finance, will work in the best interests of those who rely upon remittances, and are unduly burdened by the high commissions associated with sending money home, as these would be eliminated by cryptocurrency. President Nayib Bukele even said, “One of the reasons we passed the Bitcoin Law is precisely to help people who send remittances.”  People, of course, fear change, so it’s remarkable when a leader like Bukele dares to move beyond that fear in pursuit of a galvanizing vision. The implementation of bitcoin stands to have a revelatory and positive impact on the lives of those protesting its arrival. Cryptocurrency promises both accessibility and freedom from the arbitrary tyranny of both international borders and bank fees.  I applaud President Bukele for having a vision, for looking around the world and finding a different path to progress for his country. He has created an environment extremely conducive to bitcoin and what he stands to gain is an entirely new trajectory for the country and its inhabitants. He is forging a new road to the global economy unfettered by the traditional banking that preys upon so many of his fellow citizens, setting El Salvador as a leader that other countries may follow.  President Bukele has demonstrated that he understands extant financial institutions and systems will never serve his country – they were never intended to. So, he’s rewriting the script and that courage is inspiring to behold. The world is changing and how El Salvador’s crypto-vision plays out will be fascinating to watch, not least for other countries thinking of making such bold moves.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Edan Yago,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/07/el-salvadors-bold-bet-on-bitcoin-could-inspire-the-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b293d60f57509b5377f95585535468fbf276b31-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394451,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdZPF,1631032188,State of Crypto: The SEC Takes on DeFi,"The SEC is reportedly investigating decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and the parties behind them. While not unexpected, this is a new phase in the crypto-regulatory landscape. We may be able to predict how these investigations will proceed by looking at prominent historical examples.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  DeFi investigation  The narrative  News broke Friday that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is conducting a probe into Uniswap Labs and other DeFi platforms. It’s unclear whether these investigations are still primarily for information-gathering purposes or whether there will be enforcement actions coming. Regardless, this is a pivotal, if expected, development in the regulator’s oversight of the crypto market.  Why it matters  How the SEC approaches DeFi might determine how well DeFi platforms survive in the coming years, particularly as the agency’s investigations mature. There are few details about the SEC’s investigations that are publicly available at this time, but we can look to the past to guesstimate how these investigations may proceed.  Breaking it down  The SEC has signaled for a few weeks now that it’s going to be taking a look at DeFi. I’ve written about this at least twice now, so news stories that the agency is actively looking into this segment of the crypto market are absolutely not a surprise.  To sum up what we do know: The SEC is reportedly investigating Uniswap Labs, the developer behind Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum. What’s a DEX, you may ask? Consider it a robot on the internet routing trades through various pools of funds, no middleman (beyond the software) needed. Other (unnamed) DeFi platforms may also be in the SEC’s crosshairs.  While we don’t yet know what the regulator is specifically looking for, we can find some clues in recent history that point to how the agency might approach DeFi and enforcement actions.  DeFi tea leaves  SEC Chair Gary Gensler has helpfully explained his views in detail a few times now. Most recently, he told the European Parliament that a lack of regulated brokers and clear-cut investor protection rules leaves “the investing public … vulnerable,” particularly to scams or other forms of abuse.  In the past he has also pointed to “promoters and sponsors” who write the software behind DeFi platforms and create their governance mechanisms. The theme that’s emerging so far is a focus on the centralized players that might help create or power DeFi projects (or even engage in what my colleague David Morris calls “decentralization theater”).  The SEC therefore doesn’t appear to be looking at the decentralized parts of DeFi, even if the projects themselves are adequately decentralized after launch. If a project isn’t fully decentralized in its earliest development stage, its backers may soon receive an inquiry.  This would explain why the SEC is investigating Uniswap Labs at any rate.  In a statement emailed to CoinDesk, an external spokesperson for Uniswap Labs said, “We are committed to complying with the laws and regulations governing our industry and to providing information to regulators that will assist them with any inquiry.”  Looking further back, the SEC may also look at how a DeFi platform actually operates – whether it provides a marketplace for tokens that the SEC considers securities and uses its own orderbook.  Past cases  The agency’s precedent here would be EtherDelta, the decentralized trading platform the SEC brought charges against in 2018 on allegations it acted as a securities trading platform.  At the time, the agency pointed to EtherDelta’s smart contract, order book, order display website and marketplace as evidence it was supporting illicit securities transactions.  The SEC also specifically brought charges against Zachary Coburn, who founded the platform but left over a year before the charges were filed.  So just because a platform is decentralized doesn’t mean the SEC won’t file charges against a centralized party with a significant role in setting it up.  It is worth noting here that there may be lines drawn between decentralized finance platforms generally and decentralized exchanges specifically, but the role of centralized developers or founders is salient to both types of entities.  In short, what the SEC is likely considering includes:  Investor protection concerns;  The role of centralized parties in these decentralized platforms;  Whether the tokens are securities in the SEC’s view.

Knowing like no other the power of social networks, President Nayib Bukele was extremely adept at joining an explosive tribe in search of state legitimacy. The Salvadoran case study was a win-win for both parties.  Still, Bukele had to back down in early battles against the financial establishment. The first stumbling block was the International Monetary Fund, which quickly issued a statement naming “a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues” that bitcoin would generate in that country, in the midst of negotiations for a $1 billion loan for the country.  Bukele, without much leeway in the international arena, made several concessions. The most striking was to desist from applying Article 7 of the law, which stipulated that all economic agents must accept bitcoin as a form of payment when offered by the person acquiring goods or services. In August, the president said the use of bitcoin as legal tender would not be mandatory, and the resulting question was obvious. If businesses are not forced to accept it, can bitcoin be considered legal tender?  The second concession, more symbolic but no less important, was saying the measure of the economy would be in dollars, and that salaries would be paid in that currency. It is worth remembering that although El Salvado has a central bank, the country does not issue its own currency but uses the U.S. dollar.  Despite the changes, bitcoin could have concrete benefits for El Salvador. It could save them $400 million that Salvadorans abroad send as remittances to their country, boost tourism and even create a mining industry if Bukele effectively makes available volcanic energy as promised.  On a continent-wide scale, the success of bitcoin in El Salvador – demonstrated in massive adoption and savings in remittances – could mean a domino effect of adoption in Latin America and developing countries in other continents.  So far, Bukele’s strategy has led different politicians in the region – from the North in Mexico to the far South in Argentina – to present bills to regulate the sector and, in some cases, promote it. Either way, bitcoin bills have been a gold mine for officials in search of votes and fame, and an important step in putting cryptocurrencies on the discussion table.  The bitcoin experiment will not only be a litmus test for Bukele but also for bitcoin itself and the discourse that proposes this cryptocurrency as a financial solution for underbanked territories.  The adoption of bitcoin in El Salvador will mean something unprecedented: the first state educational policy on crypto assets, with different offices where locals will learn to use the official digital wallet Chivo and gain knowledge about how bitcoin works and its usages, such as remittances.  Bitcoin is political  The adoption of bitcoin in El Salvador comes at a tumultuous political moment for the country. On Friday, the country’s Supreme Court – which has a pro-government tilt – declared it constitutional for the president to be reelected after his five-year term, generating pushback from the entire political opposition.  It is not the only issue. At least three opinion polls published last week showed the majority of Salvadorans do not agree with the use of bitcoin as legal tender in the country, with an average of between 65% and 70% of El Salvador’s population against it. Such a level of rejection was crystallized in some small marches that took place with only hundreds of people and unions opposed to Bukele, which could have political interests beyond bitcoin itself.  Thus, Bukele expressed days ago his frustration against those who criticized the use of bitcoin in the country for remittances.  “If you don’t want to, you can always go to Western Union and pay a commission. No problem at all,” he wrote on his Twitter account.  El Salvador’s political spectrum is on the lookout for any Bukele misstep, and has criticized the Bitcoin Law in different ways. Both the FMLN party (left) and Arena (right) are unforgiving of a president who wears a backwards cap, has broken with the status quo, entered Congress with the military to try and force the legislature to approve more military and police funding, and won the last legislative elections with a supermajority that gave him a majority in parliament.  “Some will prefer to believe the thieving opponents who have done nothing but loot our country, destroy it and pay for them to murder our people. Others will choose to believe the government. But in the end, everyone will realize the reality on Sept. 7,” Bukele wrote last week.  Tether’s reserves  In May, I filed a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request with the New York Attorney General’s Office asking for the documents detailing Tether’s reserve composition breakdown. My goal was to verify that Tether submitted similar documents to the NYAG that the company published when revealing its breakdown to the public (the pie charts, as Twitter has taken to calling them).  The NYAG FOIL officer who saw the request initially denied it, tying the request to a similar FOIL request made by another individual. CoinDesk appealed, and a different FOIL officer agreed with our appeal.  Procedurally, Tether had an opportunity to push back against the second officer’s decision, which it did in the form of a petition filed last week. I imagine we’re still close to the beginning of this process, so obviously more to come on this front.  Here’s more context on how we got here, including Tether’s full statement after filing.

42411916,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh53d,1631031515,How Does Ethereum Work?,"When the Ethereum network launched in 2015, it became the first project to expand the use cases of blockchains by introducing unique technologies that allowed people to create their own digital tokens and self-sustaining, autonomous applications. This innovation paved the way for a broad spectrum of markets including decentralized finance (DeFi), initial coin offerings (ICOs), GameFi and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  But the question is, how does Ethereum achieve this?  At a high level, Ethereum consists of several key components:  Smart contracts: Rules governing under what conditions money can change hands  The Ethereum blockchain: A record of Ethereum’s entire history – every transaction and smart contract call is stored in its blockchain  Consensus mechanism: The method for validating and recording data on the blockchain; it also helps to secure the network and is responsible for issuing new tokens into circulation  The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The part of Ethereum that executes the rules of Ethereum and makes sure a submitted transaction or smart contract follows the rules  Ether: Ethereum’s token, which is required to make transactions and execute smart contracts on Ethereum  Smart contracts  Let’s start with smart contracts because they’re kind of the whole point of Ethereum.  A smart contract is simply a programmable agreement that runs on a blockchain. This technology allows users to digitize conditions governing the relationship and interactions between the two parties involved in a transaction. Once these conditions are programmed and launched on the blockchain as smart contracts, they self-execute (that is, they initiate and complete the set of transactions that they govern, as long as the predefined conditions are met).  For instance, Alice decides to borrow from Bob 1,000 tether (USDT) only if Bob deposits ether worth $2,000 as collateral. Using a smart contract, Alice could independently define the conditions that validate this deal, instead of trusting a middleman that would broker the deal. If done right, such a smart contract would autonomously release 1,000 USDT to Bob after he had deposited and locked $2,000 as collateral. Also, when Alice repays the loan, the smart contract would release the collateral and send it back to Bob.  As such, the smart contract offers a trustless system where Alice or Bob do not need to worry about counterparty risks. It also eliminates the need for middlemen. Here, Alice and Bob do not need to pay an extra fee to an intermediary or escrow service before they can conduct peer-to-peer transactions.  Interestingly, Ethereum was the first blockchain to discover and implement smart contracts as part of the functionalities of blockchains. Subsequently, this innovation unlocked more blockchain use cases and ultimately brought about the explosion of decentralized applications.  Read more: What Is a Decentralized Application?  Blockchain  Ethereum shares some similarities with Bitcoin in that it relies on a blockchain to store and secure transactions.  Note that a blockchain is a chain of chronologically ordered blocks containing the data of confirmed transactions. Think of it as a ledger where all the activities executed in a network or platform are being recorded. Importantly, this ledger is publicly available, meaning network participants and even outsiders can easily track its content. Also, copies of this ledger are distributed across a global network of computers known as “nodes.” These nodes perform a variety of tasks on the network, including verifying and recording transaction and smart contract data.  This architecture allows participants to own a copy of the blockchain and collectively verify the validity of the content added to it. Some of the benefits of this include:  No single point of failure  Data is completely transparent, reliable and immutable  Censorship resistant  However, where Ethereum is different to Bitcoin is that nodes don’t just have to verify and record transaction data, they also have to keep track of the network’s “state.” Ethereum’s state is the current information of all the applications running on top of it, including each user’s balance, all the smart contract code, where it’s all stored and any changes that are made.  Here’s a summary of what’s stored in each node:  Accounts: Each user can have an account, which shows how much ether the user has  Smart contract code: Ethereum stores smart contracts, which describe the rules that need to be met for money to be unlocked and transferred  Smart contract state: The state of the smart contracts  Consensus mechanism  Ethereum and Bitcoin used to use the same consensus protocol for validating data and adding it to the blockchain – known as proof-of-work (PoW). This involves mining nodes competing against one another using energy-intensive machines to win the right to add the next block to the blockchain. This happens roughly once every 10 minutes.  However, in 2022, Ethereum underwent a major transition known as ""The Merge"" which migrated the network to a proof-of-stake blockchain (PoS.)  Instead of requiring mining nodes to run expensive equipment to discover new blocks, the new PoS system requires users to deposit and lock away 32 ether – the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum (see below) – to become network validators.  Read more: How Does Ethereum Staking Work?  There are three main benefits to the transition:  Ethereum’s new PoS blockchain supports the implementation of new “shard chains.” These will be 64 smaller blockchains that will each handle their own batches of data, allowing for Ethereum to process significantly more transactions per second.  The new Ethereum blockchain uses 99.95% less energy than the proof-of-work version.  Because validators will not need to purchase and operate expensive mining equipment, it will reduce the barrier for entry for people to participate in the network. This should help to improve overall decentralization and network security.  The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)  The EVM is Ethereum’s native processing system that allows developers to create smart contracts and lets nodes seamlessly interact with them. Ethereum developers write smart contracts with Solidity, a programming language much like Javascript and C++. These smart contracts written in Solidity can be read by humans but not computers. It, therefore, has to be converted into low-level machine instructions – called opcodes – which the EVM can easily understand and execute.  It’s important to know every Ethereum node has its own EVM.  When a person sends a transaction to a smart contract deployed on Ethereum, every node runs the smart contract and the transaction through their own EVM. In this simulated environment, each node can see what the end result will be and whether the outcome produces a valid transaction or not. If all nodes reach the same valid outcome, the changes are made and the updated Ethereum state is recorded on the blockchain.  Ether  Ether is needed for doing just about anything on Ethereum, and when it’s used to execute smart contacts on the network it’s often referred to as “gas.” The amount of gas needed to pay is determined by the type of transaction you plan on executing and the number of Ethereum transactions waiting to be verified. The more complex the transaction, the higher the gas fee.  Ethereum uses accounts to store the ether, analogous to bank accounts. There are two types of accounts to know:  Externally owned accounts (EOAs): The accounts that normal users use for holding and sending ether.  Contract accounts: These separate accounts are the ones that hold smart contracts, which can be triggered by ether transactions from EOAs or other events.  Find more about accounts here.  How do users interact with Ethereum?  As mentioned earlier, some users interact with Ethereum via nodes. In other words, they have to connect their computers to Ethereum by downloading the blockchain software on their system (known as a “client”). Depending on the Ethereum software client you choose, you may need to download the full copy of the Ethereum blockchain.  Alternatively, you could simply generate a private key and create a wallet address to start interacting with the blockchain. Wallet in this context refers to digital or physical storage devices designed for cryptocurrencies. Each Ethereum wallet comes with a unique identifier called wallet addresses (they are random strings of alphanumeric characters).  And while most assume the crypto holders store their digital assets on wallets, these applications and devices function as storage systems for private keys. You do not leave the Ethereum blockchain. Instead, the blockchain assigns all ether holders a private key that allows them to access their ether balance and use it as they please. When you transfer ether, the blockchain updates your balance to reflect the change in the ownership of the transferred coins. It is these private keys that wallets are designed to store. Note that without the private key, a crypto holder cannot access his digital asset. This is why it is paramount to keep keys secure and away from lurking eyes. If anyone manages to steal your private key, then they have successfully stolen the digital assets associated with such a key. Below is an example of what a private key looks like (please do not send any funds to this address):  073d9dbee8875e7c91422d80413c85ba5e8e9fe7cad5dc001871dac882d07f2f  Note that you would have to pay a fee denominated in ether whenever you execute a transaction on Ethereum or trigger a smart contract.

42394437,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdYPh,1631030486,El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law Is About Self-Determination,"Money talks, often in metaphors. Today, El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, allowing residents to pay all public and private debts in the cryptocurrency. It’s a policy without precedent in the world, and one that symbolizes the beginning of a new period of national self-determination for the country.  Proposed by President Nayib Bukele and passed by the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador in June, the law puts BTC on level footing with the U.S. dollar, which has been the country’s national currency since 2001. The move is meant to improve Salvadoran’s access to financial services and reduce the Central American nation’s dependence on the U.S. economic regime.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In particular, Bukele has said bitcoin adoption is aimed at mitigating the inflationary pressure of fiat currencies, especially after the unprecedented bout of U.S. government spending throughout the coronavirus crisis. The coming years will be uncharted territory for El Salvador, bitcoin and – in a real sense – the U.S. dollar.  There’s no guidebook to how technology will develop, and no one knows where the Bitcoin Law will lead. In a nation where remittances account for about a quarter of gross domestic product, bitcoin infrastructure could significantly reduce fees for expatriates sending money home.  The government’s Chivo wallet, slang for “cool,” may end up being something of a savings account for the two-thirds of Salvadorans that currently lack banking access. (Qualified citizens will receive a $30 BTC airdrop when they sign up.)  But the policy could also go disastrously wrong. The IMF has warned about potentially destabilizing effects (such as on the government’s tax revenue), Moody’s has downgraded El Salvador’s debt rating and locals have raised concerns about money laundering or corruption in a nation that struggles to deal with organized crime.  Bitcoin is also a highly volatile currency, with some deflationary properties, making it less-than-ideal for daily use. (Though that hasn’t stopped people in El Zonte, a fishing village in El Salvador that has become something of a proving ground for semi-closed bitcoin economies.)  Still, in taking this step, the government is signalling its commitment to financial innovation. Last month it began installing a network of 200 bitcoin ATMs around the country. It’s working to build infrastructure on top of the Algorand blockchain. And its bid to attract foreign investment and crypto talent seems to be paying off.  Read more: El Salvador Wants to Attract Bitcoin Talent. Its Strategy Is Working  There’s a social media movement to encourage people to buy $30 in bitcoin, a show of support from the international Bitcoin community, which sees the Bitcoin Law as the first step towards what they call “hyperbitcoinization.”  Others view the Bitcoin Law as an extension of Bukele’s hipster-authoritarian tendencies. Cato’s George Selgin and Steve H. Hanke and prominent bitcoin advocates including Nic Carter have roundly criticized Article 7 of the law, which compels businesses to accept bitcoin. The Financial Times’ editorial board have called the law a “dangerous gamble,’’ based on the compelling argument that bitcoin is “not cool” as legal tender.  No matter what the Bitcoin Law represents, this is a matter of national sovereignty.

The SEC is seeking information about how investors use the exchange and how it is marketed, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  The exchange’s developer, Uniswap Labs, has said that it will assist the regulator with its civil inquiry. The SEC has declined to comment, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Uniswap is the Ethereum blockchain’s largest decentralized exchange by trading volume.  While it is still unclear exactly what the SEC wants to know, the news is a sign of the regulator’s intent to wield greater oversight of decentralized finance (DeFi), something SEC Chairman Gary Gensler hinted at in recent comments.  No wrongdoing appears to have been alleged at this time.  Gensler has argued that while there may be no central entity in charge of a decentralized exchange, DeFi projects that offer incentives or digital tokens to participants could fall under the purview of SEC regulation.  “There’s still a core group of folks that are not only writing the software, like the open-source software, but they often have governance and fees,” he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last month.  The SEC filed what it called its first case involving securities using DeFi technology last month, charging so-called DeFi lender Blockchain Credit Partners with raising $30 million through allegedly fraudulent offerings.

Recently, as Bitcoin hit new records, the market value of stablecoins witnessed a 10x increase. Facebook has announced its own stablecoin, and even VISA has become the first major payments network to settle transactions in the American dollar-backed stablecoin USDC. So what&apos;s to love about stablecoins? The main reason is, they lack the volatility of regular cryptocurrencies. As they&apos;re pegged to a more consistent reserve of value such as fiat currency, diamonds or gold, the price of a stablecoin isn&apos;t inclined to fluctuate so dramatically as say, Bitcoin or Ethereum does. &apos;You can have reasonable assurance that in 3 months time, or 6 months time, or 1 week&apos;s time, it&apos;ll still be worth $100.

But before the use of stablecoins can go fully mainstream, Kern warned that issuers and creators of these tokens are going to have to convince their users that their money will be safe with their new technology.

A mainnet launch is slated for the latter half of this year, according to Smirnov, and will support Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, HECO, Polygon and Arbitrum.

If they are not, it should be deemed mined, and capital gains tax must be levied. That is like voluntary disclosure,” Gandhi said Tuesday while speaking at Crypto Asset Conference HODL 2021 held by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC).  The Economic Times recently reported that the government could categorize cryptocurrencies as an “asset/commodity” for all purposes, including taxation. According to Gandhi, there is a general consensus among policymakers that crypto should be deemed an asset and not a currency, payment instrument or financial instrument.  Still, the regulatory picture remains unclear with the much-anticipated Cryptocurrency Bill awaiting action in Parliament. Despite the lingering uncertainty, interest in digital assets continues to soar, with India now ranking second on the list of 20 countries with the highest cryptocurrency adoption rate, as noted by Chainalysis.  Gandhi fears that without a proper regulatory framework, crypto could be used for criminal activity.  “So that is where the real difficulty comes in vis-à-vis a crypto asset,” Gandhi said at the online event. “There has been quite a bit of an anecdotal evidence that crypto assets have been utilized for increasingly, or in large scale, for illegal activities like ransom attacks, et cetera.”  The former central banker stressed the need to keep a tab on crypto transactions through a central repository and added that the freedom to trade in digital assets cannot be granted at the expense of the laws of the land.  “The very idea of crypto was that it should be anonymous, independent and it cannot be tracked. But every society will have rules that expect compliance from all members, and it will penalize non-compliance,” Gandhi said. “A state will always want to give freedom to its citizens in terms of economic transactions. It enforces contractual obligations and taxes income and gains. So, any economic activity should be amenable to these kinds of things.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/07/tax-crypto-based-on-payments-channel-former-india-official-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55beca1dd01520375a60e3673f0bb61be58e6d98-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He noted that more Bitcoin purchases were going to be made on Tuesday. The purchase is part of a new $150 million Bitcoin fund passed last week by El Salvador&apos;s Congress. The fund is to help aid conversion from BTC to USD so that businesses, households, and individuals can make or accept payments in BTC if they choose. President Bukele also appreciated the blockchain technology and Bitcoin industry for the innovations his government has embraced. In July, El Salvador began processes to make Bitcoin a legal tender when it passed its Bitcoin law to make the coin its legal tender. The decision, however, was met with praise by the Bitcoin community.

Sharding reduces the workload on the entire network, thereby making the network more scalable. Jax.Network also employs merged mining techniques to ensure the security of shards. But, it does not compromise security, and each shard has the same security as the entire network using Auxiliary Proof-of-Work. Jax.Network reduces the amount of information stored, but network resilience to 51% attacks remains the same. What is Jax.Network sharding and why is it needed? First, sharding is a promising blockchain scaling solution that involves splitting a network into more superficial portions, commonly referred to as shards. The concept of sharding is more like a &apos;divide and conquer&apos; algorithm and can be used to ease the workload on a single network and distribute this into multiple sub-networks. JaxNet employs this same blockchain scaling approach meaning the entire network is made up of shards. Shards are a collection of nodes that take part in transactions and also maintain the sharded network. JaxNet leverages sharding as its value proposition. When used in JaxNet, sharding divides the workload of a blockchain into groups of shards responsible for reducing the latency, allowing for more transactional throughput, which, in turn, enhances scalability. ...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/tHfgumto13Dp-GKs8eaEFDHgrmwRGUK6,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png

42412067,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otdBlT,1631011989,Ether Futures Open Interest Hits New High of $11.6B,"Ether’s price rally has revved up investor interest in derivatives tied to the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum’s blockchain.  Open positions in ether futures rose to $11.6 billion on Monday, surpassing the previous peak of $11.25 million reached May 11, according to data provided by Glassnode.  The value has more than doubled since late June, signaling an influx of money into the market, according to Gustavo De La Torre, business development director at crypto exchange n.exchange.  “Ether is constantly on a bullish trend, suggesting that the majority of investors are betting on an increased price surge in the near term,” Torre added.  Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, said so-called carry trades have picked up and could be boosting open interest.  Carry trading is a market-neutral strategy that involves buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market and simultaneously selling futures to profit from the decay in the futures premium, or the spread between the two prices. Futures premium evaporates as expiry nears and converges with the spot price, yielding relatively riskless returns for the carry trader. The strategy is typically executed when futures are trading at a significant premium to the spot price.  The quarterly futures premium on Binance, FTX, Deribit and OKEx has picked up from 5% annualized to around 12% over the past four weeks, per data source Skew. However, premiums are still significantly lower than highs near 40% observed in mid-April and indicate the market is far from being overheated. Premiums may not surge that high again even in times of extreme bullish sentiment as major exchanges like Binance and FTX no longer offer 100x leverage.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, briefly topped the $4,000 mark on Friday, having picked up a strong bid at lows near $1,800 in July. The cryptocurrency was trading near $3,760 at press time.  “We have seen good spot buying in ether,” Heusser said. “The EIP-1559 upgrade has started to kick in and is being used as a narrative for higher prices.”  Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 implemented on Aug. 5 burns a portion of fees paid to miners, limiting the supply of the token. Ether’s daily issuance dropped below that of bitcoin’s at the end of August. On Sept. 3, the daily net emission of ether was -333, the first negative daily print since the EIP activation, per CryptoCompare.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/07/ether-futures-open-interest-hits-new-high-of-116b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd58d63ceda7c1221aa8b9d711f486a970ff0e83-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The NDRC officially responded to China’s two national grid operators, the State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Power Grid Corporation, about the pilots, an unnamed representative for the NRDC said in an interview posted on the commission’s site.  Blockchain is one of the technologies that can be implemented on green power trading because it can securely “record the information of each link of green power production, transaction, and consumption,” the interview said.  The two companies will set up two trading centers, one in Beijing and one in Guangzhou, reported state-owned People’s Daily Tuesday.  State Grid, the world’s largest utility operator, has applied for a patent for blockchain-based certificates of green power transactions, the commission said.  The NDRC hopes that trading system will not only help China hit its carbon goals by incentivizing the use of green energy, but will be a Chinese solution to global energy problems.
