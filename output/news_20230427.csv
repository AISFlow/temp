42420661,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqWSL,1682636974,Leaders in Decentralized Identity Slam Soulbound Tokens,"AUSTIN, Texas — The preservation of our identities is one of the most important aspects to our digital lives, and that conversation is alive and well at Consensus 2023.  That conversation around digital and decentralized identifiers (DID) isn’t new and has been approached by some of our brightest minds for some time now including notable figures Jack Dorsey and Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin has proposed the idea of soulbound tokens (SBT), which function as non-transferable non-fungible tokens (NFT) that can help represent a person's identity and achievements in Web3.  When asked about SBTs on stage at Consensus during a panel titled “Not Your Keys, Not Your Identity: How to Protect our Most Precious Asset” Thursday afternoon, Daniel Buchner, Block’s head of decentralized identity, made his opinion clear.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  “SBTs are largely a fraudulent meme,” Buchner declared. He added that decentralized identities don’t need a blockchain or a token solely for the sake of having a blockchain or a token.  Co-founder and CEO of disco.xyz, Evin McMullen, echoed the sentiment, declaring that it is imperative to “not adopt consent-free primitives that require us to manually hide unwanted assets in our NFT interfaces. If an NFT maps to your key, I can’t tell if that NFT is wanted or unwanted or airdropped or a gift.” McMullen went on to discuss the idea of rotating keys behind the scenes of DIDs to avoid catastrophic loss of an identity profile.  The final punctuation came from the third panelist, Tyrone Lobban, head of blockchain and Onyx digital assets at JPMorgan. He agreed with his co-panelists and urged developers to go and experiment and become familiar with verifiable credentials.  The unanimous agreement among panelists that SBTs aren’t the way forward is notable because Buterin is widely viewed as an important figure in crypto.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/27/leaders-in-decentralized-identity-slam-soulbound-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60b7514729f1461d4ab11de82a26d930ed6102ec-1200x675.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite a drop from its yearly high of $0.590, XRP dominated the crypto market with total sales in Q1 2023 of $361.06M, net of purchases, compared to $226.31M in the previous quarter. Related Reading: Avalanche Remains Under Pressure Despite Circle’s CCTP Effort XRP Shines In Q1, Records Impressive Growth And Performance According to the Q1 report by Ripple, XRP Ledger (XRPL) on-chain activity remained strong, with decentralized exchange volumes increasing by 34% to $115M in Q1 2023 versus Q4 2022. Furthermore, XRP Average Daily Volume (ADV) on centralized exchanges jumped 46% in Q1 to $1B from $698M, indicating high demand for the cryptocurrency. While financial turmoil dominated the markets in Q1 of 2023, the token recorded a 46% increase in volumes compared to the previous quarter, according to the report. This increase can be attributed to market recovery and large volatile events spike volumes. Furthermore, according to the data released by Ripple, the XRPL’s on-chain activity remained strong in Q1 2023. The total number of transactions increased to 116,341,516, up from 106,429,153 in the previous quarter. The average cost per transaction (in XRP) also increased slightly to 0.00121 from 0.00096 in Q4 2022, while the average cost per transaction was $0.000484. In addition, the XRPL burned 140,993 tokens for transaction fees in Q1 2023, reflecting an increase from the previous quarter. The average XRP closing price during the period was $0.40, slightly lower than the previous quarter’s $0.42. The XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes also increased in Q1 2023, with $114,567,441 traded on DEX, up from $85,772,947 in the previous quarter. The number of trust lines remained stable at 8,317,321, while the number of new wallets created was 140,558. Moreover, The XRP Ledger’s on-chain activity remains robust, with Ripple’s latest report revealing that transactions increased by 9% in Q1 2023 to 116 million, compared to 106 million in the previous quarter. NFTs have emerged as a key driver of activity, with over one million assets minted on the Ledger since XLS-20 went live on the mainnet. Rising Above The Rest The report also notes that due to the recent banking crisis, Ripple temporarily stopped purchasing XRP for several days due to the disruption. However, the company has since resumed purchases and plans to continue purchasing XRP as ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) adoption grows. In addition, during Q1 2023, three billion XRP were released out of escrow, with one billion released each month, in line with prior quarters and the official escrow arrangement. Of the three billion XRP, 2.1 billion were returned and subsequently put into new escrow contracts throughout the quarter, ensuring the stability and predictability of XRP’s supply. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.4640, representing a decline of 2.5% over the past 24 hours. In the wider time frames, XRP is experiencing a downturn, with 5%, 8%, and 3% decreases in the seven-day, fourteen-day, and 30-day timeframes, respectively.

42420680,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqWdh,1682635837,William Shatner Warps Into Web3 With ‘Infinite Connections’ NFT Release,"AUSTIN, Texas — William Shatner is speeding to Web3 at warp 9.  The original ""Star Trek"" captain and longtime Twitter crypto guy officially dropped his non-fungible token (NFT) release, Infinite Connections, during CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference.  Infinite Connections comprises two collections: Cosmic Explorer, with 2,500 NFTs that feature a Shatner 3D avatar paired with artwork that explores scientific themes like quantum physics and sonic vibrations. Each one also includes a physical action figure of Captain James T. Kirk, the role for which Shatner is best known, each hand-signed by Shatner with a quote from the character.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  The other collection is Timeless Voyager, which includes 1,000 NFTs of 2D artwork of future tech and the cosmos. There’s no action figure included, but “select” holders will have access to unspecified IRL opportunities.  ""NFTs are slowly becoming more artistic,"" Shatner said backstage at the conference. ""These, developed by Orange Comet, are among the most artistic that I've ever seen.""  To create and release his collection, Shatner worked with Orange Comet, a Web3 entertainment company that recently raised $7 million in a funding round. The company has also worked with former National Basketball Association star Scottie Pippen, Sir Anthony Hopkins and the hit TV show ""The Walking Dead.""  Orange Comet CEO Dave Broome, who also spoke at the conference, revealed how the deal with Shatner occurred, and how Shatner's intellectual curiosity was a key component.  ""This is a man at 92 who is still inquiring, and still has an ability to learn and embrace technology and understanding what it could do,"" Broome said. ""What we're interested in doing is taking someone like iconic, legendary William Shatner and all of the millions and millions of fans that he has, and bring them over into Web3.""  The collection features images of Shatner integrated into imagery that's evocative of science and technology, such as where the contours of his face are filled in with illuminated strings that curve and overlap each other, or anther where his head connected to high-tech machinery resembling a helmet from Halo.  ""What we're trying to do with these images is show the connection – the mathematic, romantic, stars, quantum physics – the connection between it all, and we think buried in those images are those philosophies,"" Shatner said.  Shatner’s release comes at a transitional time for NFTs. Although the days of extreme hype in the mainstream and multimillion-dollar sales such as Beeple’s are long gone, celebrity drops of NFTs have been surprisingly resilient. Last winter, former President Donald Trump released an NFT collection that sold out within a day. That led to a second release in April that sold out just as quickly – although prices for collectibles from the first drop had plummeted.  Shatner, a household name with a huge fan base, clearly sees a similar opportunity. If the release is successful, more releases from other crypto-native and -curious celebrities could follow – perhaps even from other ""Star Trek"" celebrities.  Shatner’s collection went on sale Thursday at 3 p.m. Pacific Time – timed to his appearance onstage at Consensus – at WilliamShatnerNFTs.com.

A potential hurdle for the bullish price action could come from Shibetoshi Nakamoto, who took to Twitter to say he does not represent DOGE. Shibetoshi, once again, established some distance between himself and the project, which could be detrimental to the long term due to the founder’s popularity and influence.

Responding to a question from the moderator, CoinDesk Deputy Managing Editor Tracy Wang, regarding the investment time horizon of a venture capital, Draper said he is a long-term player and still holds most of the investments he has made in crypto.  Draper went on to explain that there is a distinction between a hedge fund and a VC in terms of time horizon of an investment, indicating that hedge funds tend to focus mostly on the short-term trades.

42420667,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqWVR,1682629404,"Bitcoin Circles Above $29.5K as Investors Weigh Sluggish GDP, Latest Banking Woes","A day after crypto markets went on a roller-coaster ride, bitcoin (BTC) held steady over $29,500 as investors weighed sluggish U.S. economic growth data and the latest banking sector woes.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $29,600, up about 4% over the past 24 hours. BTC dipped slightly during U.S. morning trading Thursday after the Commerce Department reported a tepid 1.1% gain in GDP for the first quarter – below expectations of 2% annualized and disappointing personal consumption data, before rebounding.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, followed a similar pattern, jumping almost 3% over the past 24 hours to change hands at around $1,920. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures overall crypto market performance, was up over 6% for the day.  Bob Baxley, chief technology officer at decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Maverick Protocol, said that bitcoin’s performance in recent days reflects investors’ confidence in the crypto’s ability to hold value even during unsettling events.  “Bitcoin and other crypto assets have clearly been performing as the sort of safe haven that many had hoped this technology class would become,” Baxley told CoinDesk in an email.  Baxley noted that BTC, ETH and other major digital assets rose Wednesday just hours after embattled regional bank First Republic’s shares plummeted by nearly 50%. “I suspect that much of this has to do with a broadening realization among more people and organizations of the core value proposition of bitcoin and [ether], among others – namely, that they’re decentralized, censorship-resistant forms of value that lack counterparty risk,” he said.  “It’s hard not to see this value at a time when banks are looking as unsteady as they are now,"" he said. He added that such a boom likely has something to do with “intensifying expectations of more bailouts of wobbling financial institutions – or what those in the crypto asset community refer to as the ‘money go brrr’ scenario.”  He foresees a likely policy shift by the U.S. Federal Reserve because the central bank’s present monetary hawkishness “risks inflicting serious damage.”  The CME FedWatch Tool is currently showing an 87% probability of a 25-basis point interest rate hike at next week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting.  Equity markets rallied on Thursday, with the S&P 500 recently closing up 1.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumping 2.4%.

12145358,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528975,1682629246,"Bitcoin Bloodbath: Market Volatility Sparks Panic, Wipes Out $1 Billion In Open Interest","In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a sharp increase in volatility, with prices fluctuating between $29,000 and $27,000, given the lack of liquidity in the market. This sudden price action has had a significant impact on bulls and bears. However, as of this writing, Bitcoin has managed to recover the $29,000 level, and it remains to be seen if it can continue to recover and consolidate above its key psychological level of $30,000, supporting the continuation of its bull run or if it will be further slumps in the coming days or weeks. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Unload Billions Amid SHIB Price Retreat False Rumors Cause Bitcoin Investors To Liquidate In Droves According to Satoshi Club, the rumors of the US government and Mt. Gox sales were initially believed to be true, leading to panic selling among Bitcoin traders. However, it was later confirmed that the data was misclassified, and no such sales were taking place. The impact of these rumors on the market was significant, as traders were already on edge due to the high levels of volatility in the market. The news of potential large-scale sales by the US government and Mt. Gox, a now-defunct Bitcoin exchange, only added to the uncertainty and fear among traders. The market panic led to liquidating $300 million worth of positions as of this writing and the wiping out of $1 billion in open interest within 24 hours. This was a significant blow to both long and short traders, as many were forced to exit their positions at a loss. Open interest can impact the price of Bitcoin because it reflects the level of market participation and sentiment. When open interest is high, it suggests greater interest and activity in the market, potentially leading to price movements. However, the market has since recovered, and Bitcoin’s value has risen again. The Funding Rate has returned to around 0.003, indicating that traders are no longer overleveraged, and the open interest has also decreased, indicating a lack of significant activity in the market. Will BTC Reclaim The $30,000 Mark? Material Indicators, a leading cryptocurrency analytics provider, has analyzed the Weekly BTC/USDT chart, which shows bid liquidity moving up and ask liquidity moving down. According to Material Indicators, when bid and ask liquidity becomes more concentrated around a price point, it dampens volatility, leading to a sideways chop until one side makes a move. Per Material’s analysis, this type of price action differs from what was observed yesterday, as bids and asks were initially moving up, indicating a clear path for a pump. However, as things started getting “toppy,” asks began dropping down, ultimately dumping into the liquidity void created on the way up. Furthermore, CryptoCon, a leading provider of cryptocurrency analysis, has highlighted the recent drop in Bitcoin’s value, which saw a 15% decline. This drop has allowed the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator to reset slightly, as it nears dangerously close to hitting the Mid-Top .35 line. The CMF indicator is a technical analysis tool that measures buying and selling pressure in the market. When the CMF is above zero, buying pressure is stronger than selling pressure, and vice versa when it is below zero. The Mid-Top line at .35 represents the halfway point in the cycle for Bitcoin’s true gains. According to CryptoCon, the mid-top cycle for Bitcoin is approaching soon, but it is only half of the “true gains” for Bitcoin in a cycle. This means there is still significant potential for Bitcoin to experience further gains in the market. Related Reading: Filecoin Price Struggles To Move, Will It Surpass The $6 Barrier?

12150412,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528962,1682625656,PancakeSwap (CAKE) Plummets 24% Amidst Debate Over Reduced Staking Rewards,"PancakeSwap (CAKE) token holders have been on a roller coaster ride as stakers brace for reduced rewards. The community is debating a change in the token’s economic model. Over the past week, governance token, CAKE, has suffered a continuous downward trend, dropping by 24%. Though the proposed change appears favorable to PancakeSwap, the heated debate has impacted the token’s value. Community Debate Over Slashed Staking Rewards PancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built natively on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It allows users to trade cryptocurrencies, provide liquidity on trading pools, and earn rewards in the form of CAKE tokens. Though the DEX has gained popularity recently due to its low fees, fast transactions, and innovative features, the economic proposal has brought uncertainty to its investors. According to the proposal, the developers will reduce CAKE’s inflation rate from above 20% to 3-5%. Related Reading: PancakeSwap Voting To Make CAKE Deflationary, But Prices Are Free-falling This move is aimed at improving PancakeSwap’s “long-term health.” However, at the same time, it will lower the amount of tokens stakers can earn, leading to a decline in staking rewards. Voting for the proposal began on April 26 and is scheduled to conclude tomorrow, April 28th. The community has already given a thumbs up to the “aggressive reduction” of staking rewards, which would reduce more than half the number of tokens emitted. Notably, Staking rewards are a vital component of any cryptocurrency. They incentivize token holders to keep their tokens in a platform or wallet rather than sell them on the market. Staking rewards are similar to interest earned on savings in a bank account. PancakeSwap’s staking rewards have been a significant selling point for the project, ranging from 50% to 200% per annum, depending on the trading pool. The proposed change has sparked a debate within the community, with some arguing that reduced staking rewards will drive investors away from the project, leading to a decline in demand. Although the proposed change aims to enhance tokenomics by reducing the dilution of CAKE’s supply, it has led to an exodus of stakers. As a result, the token’s price has dropped concurrently with the amount of CAKE unstaked, as seen in the chart below. Meanwhile, the tokenomics change proposed by the team on April 19 has also significantly reduced staking activity. The amount of CAKE staked fell from 1.007 billion to 677.851 million CAKE as of April 27. CAKE Plummets 24% In A Week The PancakeSwap (CAKE) token has experienced a sharp decline of over 24% in the past week following the proposed proposal to reduce the token’s inflation rate. CAKE has dropped by 24% in the past seven days, from a high of $3.43 on April 20 to a low of $27.57 on April 27. The token’s market cap has also dropped from a high of $636 million to a low of $506 million over the same period. The sudden drop in CAKE’s price reflects the crypto community’s perception of the proposed change. If passed, the proposed change will significantly affect the project’s stakes earnings and likely reduce the token’s demand. Related Reading: CAKE Remains Under Pressure Despite PancakeSwap Dominating BSC The decline in staking activity has not only affected the token’s liquidity. But also resulted in a decrease in its trading volume, thereby leading to supporting the bearish trend.

The most-hyped event in the cryptosphere of the past two months was the ARB airdrop, when Arbitrum – a layer 2 rollup that allows users to transact on the Ethereum blockchain with lower fees – distributed its long-awaited token to early users, builders and investors.  Arbitrum’s creators said they built and distributed the ARB token as a way of decentralizing control of the network, handing the reins from Offchain Labs, the company that originally built Arbitrum, to the newly created Arbitrum DAO – a group comprised of newly-minted ARB token-holders.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  Abitrum’s decentralization narrative came under fire soon after the ARB airdrop, however, when the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) moved nearly $1 billion worth of its new tokens to the Arbitrum Foundation – an organization established to serve as a kind of formally registered steward of the Arbitrum DAO – before a formal vote on what to do with the funds had run its full course.  In a conversation with CoinDesk reporter Margaux Nijkerk at the Consensus 2023 conference on Thursday, Offchain Labs CEO Stephen Goldfeder referred to the incident – which sparked outrage in the Arbitrum community – as an “unfortunate miscommunication.”  In an explanation mirroring one provided by the Arbitrum Foundation earlier this month, Goldfeder told the audience at Consensus that a “ratification” vote on what to do with the funds – which was ongoing when the funds were transferred – sowed unnecessary confusion.  He hedged his response, however, by drawing a line between his company, Offchain Labs, and the new Arbitrum Foundation: “I can't speak to what the Foundation did, but leading up to creating this, that was the thought process at least,” Goldfeder said.  He also said the vote fiasco resulted in a pledge from the Foundation that it will give regular transparency reports regarding its operations and the use of its treasury.  “I as a community member think the place where this ended is even better,” said the Arbitrum co-founder. “The community seems happy and I also think, you know, transparency and accountability is a great thing.”  Although Offchain Labs is, formally speaking, distinct from the Arbitrum Foundation, it would seem reasonable to question if Labs – which built Arbitrum – might be pulling strings behind the scenes. If there was any takeaway from Goldeder’s address at Consensus, it was his acute awareness that this relationship between the two organizations – or lack thereof – remains top of mind for people trying to suss out whether Arbitrum is, in fact, decentralized.  Asked explicitly by Nijkerk whether Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation are linked, Goldfeder stressed that they were not. “Who controls the Arbitrum Foundation? It’s really actually the DAO and the token holders,” adding later that “the important thing I’d focus on is that the DAO is the most decentralized DAO that exists.”  When ARB launched, however, 44% of its initial token distribution went to Offchain Labs investors and employees. Asked by Nijkerk whether this large percentage of insider tokens undermines Arbitrum’s decentralization narrative, Goldfeder responded that “principle number one was there always has to be a majority in the hands of the community.”  “The counterside” of 44% of tokens going to insiders, according to Goldfeder, “is 56% were given to the community in different capacities: the airdrop, the foundation, the DAO, etcetera.”  Goldfeder added that all tokens granted to insiders were subjected to “four-year transfer restrictions” to prevent any kind of mass sell-off, “with nothing unlocking before one year.” He said that Offchain Labs employees are not allowed to vote on Arbitrum DAO governance proposals, though they are allowed to delegate their tokens to like-minded voters.  Repeatedly, Goldfeder placed the foundation at arm's length. “The foundation has a set of excellent people,” he said at one point, adding that “Offchain Labs gave them a lot of technical guidance as they were setting up, in servicing their goals,” but remains a distinct entity.  “There's a real community,” he said towards the end of the Consensus session. “When we say it's controlled by the community, the community is not me. It's not Offchain Labs. There's a massive community with many different interests and companies and protocols and projects that care deeply about this.”",NEGATIVE,ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | ARB | AIRDROP,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/27/arbitrum-co-founder-addresses-dao-vote-fiasco-waves-off-allegations-of-decentralization-theater,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3297b4785c0f76ca21a7752116e0f49b79f4b991-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It is currently showing a bearish trend. The daily chart indicates that SOL has lost almost 4% of its value. Over the past week, it has fallen by 5%, erasing most of its gains due to the recent decline in price. Additionally, the technical outlook for Solana is bearish. Demand has been falling as buyers have stayed away. SOL also depicted negative accumulation at the time of writing. Although SOL is currently heading in a bearish direction, there is still potential for a rally if it breaks through its overhead resistance level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales Unload Billions Amid SHIB Price Retreat However, this will require a return of demand for the altcoin and consistent trading of Bitcoin above the $28,000 mark. Continued consolidation for SOL could lead to a loss of its current support and a subsequent drop in value over future trading sessions. The market capitalization of Solana has also decreased, indicating increased selling pressure on the daily chart. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Solana was priced at $21.57. Its overhead resistance level was identified at $23.30, which also serves as crucial as it has previously acted as a sell zone for the coin. If SOL manages to surpass this resistance level, it could potentially reach $26. This will result in a price appreciation of almost 22%. Conversely, a decline from the current price level would push Solana down to $20 and eventually $18. The trading volume of Solana in the last session decreased, indicating a drop in demand for the altcoin at the time of writing. It is important to note that breaching the $23.30 resistance level would require a resurgence of demand for SOL. Technical Analysis Over the past week, demand for the altcoin has remained low, causing buyers to lose confidence, especially after its fall from the $23 level. At the time of writing, the Relative Strength Index indicated that selling strength had surpassed buying strength, as it was below the 50 mark. Additionally, SOL dropped below the 20-SMA line, signaling that sellers had taken control of the market. However, there is still a possibility for a bullish market if buyers make a slight push, allowing Solana to rise above the 50-SMA line. This move could attract more buyers and revive confidence in the altcoin. On the one-day chart, SOL showed sell signals that are consistent with other technical indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which reflects price momentum, has formed red histograms that indicate sell signals for the altcoin. This signals a bearish price trend.

But that relationship hit a rough patch in November, when a CoinDesk investigation revealed the now-bankrupt exchange might be on shaky financial footing.

42420675,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqWcf,1682620450,"The Case for Regulating, Not Banning, Crypto","American University professor Hilary Allen, who recently wrote an article titled “The Case for Banning Crypto"" in the influential publication Foreign Affairs, is part of a very small cohort of “crypto banners” working toward that end. In addition to engaging the media, Allen and her peers are pushing the argument that crypto does more harm than good while speaking with federal agencies. She is testifying before the congressional hearing on ""the future of digital assets"" Thursday afternoon.  Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, is speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus conference. You can register to attend or livestream the event here.  The case for banning crypto is a pipe dream. It won't happen. By Allen’s own admission, blockchain is a general purpose “database” technology that supports a trillion-dollar industry employing thousands globally. Nonetheless, the efforts to ban, rather than regulate, crypto have only backfired and harmed Americans.  Banning crypto is simply the wrong policy – the crypto industry instead could and should be effectively regulated.  No use case for banning crypto  A complete ban of crypto is an unattainable distraction by the industry’s naysayers, as Congress, the courts and the international community have already rejected the idea. Indeed, many in Congress support embracing and regulating crypto. This includes the Republican House leadership and heads of the most relevant economic committees – the House Financial Services Committee and House Committee on Agriculture. They work alongside progressive Democrats such as Reps. Richie Torres (D-N.Y.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).  Additionally, multiple U.S. senators have been willing to introduce bipartisan legislation on this issue, such as Sens. Kirstin Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.). These officials could block any attempts to quash crypto, because the number seeking to regulate crypto significantly outnumber those calling for an outright ban. Similarly, the White House has written that it seeks to work with Congress to regulate, not ban, crypto.  The courts are the next insurmountable obstacle. As Allen knows, Congress simply won’t agree with her, and so she cheers on the efforts of allies at administrative agencies such as the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission and banking regulators. But the courts would gut these efforts.  Over the past several years, the Supreme Court has reined in agencies operating beyond congressional mandate. First, agencies cannot make “decisions of vast economic and political significance” unless Congress has said “clearly” that “it wishes to assign” that power “to an agency.” This is known as the ""major questions"" doctrine, and was recently invoked in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2022.  Banning crypto – an industry that supports tens of thousands of American jobs – is a major economic question requiring Congress, not just the SEC or banking regulators, to answer.  Additionally, the SEC has failed to engage in any kind of rulemaking on crypto, and instead has resorted to bringing individual enforcement actions. The SEC’s authority here, by its own admission, is “transaction by transaction,” not technology by technology, and so a ban on crypto via enforcement action would require the SEC to prove that each digital asset is a security and even that each transaction is a security offering, one by one, in court.  See also: It's Not Just Fraud That Chilled Crypto Regulation  Since there are already thousands of tokens, it would likely take 400 years to get through these lawsuits against all existing tokens, according to the math of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. The SEC has been in litigation against just one company, Ripple, for over two years. This kind of extended litigation could be the reason for the SEC’s $411 million shortfall last year, a number that would surely only rise were the SEC to continue its futile efforts to pick off the industry one by one. So reality again gets in the way.  Finally, crypto is global and other countries won't agree to ban crypto. Indeed, several nations are vying to be the capital of crypto, seeing the benefits of embracing – and regulating – a nascent industry. Those nations include the U.K., Singapore, Japan and France, along with the entire European Union, which passed a comprehensive and thoughtful Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation framework last week.  U.S. efforts to ban crypto will make it only easier for these jurisdictions to compete for American talent. Moreover, even if crypto companies leave the United States for greener regulatory pastures, it is unlikely that crypto would be “banned” for U.S. consumers seeking to access those platforms. Both FTX and Binance, two “foreign” crypto exchanges that ostensibly geofenced U.S. users had a large number of U.S. users using virtual private networks, shell companies and other methods.  “Banning” crypto in the United States means that foreign companies reimport even more – and less controllable – risk back into the United States. The International Monetary Fund has asserted that “comprehensive regulations are preferred to blanket bans,” because blanket bans may “stifle innovation,” “drive illicit activities underground,” “be costly to enforce” and motivate users to access “illegal markets.”  Americans harmed  There has been a real cost to the obsession to ban crypto by figures like Allen and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).  Their misguided focus caused them to miss the real risks in the financial system that led to the collapse of three banks within a week (Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank). According to Nellie Liang, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, crypto didn't play a direct role in any of those bank failures.  Yet the bank failures threatened the faith in the nation's banking system and could have destabilized the global economy in a way that none of the cryptocurrency failures could. The Senate Banking Committee, where Elizabeth Warren sits and which has jurisdiction on this issue, held 33 hearings last year. Four were on crypto, although the nation’s systemic-risk watchdog concluded crypto doesn't pose a systemic risk. Not one hearing was held on the banking system’s safety and soundness or the specific risks that banks pose.  Beyond missing the eventually realized risk of bank collapses, crypto banners also failed to protect Americans from the main bad actors in the cryptocurrency sector itself. Allen cheers on SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, but most of the largest crypto scams and failures harming Americans have happened during his watch, not those of his predecessors.  Gensler has been a remarkably ineffective “cop on the beat.” For example, Gensler missed the collapse of the now infamous exchange FTX. The banking regulators and the SEC, cheered on by Allen, have exhibited a clear pattern of misallocating resources away from real risks like banking collapses and crypto scammers, and focusing their limited resources on attacking the crypto industry as a whole, including its safest actors.  Is crypto worth it?  So the crypto banners are chasing a pipe dream and harming Americans. But are they right in theory? Do the harms of crypto clearly outweigh the benefits?  No, the benefits of crypto outweigh the harms (which could have been prevented by to good regulation). Further, the financial harms caused by crypto are overstated and not unique to the industry.  Allen writes: “The root of the problem is that cryptocurrency assets can be created at no cost and without limit, and an unlimited supply of assets makes a system more vulnerable to booms and busts.” This sentence captures the essence of Allen’s argument, and it's worth unpacking the weakness of her assumptions and arguments. Crypto’s root problem, according to Allen, is what economists call “zero marginal costs” – the idea that the cost to produce each additional unit of a good or service typically approaches zero.  Calls to ban crypto – or leave it entirely unregulated – merely distract from ... important efforts.  This type of cost structure isn't unique to crypto and is well-understood in economic literature. Many assets can be created at no cost without limit, including most software, broadcast radio or TV reception, digital books, digital articles (such as this one), digital songs and even emails in a marketing campaign. This prevalent cost structure evidently doesn't lead inexorably to booms and busts.  Investment assets, including the shares of publicly traded companies, may be created at “no cost” and “without limit.” Any company, following the usual corporate governance that crypto companies usually follow, can decide to issue a nearly infinite number of shares without cost. Every startup in America could decide tomorrow to issue billions more shares, and that would likely not lead to economic calamity, because the booms and busts turn on people being willing to buy those shares.  Finally, an overwhelming majority of the volume and value in cryptocurrency is in a handful of tokens that are created at great cost (not “no cost”) and with clear limits (not “without” them). Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and one of the top stablecoins, USDC, account for over 70% of volume.  One bitcoin costs roughly $17,700, not $0, to mine, and there isn't an unlimited supply, but instead a hard cap of 21 million tokens. Unlike with shares, no single company can increase the total number of bitcoin. Ethereum has a negative supply schedule, and so its native token, ether, decreases in supply. USDC is backed by dollars, one to one, held in regulated banks. All of these assets, which account for most of the volume in the crypto ecosystem, aren't created at no cost and without limit, and so Allen's “root” argument doesn’t apply to 70% of the market.  In short, the “root problem” of crypto Allen puts forward isn't an economic problem at all. It is common across many digital and some non-digital goods, applies to stock certificates and doesn't even apply to most of the value in the cryptocurrency industry.  Crypto's benefits  Turning away from a discussion of crypto's harms, Allen dramatically undersells blockchain's benefits. She writes, “Many of the most hyped innovations, including central bank digital currencies, do not require a blockchain at all. Blockchain technology itself has extremely limited utility. The consensus mechanisms that make blockchains work are inherently less efficient and more costly than centralized alternatives.”  Once again, the assumptions do most of the work. First, central bank digital currencies aren't one of the most hyped innovations. They are unpopular in the crypto community and elsewhere. In fact, House Republicans recently introduced the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, a bill that would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC without further congressional approval. Second, crypto users understand that there are trade-offs between efficiency and decentralization, just as there may be trade-offs between efficiency and many other qualities that are at times desirable, such as democracy or pluralistic decision making.  See also: Who Really Benefits From CBDCs? It's Not the Public  Despite innovation being constrained by continued regulatory uncertainty, crypto networks are already having a positive global impact. For example, crypto has been an inflation hedge for many struggling families holding hyperinflationary non-dollar currencies, including millions of desperate Turks, Venezuelans, Afghans, Argentinians, Ethiopians and Nigerians.  Or look to humanitarian uses: Many refugees fled with their own assets in crypto wallets and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees dispersed humanitarian aid to displaced Ukrainians via stablecoins, even as banks were in disarray.  Turning to creators and artists, non-fungible tokens enable people to effectively own digital art. NFTs are a roughly $15 billion market and benefit both collectors and the artists. Crypto networks are changing the internet itself – an internet that's now dominated by a few private companies.  Indeed, several crypto projects have introduced blockchain protocols designed to be open-source alternatives to the corporate giants, including for data storage, such as Filecoin. Blockchains also enable databases where users can control their own identity and data and easily port it to new social-media applications, such as a potentially decentralized Twitter, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s Blue Sky project and the Lens Protocol.  Finally, the crypto industry is ushering in a new era of trusted, open finance. Many decentralized-finance applications remove trusted intermediaries and replace them with transparent software. Decentralized exchange Uniswap, which pioneered automated-market-maker functions, enables 24/7 trading (rather than 40 hours a week).  Exchanges like Uniswap also offer transparent pricing and supply (rather than the dark pools of money flows in traditional finance), as well as instant settlement than many centralized exchanges. In fact, at least two multi-government international projects (known as Project Guardian and Project Mariana) are using variations of the Uniswap protocol for experiments in foreign-exchange trading (which a study by crypto researchers suggests may be highly efficient) and tokenized bonds.  How should countries regulate crypto?  Despite a lack of regulatory clarity in some countries including the United States, figuring out how to regulate crypto is not an insurmountable challenge. For example, the European Union passed MiCA, which is a framework requiring disclosure through white papers and exchange registrations. Additionally, several groups of bipartisan senators and congressmen have proposed comprehensive or partial frameworks.  As these efforts show, good-faith actors can come together across party lines and land on a proposal that would foster innovation and access while stamping out the real fraud, manipulation and security risks.

42420662,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqWQH,1682620074,"SEC Is Alleging Legal Violations ‘On the Fly,' Coinbase Says","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is making decisions about alleged legal violations “on the fly,” crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) said Thursday.  The San Francisco-headquartered platform pushed back against the SEC in a document this month, made public for the first time on Thursday, in responding to a Wells Notice – a formal warning from the SEC that the Enforcement Division found sufficient proof of lawbreaking that it may recommend a lawsuit against the exchange.  Much of Coinbase’s arguments rest on the idea that cryptocurrencies listed on the exchange are not securities – a sharp contrast to claims by SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has repeatedly stated that, in his view, the majority of digital assets do indeed meet the standards of a security under federal law. Other arguments outlined in the document say that even if certain digital assets listed on the exchange are securities, Coinbase’s own products don’t meet the standards for securities law violations.  The SEC warned Coinbase last month it could sue when it filed the notice. The SEC claims Coinbase’s staking service, Prime and Wallet products, along with its general listing process, may all violate federal securities law.  In a video shared earlier on Thursday, Gensler reiterated his view that crypto intermediaries must register as regulated entities in the U.S. “Crypto markets suffer from a lack of regulatory compliance. It's not a lack of regulatory clarity,” he said.  “An investment contract exists when you invest money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others. Intermediaries for investment contracts, whether they're exchanges, brokers, dealers, clearinghouses, they need to comply with the securities laws and register with the Securities and Exchange Commission,” he said. “Instead, many crypto platforms are just pretending that these investment contracts that they offer are more like goldfish,” using an analogy about pets.  In its response, which was filed on April 19 to the regulator, Coinbase said it had “repeatedly” answered SEC staff questions about how it determined whether listed assets were securities or not. The exchange also pushed back against SEC allegations that it was simultaneously operating a national securities exchange, brokerage and clearinghouse.  “The threat of imminent litigation appears to be intended to pressure Coinbase to accept demands that the Commission simply does not have the authority to order; namely, that Coinbase (i) agree that virtually all digital assets listed on Coinbase’s platform are securities; and (ii) overhaul its entire business model to register as an NSE [national securities exchange] and clearing agency, potentially requiring Coinbase to jettison its entire customer-facing business and overhaul its public company governance structure to conform to limits on concentrated voting control of NSEs and clearing agencies,” the exchange argued. “Neither of those objectives is supported by law or within the bounds of the Commission’s authority.”  As part of its response, Coinbase created a video featuring CEO Brian Armstrong and General Counsel Paul Grewal talking through the exchange’s history.  Grewal told CoinDesk that representatives from the exchange had met with officials from the SEC after filing the response. Any SEC enforcement action will need a majority of the five commissioners to vote in favor. The benefit of a Wells response is that these commissioners will have both the Enforcement Division’s argument and the company’s response when they decide how to vote, he said.  “Our sense is they remain unpersuaded at the staff level,” he said. “We're fully preparing for litigation, just to be very clear, and have been doing so for some time. I always remain optimistic that cooler heads will prevail but you should not be under any illusion that we are holding out any hope that somehow the SEC will change its mind.”  Operating licenses  Coinbase already owns both a broker-dealer and alternative trading system (ATS), but needs SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approval to operate them, the company said. It also said it had 45 money transmitter licenses, a New York BitLicense and a designated contract market.  The exchange has also asked a number of questions of the SEC, including about its asset listing process, the Wallet product and its staking services. The SEC has now alleged that all three of these types of products may be in violation of securities laws, the exchange said.  “A chronology of just some of Coinbase’s efforts to engage with the Commission over four years spans eight pages and is attached as Appendix A. This list includes dozens of instances in which Coinbase sought clarity from the Commission on when registration might be required for digital asset companies and, if so, how to effect such registration, including with respect to its dormant broker-dealer and ATS,” the filing said.  According to the filing, Coinbase provided information in response to SEC staff questions about all three of these types of products, but “the staff raised no concerns during” meetings about the products.  The exchange also argued it did not receive “fair notice” from the regulator about the enforcement action, arguing repeatedly in the document that “one media statement by a member of the Commission is not policy guidance.”  “We’ve seen the SEC shift its position on what assets qualify as securities. You have statements from the chair himself dating back to his time at MIT where he states that 75% of assets was not a security. Even after he became chair he said he believed there was no registration framework in place and was willing to work with Congress,” Grewal said.  Coinbase’s filing argued that the SEC could provide further rulemaking to clarify how it sees digital assets as securities.  “If the Commission wants to consider how issuer disclosure, brokerage, custody, clearing, and related issues can work in the digital asset securities markets, Coinbase remains available to discuss these issues – and is keen to do so – at any time,” the filing said. “These issues need not, and should not, be addressed before a court.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/27/sec-is-alleging-legal-violations-on-the-fly-coinbase-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9cddcf0832f6b69baf2d60826017d46c112f92f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Avalanche Struggles Under $18 – More Losses Seem Likely When writing on April 27, AVAX is down 18% from April 2023 highs of around $20 and down roughly 10% in the last trading week, according to CoinMarketCap data. Although the market uptrend of April 26 temporarily forced AVAX higher, buyers on April 27 didn’t follow through. AVAX remains below the local resistance at $18 but above last week’s support at around $16. However, from a broader perspective, AVAX is up 25% from March 2023 lows and has gained 65% from December 2022 lows. The impressive performance was a huge boost for AVAX, a coin that plunged 88% from November 2021 peaks when it was changing hands at around $145. Based on the current AVAX formation, it is yet to be seen whether fundamental events will trigger demand and push the coin above $20, reversing this week’s losses. Circle Launches Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol For USDC Transfer The decision by Circle to develop and launch a mainnet protocol for bidirectional cross-chain transfers between Ethereum and Avalanche will be convenient for users. It could also boost decentralized finance (DeFi) activities in Avalanche since users don’t have to use a third party, effectively eradicating the need for bridges and helping consolidate the web3 ecosystem. This would also have a significant effect on general liquidity on the Avalanche blockchain. Avalanche is suited for the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) dapps and as of April 27, the blockchain managed over $798 million as measured by the total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama. Aave, a lending protocol available in, among other chains, Ethereum, is the largest DeFi dapp by TVL, managing $262 million. Besides liquidity, considering the mega hacks of 2022, for example, the Ronin and BNB Chain Bridge hacks, the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) also boosts security for users and DeFi protocols.

""Our partnership with CoinFund creates such a foundational piece of infrastructure to crypto-asset markets,"" Alan Campbell, president of CoinDesk Indices, said in the press release. ""Drawing on our experience managing the longest-running and largest benchmarked crypto indices globally, we're excited to launch CESR, a building block for crypto-based finance.""  The launch of CESR helps create the market infrastructure to allow for a forward rate curve and a discount rate – which are pillars of traditional finance (TradFi) used to value assets – and it allows for digital assets to be priced in relation to CESR.  Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at fund manager Franklin Templeton, said in the release that his firm is ""very excited about the launch of CESR"" because it opens new pathways for the industry, particularly for TradFi firms intrigued by crypto.

Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 on Thursday, Prime Minister Philip Davis said his country hasn't lost its “zeal for being at the forefront of the digital-assets industry,” despite FTX’s failure and alleged fraud. FTX's headquarters was in the Bahamas at the time of its demise.  Davis also lauded the strength of the Bahamas’ recently overhauled regulatory framework and pushed back against widespread sentiments that FTX’s alleged fraud went undiscovered for a long time because of lax regulations in the Bahamas.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  The prime minister said that the “events, which led to the collapse of FTX,” had nothing to do with Bahamian laws and that any assertion to the contrary was “inconsistent with the facts.”  In fact, Davis said that, while the collapse of FTX was a disappointment and a “shock,” he wouldn’t change the past.  “I don’t think we would have done anything different than we did,” Davis said, when asked whether he felt he had been tricked by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. “[Sam Bankman-Fried] put my jurisdiction on the map.”  Davis said the country’s new crypto regulations seek to provide regulatory clarity to crypto companies, which he hopes will bring more companies to the island nation.  “When it comes to the digital-assets sector, we are open for business,” Davis said. “If you are looking for a jurisdiction where you can confidently invest, look no further than the Bahamas.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/27/bahamian-prime-minister-says-he-doesnt-regret-ftx-says-sbf-put-his-country-on-the-map-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b1012446e791878739f72c6a01df8df6e3b2d06-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""With the introduction of [Robinhood] Connect, customers will be able to access their Robinhood credentials and bypass additional steps,"" the firm said in a statement.  Robinhood Connect is already live with MyDoge, Giddy and Slingshot wallets, while integration with other wallets such as Exodus and Phantom are coming soon, Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood Crypto, said during ""A New Crypto Arrow in Robinhood’s Quiver"" – a live conversation with CoinDesk Reporter Ian Allison – at Consensus 2023.

Robinhood is aiming to address this challenge with its rollout. ""Crypto and Web3 have the potential to change the future of the financial system for the better, but we recognize there are still significant hurdles preventing broader adoption,"" Kerbrat said.  ""Our conviction in the future of Web3 remains strong, and we’ve continued to build new products that put the accessibility and usability of crypto front and center for customers, positioning Robinhood as the lowest cost, easiest to use on-ramp to crypto,"" he added.  The trading platform is also revamping its Robinhood Crypto, its own app to buy and sell crypto with a zero commission fee.

This recent trend has attracted investors and traders closely monitoring its price movement. However, the coin struggles to break through the important $6 resistance. The question now is, will Filecoin be able to break the $6 barrier? What’s the future potential of Filecoin? Notably, FIL trading volume surged significantly in 24 hours. This volume indicates increased network activity which might later push FIL price if the crypto market breaks from the current downtrend. Filecoin Recorded Price Dips, What’s The Current Sentiment? Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network created by Protocol Labs. Users pay storage miners to guarantee that their files are correctly and securely preserved over time. The Filecoin blockchain keeps track of transactions to verify file storage. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Sudden swings in the value of digital assets occur frequently. Being a player in this market, Filecoin has seen increased selling momentum and downward movement. Related Reading: MATIC Price Prediction: Polygon Recovery Faces Many Hurdles FIL has experienced some significant drop in price over the past few days, affecting its overall market sentiment and current price movement. But with the Fear & Greed Index of 61 (Greed), the current sentiment is positive. However, given that the price is in a zone where investors are likely to want to sell down, this suggests that there might be a potential price reversal. The trend reversed due to a shift in direction in the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) on 17 April 2023, and this may continue if bullish momentum remains weak. The SMA indicator is frequently used to spot trends, resistance and support levels, and probable buy/sell signals. By crossing below the 200-day SMA, the 50-day SMA has also formed a death cross, which might be a bearish signal and suggest a potential selling opportunity. The RSI is closely below the neutral zone, indicating the selling momentum is still high. However, the buyers are trying to build strength. Watch closely for a possible trend revisal. Filecoin Key Support And Resistance Zones On 23 April 2023, the Filecoin price dropped by 17.35%, making the coin fall to a support level of $5.117. The banking crisis’s impact on the financial market also affected the price movement of altcoins. Related Reading: Polygon Exchange Supply Spikes, More Downtrend Incoming? FIL could drop another 15%, reaching a month-long low of $4.79, if the panic persists and the altcoin breaches the crucial support level at $4.990. Filecoin trades between support and resistance levels of $5.46 and $5.8. The first significant resistance level for FIL is $6.388. If the price moves above the current point, the coin will reach the next resistance levels, at $8.34 and $9.24.

42420654,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqWL7,1682612622,Russian Bitcoin Wallets Allegedly Exposed by Apparent Hacker,"A mysterious bitcoiner appears to have weaponized the Bitcoin blockchain against the Russian state by exposing hundreds of wallets allegedly held by security agencies, according to crypto tracing firm Chainalysis.  The unknown individual used a feature in how the Bitcoin blockchain documents transactions to identify 986 wallets controlled by the Foreign Military Intelligence Agency (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and Federal Security Service (FSB), Chainalysis, which works closely with the U.S. government, said in a post shared with CoinDesk. Written in Russian, the vigilante’s messages accuse the wallets of being involved in hacking activity.  It’s not clear whether the individual’s allegations are true; the three agencies did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. What’s more clear is the individual took control of at least some of the addresses they allege to be held by Russia, perhaps through hacking, or even (if the allegations are to be believed) an inside job.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  Leveled in the weeks preceding Russia’s unprovoked February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the allegations amount to an unexpected crypto twist in a conflict that’s already had plenty. Ukraine’s own government has used crypto to raise tens of millions of dollars for its war effort. Some of the allegedly Russia-held wallets tied up in Chainalysis’ research even sent money to Ukraine.  Bolstering the mystery bitcoiner’s allegations, Chainalysis says at least three of the allegedly Russian wallet addresses have been linked to Russia by third parties before. Two of them were said to be involved in the Solarwinds attack and a third paid for servers used in Russia’s 2016 election disinformation campaign.  Chainalysis also said the bitcoiner’s spending habits suggest they were serious about their claims. The individual effectively destroyed over $300,000 worth of bitcoin while describing their allegations to the blockchain – far more than necessary to make use of the Bitcoin blockchain’s OP_RETURN field.  “The fact that the OP_RETURN sender was both willing and able to burn hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of bitcoin in order to spread their message makes it more likely in our opinion that their information is accurate,” Chainalysis said in a press release.  After Russia invaded Ukraine the sender stopped making the inscriptions. They later resumed their activity by instead sending Russia-linked bitcoin to Ukrainian aid addresses.  If the allegations are to be believed, the addresses and any bitcoin they contain are more or less off the table, from a security standpoint. Chainalysis said  The possibility that the OP_RETURN sender acquired private keys for Russian-controlled addresses also suggests that the Putin regime’s crypto operations aren’t secure.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/27/russian-bitcoin-wallets-allegedly-exposed-by-apparent-hacker,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14ada4d35c12abfc9942c070bca2c2667a41d0c3-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the bulls were recently able to break above an important resistance level. Despite this recent bullish action, the daily chart showed a 6% depreciation and on the weekly chart, LINK had a 9% loss. The technical outlook looked bleak with fading demand and low accumulation. Nevertheless, if LINK can remain above the $7 mark, another rebound may be possible. As Bitcoin displayed mild bullish sentiment after reclaiming the $28,000 mark, most altcoins exhibited similar behaviors. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Inflows Trigger Drop Below $2,080: Will It Slide Lower This Week? If BTC retraces in the next trading sessions, LINK is expected to move closer to its immediate support level. Maintaining buying strength is crucial for the asset to stay above its local price floor. The market capitalization of LINK had fallen, indicating that sellers were more active. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, Chainlink was trading at $7.02, with its immediate resistance at $7.40. If the altcoin manages to surpass this resistance, it will encounter a tough price ceiling of $7.70, and reaching that level may revive the bulls. Conversely, failing to stay above the $7 mark will pull Chainlink down to $6.80. If this happens, LINK may decline by up to 15%, nearing the $5.80 mark. The last session saw a decrease in the amount of LINK traded, and indicators suggested that buying strength was weakening. Technical Analysis Chainlink had experienced a sharp drop in buyers’ interest after encountering significant resistance at $7.70. However, demand for the altcoin could partially return if it moves above the $7.00 price mark. The Relative Strength Index was below the half-line, hovering around 40, indicating that sellers had taken control of the market. Additionally, LINK had fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, signaling that sellers were driving the price momentum at press time. If demand picks up, LINK could rise above the 50-SMA line (yellow), providing some relief to the bulls. In line with the other technical indicators, LINK displayed sell signals, indicating a bearish turn in price. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) demonstrates an asset’s price momentum and trend reversals as well. The MACD formed red histograms below the half-line, signaling a sell signal for the asset. The Parabolic SAR reads the price direction and changes in the same. The indicator formed dotted lines above the price candlesticks, suggesting a downtrend in the price.

12138308,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528887,1682607650,"Bitcoin Accumulation: HODLers Are Buying 15,000 BTC Per Month","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin HODLers are currently displaying net accumulation behavior, as they grow their holdings by 15,000 BTC per month. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Accumulating Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, these investors were previously aggressively distributing during the bear market lows. The HODLers, or more formally, the “long-term holders” (LTHs), make up a Bitcoin cohort that includes all investors that have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago. The LTHs make up one of the two main holder groups in the market; the other cohort is called the “short-term holder” (STH) group and naturally includes only investors that bought their BTC less than 155 days ago. Statistically speaking, the longer a holder owns a coin, the less likely they become to sell it at any point. This means that the LTHs are the more resolute bunch of the two groups, which is why they are called the “HODLers” or the diamond hands of the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: NVT Golden Cross Enters Overbought Zone As these investors are an important part of the sector, their movements can be worth tracking. An indicator called the “HODLer net position change” measures the monthly rate at which these investors are buying or selling a net amount of Bitcoin right now. The chart below shows the trend in this metric over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been green in recent months | Source: Glassnode on Twitter When the HODLer net position change has a positive value, it means these investors are receiving inflows into their holdings currently. On the other hand, negative values suggest a net number of coins are exiting the supply of the LTHs. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin HODLer net position change had a deep red value during the bear market lows that followed the November 2022 FTX crash. This means that the LTHs had been selling during this period. This sharp negative spike has been an exception to the long-term trend, however, as the HODLers have actually been showing an overall strong accumulation behavior over the past couple of years. The last time these investors participated in consistent distribution was during the bull rally in the first half of 2021. From the chart, it’s visible that after the aforementioned brief period of distribution at the bear market lows, the LTHs switched back to accumulation just before the current rally began. Related Reading: This Highly Profitable Bitcoin Cross Has Just Formed Again These diamond hands have continued to add to their holdings throughout the rally so far, showing that they haven’t been allured by the profit-taking opportunity. This can be a bullish sign for the long-term sustainability of the rally. Though, very recently, the monthly amount that they have been adding to their holdings has been trending down. Nonetheless, the indicator’s value still remains positive, as the Bitcoin LTHs are accumulating at a rate of 15,000 BTC per month currently.

""Crypto users understand now, more than ever, that there are serious risks with a third-party holding their tokens for them,"" Giddy said in its statement.

42420688,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYSD,1682607170,The U.S. Should Lead the Digital Future of Money,"It has been almost four years since the end of my term as chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. During my administration, the Commission green-lighted the launch of bitcoin [BTC] futures trading. It is still today the only legal, liquid, transparent and fully regulated crypto product trading in the United states. The success of bitcoin futures is proof that U.S. regulators can engage successfully with crypto – if they have the will to do so.  My proudest accomplishment while in government, however, was thwarting an Obama Administration proposal to allow regulators to seize trading software source code without a subpoena. To this day, I take a backseat to no one in defending in both words and deeds Americans’ rights to privacy against unlawful government intrusion.  J. Christopher Giancarlo previously served as the 13th chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He is also co-founder and executive chairman of the Digital Dollar Project, a not-for-profit initiative to advance exploration of a U.S. central bank digital currency. The following is an abridged version of Giancarlo’s speech during “Consensus: Money Reimagined Summit,” in Austin, Texas. The author’s views are his own.  Upon returning to the private sector, I co-founded the Digital Dollar Project. My colleagues and I saw the need for a neutral forum bringing together both the private and public sectors to discuss and consider the opportunities and challenges of digital money, especially, that based on the U.S. dollar.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  As I say in my recent book, “CryptoDad – the Fight for the Future of Money,” money is too important to be left to central bankers. And, by that I mean no disrespect. It is just that money is as much a social construct, as it is a government one. The success of fiat money derives from the trust and consent of the ordinary citizens who place value in it. The public has every right, if not a duty, to engage in discussion over what characteristics should be present in a digital dollar.  And that is what we do at the Digital Dollar Project – foster discussion and experimentation about a U.S. CBDC [central bank digital currency]. We ask what values – not only monetary ones but social, civil and constitutional ones – should it possess. Values like increased financial inclusion and personal empowerment. Values like the proper role of law-enforcement balanced against the constitutional right to individual privacy and economic freedom.  And we’re adamant that the U.S. should NOT deploy a U.S. CBDC – or digital dollar – before we know what that CBDC might look like. How can we support deployment until we know the exact form of CBDC to be deployed?  But we do call for the U.S. to assert strong leadership in CBDC experimentation at home and global standard setting abroad that is not subordinate to America’s economic competitors and geo-political adversaries.  Digital currency is coming  When we founded the Project three years ago, we were ahead of the curve in seeing the direction of both sovereign and non-sovereign digital currency. Now we are in the middle of it. The champion model that the Project published in 2020 is the most common form of CBDC being examined today by the world’s democracies.  Today, over a hundred foreign governments, representing over 95% of global GDP are today exploring various forms of central bank digital currency. That includes 19 of the G-20, with China placing its digital yuan, the eCNY, in over 240 million digital wallets. The ECB set to begin deploying a digital euro by 2025. And the Bank of England is proposing to roll out a digital pound by the end of the decade.  Whether or not the U.S. adopts a digital dollar, American citizens and American multinational corporations are going to be dealing with CBDCs in the years to come. Barring the U.S. from CBDC exploration will neither hinder nor stop the global deployment of CBDCs.  Here in the U.S., a lot of attention has been drawn to stablecoins with the reintroduction of congressional stablecoin legislation. Some believe that “…regulated stablecoins can provide American consumers and financial institutions with the speed and reliability of 21st century technology, with all the safeguards against authoritarianism that Americans require.” That may well be true. But there is no guarantee and, certainly, no Constitutional requirement to guarantee privacy.  What is clear is that both sovereign and nonsovereign digital currencies are coming, and coming quickly. Thus, the fashionable debate between CBDCs and stablecoins is already passé. It was always a false choice and now it is moot. The future will contain both sovereign and non-sovereign digital currency. Americans – even Floridians – will not be able to shield themselves from it.  Digital currency: Promise and peril  The possible benefits of digital currency are many. They include programmable, instantaneous round-the-clock payments at much lower cost, and greater access to financial services for both retail and wholesale participants. Digital currency may strengthen the ability of governments to implement benefits policy, allowing direct infusions of money across economies and vastly improving the administration of payments compared to inadequate U.S. efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic to issue paper checks to people locked up at home without access to bank accounts.  Our vision for digital currency is nothing less than the prospect of fully networked and integrated economies with digital currencies as operating systems and digital tokens as their value components. In the same way that 19th century railroad and telegraph technology weaved together North America’s disconnected regional economies into a continental economy (the power and influence of which had never been felt before), digital currency holds the promise of directly linking the world’s many disparate, self-contained silos of financial activity into one or more global, digital currency-based, financial system networks. A well-designed digital currency can serve as a digital operating system – a Microsoft OS – for a fully-networked digital economy with far greater efficiency, transparency and access than ever before.  The global powers that realize this vision will gain a huge advantage in the digital networked future. The economic power prize is enormous. It will drive the creation of massive-scale, singular currency platforms operated in many cases by central banks and governments and perhaps, in other cases, by commercial technology companies and stablecoin operators.  Those digital currencies that prevail – both government and commercial – will be gathering points for massive amounts of data about the economic and financial activities of users, citizens and voters.  Many thoughtful people on both sides of the political aisle are appropriately concerned about misuse of such stockpiles of financial data wreaking havoc on financial privacy and economic liberty. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is not wrong to be concerned. In 2022, Congressman Tom Emmer [R-Minn.] thoughtfully introduced legislation focused on CBDC privacy.  Earlier this month, the House Financial Services Committee introduced a stablecoin bill that raises similar concerns about privacy in CBDCs. Strangely, the legislation contains not a single provision protecting Americans’ economic privacy when it comes to stablecoins. That is a grave oversight.  Let’s be clear: There is nothing inherently superior about non-sovereign digital currency in protecting individual privacy compared to CBDC. Nothing whatsoever. Both will be massive “honeypots” of users’ financial data, creating the opportunity for wide scale mischief and abuse.  It is entirely foreseeable that private-sector sponsors of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins or even commercial servicers of digital dollars, such as wallet providers and others, could be put under government pressure to conduct surveillance, report on activity and disable financial transactions with disfavored groups and activities in the same way that the U.S. government has had full access to everything on Twitter, including private direct messages between users.  Fit-for-purpose stablecoin legislation must protect American citizens’ privacy rights. In democratic societies, lawful transactions in digital money – sovereign or non-sovereign – must be immune from political surveillance and censorship regardless of who is in power today, four years from now, and 10 years from now.  That is why the advent of both stablecoins and a digital dollar offers us the opportunity to reassess contemporary financial surveillance activities in their entirety. The transition from analog to digital is the chance to embed individual privacy as a verifiable design element of money. It provides the opportunity to reestablish financial law enforcement in more true accord with American constitutional norms, the presumption of innocence and the rule of law.  Money is power, and the digital future of money is upon us. The trajectory of the world is towards the creation of massive-scale, singular currency platforms operated in many cases by central banks and governments and, in other cases, by commercial technology companies and stablecoin operators. Financial power arrangements worldwide will be revamped. The informal currency “zones” of the past will yield to highly integrated, digital currency networks of the future.  The world will have CBDCs and stablecoins whether we like it or not, and whether the U.S. chooses to lead or follow. The question is not whether the digital future of money can be forestalled. It cannot. The question is whether surveillance coins of authoritarian governments will have the digital future to themselves, or whether they will encounter competition from freedom-protected digital currency endorsed by venerable democracies like the United States.  The choice between CBDCs and stablecoins is a false choice. The choice is between financial freedom and financial control. The question is whether these new forms of digital currency and the digital network economies they power will make societies more open, prosperous, and free. Will they empower or enslave humanity in the digital future of money?  I think Americans have and have always had something important to say about that choice. Once again, the United States must assert its time-tested democratic principles in a world seeking a sound foundation for a new future. The choice between freedom and servility in the digital future of money is being made now. We Americans have a role to play. The call to action has sounded.  Digital currencies that effectively protect financial privacy in lawful transactions will be the world’s most desired. The country that deploys it will win the economic power prize.  Let’s make sure that country is the United States.  With the engagement of a free citizenry, American technological innovation and some political vision, U.S. leadership in fostering privacy-enhancing digital currencies can shepherd the world toward an unbound and inclusive financial future.

This follows a bearish movement that occurred after Bitcoin reclaimed the $29,000 level. A flash crash sent the pioneer cryptocurrency back to $27,500 and the crypto market tumbled along with it. However, not all altcoins in the space followed this as three assets have continued to see gains. Kaspa (KAS) Rises Over 10% In the hours that followed Bitcoin’s decline, Kaspa (KAS) was one of the cryptocurrencies that were able to shake off the bears with ease. In the last day, the altcoin is up over 10% and was able to reclaim the $0.03 level before experiencing some resistance and correcting back down. Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop One reason behind the impressive movement has been the announcement that the cryptocurrency would be getting listed on its very first exchange in the United States. The Uphold digital asset trading platform is listing the altcoin for trading on Thursday, April 27, and the news of this listing saw the trading volume of the cryptocurrency rise over 82%, leading to its surge in price. KAS has also seen multiple exchange listings this month with LBank and Bitget also listing the digital asset for trading in the last week. KAS rises over 10% in 24 hours | Source: KASUSD on TradingView.com Injective (INJ) Gains Reach 9% Injective (INJ) protocol has been behind Kaspa (KAS) when it comes to gains. Over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has rallied around 9%, making it one of the best performers for this time period. This gain has brought the digital asset’s price to about $8.85, clearing the dreaded resistance at $8.8. INJ’s gains for the last month have also risen to 139% on the 30-day chart. Its trading volume has seen a 51% increase as well and is now sitting at $332 million. Render (RNDR) Maintains Considerable Gains Render (RNDR) has seen the lowest gains of the bunch but that does not mean that the altcoin has done poorly by any measure. With over 6% gains in a 24-hour period, RNDR has emerged as one of the only cryptocurrencies to be seeing green during these uncertain times. Related Reading: Losses Dominate Crypto Over The Weekend, Has The Bear Market Returned? Just like the others, the altcoin is also doing well on the 7-day and 30-day charts.

Besides Kaspa’s listing on the Uphold exchange, there seems to be no apparent reason why the other coins are pumping. It mostly comes to some leftover momentum from the initial market pump on Wednesday that pushed Bitcoin above $29,800. For now, these altcoins have been able to hold their gains and remain in the green. If the market were to pick up once again, then there is a high possibility that these cryptocurrencies will continue to see upside.

42420692,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYTF,1682604000,Reintroduced Congressional Bill Would Call for Feds to Study Terrorist Uses for Crypto,"A bipartisan bill introduced in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on Thursday would call for the federal government to study crypto use cases for illegal activity and provide recommendations on how to mitigate these uses.  The Financial Technology Protection Act, co-sponsored by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Ted Budd (R-N.C.) and Congressmen Zachary Nunn (R-Iowa) and Jim Himes (D-Conn.), would create a working group tasked with studying how terrorists or other criminals might use cryptocurrencies and other new financial technologies, and create proposals for Congress and regulatory agencies aimed at countering these uses.  The goal is to conduct an analysis and develop a regulatory structure that responds to it, Nunn, a first-term congressman, said in a phone call with CoinDesk. The bill was previously introduced twice.  “The reality is the threat vector is changing for our adversaries, not just for cybercriminals but really the terrorists and cartels and even nation-states that are using illicit money laundering to do everything from buying weapons to trafficking people across the border to buying fentanyl,” he said.  In a statement, Himes, who is the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said that “the rapid evolution of our financial systems demands increased attention to reduce risk and combat abuse by terrorist organizations.”  “I am glad to support this working group which will unite senior members of the Intelligence Community with experts in financial innovation under the shared mission of tracking illicit financing by malicious actors,” he said.  The bill was introduced ahead of a trio of hearings hosted by Financial Services Committee subcommittees and a House Agriculture Committee subcommittee, all focused on crypto or illicit finance.  The group would be composed of representatives from the U.S. Treasury Department, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Internal Revenue Services (IRS), the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the Department of State and the CIA.  Industry representatives from analytics firms, financial institutions, research organizations and other financial technology companies would also be appointed to the group if the bill is passed.  A lot of these firms already have their own approaches to illicit finance, including their engagement with law enforcement, but “the problem is it’s pretty fragmented,” Nunn said. He hopes the bill would lead to a more unified approach to these issues from industry.  The bill outlines a number of deadlines for the group, ranging from annual reports on what the group did over the past year and what recommendations it has; a final report four years after the bill is signed into law; and other interim documents.  Congress would be briefed on the results of these different reports, the bill said.  The bill does not get into the broader conversation in Congress about how crypto should be regulated. Nunn noted that there's still jurisdictional questions between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), each of which reports to a different Congressional committee.

42420690,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYUH,1682603106,"UK Tax Authority Proposes Changes to Treatment of DeFi Lending, Staking","The U.K.'s tax authority is seeking public views on a proposed change to the tax treatment of decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and staking, according to a Thursday announcement.  HM Revenue and Customs' (HMRC) proposal follows a 2022 call for evidence. The authority cited recent crypto market failures, including the collapse of the FTX exchange, as cause for regulators' heightened interest in the sector.  Regulators around the world have cast their eyes on DeFi, and policymakers have ""highlighted specific risks including cyber risks and other technical risks, as well as increased dependencies between traditional and decentralized financial systems and a lack of backstops in periods of market stress,"" HMRC said.  Under existing rules, DeFi transactions can be treated as disposals to be written off as gifts or sales by lenders or liquidity providers even in cases where ownership of the asset doesn't change.  ""This can lead to tax outcomes that do not reflect the underlying economic substance, and to a tax liability from a transaction where no gain has been realized in a form which can be used to meet the liability,"" according to the consultation document. ""The need to determine and record the market value of assets at each step in the transaction may also give rise to a disproportionate administrative burden.""  The proposed changes would ensure DeFi transactions are not treated as a disposals for tax purposes. That would occur only when crypto assets are ""economically disposed of in a non-DeFi transaction,"" the consultation said.  The new framework could also end up treating ""all DeFi returns as being revenue in nature,"" and subject to a ""new miscellaneous income charge,"" to avoid administrative burdens.  Though the proposed framework is targeting DeFi lending and staking, it is also intended to apply for centralized finance (CeFi), where crypto lending or staking is conducted through intermediaries, the document said.  The HMRC has previously extended existing tax rules to crypto, including a tax break for foreign investors purchasing crypto through local agents.  The consultation is open for eight weeks and closes on June 22.

42420684,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYO5,1682602913,Veteran Crypto Reporter Brady Dale Discusses New FTX Book,"Brady Dale is a crypto journalist and a former CoinDesker (now with Axios) with a book coming out about Sam Bankman-Fried and the fall of FTX. He said the book, “SBF: How the FTX Bankruptcy Unwound Crypto's Very Bad Good Guy,” published by Wiley, is as much a success story about decentralized finance, or DeFi – the corner of the crypto economy that continued to lend, issue stablecoins and enable users to swap tokens even after their centralized counterparts choked.  This article is excerpted from The Node newsletter, which will send two editions daily during the Consensus 2023 conference running down the biggest news from the event. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here or register to attend or livestream Consensus 2023 here.  CoinDesk caught up with Dale during Consensus 2023 in Austin, Texas, to discuss unknown details about the FTX story, his thoughts on crypto “Shelling points” and why he thinks Dogecoin should rank alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as crypto’s canonical chains.  What is one thing you could say about Sam Bankman-Fried or FTX that people cannot easily Google?  It is very much my opinion that SBF is not nearly so geeky or awkward as he's made out to be. I described him as a geek with swagger in my book. It sounds like he had enough charisma that his whole company was driven largely by his vision and that was true from the very start, well before he commanded hundreds of millions of dollars. That's not something a person without the self-confidence to look people in the eyes can pull off.  You've said in many ways your SBF book is as much about DeFi. Is it premature to say that DeFi has won, even after decentralized exchanges and decentralized lenders fared much better than centralized alternatives?  DeFi hasn't won, for sure, but it is fine and it remains fine. That's not to say it's solving all the problems the world needs it to solve yet, but very nearly all the centralized crypto lenders went under, and none of the blue-chip DeFi lenders went under. ""DeFi Summer"" was crucial to the FTX story because the wild returns of that year brought Sam out into the public and led him to taking a broader leadership role in the crypto world. The first time many of us really experienced him as a character in the space came when he saved SushiSwap in August 2020.  Bloomberg's Matt Levine said that crypto will always be a place for people with confidence games to play. Is the industry due for another Sam Bankman-Fried?  There will be a lot more con men, but there have always been con men. You can argue that crypto put steroids into the illusory side of capitalism, but you could also say that crypto is a microscope that exposes how illusory capitalism has always been. When I say ""brands,"" many people might think of Coke and Pepsi: two famous opposed brands that are basically the same product. And yet somehow those two separate words are worth piles of money. That kind of thing is everywhere. One could argue that crypto is less a new illusion and more a way to dispel illusions.  You've covered blockchain tech quite extensively. What do you think of the multi-chain model? Are there meaningful differences between consensus algorithms, and do you think we've seen the last of the different types of blockchain architectures we can expect?  You'd be crazy to ever bet that innovation will stop.  Say more.  A big idea underlying my reporting and this book is that crypto technology is really more of a Schelling point. It's not the thing. The thing is people unifying around a shared set of ideas that are instantiated by a coin. That's why Ethereum can change from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and still be Ethereum. It doesn't matter what the security model is. What matters is which coins Ethereum's users agree are actually ETH.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Opinion  Last year, I used to say that the only two blockchains we really knew mattered were Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, though, I put Dogecoin on that list, too. To me, Dogecoin is the chain that said: A story, a character, a concept can have a value, and if a community buys into that character and collaborates in a distributed way to make the idea bigger, the value of the concept will grow and so its coin will grow. Dogecoin really brought that home. It's not just about DOGE, it's about that whole notion of collaborating around a concept, and that's why my bet is Dogecoin will be the comeback kid of blockchains again and again, for some time to come.

Over the last 24 hours, the price of the popular meme coin witnessed a slight uptick of approximately 5%, which drew the attention of investors and traders. However, as of the time of writing, the cryptocurrency has seen a decline of 2.32% in, resulting in mixed sentiments among its holders. Related Reading: Render (RNDR): Biggest Gainer Among Top 100 Cryptos With A 22% Climb The minor surge in the price of Shiba Inu was enough to stimulate selling activities among crypto whales – large investors with significant holdings of digital assets. Such market players are known to have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market, and their behavior is often closely monitored by other investors. Source: Etherscan As per the information shared by Etherscan, a few prominent wallets have transferred almost 6 billion SHIB to two leading cryptocurrency exchanges through multiple transactions. Whale Transactions On Major Crypto Exchanges A considerable amount of Shiba Inu (SHIB) was recently transferred to two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Uniswap and Binance. The transfers were made in multiple transactions, with the largest of them carrying 2,208,284,207 and 1,472,189,471 SHIB, respectively. The goal of these transfers was likely to sell SHIB, triggered by earlier price surge. The total value of these transfers is significant, as the recent overnight price surge has increased the value of 6 billion SHIB to $64,440. How will these significant transactions impact the overall market trends of SHIB, and what does it indicate about the sentiments of these influential investors? Meanwhile, one whale took an opposite approach and added several billion SHIB to their meme coin portfolio. This particular whale made four purchases of slightly under 4,000,000,000 SHIB each over the past two hours and now holds a whopping 15,996,999,997 SHIB. It remains to be seen how these whale transactions will impact the market trends of SHIB in the coming days. Outlook On Shiba Inu The recent significant transactions involving SHIB on major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Uniswap and Binance, have the potential to impact the overall market trends of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. The transfer of nearly 6 billion SHIB to these exchanges in multiple transactions, followed by the purchase of several billion tokens by a whale investor, indicates that there is ongoing interest in SHIB among influential investors. SHIB market cap at $5.9 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Inflows Trigger Drop Below $2,080: Will It Slide Lower This Week? These transactions also suggest that the whale investors are closely monitoring the market trends and are likely making calculated moves based on their expectations. The goal of the transfers to Uniswap and Binance was likely to sell SHIB, given the recent price surge. However, the purchase of several billion tokens by a whale investor signals a bullish sentiment toward SHIB. Nevertheless, it is crucial to keep an eye on the activities of these influential investors to gauge the overall sentiment and direction of SHIB in the market.

42420695,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYWL,1682600400,Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol Piloting a Waste Gas Methodology With Miner Crusoe Energy,"The Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP) has started a pilot with waste gas crypto miner Crusoe Energy to refine a methodology to ascertain the environmental impact of such operations.  ""Utilizing a third-party audit, SBP will verify that Crusoe's waste gas procurement and technology meets a standard that is verifiably reducing greenhouse gas emissions and additive to the clean energy transition,"" the companies said in a press release on Thursday. SBP worked with Crusoe and other parties to create a methodology, they told CoinDesk.  SBP is a startup looking to create a market-based mechanism that incentivizes bitcoin (BTC) miners to make their operations more sustainable. They work with third parties to audit miners' operations and, if they meet their standards, clear them for the issuance of Sustainable Bitcoin Certificates (SBC). One on-chain SBC asset is issued for every bitcoin mined sustainably and can be traded. Investors could buy these to make ESG claims about their bitcoin holdings.  Crusoe and other crypto miners work on oil and natural gas wells where excess gas is released into the atmosphere, or flared. If this occurs, it adds carbon dioxide equivalents, and particularly methane, to the atmosphere. Crusoe instead sets up power generators that burn the gas, extracting energy and putting it into bitcoin mining.  Read more: Middle East Oil Producers Move Into Bitcoin Mining With Crusoe Energy Stakes  This process still emits greenhouse gases but avoids methane emissions, a gas which contributes as much as 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide, and instead puts the gas to use. Crusoe claims that in 2022 it captured over 4 billion cubic feet of gas, avoiding about 509,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents emissions.  Ensuring that this gas would otherwise be flared, adding onto greenhouse gases, is key to the methodology. SBP wants to ""ensure that using this waste gas is not perpetuating the problem,"" while ""recognizing that oil and gas will be used for many years to come,"" said Brad van Voorhees, co-founder and CEO of SBP. ""When done responsibly, utilizing this waste gas is actually really the ideal sort of energy transition process,"" he said.  If the oil and gas producer could find a pipeline that would transport it somewhere else to be sold, they'd prefer that from an ESG perspective, said Chase Lochmiller, Crusoe's CEO. If the producer can get market price elsewhere, the gas is not wasted, he said.  In February, the first transaction of SBC was completed, when Georgia miner CleanSpark (CLSK) sold SBC to digital asset investment firm Melanion Capital.  Unlike other environmental assets like carbon and renewable energy credits, SBCs are fungible. They do not represent a specific bitcoin that was mined using sustainable practices, but rather ownership of all the climate-friendly that are part of the protocol, van Voorhees explained.  ""SBP has really created a mechanism to make the claims around how that [mining] process is done,"" ensuring it is in rigorously audited with a third-party mechanism, and making the claim ""independently tradable from the actual underlying bitcoin commodity,"" which ensures that the mined bitcoin remains perfectly fungible, said Lochmiller.

42420691,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYVJ,1682599500,Bye-Bye Bitcoin Bear,"The bitcoin (BTC) bear market of 2022-2023 was a doozy. Having also held bitcoin through the bitcoin bear market of 2018-2019, I can attest that this one was just as painful despite being slightly shorter and having a less dramatic maximum drawdown.  Perhaps my increased financial exposure this time was the reason for this difficulty. Or maybe it was my shattered hopes for better-informed mainstream media coverage, as I found myself addressing the same old worries as before (prohibition, quantum computing, environmental effects).  Regardless, I'm glad to see the tail end of this bear. Although nothing is certain, barring any significant negative surprises, like the COVID-19-induced bitcoin liquidation of March 13, 2020, the bitcoin bear market of 2022-2023 is likely over. Here's why:  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  The halving is nigh. The Bitcoin halving, which reduces the issuance rate of new bitcoins, happens roughly every four years. The prior two halvings both catalyzed major bitcoin bull markets. It's not hard to see why. Holding demand constant, a downward supply shock forces an upward recalibration in price. Supply and demand always rule, and when supply is cut the price rises. The next halving is less than a year away.  No more tourists. Once the halving-induced bull starts running, it always draws the momentum crowd. These traders see the bitcoin price rising and they pile on. This causes a bubble that eventually ends, and they get washed out in the months following the peak. Today we have passed the washout point, as evidenced by the average age of bitcoin unspent transaction outputs (UTXO). The tourists are gone, and the HODLers remain.  More bad news can't cause new lows. Last year had plenty of bad news in cryptoland, and that carried over into bitcoin’s price. Terra, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, FTX and others all fell apart. But this year the bankruptcy of Genesis and worries about DCG, Grayscale and Binance didn't take bitcoin down to new lows. The last of the sellers were already washed out. (CoinDesk, like Genesis and Grayscale, is owned by DCG.)  The cycle repeats: Someday Bitcoin will outgrow its four-year price cycles. Until then, it's “deja vu all over again.” In the bitcoin bear market of 2014-2015, the price gravitated to around $350 until finally capitulating to $200 and staying there for months. In the bitcoin bear market of 2018-2019, the price gravitated to around $6,000 until finally capitulating to $3,200 and staying there for months. And in the bitcoin bear market of 2022-2023, the price gravitated to around $28,000 until finally capitulating to $16,000 and staying there for months. In each of these cases, the price followed a similar pattern of a peak, a multi-month series of lower price highs and a final capitulation of over 40% that lasted for several months, staying true to the past trends.  Read more: History Repeats: Applying What We Know About Tech Stocks to a New Market  So what does the future hold? I don't make short-term price predictions. But if bitcoin’s four-year cycle plays out again, and I expect it will, then a few things are true.  We will probably never see $16K bitcoin again. Two cycles ago, bitcoin’s price never revisited the lows after it returned to the pre-capitulation price low. One cycle ago it almost revisited the low, but it required a massive market liquidation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next bitcoin halving is less than a year away. Absent a major liquidation event, bitcoin’s price has likely bottomed.  Bitcoin remains regulatory teflon. Bitcoin has proven to be relatively immune to regulatory pressures. It's been clear for years now that bitcoin is a commodity and not a security. Even the ultra-active current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has been the most active and aggressive chairman I've seen in my professional career, admits that there is only one crypto asset that is clearly a commodity (and, by implication, not a security). He obviously means bitcoin. With or without him, the SEC will likely continue to pursue actions that imply the vast majority of digital assets are securities. None of this risk sticks to bitcoin.  Financial advisors and institutions are severely under-allocated to bitcoin. I can attest from my involvement with Swan Advisor Services that financial advisors and their clients are significantly under-allocated to bitcoin. In prior cycles they had reasonable excuses for that positioning, including a lack of reasonable products and significant regulatory risks. For the broader digital asset market, these problems largely remain. But for bitcoin they are largely solved. Therefore, I expect major adoption of bitcoin by financial advisors in the coming bull market.  Read more: Bitcoin Price May Hit $100K by Year End, Standard Chartered Bank Says  So, what’s next? Now is a good time for financial advisors to start educating their clients about the benefits of including bitcoin in their investment strategies and help them implement bitcoin allocations in their portfolios. Bitcoin bear markets are great times to accumulate bitcoin. But the end of the bear market is also a great time to add a truly unique asset to any diversified portfolio. The next bitcoin bull market has likely just begun.

42420677,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYJx,1682599024,Tokenization Is 'Killer App' for TradFi: JPMorgan,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the largest U.S. bank in terms of assets, remains steadfast in its plan to ""tokenize"" traditional-financial assets, largely undeterred by the crypto bear market and regulatory uncertainty.  The bank has processed almost $700 billion in transactions in short-term loans using its Onyx digital-assets platform, a permissioned version of the Ethereum blockchain, where customers can trade tokens that denote ownership rights to U.S. Treasurys as well as use blockchain bank accounts known as JPM Coin.  Among the clients known to be using the Onyx-based repo service are Goldman Sachs (GS), BNP Paribas and DBS Bank. Fifteen more banks and broker-dealers are looking to sign up, Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx, told CoinDesk in an interview.  As the platform ramps up, Onyx will focus on tokenizing assets that are traditionally hard to finance, such as money-market funds, and will use them as collateral, Lobban said. Further down the road, Lobban expects Onyx will issue a wider range of blockchain-based assets, including private funds.  Read More: U.S. Banking Crisis May Be Vindication for Crypto Ecosystem: JPMorgan  “We think that tokenization is a killer app for traditional finance,” Lobban told CoinDesk. “If you think about private markets – private credit, private equity and private real estate – they are pretty much double the size of public markets, but many orders of magnitude less liquid, so there’s this huge disparity.""  Like others in the crypto sector, the Onyx team has felt the effects of the bear market and greater regulatory scrutiny following the collapse of many major crypto firms.  While acknowledging the need for additional caution, Lobban stressed that nothing has materially changed for JPMorgan and Onyx.  “The timing might be a little bit longer than what it was before, but our strategy hasn’t changed at all,” Lobban said. “In any case, there’s so much work to do that these kinds of momentary lows are really very minor over the long term. We’re lucky to have the resources to be able to actually deliver on these very big use cases, and if we can help bring more clarity to regulators and help them understand the value, then that’s only a good thing as well.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/27/tokenization-is-the-killer-app-for-tradfi-jpmorgan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a2bf23a52f6f464a1e8bcacb483cb9a170d11e3-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Sudden volatility in bitcoin caused traders of both longs and short futures to be affected as $175 million worth of positions was liquidated and $1 billion in open interest was effectively wiped out in the past 24 hours. Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly. Crypto exchange OKX had over $52 million in bitcoin futures liquidations on its platform, followed by counterparts Binance and OKX at $38 million and $29 million, respectively. The largest single liquidation order happened on BitMEX, a bitcoin/tether (USDT) trade valued at $6 million. Bitcoin is up 1% over the past 24 hours to about $29,000.  The former chief technology officer and chief information security officer from Andreessen Horowitz, or a16z, a venture-capital firm that has invested heavily in crypto, are starting an institution-focused cryptocurrency custody firm,according to a person familiar with the plans. Riyaz Faizullabhoy, the former CTO, and Nassim Eddequiouaq, the former chief information security officer, have the blessing and seed backing of a16z, the person said. The two men departed a16z in February.  Grayscale Investments expects to learn by the end of the third quarter whether it will be allowed to turn its $17.5 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund, the asset manager’s CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, said Wednesday at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference in Austin, Texas. Last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission turned down Grayscale's request to convert the bitcoin trust into an ETF. The conversion could help Grayscale eliminate the discount for the product; GBTC's market value is far below the actual value of all the bitcoin it holds. GBTC was trading at a 42% discount on Thursday. Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the share of different national currencies in central banks' foreign-exchange reserves since 1999.  Although the U.S. dollar remains the dominant reserve currency, its share has declined to 58% from 70% two decades ago.  According to Bank of America's global research team, the declining share of the dollar reflects a multi-polar world and has central banks diversifying into other assets.  ""The remit of monetary authorities to hold different asset classes is usually limited; indeed, beyond bonds, gold tends to be one of the few assets central banks can own, so the yellow metal has been a key beneficiary of a re-weighting in reserves,"" the bank's research team said in a note sent to clients on Tuesday.

42420702,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYaT,1682596389,PancakeSwap's DAO Voting for 'Aggressive Reduction' of CAKE Token Inflation,"A community vote to reduce CAKE block rewards emitted by the decentralized-finance protocol PancakeSwap is nearing completion, with nearly 70% of votes of the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, in favor of an “aggressive reduction.” The vote will end 15:30 UTC on Friday.  The version 2.5 ""tokenomics"" proposal would move CAKE toward a deflationary model by slashing the token rewards paid to traders and stakers by over 68%. CAKE “emissions” on Syrup Pools, PancakeSwap’s main liquidity pool on the BNB Smart Chain, would drop by 94%.  Syrup Pools allows users to lock tokens for up to one year in order to earn CAKE rewards.  The proposal was floated earlier this week and had been under consideration since early April. It would adjust CAKE emissions from 6.65 cake per block to 3 cake per block immediately. That would be followed by reducing 0.5 cake per block monthly for five months until emissions reach just 0.35 cake per block each month.  That is a 94% drop from the current emission rates. CAKE tokens are used on PancakeSwap to receive discounts on trading fees and for entering lotteries, purchasing non-fungible tokens or investing in token offerings.  Cake’s emission rates were an issue of concern among several PancakeSwap community members for some time. The high inflation rate was deemed unsustainable because it relied on a constant flow of new money. Plus, it didn't benefit long-term CAKE holders.  Plans were made to reduce cake rewards either aggressively or gradually. Both options sought to reduce emissions to 0.35 cake per block in varying amounts of time. Some 10% of members have voted for a gradual reduction, governance data shows.  A third option floated is that of doing nothing and leaving the emissions as is – a choice that has received nearly 20% of the community's votes.  Reducing block rewards may mean reduced yield for newer stakers – which could eventually mean lesser capital flowing to PancakeSwap. That, in turn, could cause the platform's revenue to drop.",NEUTRAL,BNB | CAKE,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | BNB | CAKE | TOKEN SALE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/27/pancakeswap-dao-votes-for-aggressive-reduction-of-cake-token-inflation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80925668c054664e06609b8805c2ca337fa1ebf2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Data from DefiLlama shows that activity on Stargate has risen significantly over the past five weeks. Earlier in April, the protocol announced that it surpassed $1 billion in monthly volume for the first time. Stargate is a gateway to LayerZero and is responsible for the majority of capital flowing into the protocol.  Trading volume for Stargate's STG token has jumped by 95% in the past 24 hours, and the token was recently trading at 78 cents, up 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  Although LayerZero hasn't announced that it will release a token, the protocol's code on GitBook mentions ""ZRO token holder,"" suggesting that a native token is set to be issued.  LayerZero is an ""omnichain"" protocol that communicates with different blockchains. It facilitates the transfer of assets and arbitrary data across different blockchains. Earlier this month, the firm raised $120 million at a $3 billion valuation with investments from Andreessen Horowitz, Samsung Next and Sequoia Capital.  The funding caught the attention of crypto traders. A number of high-profile airdrops in the past 12 months yielded significant returns for a minimal amount of effort. Optimism (OP), Aptos (APT), Arbitrum (ARB) and Blur (BLUR) all issued lucrative airdrops that rewarded early adopters.  Airdrop hunters are hopping on Stargate governance proposals in the hope of receiving a larger allocation of LayerZero's rumored token. More than 6.4 million STG tokens were staked for a recent proposal on whether to make decentralized exchange Velodrome an STG hub on the Optimism blockchain.

12134641,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528858,1682594023,"Ethereum Exchange Inflows Trigger Drop Below $2,080: Will It Slide Lower This Week?","Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is facing another bout of turbulence as it experiences a fresh influx of coins into exchange addresses. According to recent data, this surge in Ethereum inflows is reminiscent of a similar occurrence that coincided with a drop in the cryptocurrency’s value below the $2,080 mark. The question on the minds of traders and enthusiasts alike is, will this latest wave of inflows lead to a similar outcome? Related Reading: Render (RNDR): Biggest Gainer Among Top 100 Cryptos With A 22% Climb Ethereum Inflow Analysis In the past week, Ethereum experienced a decline of 3.51%, with bulls barely managing to keep prices above the $2,000 support zone. However, when Bitcoin was rejected at the $30,000 mark, Ethereum also saw a drop in value. Despite this bearish trend, the cryptocurrency managed to post a 1% gain in the last 24 hours and is currently priced at $1,886 according to CoinMarketCap. The 30-day MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio for Ethereum, which measures the average profit or loss of all addresses that acquired ETH within the past month, retreated from a three-month peak in mid-April to negative values at the time of writing. This drop was a result of intense selling pressure over the past two weeks, which saw ETH’s value decline from $2,125 to $1,820. The MVRV values indicated that short-term holders of ETH were at a loss, and that the average age of the coins has not changed much in the last week, but it has gone up a little bit in the last few days. Based on the data of exchange inflow over the past week, it appears that there is a high likelihood of further selling taking place soon. Source: Santiment Ethereum Could See Further Losses; Sentiment Bearish Given the current market sentiment and technical indicators, it’s possible that Ethereum could see further losses in the coming days. If the bears continue to dominate the market, the cryptocurrency could break through the $1800 support level and head towards the $1,600 range. However, if the bulls manage to gain momentum, Ethereum could potentially see a price movement towards the $2,000 range. The 4-hour chart shows a resistance level at $1,890, which, if broken, could lead to a potential price increase. ETH total market cap currently pegged at $226 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: 37 Billion Dogecoin Holdings In Jeopardy: Price Level Investors Should Watch It’s important to note that cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile and unpredictable, and unexpected events could always occur that impact the price of Ethereum. As always, traders should exercise caution and carefully analyze market trends before making any investment decisions. While Ethereum has experienced losses in the past week, there is still potential for a price increase if the bulls manage to gain momentum. However, the current market sentiment and technical indicators suggest that further losses could be in store. It remains to be seen how the market will develop in the coming days and weeks, and traders should remain vigilant and adapt to changing conditions. -Featured image from TipRanks",NEGATIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-inflows-drop-below-2080/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42420701,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYcX,1682593610,Bitcoin's Negative Correlation With Dollar Index Strengthens Ahead of U.S. GDP Data,"Bitcoin (BTC) has historically moved in the opposite direction of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro.  The negative correlation has strengthened, reversing the brief let-up witnessed in late March, and indicating the possibility of accelerated gains in the cryptocurrency in the case of a continued dollar slide following the release of the U.S. gross domestic product data on Thursday.  The 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the dollar index has slipped to a two-month low of -0.70, according to data from charting platform TradingView. It had weakened to -0.11 four weeks ago.  Correlations are measured on a scale of -1 to +1. Values skewed toward -1 indicate that lower prices for one variable are associated with higher prices for the other.  Bitcoin and the DXY have been mostly negatively correlated over the past three years, except in times where crypto-specific factors overshadowed the dollar trends. For instance, bitcoin fell in late 2022 as the collapse of crypto exchange FTX kept investors from cheering weakness in the U.S. currency. A similar breakdown was seen in the lead-up to Coinbase's (COIN) Nasdaq debut in April 2021 and the launch of a futures-based exchange-traded fund in the U.S. the following October.  Focus on GDP  At 12:30 UTC, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its preliminary estimate of first-quarter GDP. The data is likely to show the world's largest economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.0%, a slower pace than the 2.6% growth in the fourth quarter last year, according to Reuters estimates published by FXStreet.  Several economic indicators and bond market metrics have been warning of a recession for months. The dollar index has declined by over 12% since early October in the hopes that the Federal Reserve would halt its interest-rate hikes and resort to liquidity easing to support the economy.  Besides, traders are back to pricing three interest-rate cuts by year end in the wake of issues at First Republic Bank (FRC), even though the Fed didn't cut rates and maintained a hawkish or anti-stimulus bias following the banking crisis episode of March.  With so much dovish expectations already in the air, the GDP figure might have to indicate a sharper-than-expected moderation in economic activity to trigger a deeper dollar sell-off and rally in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  It also means that a upbeat figure may see markets price out rate cuts and lift the dollar higher.  ""The market eyes growth at 2% – shouldn't move markets too intently given the backward nature of the data point – would need to be a big beat/miss to the move rates expectations and the USD, gold, Nasdaq,"" Chris Weston, head of research at foreign-exchange brokerage Pepperstone, said in a tweet.  At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $29,010, up 2% in the past 24 hours.

The bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets rules, known as MiCA, are set to take effect next year, but crypto market players should start adjusting their operations now, said Campa, whose agency will play a key role in implementing MiCA by drafting more details of the laws. MiCA was passed by the European Union last week.  MiCA requires issuers of stablecoins to have enough reserves to manage turbulence – and “the EBA will be paying special attention to diversification of the deposit component of the reserve,” Campa wrote.  Campa highlighted the importance of stablecoin issuers mitigating conflicts of interest, and mapping connections to custodians and trading platforms, to ensure risks don’t ricochet within the crypto ecosystem.  Although the law, which licenses wallet providers and exchanges, isn't yet formally etched into the statute book, the “contours of MiCA are, by now, familiar and I would encourage market participants to already adjust their operations” to ensure sound risk management, Campa said.  The collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD last year prompted regulators to consider how to govern the cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the U.S. dollar or another stable asset.  The November collapse of crypto exchange FTX and revelations of its murky relationship with Alameda Research, an affiliated trading firm, also drew attention to risks posed by large and often complex crypto conglomerates.  “The corporate structures, business models and exposures of the main crypto market participants are not transparent,” Martin Moloney wrote for Eurofi. Moloney is secretary-general of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, which is soon set to publish a consultation on crypto standards that will be made final later in the year.  The risk “is exacerbated by evident market concentration with the three largest so-called trading platforms,” Moloney added.

How We Rate Non-UK Online Casinos We have ensured that our experts have put each of these casinos through rigorous testing to ensure that you won’t be depositing any money at a scam website. Here are the main factors we consider before recommending the best non-UK casino sites: License The best casinos, even non-UKGC licensed ones, will still have a gambling license of some description. We look to see that the gaming site has been tested and regulated by an alternative regulatory body such as the Malta Gaming Authority, Curacao eGaming, or the Kahnawake Gaming Commission, etc. These will ensure that the site is running safely and fairly and that it offers players a high-quality service. Safety and Security We also want to see that the casino is safe and secure and protects your personal and financial information. This is the same, also for Non-UK casino sites. As such, we look for top-end SSL encryption technology, firewall protection, and 2-Factor authentication, etc. Customer Service It is essential that a good casino offers excellent customer service. Ideally, the support team should be available around the clock, 24/7, and contactable in a variety of ways including live chat, email, and preferably phone as well. We also look for fast responses, professional and helpful replies and can assist in multiple languages. Selection of Games We also expect the casino to offer lots of variety in its gaming catalog. The best will offer 1,000+ games from top providers, including slot games, jackpot games, table games, specialty games, and ideally live casino titles. Bonus points if it offers sports betting as well. There should be games to suit all tastes and budgets. Bonuses at non-UK casino sites As you can see from the casinos we have picked out, we love a good bonus! We look for those that offer generous bonuses including welcome offers plus plenty of existing player rewards and preferably loyalty and/or VIP reward schemes. Ideally, they should also come with fair and transparent terms and conditions, such as reasonable wagering requirements, so you can claim the bonus and withdraw your winnings with relative ease. Payment Options The best non UK casino sites will offer players a selection of safe banking methods offering quick and secure deposits and withdrawals. As well as accepting bank cards, eWallets, prepaid cards, and bank transfers, we also like to see cryptocurrency options as well. Is It Legal to Play at a Non UK Licensed Casinos? Yes. As long as you are old enough to gamble online, then it is legal for you to play at a non-UK casino site, but make sure you check your local laws carefully and make sure you live in a country or region where online casinos and other gambling sites aren’t prohibited. However, because UK players get extra protection from UKGC-licensed casinos, it is vital to ensure you play at one you trust and has received positive reviews and feedback. The Advantages of Playing at a Non UK Casino Site Although they often get bad press, there are, in fact, advantages as well as disadvantages to playing at a non-UK casino site – so let’s take a look: Easier KYC Procedures Having to comply with the heavy KYC procedures set out by the UKGC means some things can take a lot longer – including withdrawals. However, some non-UK casinos have shorter processes whilst others have no verification procedures at all. That means you can get playing quicker – and hopefully withdraw your winnings even quicker! Play With Credit Cards The UKGC put a stop to their licensed platforms accepting deposits made by credit cards. This has certainly been inconvenient for some players out there. However, many non-UK casino sites still accept credit card payments. Licensed from Other Recognised Regulators Although they aren’t licensed by the UKGC, most are licensed by other overseas regulators such as the MGA or Curacao, etc that still enjoy a good reputation but are considered to be more flexible in areas. The Disadvantages That being said, it is also worth noting that there are some disadvantages of playing at non-UK casino sites, here are the most important: Not as Many Protections for UK Players Unfortunately, if you are a UK player that has issues with your non-UK licensed casino, there is less protection for you. Fewer Responsible Gambling Tools The UKGC places a big emphasis on responsible gambling. So, to have and retain a license, it will need to provide plenty of responsible gambling tools and ensure players go through strict verification processes. They are also usually linked to Gamstop, which allows you to self-exclude from nearly all UKGC-licensed casinos if your online gambling is getting out of control. Most non UK casino sites are not linked with Gamstop and do not place the same emphasis on playing responsibly, so it can be harder to prevent gambling-related harm. No PayPal Payments Most non-UK licensed casinos don’t accept PayPal payments or pay-by-phone deposits. However, you can still use eWallets such as Skrill and Neteller or credit and debit cards but many players like the security offered by PayPal. Other Gaming Licences If you are looking for casinos that haven’t been registered by the UKGC but still want the security and comfort that comes with knowing that you are playing at a licensed casino, here are the main alternative licenses to look out for: Malta Gaming Authority: There are plenty of MGA casinos that will accept UK players and offer safe, secure, and trustworthy gaming platforms. This is one of the most well-respected licenses in the world, alongside the UKGC. Gibraltar Licensing Authority: Another well-respected licensing body is the GBGA, which regulates casinos situated in Gibraltar. These must adhere to strict rules as stipulated in their licenses. Curacao eGaming: This is a very common license that is recognized across the globe. It is more flexible and less stringent than some others. Spelinspektionen: This is the Swedish licensor – and many licensed by this regulator will accept UK online casino players. The Best Games at Non UK Casino Sites When you do take the plunge and sign up at a non-UKGC casino, here are some of the most popular types of games you will find: Slots: The majority of games will be slots games – with many having thousands to choose from. These could include classic fruit slots, 3D video slots, Megaways slots, and progressive jackpots from providers such as NetEnt, Microgaming, Play ‘N Go, and more. Table Games: There should also be a decent selection of table games including variants of roulette, blackjack, poker, baccarat, and more. Specialty Games: These often include games such as Bingo, Keno, and scratchcards which are also very popular: Live Casino: Many will also have a live casino, where you can enjoy live dealer versions of popular table games as well as game show-style games with real tables and real dealers. Sports Betting: Some non-UK gambling sites also offer a sports betting platform, allowing you to bet on your favorite sports events from around the world. Popular Payment Methods at Non UK Licensed Casino Sites As mentioned earlier, one of the differences between a non-UK-licensed and a UKGC-licensed casino is the selection of banking options to choose from. It is essential that you only choose a casino that offers safe, fast, and convenient payment methods. Although non-UK casinos don’t generally support PayPal payments, they do often accept deposit methods not found at UK-licensed casinos – such as credit cards and cryptocurrencies. Most will also support a variety of currencies, including GBP, EUR, USD, and more. The Most Common Payment Options at Non-UK licensed casinos Visa MasterCard AMEX Neteller Skrill Paysafecard EooPayz Qiwi Wallet Bonuses at Non-UK Casinos You will find very similar bonuses at non-UK licensed casinos and online gambling sites, including: Welcome Bonus: Available when you sign up and make an eligible deposit/s to your account. Deposit Bonuses: Some non-UK casinos offer deposit bonuses where you can earn a percentage bonus on your deposit up to a certain amount. Reload Bonuses: Existing players can enjoy reload bonuses, which may include free spins, deposit match bonuses, and rewards for making additional qualifying deposits. Cashback: Players who have suffered net losses over a period of time may be eligible for cashback offers. Loyalty Rewards Regular and/or high-rolling players can benefit from loyalty rewards and VIP programs that offer exclusive perks, bonuses, and promotions. Remember to check all your terms and conditions carefully before you claim any offer. Conclusion By now, you should have a better understanding of non-UK casinos and how UK players can safely enjoy them. It’s important to note that just because a casino isn’t UKGC-licensed, it doesn’t automatically mean it’s not trustworthy or accessible for UK players. In fact, many non-UK registered casinos hold licenses from other reputable regulatory bodies in different countries, meaning they are still held to high standards similar to UKGC-licensed casinos. These casinos often offer some of the best games from top providers, fast and secure banking options (including credit cards and cryptocurrencies), and state-of-the-art security measures to protect their players’ safety. However, it’s crucial to only play at safe and reliable sites, such as those that we recommend, to ensure a fun and enjoyable gaming experience at non-UK casinos. FAQs What is the Best Non-UK Casino? With numerous excellent non-UK licensed casinos available, we’ve compiled a top list of the best options. However, determining the ultimate “best” casino depends on your personal preferences. We recommend reading our reviews and choosing the one that suits your needs and interests the most. What is the UKGC? The UKGC is the UK Gambling Commission which is the gaming authority that oversees and regulates casinos and gambling across the UK. To operate within the country, a casino is required to have this license although many overseas casinos don’t. Is it Legal to Play at Non-UK Online Casinos? Playing at non-UK online casinos is legal, as some casinos based outside of the UK offer their services to players within the country. However, it’s important to note that these casinos don’t offer the same level of protection as UK-regulated casino sites, so it’s essential to choose a reputable and trustworthy non-UK casino to ensure a safe and enjoyable gaming experience. Can I Gamble at an Offshore Casino? Yes, you can. You can register and play at an overseas operator if it specifies that it accepts players from the UK. However, if there are any disputes with the other casino operators, you won’t be covered by the protection offered by the UKGC so you need to pick a trustworthy casino. Are There Any Risks Associated with Playing at Non-UK Gambling Sites? While playing at a reputable and licensed non-UK gambling site can be safe, there is always a risk associated with online gambling. It’s important to thoroughly research and choose a trustworthy site. Are Bonuses Available at Non-UKGC Casinos? Yes, non-UKGC casinos often offer a variety of bonuses to attract new players and reward existing ones. These bonuses can include welcome bonuses, no-deposit bonuses, free spins, cashback offers, and more. However, it’s important to carefully read the terms and conditions of any bonus offer to understand the wagering requirements and other restrictions. It’s also worth noting that UK-based online casinos regulated by the UKGC may have different bonus offers and restrictions compared to non-UKGC casinos.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | ZRX,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/gambling/non-uk-casinos/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12133886.jpeg

12133786,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528873,1682590806,"Polygon (MATIC) Keeps Going Down Despite Bullish News, Buy The Dip?","The Polygon (MATIC) price is currently at a crucial moment. Despite bullish news, MATIC has been in a downtrend since mid-February. After retesting the March 10 low yesterday, the price is at a turning point. According to data from on-chain data provider IntoTheBlock, Polygon token holders in profit fell to 34% this week. This is the lowest level since February. Therefore, analyst @CryptoTheBeast_ raises the question whether MATIC will turn around here or continue its downward trajectory? According to @intotheblock data, $MATIC holders in profit reached down to 34% this week, which is the lowest it has been since February. Will $MATIC turn around here or will it keep going down? pic.twitter.com/Pbu5KQjb5d — Crypto ₿east (@CryptoTheBeast_) April 27, 2023 MATIC Price Needs Quick Reversal The 1-day chart of MATIC reveals that MATIC lost the “bull line”, the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) last Thursday. The indicator served as Polygon’s key support on March 10 and again in late March this year. Since breaking below the 200-day EMA, currently at $1.0521, MATIC failed to rise above it. If there is no timely recovery and another rejection (like yesterday), MATIC could fall towards the support level at $0.81. Related Reading: MATIC Price Prediction: Polygon Recovery Faces Many Hurdles However, with an RSI of 35 on the 1-day chart, MATIC is near oversold territory. So, this price could be the biggest pain for now. On the other hand, regaining the 200-day EMA could avoid this scenario. As then, the 23.6% Fibonacci level at $1.09 is expected to come into focus. A dynamic move above this area would open the possibility for a rise towards the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $1.185. In this area at the latest, greater selling pressure from the bears can be expected. Afterwards, the next target of great importance is the 50% Fibonacci level at $1.25. In mid-March, MATIC got rejected at this level and thus failed to achieve a reversal towards the February high. Bullish News For Polygon Nonetheless, there is no shortage of bullish news for Polygon at the moment. Traditional finance giant Franklin Templeton announced yesterday that it will be experimenting with Polygon. The company has launched the OnChain US Government Money Fund on the layer-2 blockchain.

The funding demonstrates the continuing appetite among institutional investors for custodians that provide crypto storage services.

""As investors demand greater assurance and rigor, compliance is crucial to the future evolution of our sector.""  The London-based firm is majority-owned by Standard Chartered.

42420678,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYKz,1682581943,Bitcoin Market Impact From Mt. Gox Repayments Will Be Limited: Matrixport,"Bitcoin (BTC) slid 8% during the U.S. afternoon Wednesday on rumors that wallets tied to defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox and the U.S. government are making transactions, crypto-services provider Matrixport said in a report Thursday.  Matrixport says it has analyzed the potential market impact of the Mt. Gox haul and concluded that such an event would have limited effect on the bitcoin price. Still, investors should be well aware of the eventual distribution of those bitcoins, it said.  The Mt. Gox hack resulted in the theft of 850,000 bitcoins, valued at $500 million at the time and now worth $17.8 billion, the report said, noting that only 200,000 have been recovered.  “Since not all of the stolen BTC could be recovered, only a fraction of the original amount held by creditors will be compensated,” wrote Markus Thielen, head of research.  Creditors will receive a base payment with four options to receive the remainder of their funds, the note said.  These include “early lump-sum repayment (where customers can recover 15%-20% of their lost funds), repayment by bank remittance, repayment for a portion of crypto rehabilitation claims in crypto, or repayment through a fund transfer service provider,” the note added.  Sept. 30 is the deadline for repayments, the report said, with $1.7 billion in cash, 141,000 bitcoin and another 142,000 bitcoin cash (BCH) to be distributed as part of a civil rehabilitation plan.  Bitcoin was trading at around $28,920 at publication time.  Read more: Mt.

42420698,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqYZR,1682581807,Bitcoin's 'Estimated Leverage Ratio' Hits Lowest Point Since December 2021,"A key metric gauging the use of leverage in the bitcoin (BTC) market continues to slide, signaling low price volatility in the future.  Bitcoin's estimated leverage ratio, calculated by dividing the dollar value locked in the active open perpetual futures contracts by the total number of coins held by derivatives exchanges, fell to 0.195 on Wednesday, reaching the lowest since Dec. 20, 2021, per data tracked by analytics firm CryptoQuant.  Since October the ratio has halved, indicating a sharp decline in the degree of leverage employed in the market to magnify returns.  Other things being equal, a dwindling ratio also means less sensitivity of the spot market to the derivatives market activity. In other words, episodes of liquidations-induced wild price swings, the likes of which was seen on Wednesday, may become rare going forward.  Perpetuals are futures contracts with no expiry that use the funding rate mechanism to keep prices tethered to the spot market price. Leverage allows users to open positions worth more than the money or coins deposited at the exchange. The use of leverage exposes traders to liquidations – forced unwinding of bullish long or bearish short positions due to margin shortage. Mass liquidations end up injecting volatility into the market.  A reduced bitcoin price volatility may bring more mainstream participation in the crypto market.  The estimated leverage ratio has been in free fall since Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX went bust in early November. The exchange was known for its perpetual futures product, offering leverage up to 20 times the collateral traders posted.  The continued decline in the leverage ratio suggests that bitcoin's year-to-date rally of 75% has been spot market driven. The popular assumption is that the spot market is a proxy for long-term investors, while derivatives represent institutions and sophisticated traders/speculators.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/27/bitcoins-estimated-leverage-ratio-hits-lowest-since-december-2021,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fee0bacd9fabee98898005dfbe4e5f8b64528004-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A rug pull is a type of exit scam in which the perpetrators create a new token, launch a liquidity pool for it and pair it with a base token, such as ether (ETH) or a stablecoin such as dai (DAI). A liquidity pool is a large pool of tokens a protocol uses to fulfill trades, as opposed to an order book system where buyers and sellers list their trade orders and wait to be filled.  “CertiK is actively investigating the recent Merlin DEX exit scam, where rogue developers are suspected of causing the loss of around $2 million in user funds,” the representative said. “Working closely with the remaining Merlin team, CertiK will initiate a compensation plan to cover the lost funds for affected users.”  “Initial investigations indicate that the rogue developers are based in Europe, and CertiK will collaborate with law enforcement authorities to track them down if direct negotiation is unsuccessful,” they added.  The rogue developer is urged to return 80% of the stolen funds and accept a 20% white-hat bounty, CertiK said. On its part, CertiK emphasized that although private key privileges are outside the scope of a smart contract audit, they are committed to assisting impacted users in this case.  Merlin was seemingly exploited for over $1.8 million on Wednesday morning during a public sale of its mage (MAGE) tokens.

Here’s What Happened,"Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a flash crash yesterday in which the price plummeted from $29,800 to as low as $27,243 in just 60 minutes. The reasons for this violent price movement, which has not been seen on the Bitcoin chart for a long time, has caused speculations about what caused the crash. The popular Twitter account db (@tier10k) and crypto market intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence are in the crosshairs of the speculation. But what happened? Bad Data Responsible For Bitcoin Flash Crash? The crash was allegedly due to a wallet move by the US government and the sell-off of Mt. Gox Bitcoins. The Twitter account db sent out an automated tweet at 4:08 pm EST (8:08 pm UTC) that stated, “[DB] Mt Gox and US Govt Wallets Making Transactions,” which proved to be false. [DB] Mt Gox and US Govt Wallets Making Transactions: Arkham Alert — db (@tier10k) April 26, 2023 Arkham Intelligence denies sending out erroneous messagesto certain users. But @tier10k also denied making a mistake: “[DB] Arkham: A Bug Fix Deployed Today Caused Alerts to Be Sent Erroneously to Small Subset of Users,” the account wrote as justification, explaining in a follow-up tweet: Had to wait to get clarification from Arkham, did not want to point the finger incorrectly. Believe they will make a statement soon. Will use multiple on-chain providers going forward. For its part, Arkham conducted an investigation DB Alert situation and determined that Arkham alerts “were sent correctly in this case.” The platform claims that DB set two alerts for all Bitcoin transactions worth more than $10,000 and named those alerts “Mt Gox” and “US Gov.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Flash Crashes 6% In Under 60 Minutes, What Happened? Thus, Arkham’s account of events suggests that DB inferred the transactions of specific Bitcoin addresses from the designations he himself assigned. “When we fixed a bug causing us to not send alerts on configs like this, he then correctly received many alerts based on his parameters. No one received inaccurate alerts, they simply began receiving the alerts they had previously set,” Arkham states. Related Reading: This Highly Profitable Bitcoin Cross Has Just Formed Again Remarkably, Arkham also clarifies that db’s tweets did not trigger Bitcoin’s flash crash. According to Arkham’s research, the crash began before db’s tweet, “as the drop occurred between 19:17 and 20:01 UTC (15:17 and 16:01 EST), and the alerts and tweet were sent afterwards at 20:07 UTC and 20:08 UTC (16:08 UTC) respectively.” Cascade Of Liquidations The bottom line is that the Bitcoin price plummeted by more than 8%, but as the data shows, this happened already prior to db’s tweet. In the process, over $1 billion in open interest (leverage) was wiped out. According to Coinglass data, a total of $80.3 million in longs and $73.4 million in shorts were liquidated in BTC yesterday. As analyst @52skew further notes, selling volume on the largest exchanges was huge. Binance saw selling volume of 19,400 BTC, Coinbase of 5,000 BTC, Bitstamp of 1,400 BTC and OKX of 6,400 BTC.

Longs are bets on higher prices, while shorts are bets on lower prices. Liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when a trader does not have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Crypto exchange OKX had over $52 million in bitcoin futures liquidations on its platform, followed by counterparts Binance and OKX at $38 million and $29 million each, respectively.  The largest single liquidation order happened on BitMEX, a bitcoin/tether trade valued at $6 million.  Bitcoin climbed to over $30,000 during the Asian evening hours on Wednesday on hopes of favorable monetary policies in the U.S, some market analysts opined. That move didn’t last long, however, as sudden sales drove prices to the $27,700 level following the U.S. market open.  Rumors of bitcoin sales from the U.S. government and beleaguered crypto exchange Mt. Gox may have further impacted prices, as prices fell to as low as $27,200. However, such data alerts were later confirmed to be misclassified by the on-chain firm Arkham Intelligence, which initially sent out the alerts.  Arkham said it did not believe its alerts caused the market panic as they were sent to a “small subset” of users much after bitcoin’s move.  Bitcoin has since retraced Wednesday’s losses to regain the $29,000 level in Asian morning hours on Thursday. Some $200 million in open interest has been added, data from Coinglass shows.  Crypto majors have followed bitcoin’s lead with a slight recovery at writing time.

According to CoinGecko, the token is up 11% in the last 24 hours, and 22% in the last week. With Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing a strong bullish sentiment, RNDR might experience a bigger upside in the medium to long term. After a tough start this week, the market is finally showing signs of vigor. According to CoinGecko, the total market cap of crypto rose nearly 3% since yesterday, flipping sentiment from bearish to bullish. Despite this, macroeconomic uncertainty will still be a major driving force for the bears. With this week being jam-packed with new data that would affect investor sentiment, investors should stay cautious of the current market situation. Source: Coingecko Off-Chain Development Offsets Macro Uncertainty Render has been on a roll recently as on-chain developments continue. RNP-002, the proposal to move the Render network to the Solana blockchain, has concluded last week. With Render’s help, Solana’s NFT space will benefit greatly as Render helps in the quick generation of digital assets. “This rendered in 5 min at 1500 samples on the #RenderNetwork..

Titled “Resource Acquisition and Allocation for Core Team and Grants”, the proposal aims to push decentralization on the network. According to their blog post regarding the proposal, it is an important step as this would push Render from being run by a core team to being run by the community. Despite the positive developments for the network, fears surrounding the banking system were renewed as First Republic Bank and senior officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. revealed that they are considering downgrading their scoring of the bank. This would block the bank from receiving loans from the FDIC, further adding stress to the banking system. Related Reading: Will AVAX Price Get A Lift From Avalanche NFTs?

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading over $29,000, up more than 2.4% from the previous day but well off its Wednesday morning peak of $30,000. BTC fell as low as $27,264 at one point as investors considered some $310 million of losses from liquidations – both long and short positions – over a one-day period.  In an email to CoinDesk, Markus Levin, co-founder of blockchain-based geospatial oracle network XYO Network, also noted the possible impact of separate rumors that the the U.S. government was jettisoning a large amount of bitcoin, and that coins from long-disgraced crypto exchange Mt. Gox would be sold on the market. But Levin added optimistically that the market rebounded quickly – evidence of bitcoin's months-long resilience.  ""It seems like these were primarily just rumors, however, what is interesting to see from all this is how much of the selling that was triggered by this event was ultimately absorbed by the market,"" he wrote. ""The market is rather jittery right now, yes, but bitcoin is looking stronger and stronger from the lows late last year.”  Ether was recently trading at about $1,910, up 2.4% over the previous 24 hours and not far off where it started Wednesday. The second-largest crypto in market value dipped below $1,800 at one point on Wednesday. Other major cryptos also seesawed but were recently in the green. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently up about 1.9%.  Asian markets were mixed Thursday morning with the Hang Seng and Nikkei up slightly.

One of the issues that happens whenever an industry grows is it becomes difficult to tell if everyone is speaking the same language. Nowhere is this clearer than in the conversations between builders of decentralized finance (DeFi) and financial regulators. Can linguistic consensus be found at Consensus? It seems unlikely.  For the most part, financial watchdogs in the U.S. (and the international bodies that are essentially offshoots of the U.S. Treasury Department) have said crypto clearly fits into the existing regulatory framework. Crypto’s governing rules have already been written, supposedly.  This article is excerpted from The Node newsletter, which will send two editions daily during the Consensus 2023 conference running down the biggest news from the event. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. It's not too late to get IRL or virtual tickets for Consensus 2023 here.  And so, you have situations like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Gary Gensler, telling crypto operators to “come in and register” with the agency and FinCEN advocating for stricter know-your-customer/anti-money laundering requirements across crypto.  Crypto, with exceptions, has largely promoted itself as a square peg that cannot fit in the round hole of the so-called Howey Test (the guidance the SEC uses to determine whether something is a security, which essentially probes whether ""the investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts of others”).

42393661,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj28od,1682553746,"Crypto Innovation and Regulation Can Co-Exist, Top Industry Executives Agree","AUSTIN, Texas — Crypto innovation and regulation can mesh, a quartet of high-profile executives agreed during a spirited panel discussion on potential changes to crypto markets at Consensus 2023.  BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, Kraken Managing Director North America Guy Hirsch, Cboe Digital President John Palmer and Cumberland DRW Global Head Chris Zuehlke noted that smart regulation stemming in no small part from the debacles of 2022 could benefit crypto by giving companies clearer guideposts and increasing public trust in the asset.  ""There's no reason why innovation and regulation have to be mutually exclusive"" Zuehlke said, adding that the industry had already made significant progress in a short period.  Read full coverage of Consensus 2023 here.  The wide-ranging discussion came as the industry rebounds from a calamitous year when a number of major crypto-focused firms imploded and trust in digital assets waned. Regulators, particularly in the U.S., are now eyeing crypto to an unprecedented degree and some observers believe the scrutiny will hurt the industry's growth, or at least shift the balance of power outside the U.S. The panelists discussed new challenges for liquidity and prime brokerage, how custodial services will change, regulatory issues and requirements for exchanges to prove their reserves.  The panelists noted industry anxieties about regulation's potential damping impact, but said the relationship between crypto firms and regulatory agencies must not be contentious.  Palmer noted that Cboe Digital's conservative offerings, which once seemed a hindrance to adoption, have become a strength as investors search for safe, trusted vehicles to store their assets. Cboe Digital offers exchange and clearinghouse services for crypto spot and derivatives markets  The Kraken exchange's Hirsch highlighted the need to protect client assets by creating environments where customers “can trust the venues” where they engage in digital asset transactions. The group also emphasized the need for separating assets but that notable crypto failures of 2022 were related to fraud more-so that structure.  Hirsch said the challenges that befell the crypto industry in 2022, can provide an opportunity moving forward, specifically via proof-of-reserves accounting. He said that the cryptographic method allowing for verification of assets can be more reliable than audits in traditional finance.  Zuehlke said that despite the crypto industry's 2022 woes, the banking industry's recent near meltdown and lingering concerns about its vulnerabilities prompted a migration to bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets.  ""The cat's out of the bag. Bank deposits are risky in a way that people didn't understand,"" Zuehlke said.
