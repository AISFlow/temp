42405621,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedj6L,1609882710,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Breaks $34K as Ether Futures Interest Jumps $350M in a Day,"Higher-than-average spot volume, even for the past month, is helping push bitcoin’s price upward at a time when traders are plowing into ether futures at a quick pace to open 2021.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $33,987 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 8.9% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $29,986-$34,220 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC well above its 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price made gains Tuesday after a four-hour sell-off was reversed around 06:00 UTC (1 a.m. ET). That led to a steady climb to as high as $34,220 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $31K After Monday’s Drop      “Bitcoin has extended its already-steep uptrend to new all-time highs,” said Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies. “The signs of exhaustion that appeared in December were absorbed via a brief consolidation phase, and there are no active overbought ‘sell’ signals.”      So far in the five days of 2021, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency is up over 16%.      Stockton still sees “support,” the price floor where traders step to buy, much lower than the current spot price.      “Initial support is below $25,000, which hints at a continued day-to-day volatility,” she said. Since Dec. 31, bitcoin’s realized volatility has been creeping back up, from 55.5% to 63.3% Monday, a rise not entirely uncommon of late but nonetheless something traders track.      “On a technical basis, things have been overbought for a while,” said Andrew Tu, an executive for quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. “The overall trend is still upwards and this seems unlikely to change, though the pace may not be like it was during the holiday season.”      Spot bitcoin volumes are looking quite robust; Monday was the highest-volume day on the eight CoinDesk 20 exchanges in the past month, at over $6.6 billion. Tuesday’s spot volume is also looking healthy, at $4.2 billion as of press time. In the past month, volumes have averaged $2.3 billion per day.      “If bitcoin continues to rally at its current rate, I believe we could see a price of $54K around Valentine's Day,” said Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading for blockchain ecosystem provider NEM. “We could see a higher price than this by the end of Q1; $74K is also on my radar.”      Read More: JPMorgan Predicts Bitcoin Price Could Rise Over $146K in Long Term      However, Pelecanos still envisions an eventual retreat from those lofty forecasted prices. “I have the sense a pull back from $54K would leave the bitcoin price to consolidate around $35K,” Pelecanos said.      It may be hard to remember but less than a year ago during 2020’s sell-off in traditional and crypto markets, bitcoin hit a low of $3,867, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “Based on previous cycles we could be in for a year or so of extreme bullishness,” Pelecanos said. “With all cycles, the crash comes from the madness of the crowd. There won't be a catalyst news story, the market will just run out of buyers.”    Ether futures boiling hot to open 2021    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Tuesday, trading around $1,095 and climbing 7.3% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: As Bitcoin Rally Pauses, DeFi Keeps Astounding      The ether futures market continues to see staggering gains in the first trading week of 2021. Since Sunday, ether futures open interest (OI) on major venues has grown $350 million to $2.95 billion total, with Binance by far leading the way at $734 million in open interest alone.      The record-high open interest could easily simmer down, according to Vishal Shah, founder of derivatives venue, Alpha5. “It's just leverage. It wipes itself out a lot when financing gets high and the market is looking for a story once it races ahead,” he told CoinDesk.      Brian Mosoff, chief executive of investment firm Ether Capital, said ether’s spot price still has room to grow, and the growth of futures is a sign of that.      “ETH is still below the all-time high, and many believe with all the positive news in the latter half of 2020 it still has room to grow,” Mosoff said. “Ether futures are at an all-time high as the market sentiment has drastically shifted in the last few months. I'd attribute it to the successful launch of ETH2, macro conditions looking to alternative asset classes to hedge pending inflation and a robust ecosystem.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Tuesday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    stellar (XLM) + 23.4%  algorand (ALGO) + 19.3%  cardano (ADA) + 19%    Notable losers:    tron (TRX) - 4.2%  xrp (XRP) - 2%    Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 ended the day slipping 0.37%, led lower by a slump in shares of packaging container manufacturing company Toyo Seikan, which fell 3.6%.

International Game Technology plc, which builds slots and other tech for casinos, has yet to reveal any plans to integrate bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether into its tech. But its new patent awarded Tuesday covers a means for HODLER-gamblers to pay for their bets with any of the three.      As described in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filings, users of IGT's method would be able to transfer cryptocurrency into their gaming accounts as a means of payment. There, the crypto would convert to fiat currency after payment of a fee.

One drawing included a live bitcoin wallet address that IGT appears to have set up but never used.      But the patent is not exclusive to slots machines; rather, it also covers the means for moving crypto into the gambler's account. IGT could theoretically roll out a now-patented method for crypto funding across any of its digital gambling platforms. The company has stakes in slots, lotteries and the burgeoning sports-betting scene.

42405619,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedj3O,1609877597,Ethereum: The Last Bastion for Yield,"In the legacy financial world, yield has dried up. Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds have never been lower. The 10-year Treasury bond now offers you a less than 0.9% return. At around 2.1%-2.3%, AAA corporate bonds aren’t doing a whole lot better.      Knowing this, while also hearing about the Federal Reserve’s strong intentions to get inflation above 2%, it's no wonder investors are ditching low-yielding assets and getting into more speculative investments. People are allocating capital in increasingly distorted ways. How else are they going to get a return?    David Hoffman is the co-founder of Bankless, a content studio with a newsletter, podcast and YouTube channel focused on how to live a life without banks.    On Ethereum it’s difficult to avoid yield. Yield is the default incentive for successful decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to attract capital.      At the most basic level, borrowing and lending applications like Compound and Aave are offering 4.6% and 6.2% interest, respectively, on deposited USDC. More sophisticated yield aggregators like Yearn are generating 7.8% in their basic yield strategies, and up to 16% in more aggressive strategies.      See also: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Uniswap, averaging over $1 billion in trading volume per week, is putting its 0.3% trading fees into the hands of those that have supplied liquidity to the protocol. Those that have supplied ETH and USDC to Uniswap have received a staggering 35% APY on a hybrid 50-50 USD/ETH position in the last 30 days.    No negative rates    The DeFi economy is constructed fundamentally differently than its legacy counterpart. In order for DeFi to work, it requires over-collateralization. No one can borrow more than they have deposited, and so far this simple safety net has been the foundation on which DeFi has been able to stand.      It is also the reason why Ethereum and DeFi will become synonymous with “yield” in 2021. In DeFi, rates can’t go negative. There is no room for fractional-reserve lending in DeFi, because it would break the trust model that makes these applications function. In order to remove trust (and therefore centralization), you must over-collateralize.      The elimination of fractional reserve lending in the DeFi economy is why yield will always be able to be found in DeFi. Negative yield is not possible in Compound or Aave; the math doesn’t allow for it. Because these protocols are solvent-by-design, in a scenario in which demand to borrow is at absolute zero, then the yield is also at zero, but not negative.    ETH: The internet bond    The launch of the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain kicked off the long-awaited ability to stake ETH and receive ETH-denominated returns.      In addition to its native store-of-value qualities, the launch of ETH staking turns ETH into a capital asset that produces cash-flow for its owner. We have seen other protocols offer proof-of-stake style returns on alternative assets, but ETH is uniquely compelling because it is also backed by the native economy of Ethereum.      When the size of the Ethereum economy increases, staking yields are designed to reflect this growth. The relationship between the Ethereum economy and ETH should be familiar to the typical bond investor: Healthy economies are highly valued, therefore the native bond typically has a premium associated with it.    Ethereum has no debts to pay, it is solvent by design.    Ethereum cannot default on its ETH payments to ETH bond-holders. ETH is dependably issued to ETH bond-holders for compensation for providing security to Ethereum. Ethereum doesn’t need to collect taxes or generate revenue to compensate those who are looking for ETH-denominated yield. Removing this requirement is a boon to the valuation of ETH bonds because there is no risk of default. Ethereum has no debts to pay, it is solvent by design.      Bitcoin’s recent penetration into the minds of the legacy investor class shows people are interested in a protocol-constrained monetary asset. Additionally, DeFi’s explosion onto the scene, underpinned by offering extremely high yields not found anywhere else in the financial universe, shows how thirsty investors are for dependable yield.      The combination of ETH dividends to bond holders with constrained max issuance creates ETH’s uniquely compelling position as a macro asset in 2021 and beyond.    Last bastion for yield    In 2021, Ethereum is positioned to become the Schelling Point for yield. As bitcoin blasts the doors open on the investability of digital assets, it exposes a yield-rich world behind it in Ethereum.      The diversity of asset types and differing yield-generation strategies is likely to attract the attention of yield seekers of all types. Whether investors are looking for stable, low-risk U.S. dollar-denominated returns, or aggressive high-yield speculative instruments, Ethereum offers investors an array of financial products for them to choose from.      See also: David Hoffman – Ethereum Is the Frontier of Financial Innovation      In addition to dollar-denominated returns, ETH as an internet bond is positioned as an instrument that offers upside exposure to the growth of the Ethereum economy, while simultaneously generating ETH-denominated yield for those ready to accept its volatility.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,David Hoffman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/05/ethereum-the-last-bastion-for-yield,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db6c0946b3e0b3658c0e71859315bf26e1ac6ff9-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385542,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Bf3,1609875470,Bitcoin Retail FOMO Brings a Heap of 'Kimchi Premium' to S. Korea,"The “kimchi premium” has returned.      Price premiums for bitcoin on South Korean exchanges have hit two-year highs, indicating retail investment interest in cryptocurrencies is surging in that country. However, analysts and traders warn that certain market players could take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, resulting in short-term price volatility.      The “kimchi premium,” named for a popular Korean pickled side dish, also helps to explain why bitcoin prices drop during Asia’s trading hours – some traders sell bitcoin at higher prices on South Korea-based crypto exchanges.      As of press time, bitcoin’s “kimchi premium,” as quantified by the difference in prices between South Korean’s upbit exchange and Binance, was at 4.15%, or 1,444,941 won (approximately $1328.97), according to real-time exchange data-tracking site scolkg.com. Such a mark-up in prices has not been seen since early 2018.      Data from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant also shows the price gap between Korean exchanges and the rest of the market went as high as 6.18% on Jan. 4. On that day, 3,001 bitcoin flowed to Bithumb, one of the biggest crypto exchanges in South Korea.      “It is clear that the greatest selling happened during the Asia trading hours,” Andrew Tu, an executive at quant firm Efficient Frontier, told CoinDesk.    South Korea’s retail FOMO in crypto    The “kimchi premium” first appeared in early 2016, according to researchers at the University of Calgary. Between January 2016 and February 2018, it averaged at 4.73% and reached its highest at 54.48% in January 2018.      There are several reasons for the sometimes exceptionally wide price gap, including historical background, economic situation and regulatory environment.      Driving some of the sudden bitcoin frenzy could be the delayed implementation of a 20% crypto tax in South Korea, according to Simons Chen, executive director of investment and trading at Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance. He said some traders may be rushing to purchase cryptocurrencies before the tax is implemented in 2022.      South Koreans are buying crypto on exchanges closed to non-Korean nationals, making prices a little bit removed from the global market.      “The South Korean government has banned exchanges from servicing foreigners,” according to the book “Mastering Blockchain,” co-written by CoinDesk’s senior markets reporter, Daniel Cawrey. “In addition, South Korea has capital controls that limit the amount of funds that can leave the country.”      Jason Kim, the chief investment officer of Tokyo-headquartered investment firm Anchor Value, noted the lack of institutional traders in South Korea’s crypto market, meaning that the market is mainly driven by retail customers who use exchanges more frequently and tend to follow “fear of missing out” (FOMO) trends during each bull run, likely causing more drastic market volatility. Retail crypto buyers are able to do so easily because they can make their purchases using their local currency, the won (KRW).      “Korean exchanges have BTC/KRW pairs,” Ki Young Ju, chief executive office of CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk. “It's straightforward to integrate a bank account and exchange deposit account to buy bitcoin with KRW. We can buy bitcoin with just a couple of clicks via online banking.”      Culture is also a factor. In a country that rose from the ashes of Korean War, there is an underlying theme of becoming rich in a short period of time, much the same way South Korea’s economy had grown, said Anchor Value’s Kim. After traditional high-return investment options such as real estate became too expensive for most people, many turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which went from almost nothing to skyrocketing in just a few short years.      All these factors were ingredients in bringing back crypto’s price difference in South Korea, after it shrank close to nothing since late 2019.      After bitcoin’s price broke the $33,000 threshold over the past weekend, searching the keyword “bitcoin” on Naver, Korea’s most popular search engine, surged again after peaking in mid-December.      Trading volumes on major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea also climbed up in the beginning of January to their highest levels in the past 30 days.      “We start seeing more ‘kimchi premium’ from the last few weeks,” Sinhae Lee, partner of Shanghai-based blockchain consulting firm Block72, told CoinDesk. “The deposit of KRW to Korean exchanges has been increasing, and I think that Korean retailers are entering the market after seeing a strong price increase of bitcoin.”    Hedge funds play arbitrage trades    During the previous appearances of the “kimchi premium,” it was harder for traders to do arbitrage trades – buying at a lower price in one market and simultaneously selling in another market for a higher price – due to capital controls and high transaction costs on exchanges in South Korea, according to a 2018 report by New York-based fintech company Cindicator Analytics.      Some now say that experienced traders have been able to take advantage of arbitrage in this bull market, evidenced by the multiple huge sums of bitcoin inflows to Korean exchanges. Most recently, CryptoQuant’s on-chain data alerts warned earlier Tuesday of aggregated 1,882 bitcoin inflows to Bithumb.      “People are more prepared compared to 2017 when the ‘kimchi premium’ hit like 50%,” CryptoQuant’s Ki said. “We have many arbitrage hedge funds who run their money on Korean and non-Korean exchanges.”      Over the past few weeks during Asian trading hours, bitcoin faced sell-offs, as shown on CoinDesk’s BPI.      “On a technical basis, things have been overbought for a while,” Efficient Frontier’s Tu said about the recent small-scale market sell-off since bitcoin’s price broke $33,000. “It's likely just the market consolidating, with primarily Asian sellers taking profits at this level.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/05/bitcoin-retail-fomo-brings-a-heap-of-kimchi-premium-to-s-korea,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8bb2294a21b6967be0446f3e80e461c86b98981-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385533,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2BST,1609869019,The Pandemic Was Just the Catalyst,"In his 2017 book, ""Zero Hour: Turn the Greatest Political and Financial Upheaval in Modern History to Your Advantage,"" Harry Dent forecast a catastrophic economic crash would hit us no later than early-2020.      Dent saw the developed world arriving at the pointy-end of a long and unsustainable period of technological progress and growth, which was destined to implode in the greatest bubble burst of modern history. In a feeble attempt to thwart the resulting downturn, and in an expression of gross monetary manipulation central banks would respond by printing more money.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.    Then, amid rising geopolitical tensions and regional trade wars, domestic melting pots would finally boil over as citizens from incongruous cultures, religions and income groups railed against the establishment in a backlash against intensifying globalisation. In 2017, he pointed to Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president, Brexit and Black Lives Matter, and predicted “the greatest revolution and financial crisis since the late 1700s.”    Harry who?    Harry Dent, who is 67, has built a career on such bold predictions. His books have titles like ""The Great Crash Ahead"" (2011), ""The Great Depression Ahead"" (2009) and ""The Next Great Bubble Boom"" (2006). The son of a political strategist, Dent created an investment and newsletter empire in Tampa. But recently he has decamped to Puerto Rico, where he mixes with several members of the island’s crypto community.      “At least it's dealing with its crisis rather than printing money to cover the problems,” wrote Harry about his decision to set roots in Puerto Rico.      The debt-ridden Caribbean island is known for its favorable tax incentives. Around 2018 it began to attract some high-profile blockchain entrepreneurs and investors who set their sights on building the local scene. Harry’s rhetoric was in alignment with the core philosophies of Puerto Rico’s burgeoning crypto community and his new neighbor, investor and PR man Michael Terpin, invited him to deliver a keynote on the future of money at his investing conference, CoinAgenda Caribbean.    Harry concludes our chat with a warning: You better start listening to me, not those egghead economists and central bankers.    That’s where I met Harry and where he gifted me a signed copy of his new book, “Zero Hour.” Had I read it back then, in May 2018, I might have dismissed most of his bizarre predictions as hyperbole. But I didn’t get around to it until March 2020, after the coronavirus lockdown had kicked in and suddenly I had all this free time on my hands. Reading it as the global crisis was unfolding and the economic outlook turned bleak it felt like Harry was commentating world events in real time.      “Zero Hour” mentions nothing of a pandemic, but speaking with me via Zoom in December 2020, Harry said COVID-19 was simply the trigger for a series of calamitous events that had been timetabled for decades. To arrive at these conclusions, Harry and co-author Andrew Pancholi identified a range of demographic and geopolitical cycles all due to collide in 2020. They explain that it is rare to get so many cycles converging at once, with the most comparable event in history being the period known as “The Great Depression.”      In Harry’s view, recessions, depressions, booms and busts are completely normal and necessary for efficiency, but the natural process has been interfered with. “Central banks have hijacked democracy and killed free market capitalism by taking over the economy and driving it from the top down,” he said, pointing out that governments worldwide had responded to the financial crash of 2020 exactly as he predicted, with quantitative easing and excessive stimulus.      Of course, that only helped to add value to bitcoin’s ideology – and price – throughout the year.    Shoot the messenger    Harry will never call himself an economist and it’s true that his unconventional approach has attracted many critics. An opponent of note is the economic researcher and wealth adviser Larry Swedroe, who has made it his mission to hold Harry accountable to his predictions – which he claims have been more often wrong than they are right.      Via a LinkedIn DM, Larry described Harry’s harbingers as “investment porn that is designed to titillate, stimulate and excite you into action, but has no basis in reality.” He compared Harry's success as a forecaster to a blind squirrel that occasionally finds an acorn. Larry said he’d “written many pieces exposing [Harry’s] garbage” and shared a few links as evidence, one going back as far as 2013.      See also: Leah Callon-Butler - What DeFi Can Learn from 'InFi'      But Harry isn’t fazed. He says this is just how disruptors are met. “That’s the way I’m greeted by economists: ‘Shut up, we don’t want to listen to this, you’re a cuckoo,’” he said, outlining the plight of anyone who dares to position their opinions on the wrong side of popular. “It’s the same as innovators. We are greeted with bullets and A-bombs and told to get out of here.”      That might also explain why Harry isn’t getting invited to speak at the crypto conferences anymore, since he’s now saying stuff like: There’s no bigger bubble than bitcoin, it’s the bubble of bubbles. Refusing to concede the current bull run represents mass-scale adoption and true institutional acceptance, Harry thinks he’ll still be feeling bearish until some point in 2022, when bitcoin should experience a 90% correction, by his clock.      Some of his neighbors would like to insist they’ve seen the worst of the crypto winter already, but Harry sees an even bigger shakeout on the way up to the next big thing. He says it’s a perfect example of an S-shaped adoption curve at very early stages, with the technology still at 1% but growing exponentially. He likens blockchain to the World Wide Web on a 20-year lag, recalling the time “the internet ran past the Nasdaq like a race car.”      Harry concludes our chat with a warning: You better start listening to me, not those egghead economists and central bankers.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/05/the-pandemic-was-just-the-catalyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e3a5de317b14a2ac235b9fcfa68b19353400ea5-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A late night interpretative letter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the U.S.’ federal banking regulator, saying banks can act as stablecoin nodes was the juice needed to push bitcoin out of the doldrums. JPMorgan analysts see a future where 1 BTC could trade hands near $150,000, according to a new report.      In other regulatory news, the comment period for a controversial wallet rule closed, with many heavy hitters coming out against the U.S. Treasury’s proposed rules to increase exchange surveillance. More on that later, first the top stories for the day.    Top shelf    Banking on stablecoins A new letter from the U.S. federal banking regulator could give stablecoin networks the same status as other global payments networks like SWIFT or FedWire. In a possible last act from Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks, U.S. banks can now operate as stablecoin nodes and are free to send transactions, so long as they comply with securities and other regulations. Bitcoin markets rebounded on the news.      Supply crunch Bitcoin mining machine prices are soaring along with bitcoin’s price. According to data reviewed by CoinDesk, a surge in mining revenue, limited manufacturing capacities and a number of new mining entrants has led to a supply shortage. It doesn’t help that established players like Riot and Marathon (both publicly traded) have been buying up the most up-to-date ASICs miners.      Brazil’s market The battle to control Brazil’s growing crypto retail sector is heated, with Argentina's Ripio acquiring BitcoinTrade, the second-largest crypto exchange in South America’s largest economy.

(Decrypt)  Market intel    Gold bugs A new investment report from JPMorgan has set a $146,000 price target for bitcoin. The bullish target is the latest analytical note that wagers bitcoin will become a popular alternative to gold. “Bitcoin’s [current] market capitalization of around $575 billion would have to rise by 4.6 times – for a theoretical bitcoin price of $146,000 – to match the total private sector investment in gold via exchange-traded funds or bars and coins.” The one thing holding the bitcoin beast at bay? Volatility.    At stake    11th hour? A comment period for a proposed set of rules that would increase reporting requirements for crypto exchanges and minimize blockchain user privacy closed yesterday, with many major crypto firms rejecting the maneuver.      Spearheaded by the U.S. Treasury Department in December, but shaped primarily by the global Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the set of rules would see exchanges implement know-your-customer (KYC) requirements for transactions sent to unhosted wallet addresses, or addresses that exist outside a centralized or custodial setting.      This would mean many types of personal wallets as well as counterparties to exchanges’ customers would need to be identified. Reporting limits would be set for private wallets that receive more than $10,000 in 24 hours, and record-keeping rules for transactions valued at over $3,000. FinCEN and the Treasury Department claim the increased surveillance will aid criminal enforcement and reduce financial malfeasance.      The proposal was rushed out late on Friday, Dec. 18 – a week before many U.S. employees might expect to break for the winter holiday season – with the Treasury setting only a 15-day comment period. Many crypto industry commentators referred to the rushed timeline as onerous and potentially illegal.      Still, some 6,000 comments were filed with FinCEN within this narrow window, with firms such as Square, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Kraken as well as civil liberties organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Coin Center coming out hard against the proposal. The reporting period has since been ""extended"" until Jan. 7.      “The process itself is fraught with an 'us-versus-them' hostility to the industry’s views – as seen by the breakneck schedule for a major rule, the thinness of Treasury’s justifications, and the lack of meaningful engagement before the eleventh-hour holiday rule making,” cryptocurrency platform Coinbase said, in a prepared statement.      While the rushed timeline was a frequent target – the rule was proposed as United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin is set to leave office – others noted the perverse effects these new reporting requirements could have for the fledgling crypto industry.      “This creates unnecessary friction and perverse incentives for cryptocurrency customers to avoid regulated entities for cryptocurrency transactions, driving them to use non-custodial wallets or services outside the U.S. to transfer their assets more easily,” Jack Dorsey, CEO of payments company Square, wrote.      In a press release, Kraken noted the proposed rule would be a “substantial departure from existing law.” And one, that if passed, Coinbase and a16z have pledged to fight in court.      In defense of the proposal, CoinDesk columnist and financial blogger John Paul Koning tweeted the rules would bring the crypto industry in line with practices already in place for money transmitters, such as those followed by remittance giant MoneyGram.      “Coinbase sending cryptocurrency to an unhosted address is like MoneyGram remitting physical cash to a stranger. MoneyGram has to collect personal information about the stranger. Shouldn't Coinbase have to collect information about the unhosted wallet?” Koning wrote.      In response, Coin Center Director of Research Peter Van Valkenburgh, wrote that “equating a blockchain transaction to a funds transfer ignores the obvious difference ... blockchain transactions can happen peer to peer while wires are always intermediated.”      Indeed, there are notable differences between the two systems of value transfer. With blockchains providing a public ledger of all transactions, an increased reporting rule could be a great intrusion into an exchange user’s financial privacy than simply identifying the recipient of a remittance – the total history of both counterparties financial lives would be on full view, including those that are unrelated to any centralized exchange.      As the EFF said in its statement against FinCEN’s rules: “Anonymity is important precisely because financial records can be deeply personal and revealing: They provide an intimate window into a person’s life, revealing familial, political, professional, religious and sexual associations.”    Who won #CryptoTwitter?",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/05/blockchain-bites-jpmorgans-146k-btc-target-crypto-responds-to-us-treasurys-proposed-wallet-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23bd64eba12d426b27c727cda6123ea6c339f6d8-1200x770.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385538,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2Ba1,1609864449,Swedish Bankers Air Concerns Over E-Krona Digital Currency Plan,"Swedish banks have expressed apprehension over the central bank's proposed e-krona digital currency and how it could affect their industry.      With Sweden the nation that uses cash the least globally, the Riksbank has been considering taking digital payments using the e-krona mainstream. Late last year, Sweden’s financial markets minister, Per Bolund, said the Riksbank finance committee had launched a review into the prospects of switching the country to the digital currency, a study that will be completed in November 2022.      But bankers in the nation say this would fundamentally change how the banking system works, according to a Reuters report Tuesday.      One concern expressed is that if people move their money out of deposit accounts and to the e-krona, this could leave banks short of funding and leave them to rely on wholesale markets for liquidity, said the report.      Masih Yazdi, CFO of corporate bank SEB, said this would risk financial stability by making banks take on more debt and possibly become unprofitable.      How the central bank would manage the money it takes in is another question. Rickard Eriksson, an adviser for the Swedish Bankers Association, asked whether the Riksbank might lend funds to banks to compensate for the lack of deposits or would it merely hold them? The former option might mean mortgages and corporate loans may depend on the central bank's risk appetite.      “I don’t think the Riksbank has really thought about this or come up with good answers,” he told Reuters.      Yazdi added that the central bank would be moving beyond monetary policy into areas like privacy. That's because a blockchain-based digital krona would be traceable, unlike cash.      Read more: Sweden’s Central Bank Finally Embraces DLT, but Only in Simulation Mode      However, the central bank appears set on the project. Last October, Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves called for the Swedish government to ""review the concept of legal tender"" and prepare legislation to make way for the e-krona.

""Bitcoin has started 2021 with a stark reminder that volatility is the norm,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading with the cryptocurrency firm Diginex, wrote Monday.      In traditional markets, European shares dropped after the U.K. imposed a new coronavirus-related lockdown. U.S. stock futures pointed to further losses after the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index slid 1.5% on Monday, the gauge's worst start to a year since 2016. Gold rose 0.4% to $1,954 an ounce.    Market moves    The cryptocurrency subsector of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, is getting hot again. Maybe even hotter than in mid-2020, a timespan so sizzling with fast-paced growth that it became known as the ""summer of DeFi.""      Total collateral locked into DeFi protocols, the most commonly used metric for gauging uptake of the systems, has climbed to new record highs above $17.5 billion, according to DeFi Pulse, a website that tracks the space. That's up from about $10.5 billion at the end of September and less than $1 billion at the start of 2020.      In DeFi, entrepreneurs are building semi-automated lending and trading systems atop blockchain networks – aiming to someday, potentially, challenge banks and Wall Street trading firms. The arena rose to prominence in June through September of last year as a flurry of usage and high-profile token rollouts ignited enthusiasm among traders and venture-capital investors alike.      The phenomenon faded from cryptocurrency headlines as bitcoin's price rally dominated market conversations in the final quarter of 2020, but a recent resurgence in DeFi has industry analysts buzzing again over its prospects.      ""User growth over time is ballooning and should continue to accelerate,"" the cryptocurrency analysis firm Delphi Digital wrote in a Jan. 1 report.      Prices for ether – the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, which has attracted much of the DeFi development – have soared 37% this year alone, outpacing bitcoin's comparatively feeble 7% start to the year.      The elevated pace of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain has also pushed up network congestion, sending fees to an all-time-high of $898,000 for a single day, according to Decrypt, a news site, which cited the data provider Glassnode.      DeFi ""can be best thought of as an emerging sector within the frontier digital asset market,"" Dan Zuller, a partner at the investment consultancy Vision Hill, wrote last week in an op-ed. ""Investors that put capital to work in this thematic sector of digital assets generally outperformed bitcoin and the digital asset market beta in 2020.""      According to Messari, a cryptocurrency data provider, the top 10 DeFi tokens, as ranked by market capitalization, have jumped an average 18% in the first several days of 2021, led by the decentralized exchange Loopring's LRC token and decentralized derivatives platform Synthetix's SNX. Uniswap, the biggest DeFi project with $1.4 billion of locked collateral, has seen its UNI tokens gain 10%.      Denis Vinokourov, head of research for the cryptocurrency prime broker Bequant, said in an audio interview over Telegram that he's encouraged by last month's launch of a new digital token from 1inch, a platform designed to help users find the best trading prices available from decentralized exchanges.      The development company behind the project late last year closed a $12 million funding round led by the digital-asset investment firm Pantera Capital.      That's despite DeFi sector risks exposed last year, when several platforms were upended by software bugs, sophisticated trading exploits and unexpected exits (with tokens) by project leaders – the latter seen as so serious a threat that industry executives and journalists gave the maneuver its own term, the ""rug pull.""      ""The decentralized world of chaos is becoming more professionalized,"" Vinokourov said. ""There's huge growth potential.""      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    The staggering rally from $10,000 to $34,000 over the past three months looks overbought, from the look of price charts. However, blockchain data suggest the cryptocurrency has scope to rally even more.      For example, take the MVRV Z-score, which is derived from blockchain data and measures the average deviation of individual coins' market value from their realized value – the price at which they last changed hands. The metric is used to assess undervalued and overvalued market conditions.      Bitcoin’s market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) Z-score has risen to a three-year high of 5.32. But it remains well below the 7.0 score at which an asset is considered near a top, according to Glassnode. Historically, above-7.0 readings have marked the end of bull markets.      Options traders also remain hungry for further upside, as noted by crypto derivatives research firm Skew. The one-, three-, and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts (bearish bets) relative to calls (bullish bets) are hovering well in negative territory. That's a sign of bullish bias.      Further, the market is now looking less overheated than it did 24 hours ago with the perpetual funding rate – the cost of holding long positions on major derivatives exchanges – falling to 0.039% on Tuesday from an 11-month high of 0.137% reached Monday.      Though the path of least resistance appears to be on the higher side, the cryptocurrency may face some temporary selling pressure if equities react negatively to potential Democrat failure to sweep Tuesday's Georgia elections. Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted Monday that a Democrat-controlled Senate would pave the way for bigger fiscal stimulus.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $31K After Monday's Drop    What's hot    U.S. federal regulator OCC says banks can conduct payments using stablecoins, participate in independent node verification networks, potentially elevating blockchains to status of other global financial networks like SWIFT, ACH and FedWire (CoinDesk)      JPMorgan predicts bitcoin price could rise over $146K in long term, while seeing signs of ""speculative mania"" in short term, Bloomberg reports (CoinDesk)      Coinbase, Square Rally against FinCEN's proposed crypto rules (Decrypt)      Grayscale Ethereum Trust's price premium tanks as new shares hit public market (Bloomberg) (EDITOR'S NOTE: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the owner of CoinDesk.)

The licenses make LCX a regulated crypto exchange, digital asset custody provider, price oracle provider, digital asset compliance provider, smart-contract creator and token-offering platform, said LCX CEO Monty Metzger.      The exchange had already been operating with retail crypto services in Europe and Switzerland and security token services in the U.S., but now those services are expanded, allowing the firm to custody and also generate security tokens for its clients.      “If one of the banks wants to have [security token] clients worldwide and wants to go through Liechtenstein, they have to work with one of the regulated token generators,” Metzger said. “We are the only token generator in the region.”      In an era where banks are not only exploring bitcoin but their own digital assets, LCX is positioning itself to be a retail exchange that can help other institutions launch their own digital assets.

42385532,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2BRD,1609851621,Argentina's Ripio Acquires Second-Largest Crypto Exchange in Brazil,"Argentina’s Ripio has acquired BitcoinTrade, the second-largest crypto exchange in Brazil, in a bid to increase its footprint across the frothy Latin American crypto market.      Ripio (formerly called BitPagos) ended 2020 on a high, crossing the 1 million user milestone. Earlier last year, the firm began looking in earnest for a good fit in Brazil and decided on BitcoinTrade, said Ripio CEO and co-founder Sebastian Serrano. The financial terms of the deal were not revealed.      “Brazil has always been a very important market for us,” Serrano said in an interview. “BitcoinTrade has a very good reputation in the market, very good processes and compliance. It also has a very meaningful user base – about 300,000 users in Brazil – and very good volumes on the exchange.”      Serrano also pointed to BitcoinTrade’s well-established banking relationships in Brazil, which includes accounts with Santander, Banco Itaú and Banco do Brasil.      Brazil has the largest GDP in Latin America and seems to be a highly desirable virgin territory among South American and Central American crypto exchanges. Last month, Mexico City-based crypto exchange Bitso raised a $62 million funding round, a chunk of which was earmarked for a Brazil push, the company said.    See also: Coinbase-Backed Bitso Raises $62M to Expand Crypto Footprint in Brazil    “We have a very good relationship with Bitso,” said Serrano. “Bitso and ourselves are the two really well-funded companies with access to venture capital. There are no companies in that position in Brazil.

The criminals tricked the 37-year-old man into a meeting outside a hotel in North Point on Monday, where two men arrived in a car to pick up the victim, the South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday.  Police said the trader had chatted with the men online before agreeing to the in-person meeting to sell the men 15 BTC.  The trader was paid around HK$3 million (almost US$387,000) in cash in the car after he'd transferred the bitcoin to the two buyers, said the report, citing a police source.  The men then drove the trader an estimated 6 kilometers where they met another three men before forcing him out of the car on a Hong Kong hillside.  The man was not injured, but the cash and two mobile phones were stolen, per the report.  The 15 BTC, at a price of around $31,000 on Monday, would have been worth US$465,000, meaning approximately US$852,000 was stolen in total.

42385544,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2BgJ,1609847332,Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $31K After Monday's Drop,"Bitcoin is trading higher on Tuesday, and the bull market is looking less overheated than it did a day ago.      At press time, the top cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands near $31,590, representing a 5% gain on a 24-hour basis. Bitcoin had dipped by 15% to near $28,000 during Monday's European trading hours.      The sudden sell-off happened after the average perpetual funding rate (the cost of holding long positions) on major derivatives exchanges rose to an 11-month high of 0.137%, implying excess bullish leverage.      ""The bitcoin futures market was very over-leveraged and overcrowded before the drop,"" analyst Joseph Young noted in a Substack post, adding the market now looks less overheated with funding rates having dropped.      The average now stands at 0.039%, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode. Further, major exchanges liquidated $936 billion worth of long positions on Monday – the highest in at least eight months – wiping out excess leverage.    Sentiment remains bullish    Bitcoin's swift recovery from Monday's low indicates dip demand, a sign of the bullish mood in the market.      ""The Coinbase premium reappeared as bitcoin began to recover, which is a good sign,"" Young noted. ""This means high-net-worth investors in the U.S. took advantage of the drop and bought bitcoin.""      The options market continues to paint a bullish picture amid the high price volatility, with the one-, three-, and six-month put-call skews hovering well into the negative territory, according to data source Skew.      Put-call skews measure the cost of puts (bearish bets) relative to calls (bullish bets). Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show scope for a continued price rally.      While bitcoin's market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score has risen to a three-year high of 5.32, it remains well below the 7.0 level at which an asset is considered near a top, per Glassnode. Historically, above-7.0 readings have marked an end of bull markets.      According to trader Alex Kruger, Monday's low of $28,154 could turn out to be this week's bottom, especially if the U.S. Democrats sweep Tuesday's Georgia elections and gain control of the Senate.      A Democrat-controlled Senate would pave the way for more significant fiscal stimulus, according to Goldman Sachs. Fiscal stimulus is inflationary in nature and would likely strengthen the long-term bull case of scarce assets such as gold and bitcoin.

FinCEN proposed the regulations in December, potentially requiring users to comply with know-your-customer requirements if they want to send cryptocurrency from an exchange to a private wallet. The agency's public comment period on the proposed wallet rules ended Monday.      The agency would require personal information from the owner of the private wallet if the amount sent from a crypto exchange is greater than $10,000 in 24 hours. It would also require crypto exchanges keep records for transactions valued at over $3,000.      Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has also offered comment on the proposal, recently saying the rules could “adversely impact” the effectiveness of existing anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regulations. Crypto exchange Coinbase said the 15-day comment period was insufficient to provide detailed feedback on the complex topic and suggested the rules were being rushed through by the outgoing Trump administration.      Square has made notable investments in bitcoin and offers cryptocurrency services through its Cash App. ""The burdensome information collection and reporting requirements deprive U.S. companies like Square of the chance to compete on a level playing field to enable cryptocurrency as a tool of economic empowerment,"" according to the letter.      VC firm Andreessen Horowitz said Monday that ""FinCEN has proposed at the eleventh hour of an outgoing administration a rule that has all the hallmarks of an arbitrary and capricious agency action.""

""A crowding out of gold as an 'alternative' currency implies big upside for bitcoin over the long term,"" strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note on Monday. ""Bitcoin's [current] market capitalization of around $575 billion would have to rise by 4.6 times – for a theoretical bitcoin price of $146,000 – to match the total private sector investment in gold via exchange-traded funds or bars and coins.""      However, analysts argued that bitcoin's price volatility needs to drop for institutions to make large allocations. The convergence of bitcoin and gold volatilities is a ""multi-year process"" and suggests that the $146,000-plus target is a long-term objective, JPMorgan noted.      Bitcoin rallied by 300% to $29,000 in 2020 and extended gains to a new record price of $34,420 in the first three days of the new year. The cryptocurrency has gained over 160% in the last three months alone, helped along by increased institutional participation.      While the crypto community expects the rally to continue, JPMorgan sees signs of ""speculative mania"" and believes further big gains towards the region of $50,000-$100,000 may be unsustainable in the near term.

42385536,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2BXV,1609811506,Crypto Markets Jump on OCC Approval for Banks to Use Blockchains,"Cryptocurrency prices jumped Monday evening after the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a letter approving U.S. banks to use public blockchain networks.      Ether jumped nearly 12% on the letter's release, given Ethereum's dominance as a stablecoin payment settlement protocol, and bitcoin gained 5%. Both leading cryptocurrencies almost fully retraced Sunday evening's losses.      ""After a flurry of negative regulatory news, investors are pleased to see positive regulatory news allowing stablecoin and public blockchain integration into the traditional banking sector,"" said Justin Yashouafar, managing partner at Santa Monica-based Blockhead Capital.      The letter addressed national banks and federal savings associations participating as nodes on a blockchain and storing or validating payments made in native digital assets or stablecoins.            The OCC's letter stands in contrast to a bill introduced in the last U.S. Congress session that would have required stablecoin issuers to obtain bank charters. That aggressively anti-stablecoin proposal resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations sent to leading cryptocurrency advocacy group Coin Center.      In mid-December the Treasury Department proposed enhanced know-your-customer (KYC) rules on U.S. cryptocurrency users that want to transfer their holdings from an exchange to their own personal wallets.      Yashouafar noted the positive reactions of bitcoin and ether Monday were followed by price jumps from native tokens for other stablecoin-supporting networks, such as Algorand and Solana, both of which support the two largest stablecoins: tether (USDT) and Circle's USDC stablecoin.      Yet, while the prices of ether and algorand ""reacted immediately to the news,"" Yashouafar pointed out that Solana's had not.      Bitcoin has gained nearly 13% already in 2021 at last check, trading hands above $32,500.
