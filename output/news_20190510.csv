42381889,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q10d,1557528841,The Big Question at Ethereal Summit NY: Is DeFi Enough for Ethereum?,"Ethereum's true believers think the world's second-largest blockchain can still be all-encompassing. Others think a more-focused path would be best.  That was the tension on display at Day 1 of the ConsenSys-organized Ethereal Summit NY, a Blockchain Week gathering held at Pioneer Works in Red Hook, Brooklyn on Friday.  ""Ethereum's going to eat everything,"" Ameen Soleimani, SpankChain founder and summoner of the MolochDAO, said during one panel.  Earlier in the day, Messari founder Ryan Selkis offered a counterpoint. If ethereum, he argued, truly reinvents finance, that would be plenty.  ""If you think about ethereum as programmable money and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, that's probably good enough,"" Selkis argued.  It reflected an underlying tension at the conference, one where ethereum's creators and most ardent adherents envision a blockchain that reinvents the web as we know it.  Still, speakers kept coming back to DeFi, which was unquestionably a major recurring theme for the day, given the rise of ethereum lending platform MakerDAO. But it was also clear that the crowd was not ready to give up on ethereum running the decentralized web.  Soleimani's ""ultimate bull case"" for the blockchain, for example, was when DeFi reaches the nation-state level.  Soleimani said:  ""The announcement that I'm waiting for is the first small nation to announce they are issuing their own currency on ethereum.""  Where to focus  To Selkis' point, ethereum's ability to run a new internet hinges on building robust technology that can take much of the pressure off Vitalik Buterin's still-constrained creation.  ""If Layer 2 does not work, ethereum will not work. I believe that with pretty high conviction,"" Tushar Jain, co-founder of Multicoin Capital, said from the Ethereal main stage. ""There are other Layer 1 chains out there that outperform ethereum on multiple dimensions.""  Kaleido  co-founder Sophia Lopez was more circumspect on the question, though. The trouble with the Web3 visions for ethereum, she argued, is that ""It doesn't translate into anything actionable, today.""  She said building toward that long term was still fine, but added, ""People need to get excited about what they can do today.""  Brian Flynn of Dapper Labs and the NFTY News newsletter was not circumspect. When asked if ethereum should drop all other applications for DeFi, he gave an immediate head shake.  ""I think DeFi is a solution looking for a problem,"" Flynn said. ""Last year people were all about NFTs and this year they are all about DeFi. It's just recency bias.""  'Narrative shift'  ConsenSys Chief Strategy Officer Sam Cassatt gave a talk on-stage arguing that humans now evolve by building better institutions.  He showed a screenshot of a group of people doing a group video chat and said:  ""This is a live Maker governace call. It's equivalent to watching the Fed set interest rate policy.""  In other words, DeFi seems to be what gives the original smart contract chain its strongest bragging rights these days. It's the value proposition on which its hopes seem to hang.  MakerDAO, the most well known of the DeFi dapps, has been beset by controversy of late. Nevertheless, the MakerDAO smart contract has $346 million in ETH locked up in it, 83 percent of all the ETH locked in the DeFi sector as a whole, according to DeFi Pulse.  If the main use case remains financial, the question for ethereum is whether DeFi is all it needs to be. It's a narrative question for ethereum's community, says Long Reads Sunday curator Nathaniel Whittemore, one the community should have seen coming.  ""This is an inevitable narrative shift,"" Whittemore said, pointing to those who question the DeFi narrative as nothing more than Ponzi schemes on the blockchain versus those who spin it as a revolution.  Whether the question is raised as a defensive counternarrative or a legitimate critique, Whittemore argued that communities like ethereum's need to be ready to grapple with these big challenges when they arise.  Said Whittemore:  ""If you don't understand the narrative your project is coming into, you're a ship without a rudder.""

42381877,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q0o3,1557521144,Boston Fed Announces Plans To Design a Blockchain 'Supervisory Node',"The Federal Reserve of Boston is starting a new blockchain experiment this summer.  The Massachusetts state regulator has been one of the earliest and most involved government bodies to dip their toe into the new technology. It has been quietly developing blockchain systems since 2016 but has said very little about their plans.  Now the first results of those trials are out and the Boston Fed published a white paper on its proof-of-concepts on ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. Now it’s getting ready for the next stage, Boston Fed’s vice president of IT Paul Brassil told CoinDesk.  The team is going to look into possible opportunities to set up a “supervisory node,” a regulatory surveillance tool that should be able to connect to various banking blockchains in the future. This node will watch the money flows and settlements between different banks, Boston Fed’s senior vice president Jim Cunha said.  “If you look at the future, there might be one blockchain that is holding securities, one that is holding derivatives, one is holding cash or interbank transfer — how do you as a supervisor watch the traffic on all these platforms that also will be on different technology?”  Cunha adds, that Boston Fed is not looking at these explorations from a policy standpoint and that is expects to work with the central Federal Reserve on these rules. But in the meantime monetary authorities have to keep apace with the technology development.  “We are surrounded by very large financial institutions and banks and we know that all of them are experimenting with the blockchain technology. So the more we can work with them and understand their roadmap, the more we know that we’re moving in a right direction,"" Brassil said.  First, the Boston Fed plans to set the agenda and determine the main direction of this experiment and the work on this ideological part will start as early as this summer. Cunha said there are no plans yet for the publicly releasing the project.  ""Right now there is very little research on it, so our next goal is to look into what an audit node look like,"" Cunha said. ""What kind of data we should have access to, how to interact, how to update nodes, can you create operational problems with it? What kind of coding you will need to do to store the information about the movement of funds, so you can do analysis of the flows. We are really starting from scratch.”  In the future, it could be possible that we will see multiple blockchains by various banking institutions, Brassil said, so the Fed’s supervisory node should have a technical capacity “broad enough to cover all the platforms.”  “Startup in the basement mentality”  Boston Fed started blockchain technology trials back in 2016 by experimenting with ethereum. At that time, there were no specialized blockchain developers on staff, so the team of coders educated themselves watching relevant videos on YouTube. Cunha and Brassil called it their ""startup in the basement.""  During that period, developers tried to put depository institution balances under the Boston Fed supervision on a blockchain and create mock transactions — a kind of a blockchain-powered back office model. They conducted the testing first on the ethereum blockchain and then on Hyperledger Fabric. In the end, the latter was considered a more suitable option.  Why did they pick Fabric? first of all, a permissioned blockchain is preferable for a government entity. Among other challenges, the necessity to maintain a supply of ether to pay gas in transactions complicated the task and they were also worried about speed limitations.  ""The time necessary to create a block was slower than could be tolerated in a production environment,"" the white paper said.  Now, with the project of the blockchain back office on hold and the ""supervisory node"" experiment in the pipeline, Boston Fed is hiring some professionals to ramp up its blockchain testing, Cunha told CoinDesk.  “We are trying to add stuff to do something more robust internally, we need more dedicated resources,"" he said. The new blockchain team will not be large, though, only ""a handful"" of people.  Boston Fed is also actively talking to other monetary authority bodies, though Cunha and Brassil won't name the particular institutions. That said, they are excited to spread the word about the project.  “We have to share information because the whole industry needs to educate itself,"" Cunha said.

The coverage, announced Friday, is an add-on to the Tel Aviv-based Curv’s Institutional Digital Asset Wallet Service,  ""Curv will have the financial capability to pay for losses of crypto assets,"" the partners said in a press release Tuesday.  The startup claims that ""digital assets cannot be stolen from Curv’s Wallet Service with a single cyber breach or even through insider collusion."" Even so, the insurance policy is available as a further line of defense.  Specifically, Munich RE is insuring Curv against the risks of ""an external cyber breach or malicious behavior by Curv or one of its employees,"" Curv said. Customers using the wallet can opt-in for the insurance by paying an additional cost based on the amount of assets they store with Curv.  Munich Re audited Curv's technology and found ""their approach enables us to underwrite a policy that covers customer-controlled wallets in Internet-connected settings,"" said Ali Kumcu, Munich Re's head of cyber innovation and services.  That approach dispenses with the usual mix of so-called hot wallets, which are connected to the internet, and cold storage, in which cryptographic private keys are kept on a piece of paper or an offline device and locked away in a safe or even an electromagnetic field-proof cage.  Instead, ""the product applies multi-party-computations to the private key signing mechanism, eliminating the private keys altogether,"" explained Curv CEO Itay Malinger. ""This brings a distributed security model to the signature mechanism.""  The company raised $6.5 million in February 2019 from Team8 and Digital Currency Group.  With its security system, ""Curv can enforce a corporate [access] policy from the cloud and completely out of band, so that an attacker or an insider within Curv or within its customers are unable to sign transactions because they simply don't have enough cryptographic material,"" said Malinger, concluding:  ""This is also what makes the service insurable.""

Stepping back, MolochDAO launched publicly in March as a crowdsourced funding initiative to support ethereum infrastructure projects. It was started with 22 founding members, each depositing 100 ETH (the equivalent of $17,000 at today’s price) into the decentralized and autonomous grants system.  As stated in the MolochDAO white paper, the immediate goal of the initiative was to fund further development of the next major iteration of the ethereum blockchain, ethereum 2.0.  With the announcement of additional funding today at Ethereal, Soleimani told CoinDesk he would “love to have more insight from wider groups of people with diverse and complementary viewpoints to help make sure all the blind spots are covered.""  With the 4,000 ETH donation ($700,000 at today’s price), both Lubin and Buterin, along with the 20 individuals from ConsenSys and the Ethereum Foundation who have submitted donations, will be voted in as members of the decentralized autonomous organization. Members are able to submit funding proposals to the platform and have them approved with a simple majority vote from all members in the system.  Soleimani told CoinDesk:  “It’s inspiring to see the leads of the ethereum community join together and help try out new coordination mechanisms to help move the ethereum ecosystem forward.”  Today’s donation will raise the valuation of MolochDAO's funding pool to over $1 million, Soleimani said. It's currently valued at nearly $400,000.

42381879,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q0pJ,1557513908,QuadrigaCX Has $21 Million in Assets and Owes $160 Million: EY Report,"QuadrigaCX, the Canadian crypto exchange that collapsed after the death of its CEO and founder late last year, has just $21 million in assets, but owes creditors $160 million, its court-appointed monitor and trustee said.  The latest report by Ernst and Young (EY), which is dated May 1 but appears to have been published in the last few days, outlines three legal entities affiliated with the exchange – Quadriga Fintech Solutions Corp., Whiteside Capital Corporation and 0984750 B.C. Ltd., each of which is presented as its own bankrupt firm.  As a result, each entity has its own list of assets and liabilities, even though they overlap. As of April 12:  Quadriga Fintech Solutions had $254,180 CAD ($189,345 USD) and owed $214,873,113 CAD ($160,051,461 USD);  Whiteside Capital Corporation had no assets and owed $214,618,937 CAD ($159,875,011 USD); and  0984750 B.C. had $28,649,542 CAD ($21,343,192 USD) and owed $215,697,147 CAD ($160,688,982 USD).  ""There is a material discrepancy between the reported fiat and cryptocurrency obligations"" due to the fact that there were different estates, creditors and known assets, wrote George Kinsman, the EY employee acting as the monitor and trustee.  Kinsman also cited shoddy bookkeeping as an issue EY faced when pulling together these numbers.  Where's the money?  Stepping back, Quadriga entered a civil rehabilitation process at the end of January, when Jennifer Robertson, the widow of Quadriga founder Gerald Cotten, wrote in an affidavit that the exchange was unable to access its cold, or offline, crypto wallets following his death.  EY was unable to locate any cryptocurrencies in the cold wallet addresses listed by Quadriga, however, aside from 103 bitcoin accidentally transferred from a hot wallet.  Addressing EY's efforts to locate Quadriga's missing funds in this week's report, Kinsman wrote:  ""A complete and fulsome review of Quadriga’s financial affairs will take considerable time and effort to pursue and may not be possible or cost effective to complete given the lack of available information, the volume of transactions processed and the number of [third-party payment processors] and crypto currency exchanges involved, many of whom to date, have not fully cooperated with the Monitor's investigation.""  EY also holds about $500,000 in cryptocurrency recovered from Quadriga's hot, or online, wallets ""and various other sources."" Broken down, EY holds 61 bitcoin, 33 bitcoin cash, 2,661 bitcoin gold, 851 litecoin and 960 ether. The report did not address what progress, if any, EY has made in locating the exchange's other missing cryptos.  While Robertson initially estimated that the exchange may have as many as 115,000 creditors, Kinsman wrote in the new report that Miller Thomson, the court-appointed representative counsel for the exchange's users, had presented an omnibus proof of claim for 76,319.  Miller Thomson also presented the $214,618,928 CAD figure that is being used to calculate liabilities.  In addition to Quadriga's users, Robertson is listed as a secured creditor, and is owed $300,000 CAD ($223,500 USD) based on her costs in starting the civil rehabilitation process, though Kinsman said he expects this claim to be challenged.  Costodian, a payment processor for Quadriga, has also claimed $774,214 CAD ($577,200) in processing fees, though this claim has yet to be resolved in court.  Founder's estate  Kinsman also addressed the estate of Cotten and Robertson. In a previous report, he noted that it appeared corporate funds may have been used to purchase personal goods, and EY agreed to an asset preservation order with Robertson's attorneys to prevent the liquidation of any assets.  In this week's report, Kinsman noted that while the order is in effect, ""for the purpose of the Quadriga Statement of Affairs the Quadriga Estate has valued this possible asset category at $1,"" a placeholder figure that indicates the exchange may have more than just the $21 million in assets that were already listed.  While the assets in the estate have not been appraised, ""the preserving parties"" have told Kinsman that they approximate $12 million CAD (about $9 million USD), meaning they still would be insufficient to fill the hole Quadriga finds itself in.

Announced Thursday, Shatner is partnering with Mattereum, a legaltech firm headed by former ethereum launch coordinator Vinay Gupta, to highlight its Asset Passport technology, which uses “legally-binding” smart contracts to record the authenticity of collectible items.  Shatner aka Captain Kirk said that he is collaborating with the startup to “establish an authentication system” that provides data on where an item has been, who has owned it, and if it is genuine.  “It can mean the difference between a priceless, future heirloom and worthless fake,” Shatner said.  The initiative will create ""digital twins"" of science fiction and other collectible memorabilia. The first item that has gone live on Mattereum's system is “Capt. James Kirk in Casual Attire,” autographed by Shatner. The digital clone will rest in an immutable ledger and ""will assure collectors that the item is from Mr Shatner’s personal collection,"" the firm said.  Chris Wray, Mattereum chief legal officer, said:  “The Mattereum Asset Passport gives you reliable provenance for your collection, backed by the liability of those who certify it – and ultimately their collateral, insurance, and personal assets.”  An independent art and collectibles expert, Paul Camuso, who is involved with the initiative, commented that the global art and collectibles market is estimated to be valued at around $67 billion annually and as trading moves online collectors are increasingly looking for digital authenticity solutions.

42381888,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q0zN,1557508856,Canaccord Analysts Predict Bitcoin Price Return to $20K In 2021,"Analysts at Canaccord Genuity expect to see a little bit of history repeating.  In a research note sent to the investment bank's clients Thursday, analyst Michael Graham and associates Matthew Volpe and Alexander Frankiewicz predicted a return to bitcoin's stratospheric late-2017 high over the next 24 months.  They wrote:  Now four months into 2019, we note for the third time the striking similarity in bitcoin's price action between 2011-2015 and 2015-2019. While this simple pattern recognition has little fundamental basis, we note that bitcoin does operate on a four-year cycle of sorts, as the halving of bitcoin's mining reward occurs approximately every four years. Bitcoin has started to form the spring 2019 bottom we began mentioning last year, although a close look at the chart suggests the recovery may be slightly ahead of itself. Looking ahead, if bitcoin were to continue following the same trend, the implication is a slow climb back toward its all-time high of ~$20,000, theoretically reaching that level in March 2021.  The analysts also noted more movement in the crypto markets, saying that about ""7 million bitcoins have been shaken out of 'Cold' (not active for at least six months) status and have begun trading hands again.""  Since no one knows what the future holds, the analysts overlaid two past performances over each other, noting that with each halving of the block reward, the bitcoin price rose dramatically. The next halving is expected in 2020.  The team also points to increased Wall Street interest in cryptocurrency as a catalyst for price growth, writing:  Perhaps most important is Fidelity’s continued push into the space. After the asset management giant launched Fidelity Digital Assets last October and a custody service in March, numerous reports suggest the launch of an institutional digital assets trading business within the next few weeks. Fidelity also released a survey of 411 US institutional investors which found that 40% are open to owning digital assets within the next five years. Another factor may be Grayscale’s “Drop Gold” advertising campaign, which hit airwaves recently and targets digitally native investor base that may prefer bitcoin to gold as a non-government store of value investment. Yet another could be several corporate crypto initiatives from the likes of Facebook, Nike, and others gaining attention in the media.  The Cannacord analysts' bottom line: It's looking good.  ""In any event, bitcoin is so far one of the best-performing assets of 2019,"" they wrote.

42381874,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q0gV,1557500446,US Senators Seek Information on Facebook's 'Libra' Crypto Project,"The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is clearly concerned about Facebook's new cryptocurrency project and how it is treating individuals' financial information.  The banking committee wrote an open letter to Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg Thursday, asking him to share details about its secret cryptocurrency project, with a particular focus on consumer privacy.  ""Last year, Facebook asked U.S. banks to share detailed financial information about consumers,"" the letter says:  ""In addition, privacy experts have raised questions about Facebook's extensive data collection practices and whether any of the data collected by Facebook is being used for purposes that do or should subject Facebook to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.""  In light of these concerns, the committee wants Zuckerberg to outline how the Facebook cryptocurrency, referred to under the codename of ""Project Libra,"" would work; what outreach Facebook has done to financial regulators; and what users can expect in terms of privacy and consumer protection.  More broadly, the committee has asked Facebook to share what consumer financial information has been shared by banks and other financial institutions; what Facebook does with that information (including whether that information is shared or sold to other third parties); whether Facebook has credit rating and other personal information about individuals; and how Facebook avoids violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  Little is known about Project Libra. The company quietly began building up a blockchain research team last year, headed up by vice president and former Coinbase board member David Marcus.  The company has posted numerous job listings for the team since, and notable figures in the space such as crypto economist Christian Catalini, a researcher with MIT, have also joined the project.  The company is reportedly looking to raise as much as $1 billion for the project to use as collateral to back a stablecoin.

As part of the deal, Jefferies may periodically lend to Figure under a variable funding note, which is secured by Figure's home equity lines. WSFS Financial is acting as trustee for Jefferies.  Lines of credit have a maximum loan amount that can be borrowed as needed, paid back, and borrowed again. Figure's financing facility is custodied on its own blockchain platform called Provenance, according to the announcement.  The platform can support “the entire end-to-end financing of loans, from origination to funding to servicing to financing,"" said Cagney, adding:  ""It paves the way for the first securitization on chain, which will demonstrate the massive cost savings, risk reduction and liquidity benefits blockchain delivers.""  Brian McGrath, head of the securitized markets group at Jefferies, commented on using the blockchain:  ""We've gained full transparency into the underlying assets, real-time access to loan performance and the process of accepting collateral has less friction than off chain.""  If the prospective securitization deal closes, it will become the first asset-backed security transaction with loans originated on a blockchain platform, said WSFS’ senior vice president and director of corporate trust, Kristin Moore.

42381885,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q0vb,1557493204,What's Holding Back Bitcoin in Venezuela? This Group Is Investigating,"Open Money Initiative (OMI) co-founder and Venezuelan expat Alejandro Machado wants to help his homeland while remaining realistic about bitcoin.  The truth is, Venezuelans haven’t abandoned the inflation-riddled bolivar as quickly as he expected, namely because it is so difficult to use digital currencies inside Venezuela’s borders.  “No one wants [the bolivar] but people need it to survive,” Machado said.  Now his San Francisco-based nonprofit OMI is teaming up with crypto industry incumbents, like the peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins, to explore ideas for making cryptocurrency more useful for people in distressed economic climates like Venezuela.  “Access to products is the number one thing,” Machado said of the needs of everyday Venezuelans. “Do I have enough to eat this week or do I need to reinvent the ways that I access food?”  So far, better-off Venezeulans have mainly used bitcoin for remittances, freelance earnings from abroad and savings. Meanwhile, users of other cryptocurrencies, like dash, often rely on local ambassadors for fiat liquidity.  In order to gain more insight into diverse demographics, OMI co-founder Jamaal Montasser hired Venezuelan recruiters to gather more than 40 participants for studies exploring how people use money in times of political and social upheaval.  One such refugee, currently living in Colombia, told OMI the Venezuelan national guard would beat him if he didn’t sell coffee for the government-sanctioned price in bolivars. Another Venezuelan, who now crosses the Colombian border regularly to find work, smuggles back American dollars in her underwear and hair.  In such circumstances, a digital currency would seem ideal. But OMI’s research found such users have habits and circumstances that current bitcoin wallets don’t account for.  “The things that people wanted to buy, they couldn’t buy with bitcoin,” OMI co-founder Jill Carlson told CoinDesk. “You could find merchants willing to accept bitcoin for more high-end goods, but not for more basic or staple goods. You can’t go buy bread with bitcoin in Caracas.”  Montasser said in many Venezuelan stores that do accept cryptocurrency there might only be one particular person who knows how to operate digital wallets. So shoppers need to sync up with that person’s schedule. Indeed, mobile wallets are one of the underlying challenges for bitcoin users in Venezuela because it is common for Venezuelans to pool their money and even share one bitcoin wallet with family or friends.  “There’s certainly some type of case to be made for family banking tools,” Montasser said. “What we saw in the field was people need systems and products and tools to help elevate trust with the people that they already interact with.”  This supports what Human Rights Foundation (HRF) chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein told CoinDesk about research he is conducting with bitcoin users in Iran, India, and Nigeria.  “Both with remittances and commerce, people are using bitcoin as a bridge between two different monies,” Gladstein said of users that leverage bitcoin to access fiat when they need it.  Agnostic research  HRF is one of several organizations that support OMI so far. Others include the Zcash Foundation, IDEO, Cosmos, Tezos, Stellar and GiveCrypto.  To be clear, these organizations, and independent backer Zooko Wilcox of the Electronic Coin Company, all donate to the nonprofit OMI for independent research and insights beyond cryptocurrency.  “It is nice to have an autonomous organization, especially when it comes to showing up somewhere without an agenda,” Gladstein said of getting a better understanding of how people are using money.  Wilcox agreed, saying protocol-agnostic insights are crucial for crypto companies because it’s still unclear if or how cryptocurrencies could be useful in distressed markets like Venezuela.  “It’s really important to connect the technological ideas, the product ideas, even the economic theories that we come up with to real people’s lives,” he said.  As such, the OMI team said they are now sharing their research with companies seeking specific product and feature ideas that suit the needs of economically distressed and politically censored populations.  “It looks like in this case, with bitcoin in particular, the LocalBitcoins platform became a vital way for Venezuelans to access the global economy,” Gladstein said.

The expanded bank options come courtesy of an integration with Plaid, a fintech service that enables applications to connect with users' bank accounts using APIs.  Until now, Abra users in the U.S. and EU have had the option to fund their wallets via a bank transfer. With the new feature, they will have banks connected in-app for funding their purchases.  Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra, said:  “The addition of these new liquidity enhancements in our app gives users more ways to move between crypto and fiat.  “Consumers need to be able to invest their money wherever they choose, regardless of where they bank,” said Plaid’s head of sales, Paul Williamson. With the integration, Abra users who bank with smaller institutions will have more investment options, he said.  In the same announcement, Abra said it has expanded native withdrawal support to all 30 supported cryptocurrencies. Previously, it users could withdraw only bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH).    With the extra withdrawal options, users will have more options for storing their holdings, including hardware wallets, the firm said.    Abra is also expecting to expand crypto deposit support “in the near future,” the firm’s VP of product, Willie Wang, said.  Notably, the firm will soon allow global users to buy fractions of traditional investment instruments.  Back in Februry, Abra said its app will utilize the bitcoin blockchain and smart contract technologies to support fractional investments in stocks and exchange-traded funds.

42381890,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q139,1557486017,"As Bitcoin Continues Its Climb, Top Crypto Assets Tease Breakouts","View  Bitcoin's price hit fresh six-month high earlier today, further strengthening the case for a rally to $6,500 (100-week moving average).  BTC may witness a pullback to levels near $6,100 before rising toward that level, though, according to the hourly chart.  A bull flag breakout on the total market capitalization chart for all other cryptos, if confirmed, could be considered a sign the much-anticipated altcoin rally has begun.  Among those, litecoin could shine bright as both fundamentals and technicals have aligned in favor of the bulls.      Bitcoin's (BTC) ascent continues with prices hitting new multi-month highs earlier today, and other top cryptocurrencies may soon join the party.  Bitcoin violated the resistance zone of $6,055–$6,100 with a UTC close at $6,156 on Thursday and reached a six-month high of $6,336 on Bitstamp at 07:40 UTC today.  Prices have now hit multi-month highs on three consecutive days – a sign of strong bullish sentiment. With every move higher, both the short- and long-term bull cases presented by several technical indicators over the last few weeks have gained strength.  BTC, therefore, appears on track to test the 100-week price average, currently at $6,506 – a level that last came into play last November.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,260 on Bitstamp, representing a 3.45 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Daily and weekly charts  BTC continues to establish bullish higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart (above left) with key moving averages trending north.  The relative strength index (RSI) is reporting overbought conditions with above-70 reading. That signal, however, would gain credence if and when the momentum starts weakening. As of writing, the bulls are showing no signs of exhaustion.  Further, the weekly RSI (above right) is currently printing the strongest bullish signal in over 15 months.  Hourly chart  On the hourly chart, the RSI has breached the ascending trendline to the downside and is rolling over from overbought levels. Hence, we may see a minor pullback to the ascending trendline support, currently at $6,140, before rising toward $6,500.  Altcoins tease breakout  While bitcoin has doubled in value over the last six weeks, altcoins have underperformed big time, as indicated by the massive depreciation of their BTC-denominated exchange rates.  The top 10 altcoins by market capitalization (excluding stablecoin tether/USDT) are reporting double-digit losses on a 30-day basis.  Stellar (XLM), down 40 percent, is the biggest loser, followed by cardano (ADA) and tron (TRX).  With a 14 percent drop, Binance coin (BNB) is the best performing major altcoin.  The numbers indicate a lack of interest in altcoins despite BTC's confirmation of the long-term bullish reversal on April 2.  The battered altcoins, however, could soon find some love, as their combined market capitalization seems to have charted a bullish technical pattern.  Total altcoin market capitalization  The bull flag seen in the above chart is a continuation pattern that often ends up accelerating the preceding rally.  A convincing break above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $73.65 billion, would confirm a flag breakout and signal a continuation of the rise from lows near $45 billion seen in February.  A flag breakout, if confirmed, could be considered a sign the much-anticipated altcoin rally has begun. As of writing, the total altcoin market cap is seen at $72 billion.  Among the major altcoins, litecoin (LTC) could shine bright, as its mining reward halving is due in less than 90 days.  The process aimed at curbing inflation by reducing mining rewards by half every four years tends to put a strong bid under the cryptocurrency for months in advance, according to historical data.  Litecoin daily chart  Litecoin's channel breakout indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side. Prices, therefore, could rise above $100 ahead of the reward halving event.

42381883,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q0wr,1557483313,Ethereum Stablecoin DAI Is Trending Towards Its Highly Sought Dollar Value,"After four months, the ethereum-based stablecoin DAI looks to be maintaining a steady dollar valuation.  Since January, the theoretically USD-pegged token has fallen below dollar valuation, trading hands at or above $1 only sporadically. However, for the past few days, DAI across four different cryptocurrency exchanges has been exchanging above the dollar level and is worth exactly $1 at press time.  MakerDAO is currently the most popular decentralized finance application in the crypto space, according to site DeFi Pulse. There is an estimated 87 million DAI presently in circulation, according to blockchain analytics site Alethio, and an estimated $300 million worth of ether locked in the MakerDAO system that supports the token's value.  As of now, there are still a number of bids occurring below $1, as recorded by data scientist Alex Svanevik. Specifically, roughly $600,000 in DAI tokens are still trading on leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase between the $0.98 and $1.00 range.  However, as Svanevik notes, this is a measurable increase from trades as low as $0.95 which have taken place on Coinbase in the last two months.  ""So now that DAI has recovered to [about] $0.99, this is by many considered 'close enough' to the $1 peg."" Svanevik told CoinDesk.  To this, David Hoffman – COO of cryptocurrency real estate platform RealTPlatform – reaffirmed in a community call Tuesday that discussions over the DAI dollar peg could soon be moving into ""a new phase.""  ""The last three months has been how do we get DAI back to a dollar and now it's looking like DAI is strongly above 99 cents,"" Hoffman said during the call. ""That brings into relevancy a bunch of new questions like how close to a dollar should we have? What is an acceptable bound to be around a dollar...How long do we want DAI to be around 99 cents to a dollar before we claim that the peg is fixed?""  A healthy peg  Utrobin also highlighted on Tuesday that the present supply of DAI has contracted from an all-time high of 96 million DAI in circulation. This supply contraction, according to Utrobin, is a result of consecutive fee increases over the past four months that has slowly but surely caused the DAI peg to get ""healthier.""  Svanevik added that, in his view, increased demand for the DAI along with supply retraction through fee hikes has helped the stablecoin achieve a healthier state.  There have been eight consecutive fee hikes in the past four months to programmatic lending protocol MakerDAO which issues DAI tokens in exchange for native ethereum cryptocurrency, ether. Loans to create DAI initially accrued interest at 0.5 percent.  Now, that interest – also called the Stability Fee – for all current DAI loans has increased 39 fold to sit at 19.5 percent. Since the first Stability Fee increase back in February, over 30 million DAI has been burned, according to data from Alethio.  Today, Vishesh Choudhry of the MakerDAO Foundation's Risk Team reaffirmed on a governance and risk call that ""the most clear and measurable impact of the Stability Fee increases"" has been contracting DAI supply. However, the impact such supply contractions have had on DAI price Choudhry was less certifiable.  On the other hand, Svanevik suspects that both the recent controversy surrounding dollar stablecoin Tether and the attractive DAI interest rates on cryptocurrency lending platforms such as Compound have caused a higher influx of demand for DAI.  Whether or not the current upward trend for DAI price will last beyond a few short days remains to be seen. ""I think it will be a week or two before we can say that the peg is restored with any certainty,"" Richard Brown, head of community for the project, wrote in the MakerDAO chatroom Tuesday.  Looking ahead to the potential need for further fee increases, Brown asked today during the call:  ""How do we know when the peg is stable? What kind of deviation over time do we deem is acceptable?""

42381887,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q11t,1557480646,"Binance, Bitfinex and Tether: What's the Worst That Can Happen?","Daniel Cawrey is chief executive officer of Pactum Capital, a quantitative cryptocurrency investment firm and hedge fund. The views expressed are those of the authors and are not investment advice.      All investors, institutional or otherwise, have a duty to try to see the world as it truly is. Not as they wish it to be. This is especially true when putting investment dollars at risk. One needs to ask questions to understand elements influencing the outcome of an investment.  One of those questions is: How could things go wrong here?  Investment guru Charlie Munger, for example, says: “Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where don't we want to go, and how do you get there?”  There is potential for catastrophic, systemic risk in crypto right now. Recent events surrounding Binance, Bitfinex and the stablecoin Tether necessitate this conversation.  Yet it is strange how infrequently one hears the concept of systemic risk mentioned in this space.  Headed towards default?  The New York Attorney General continues to demand more information from Bitfinex and Tether. The NYAG indicates that there are numerous inconsistencies with Bitfinex/Tether's statements.  This makes them want to “understand what has taken place, and what continues to take place, at these companies.” Even so, a judge has narrowed the scope of information that Bitfinex/Tether need to provide.  Source: TokenAnalyst    Now, if we read ever so slightly between the lines, there seems to be a suggestion that there may be further improprieties. Or at least the NYAG is reasonably certain it is worthwhile to investigate this further. They’ve already stated that they believe there may be fraud involved.  So, it makes sense that they want to find out the extent of it and whether other illegal activities have happened or continue to happen.  If this indeed turns out to be the case, enforcement action could be taken by the government against Tether. If such action prevents USDT from being freely traded, holders of tether would then almost certainly sustain significant losses.  But that’s only part of the picture. Binance has decided to suspend deposits and withdrawals for a week after a $40 million hack. Suspension of funding flows is never a good thing, especially since Binance’s public USDT wallet has been drained of hundreds of millions of dollars without explanation.  Really, how bad could it be?  Remarkably, USDT is still the most widely used stablecoin. Traders use it extensively to move into and out of positions on crypto exchanges across the globe.  However, it’s possible USDT could get locked up or otherwise become unusable. There would likely be a cascade of activity following that. This could cause massive, ecosystem-wide harm to the entire crypto space.  Many exchanges (including Binance nd Bitfinex) likely couldn’t function. Assets would likely get locked up in court battles that could take years to resolve. Think Lehman Brothers.  When they fell, the rest of Wall Street felt the pain.  As an interesting side note, it is possible that large traders or other holders decide to sell off USDT. This would be in favor of a coin that is perceived to be safer, like BTC. This could happen with a lot of volume. It could drive up the price of BTC short-term as people exit USDT positions and park funds in BTC.  It may be tempting to look at BTC’s recent price increase as a positive sign. Yet it is worthwhile to consider whether it may be due to people dumping tether positions and rolling them into BTC to some extent.  A house of cards?  Despite bad news, the BTC price keeps going up.  Regulators could immediately take significant action against Bitfinex/Tether. It could have a cascading effect whereby exchanges simply blow up. To borrow a phrase from Bitmex’s Arthur Hayes, altcoins could get ""molly-whopped.""  If the government finds conclusive evidence of fraud committed by Tether or Bitfinex, then it stands to reason that decisive action would be taken as a result. The fallout from such a scenario would likely envelop the whole crypto space.  Preparing for a potential crypto collapse may be a prudent and rational move. Those with large allocations to digital assets should think carefully. Imagine a large exchange locking up. Or traders panicking from the biggest stablecoin imploding or getting seized by authorities.  Do you think crypto investments will be safe then? What exactly will happen to them if everyone is trying to head for the exits?  A new hope  ""Affairs are easier of entrance than of exit; and it is but common prudence to see our way out before we venture in.""  When the Greek storyteller Aesop said this around the 6th century BC, it is highly unlikely that he was envisioning the digital asset ecosystem. And yet this quote contains untold amounts of wisdom. Much of which applies directly to crypto and digital asset investing.  While we do actually hope we are wrong here, we also feel it’s better to err on the side of safety. If there is a systemic shock to the crypto space, it is likely that many investments will suffer. Both liquid crypto assets, and illiquid ones.  If the shock is sufficiently bad, it would be reasonable to expect a repricing of assets that could take valuations back to 2016 or 2015 levels.  Think about how you would exit a building if there were hundreds or thousands of people trying to exit through the same door as you. Before you walk into that building, you had better have an exit plan (or two) in place.  Don’t believe us? Ask the people who lost their retirement savings because of the 2008 financial crisis.

42381878,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9q0mn,1557477425,Crypto Exchange Binance Says It's Revamping Security in Post-Hack Update,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance said it is revamping security measures after losing some 7,000 bitcoin worth over $40 million in a hack earlier this week.  “Significant” changes related to its application programming interface (API), two-factor authentication (2FA) and withdrawal validation are being made, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a blog post published on Friday.  The exchange did not disclose more details regarding these efforts, but said it is also improving its risk management and know-your-customer procedures to fight phishing, among other additional security measures at the back-end.  Binance will take action of some of the measures within this week and in the coming weeks in order to resume services at the earliest, according to the post. Zhao said tentatively, the exchange is looking to resume withdrawals and deposits ""early next week.”  Binance will also be adding support for hardware-based 2FA devices such as YubiKey ""very soon,"" the CEO further said, adding that 1,000 YubiKeys will also be given away once the feature is live.  Binance first announced it had lost 7,000 bitcoin on Tuesday, saying hackers had gained access to user API keys and two-factor authentication codes, allowing them to withdraw bitcoin from one of the exchange’s hot wallets.  Immediately after discovering the breach, withdrawals and deposits were suspended, while trading was not affected. Binance said it would cover the loss for all impacted customers using its own emergency fund.  As of Wednesday, 2,500 of the stolen bitcoin had been shifted around and broken up into small amounts, a move that may be designed to obscure if and when the hacker decides to cash them out.

The proposed ETF, posted by the SEC on May 9, was created by Crescent Crypto Index Services LLC, a subsidiary of Crescent Crypto Asset Management LLC, to track the performance of a market capitalization-weighted portfolio of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  Dubbed the USCF Crescent Crypto Index Fund (ticker symbol ""XBET""), the ETF is sponsored by United States Commodity Funds LLC (USCF), which will invest XBET’s assets in the two portfolio cryptocurrencies.  The prospectus states:  ""XBET is an exchange traded fund. This means that most investors who decide to buy or sell shares of XBET place their trade orders through their brokers and may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges. Shares of XBET are expected to trade on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol “XBET” and will be bought and sold throughout the trading day at bid and ask prices like other publicly traded securities.""  USCF is a commodity pool operator subject that comes under the regulatory oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), according to the filing.  ""Crescent's mission is to create innovative investment solutions that make cryptocurrencies accessible to mainstream investors,"" said Christopher Matta, co-founder of Crescent, in a press release.  XBET adds to the list of crypto ETFs currently being reviewed by the SEC. Decisions on two bitcoin ETFs – one from filed by Bitwise Asset Management with NYSE Arca, and the other from VanEck and SolidX, in partnership with Cboe BZX Exchange – were postponed late in March.  While the SEC has not yet approved any crypto ETFs, it may be just a matter of time before one passes muster with the regulator.  In an interview with Roll Call in early February, SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson offered the opinion that an ETF proposal will “satisfy the standards” the regulator has set, “eventually.”  This is not the first ETF proposal that involves ether. Back in 2017, the SEC was weighing whether to approve a product from EtherIndex Ether Trust that would also list on NYSE Arca.

Binance, the biggest crypto exchange by volume, was hacked on Tuesday. The hacker took $40 million or 7000 BTC.  Binance had a chance to recover these funds. They could cut a deal with the majority hashpower miners. The miners would reverse the chain and gain a share of the stolen money.  Binance this time decided not to make the deal with miners. And as time goes on, the attack becomes harder. But all it took was a private phone call. The majority hashpower lies under control of a handful of men. They can collude and reverse the chain.    Truth is that reorgs are not prevented by the Bitcoin protocol (except against low hashrate mining coalitions), but instead by the social, legal, and political reality of the Bitcoin community        CZ says ""pls"", Bitcoiners say ""no"" and demand homage, so CZ says ""ok! It's #immutable"" https://t.co/zhFhBSt8SH    — Vlad 'ETH is not money' Zamfir (@VladZamfir) May 8, 2019      We got lucky this time.  The Binance event has shaken the core of Bitcoin. The main criticism of Ethereum is now valid too for Bitcoin. In July 2016, Ethereum reversed a $50 million hack of the DAO smart contract. This made many angry, that Ethereum can be changed. This was a main critique made by Bitcoin against Ethereum. But the DAO hack blockchain reversal could also happen on Bitcoin.  For more than two years now, I have over and over tried to push the point that the crypto movement is about more than just technology. It is also about politics.  The Binance episode shows us that the Bitcoin protocol is not only protected by technology, but also by political consensus.  We have ignored the social fabric that gives the crypto project its power. We have focused on magic tricks hoping to be saved by the next innovation. But no new technique can save crypto.  The problem cannot be reduced to technical ideas such as a decentralized market, p2p exchange or instant transactions. It is much deeper. We tried to engineer the perfect system. A rube goldberg machine, where human robots strive for fast financial gain. And in exchange, the project has been populated with mass men with a slave mentality that can only think on the level of moon memes. All the good people are moving on because we no longer offer the future.  And it has fostered a greedy penny-pinching mindset where people cannot think beyond their own quick self-interest or project brand name.  Our project is to open academies to train hackers able to work on projects which are critical to crypto’s survival but don’t have direct financial reward. These people have to be hacker philosophers, multi-disciplinary renaissance hackers. When I go to any crypto conference, there is a huge number of skilled idealistic young people looking for a place to direct their energy. We must make use of this raw material.  And many times over the last year I met with multi-millionaires about this project. They had no interest in putting $10k into something that while it doesn’t directly benefit them, it is the only hope to save crypto from certain death. But they were super interested to invest 100s of thousands into nonsense projects that will make profit in a few months. We are in a sinking ship, and everyone tries to climb on top of each other to get to the top.  Imagine for a second this gift that has been given to us. What a massive change could happen. Why do we think small?  “Bitcoin is based off technological consensus” they say. But who makes the technology? How you name your function, the processes that allow new code in, even the atmosphere of your discussion all shape how the technology evolves. It is never static. Bitcoin is more than rules. It is a movement, an ideology.  The longer we ignore this the worse it will get. Last year at Bitcoin’s peak of $20k, I called that the project was heading for failure. We have since then suffered the worst market crash in the history of crypto. Ideas shape how the technology evolves. People are waiting for the up. And there might be bumps. But unless the content is not there, there will be no growth.  What inspires people to create ideas? Not money. Destiny, vision, and purpose are the fuel of history. We are technologists. We have power to shape the world. We have been given the chance to overthrow the system of global finance. Why think small? Why waste this moment? Imagine big.  Our goal is to spread across the world, anonymous digital black markets. Markets outside state control. No control of the economy.  How?  First, we do not need the help of global capital or regulators. We must declare our total and complete opposition to the old order that we are going to replace.  Second, we must start to explore the realm of ideas, philosophy of technology, global geopolitics, history of computers, and put these together to paint a vision of where we’re going and the steps to get there.  Third, we must think beyond our own little place in the present to where we can get in the future. We must find that strength and will to overcome ourselves, and aspire towards a big goal. Grow strong. Nourish our beast. We are an energy. Inside us is a seed.  There is lots of work. We need the wikis, exchanges, markets, currency, financial instruments, political decision-making tools and much more – all of them dark and p2p.  The biggest letdowns were the financial crises that presented themselves. We were not prepared to make use of them. We could not move quickly to profit from them. Instead, they passed by (Greece, Iran, Venezuela) and became news memes.  But the good news is, that the contradictions of the system are growing. It cannot sustain itself. Already nationalist and religious extremist groups are agitating to grow the cracks and then move into the vacuums. This system of western-led finance-capital-state matrix cannot continue. It will collapse.  And if we have made the groundwork, when the time comes, we will be ready to summon our beast. We are the opposition.
