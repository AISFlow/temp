Former New Zealand Prime Minister Denies Investing in Bitcoin,"A former prime minister of New Zealand is crying ""fake news"" after false reports circulating on Facebook suggested he had invested in bitcoin.  According to the New Zealand Herald  , a fictitious news website – which itself bore the New Zealand Herald logo – purported that John Key, who served as prime minister from 2008 to 2016. The page, which was reportedly circulated on Facebook in the wake of its release, purported that Key was claiming a $300 million windfall from an initial investment of $1,000.  Key, who is currently the chairman of ANZ Bank New Zealand, is crying foul, stating that he never invested in or endorsed bitcoin.  The webpage in question, linked below, included a photo of Key as well as a quote attributed to him.  Key told the real Herald that he has asked Facebook to remove the post to prevent it from being shared further. So far, Facebook has not moved to remove the content.  He told the newspaper:  “This is outrageous. People are at risk here and you'd think Facebook would take their responsibilities seriously.”  The report in question is titled “Bitcoin is about to surge and make thousands of new millionaires: how you can turn $50 into a fortune!” and claims that investors in bitcoin can claim “legal tax-free cash” in the nation.  Key told the Herald he received messages thanking him for the advice and saying that people invested in the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization because of it.  The New Zealand Herald also disclosed that it, too, is moving to have the page removed, given that it represents a false version of its website.

The startup revealed today that, through an existing partnership with MicroVentures, it will begin offering services to projects seek to use the blockchain funding model. The first sale is for the Fan-Controlled Football League which, according to its website, is seeking to create a user-driven model for American football teams.  Specifically, in the case of FCFL, investors (both accredited and non-accredited) purchase Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (SAFTs), with the tokens set to be delivered at a later date. The mode has been used by a number of ICOs in recent months, and according to the page on MicroVentures, $915,000 has been raised from nine investors thus far in the new ICO.  [Update: The company has said that it aims to host both non-SAFT presales as well as actual token sales on the platform.]  The launch is a notable one given Indiegogo's size and influence in the crowdfunding platform ecosystem. Indiegogo first went live in early 2008, and the development comes more than a year after it moved to offer access to equity crowdfunding.  Through this lens, Indiegogo is positioning itself as a new hub for ICOs – specifically, those that are compliant with U.S. regulations around securities.  In statements  , the startup said that the move to embrace ICOs was a natural fit given its crowdfunding work to date, noting:  ""For us, this is simply another way of doing what we’ve been working on for the past decade. ... We’re ready to become the go-to platform for selling and investing in digital tokens and blockchain-based assets, and we can’t wait for you to join us.""  According to The New York Times, Indiegogo is working with law firm Cooley LLP on the initiative. Slava Rubin, one of the startup's founders, told the publication that ""we want to bring a brand of trust to the entire industry"" through the ICO initiative.

42428256,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6p7h,1513109735,Mt Gox Creditors Want Bitcoin Exchange Taken Out of Bankruptcy,"A group of creditors of the defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox has filed a new court petition in an effort to prevent a possible billion-dollar payout to its CEO.  As reported by the Financial Times, the creditors are seeking to move Gox out of bankruptcy and into a process of civil rehabilitation. If successful, the legal effort would shift the process of unwinding the company, which is primarily owned by CEO Mark Karpelès, and the 202,195 bitcoins held by the Gox trustee (worth approximately $3.4 billion at press time).  Mt Gox infamous collapsed in early 2014 following revelations that it had lost hundreds of millions of dollars (at then-current prices) worth of bitcoin. The exchange, once the world's largest by trading volume, ultimately declared bankruptcy and its CEO was subsequently accused of embezzlement and data manipulation.  Under current Japanese bankruptcy law, if Gox maintains its current status, it will pay its creditors the amount they had invested in U.S. dollars in 2014. However, due to the rise in bitcoin's price, this means Gox – and by extension, majority shareholder Karpelès – could receive a multi-billion dollar windfall, according to Fortune.  Creditors contend that Mt Gox's liabilities can be easily paid off with its existing bitcoins, even after returning what the creditors believe is owed to them due to its current price.  By the Financial Times' math, after returning creditors their bitcoin and paying off its liabilities, Gox would have more than 173,000 bitcoins remaining, which would be worth just under $3 billion.  The Japanese court overseeing Gox's bankruptcy is now looking into the claim but has not yet made a ruling one way or another.  ""The creditors bringing the case say the outcome is likely to come down to a ""battle of experts"": those working for the bankruptcy trustee, who argue the current liquidation plan is more stable, and those hired by the creditors, who say their solution is quicker and fairer,"" the newspaper added.

As CoinDesk reported in September, the bill – as advanced by the U.S. Senate at the time – called for the Department of Defense to investigate ""potential offensive and defensive cyber applications of blockchain technology and other distributed database technologies.""  The language itself is part of the wider Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT), which focuses on improving the government's IT and cybersecurity systems.  The blockchain study, according to the latest version of the text (which was ultimately signed earlier today by Trump), will constitute ""an assessment of efforts by foreign powers, extremist organizations, and criminal networks to utilize such technologies;...[and] an assessment of the use or planned use of such technologies by the Federal Government and critical infrastructure networks.""  The results of the study, according to the text, are due to be delivered to Congress sometime in the next 6 months. While it is set to be prepared by the Department of Defense – which has explored a number of applications in the past – the final product is likely to include input from other federal agencies and departments.  And though it constitutes a minor element in major funding law, the measure, proposed by Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, could help spur investigation into possible blockchain uses within the U.S. government, some observers say.  ""Blockchain was clearly one of the technological capabilities that Congress meant for agencies to look at, and what they were trying to do was create dollars with some flexibility to them so that agencies would have their own discretion on what they invest in,"" Trey Hodgkins, senior vice president of public sector at the Information Technology Industry Council in Washington, D.C., told CoinDesk last month.

As per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the cryptocurrency is trading at $17,539, having appreciated 4.48 percent in the last 24 hours to a new all-time high.  But while that's a modest, even impressive gain, it's worth noting that alternative currencies like litecoin and ether have strengthened by even more impressive rallies.  On the day's trading, the cryptocurrencies, the second and fourth by market volume, have seen 71.8 percent and 30 percent gains, respectively. Coinbase's GDAX exchange and South Korea's Bithumb have emerged as the primary drivers.  All told, though the stellar performance of litecoin and ether could be indicative of their availability and appeal to new buyers. Hence, a minor correction in bitcoin (BTC) cannot be ruled out as other assets garner attention.  1-hour chart  The above chart shows:  Bull flag breakout followed by a nice rising lows pattern as represented by the ascending trend line.

Giancarlo commended his SEC counterpart for encouraging market participants and investors to ""recognize risks and legal responsibilities they have regarding cryptocurrencies and [ICOs].""  He went on to say:  ""I have said consistently that virtual currencies are unlike any commodity that the CFTC has dealt with in the past, and I know they pose challenges for the SEC as well.""  Notably, Giancarlo added that the two agencies are in ""regular communication"" with each other regarding both digital currencies and ICOs, highlighting the degree of inter-agency cooperation within the U.S. government on issues around cryptocurrencies.  Giancarlo further noted that his agency cannot effectively regulate cryptocurrencies, saying ""the relatively nascent underlying cash markets and exchanges for bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets over which the CFTC has limited statutory authority.""  He concluded with a warning for investors, saying, they should ""be aware of the potentially high level of volatility and risk in these markets.""

42428272,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6pfh,1513089903,"Bitcoin Investing: A 10,000-Year View","Willy Woo is an avid cryptocurrency trader and blogger, whose work is published at Woobull.com and via Twitter at @woonomic.  This article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review opinion series.      A few weeks back, I spoke to 1,000 fund managers, bankers and private equity folks in New York at the inaugural Consensus: Invest conference organized by CoinDesk.  What to told them is that I don't come from Wall Street, and I'm not a formally trained analyst. My background comes from the world of emerging tech and startups, hence my view and analysis tend to be outside the box.  This is a brief overview of some of the work I presented there, including my view of where the crypto asset markets are at in Q4 2017.  If you're new to the market, there's a lot to learn. Understanding cryptocurrencies is akin to learning about an alien species. Even our markets do not correlate to any other traditional asset class. (I published this ""3 cats and a moon"" fractal pattern that reliably traded for three years, and it ceased to work after publication).  This leads to the first point: the bitcoin market is changing and actively changes frequently.  What we're seeing now appears to be a trend that began in Q4 2017 with the decision by U.S. regulators not to approve a bitcoin ETF. The publicity from the ETF buildup described bitcoin as a legitimate asset instead of the ""drug money"" rhetoric.  My theory is that Wall Street investor interest mounted during this phase and the money that was denied an opportunity to enter via a regulated ETF, came in anyway directly through the exchange markets around March.  We saw an uptick in price when it should have dropped lower according to existing models. Additionally, we saw bitcoin's long-term declining volatility trend break upwards as large volumes of money started trading the swings.  Bitcoin's price chart as of Q4 2017 started carving a new fractal pattern. Fractals reflect the market's psychological profile. By my reckoning, a new animal had arrived.  The price chart was now determined by a hybrid of traditional bitcoin traders and early Wall Street trader money.  Marching toward M2  But new traders are entering a market with a not insignificant history.  Attempts have already been made to attempt to value cryptocurrency networks, taking inspiration from other trading tools. NVT Ratio is another invention of mine. This works like bitcoin's PE Ratio, indicating when BTC price has outstripped fundamental value.  Like PE Ratio in equities, fast-growth companies exhibit higher ratios, similarly, bitcoin exhibited higher NVT Ratio values in its early high-growth phase.  But, you may be asking, growth to what? The answer is becoming a significant part of the global money supply. In 2017, all the crypto asset markets combined equal half a percent of the world's M2 money supply, and we are at approximately 1 percent of the world's population as users. This is an equivalent adoption level as 1996 for the internet.  Bitcoin users double every 12 months in our current phase of the adoption S-curve. This was calculated with my work tracking Google Trends data on the assumption that users search BTC/USD price.  If this trend continues, we are nine years away from half the world using bitcoin.  That might seem like a lot to take in, but it's supported by data.  Here’s another view of bitcoin's growth on a long-term chart where each altitude climb is a 10x increase. Though bitcoin's share of the 0.5% seems small, but we are actually 66% of the way on our journey to usurp M1 money.  Let me reiterate something that sounds radical – bitcoin is four years out from exceeding the world reserve currency’s M1 supply.  If volatility continues it's on its 9-year downward trend, we should also see bitcoin price stability near fiat FOREX levels. This means grandma can have a USD savings account earning 1 percent per year, or she can have a BTC savings account earning 1 percent per week at similar risk profiles.  Thinking in trillions  So let me zoom out a bit and talk about where we are in the 10,000-year view.  In 2013, they called bitcoin drug money. In 2017, they called it a bubble. It’s not in a bubble. We're on the path of digitizing the world. We are seeing the final phase of the Post-Industrial Revolution which started in the 1960s-1990s with the invention of the microprocessor through to the expansion of the internet.  Bitcoin is not just money. It’s the invention of an internet-native digital scarcity. And with that breakthrough, software will eat the financial world.  Blockchain assets will be bigger than the approximately $70 trillion in money, there’s another $80 trillion in equities, and I’m told well over $200 trillion in real estate. This will all be digitized.  ""Stealth,"" ""awareness,"" ""mania,"" and ""blow-off"" are the stages of the investment cycle.  With Bitcoin only the geek money invested in the stealth phase. Smart money was displaced to the ""awareness phase.""  Normally institutional money arrives during the awareness phase, but due to regulatory bars institutions were not allowed to enter. Hence we are now seeing institutional money arrive late competing with retail money in the early mania phase.  It's my belief this could create a super bull season right now in Q4 2017 and into 2018.  The new frontier  But bitcoin's maturity is also likely to push newer investors toward higher yields, and as expected, we have seen bitcoin itself losing its dominance over the last five years.  This is a sign of the markets starting to mature. A fully digital economy should not be 95 percent money. All industries will eventually fill this economy.  That last slide was the top 125 outliers, this chart shows essentially the entire market, with the darker colors moving to lighter represent the top 200, 400, 600, etc.  Newer coins are outperforming older coins in general. Also buying the entire market tends to be neutral in performance.  In this environment, selection and filtering is key. I suggest selecting just as a venture capitalist would. Vet the team, call them up, are they competent? Check their tech, read their source code, is the tech stack useful? How big can the market grow to? What are the token dynamics, is the token designed for high velocity or low?  Successful projects will follow what I call the ""Falcon 9 launch trajectory.""  The goal is to ride the early steep trajectory for two to three years, then roll the investment into new projects capable of climbing steeply. It's a venture capital model. Returns that bitcoin offered in 2011-2013 are still available today, but today there’s more work involved to find the gems.

42428258,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6pDh,1513087226,"Bitcoin Isn't Sapping Demand for Gold, Says Goldman Sachs Exec","A Goldman Sachs executive has said there is ""no evidence"" that bitcoin's price gains have reduced demand for gold.  Amid investor concerns over the issue, Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities research for the financial services giant, told the Financial Times this week that he believes investor pools for the two assets are different. Further, bitcoin's lack of regulation, he alleged, is an obstacle for traditional investors.  Still, bitcoin prices have shown astonishing gains over the past month, particularly in the wake of bitcoin futures trading launched by CBOE Global Markets last Sunday, movements that coincide with the fact gold is witnessing a slump in price.  Currie, however, asserted that gold and bitcoin have different characteristics and that the recent price action is due to the nature of demand for the assets.  He said:  ""In our view, bitcoin is attracting more speculative inflows relative to gold.""  Saying that gold ETF holdings are at their highest level for over four years, Currie stated there is ""no evidence of a mass exodus from gold.""  And although the lack of liquidity and high volatility may make bitcoin ""interesting,"" it will not likely be a draw for investors seeking the diversification and hedging benefits of gold, he remarked.  The statements follow those by Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein 10 days ago when he said he believes it's still too early for the bank to consider a bitcoin strategy as it ""doesn't feel like a store of value.""  In November, the company's CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, indicated that, while he's not ""comfortable"" with bitcoin, he is open to the cryptocurrency.

42428265,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6pRh,1513085425,Blockchain's Boom Year: Job Market Grows 200%,"The number of blockchain jobs posted in the U.S. this year has seen a dramatic increase, according to data provided to CoinDesk from one of the largest jobs sites.  The just-published statistics from Indeed.com indicate that, since last December, that number has increased by 207 percent. Even more dramatically, the number of blockchain jobs has increased 631 percent since November 2015.  Showing how hot cryptocurrency has become this year after being generally overshadowed by blockchain in 2016, 15 out of the 18 most popular industry jobs specifically mentioned ""cryptocurrency"" in the description.  Moreover, when seen as a percentage of the site's total number of job postings, the blockchain industry overall increased from only a few jobs per million to roughly 30 jobs per million, showing a slight increase relative to the overall available positions on the site.  While many industry observers likely didn't need the numbers to know the blockchain industry has grown massively over the course of the last year, the quantification is interesting, especially as it relates to the divergence in the number of jobs searched compared to the number of jobs posted.  At the beginning of this year, the number of jobs searched neared parity with number of jobs posted, at about 20 searches each per million, according to the chart below, also provided by Indeed. Then, over the course of this year, the frequency of blockchain jobs searched increased by five times to almost 100 blockchain jobs searches per million.  This combination of explosive blockchain jobs growth and the interest of jobs seekers has created a tumultuous environment, where the leading employers are duking it out over top-notch talent.  Vice president of product at Indeed.com, Terence Chiu told CoinDesk:    ""While the number of opportunities and searches are still quite small, Indeed data shows that companies are increasingly seeking experts to focus on this new technology – and job seekers have been quick to react.""      Not just technicians    While nearly all the jobs on Indeed.com were technical in nature, not all employers are after developers or engineers.    This year also marked the birth of the Crypto Jobs List website, dedicated exclusively to crypto industry jobs. Launching in September with the promise to not scrape job postings from other sites, and instead only to publish original opportunities, the site has discovered a niche in the non-technical side of the industry.    With an average of two job postings per day, the site has listed 90 blockchain jobs so far, with about 20 more currently being ""curated"" for possible inclusion. Among those that have been posted are positions for writers, traders, marketers and lawyers.    The site's founder and director of growth, Raman Shalupau, described the diverse demand, saying:     As an example of this diversity, one of the largest industry employers, Deloitte, currently employs about 800 people across its various blockchain efforts, but only 400 of those are either blockchain developers or architects, according to numbers provided to CoinDesk.    The other half of those jobs include positions such as business analysts, strategy and technology consultants, and tax and accounting experts. An estimated 75 percent of all blockchain jobs result from cross-training existing employees – an increasingly popular trend, according to Eric Piscini, a Deloitte principal who oversees much of the firm's blockchain work.    ""Every morning when I wake up the first thing I think about is, where can I find more people to join the team?"" he said. In addition to cross-training employees, Deloitte hires many of its staff from educational institutions and is one of the largest posters of jobs in the provided Indeed.com data.    The top employers    But it's not just the types of opportunities that differ greatly from job site to job site. It's also the types of employers.    On Crypto Jobs List, the top three biggest blockchain employers are interoperable smart contracts startup Wanchain, ethereum client software startup Parity Technologies and asset management startup Cindicator.    On the flip side, Indeed.com appears more attractive to legacy firms, with industry mainstays like Deloitte and JPMorgan, as well as interesting newbies including eBay, ESPN and Uber using the premium Indeed Prime service to actively seek out candidates.    CoinDesk also reached out to several other large blockchain companies to get an idea of how employment numbers have changed.    Distributed ledger consortium R3, which earlier this year raised $107 million in venture capital, has grown its staff from 30 in early 2016, to 90 at the beginning of 2017, and as high as 150 today, according to the consortium's head of global talent, Simon Clarke.    Clarke said R3 has had to become more competitive with its compensation packages, while focusing on creating a culture that encourages employees to stick around.    ""It's no secret that blockchain expertise is in huge demand right now,"" said Clarke. ""Firms are fighting to hire the best talent, and candidates are able to be incredibly picky about the role they ultimately choose.""    Computing giant IBM said that other large enterprises aren't the biggest threat in attracting talent. According to the firm's vice president of people and culture, Mike Schade, it's rather the blockchain startups that are most attractive to job seekers.    Since the beginning of the year, IBM has grown the number of blockchain-focused employees it has from 400 to 1,500, primarily by giving those employees access to its biggest clients (whereas startups generally offer equity in the company).    Yet, if that doesn't work, Schade said the tech giant works to keep friendly relations with even former blockchain employees, in case the startup life doesn't work out.    ""We keep in touch with them closely,"" he told CoinDesk.    A new kind of employee    Beyond just changing the relationship these companies keep with former employees, blockchain technology is also changing the nature of employment itself, according to Andrew Keys, an early employee of ethereum startup incubator ConsenSys.    Formerly the head of global business development for the firm, Keys is himself as an example of the evolving arrangements that are helping change what it means to be an employee.    Keys is now the co-founder of ConsenSys Capital, which is just one of more than 25 so-called ""spokes"" of ConsenSys as a larger company. Each spoke has its own founder, who interacts with the corporate hub in his or her own way.    But along with their job titles, Keys and other employees identify as ""members"" of ConsenSys, an allusion to their varying vested interests in the company's success.    The company, which grew from about 100 employees in January to about 470 today, offers a spectrum of compensation arrangements, including varying degrees of equity, salary, token distribution arrangements and other affiliations.    ""We're blurring the lines of what employer-employee relationships are,"" Keys told CoinDesk.        Threat to jobs?        In the end, though, the total number of blockchain jobs in the economy will likely be more difficult to calculate than any other profession, as will their impact on other jobs.    While jobs numbers are always an estimate, blockchain roles in particular will likely always be tough to quantify due to the pseudonymous or anonymous nature of many in the industry.    That's not the only reason why the impact of blockchain on the jobs market could prove difficult to calculate, though.    The often touted ""increased efficiency"" achieved by a shared, distributed ledger has increasingly become a widely used euphemism for cutting jobs.    Earlier this year, Digital Asset Holdings founder Blythe Masters warned that there was no guarantee blockchain would be a net win for the jobs industry.    Echoing that sentiment is Mizuho Bank senior digital strategist working with blockchain, Ikuma Ueno. Following an address Ueno gave at banking conference Sibos earlier this year, he argued in interview with CoinDesk that employers might eventually have a responsibility to retrain the employees that blockchain makes irrelevant – if they can.    ""It's always hard to tear off the people who have been dedicated to that service for 25 or 30 years, and then tell them to do sales. It's not going to work,"" he said, concluding:     Now hiring sign image via Shutterstock  ""Even though demand for Solidity smart contracts engineers and core engineers is through the roof, there are plenty positions that are accessible for non-technical people.""      ""But that must be taken into consideration when you are trying to do new approaches.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael del Castillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/12/12/blockchains-boom-year-job-market-grows-200,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9374e9217b5fad5d3bc7f0126ede66ddafd8c408-2560x1563.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Fuelled by trading on Coinbase's GDAX exchange, one of the most trafficked onramps for new buyers, the world's fourth-largest cryptocurrency by value is trading at an all-time high near $300, up from under $5 at the start of 2017.  With the move, the asset's year-to-date gains stand at more than 5,500 percent, three times more than bitcoin's 1,800 percent rally. Litecoin prices have also jumped close to 200 percent from the Dec. 8 low of $95.40.  The meteoric rise could be associated with the broad-based rally in the cryptocurrency space, though litecoin's accessibility to more user-friendly buying tools, and the general fear of missing out (FOMO) ongoing in developed markets, are perhaps the biggest drivers.  LTC has appreciated 75 percent in the last 24 hours. The rally is also backed by strong volumes.

The stochastic also shows overbought conditions.  The 10-day MA is curled up in favor of the bulls.  View  Litecoin looks set to extend the gains. The next big resistance is seen at $407.70 (261.8 percent Fibonacci extension).  A technical pullback could gather pace if prices move below $285 (current 4-hour candle low). Such a move would open doors for a quick drop to $239.60 (red doji candle low).  Only a close (as per UTC) below $239.60 would signal the rally has topped out and could yield short-term consolidation.

Backing the San Francisco-based startup in the raise are investors including Kholsa Ventures' Keith Rabois, General Catalyst's Hemant Taneja and Blockchain Capital, as well as Naval Ravikant, Suna Said, Adam Ludwin, Adam Nash and Elad Gil, among others.  The funding comes as the firm officially unveils its HOLD 10 Private Index Fund, which is pitched as a way for accredited investorshttps://www.sec.gov/files/ib_accreditedinvestors.pdf in the U.S. to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without actually having to buy the digital assets.  First announced in October, HOLD 10 will focus specifically on the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, allowing members to simultaneously invest in bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash and other major cryptocurrencies within the wider $466 billion market.  Bitwise intends for HOLD 10 to be a passive fund for its users, allowing them to simply invest in the fund and let it handle the rest. The fund will account for hard forks and ""airdrops"" of free tokens, and will follow trading volume to establish the most promising tokens in which to invest.  Bitwise co-founder Hunter Horsley explained:  “For example, in November, bitcoin was up 58 percent and other top 10 coins like bitcoin cash, dash, and monero were up over 100 percent. As a result, the HOLD 10 Index was up approximately 64 percent while having around 37 percent less volatility than bitcoin.”  Bitwise put its index through testing from the start of 2017 and found that, had it been launched at the start of January, HOLD 10 would currently be up 1,750 percent, Horsley said.  HOLD 10 was launched in a bid to make it easier for people to invest in cryptocurrencies – especially those who may not have the means to manage their own portfolio of digital assets.  ""We constantly hear people say that they'd like to invest but it's too complicated and risky to actively manage a portfolio yourself,"" Horsley told CoinDesk in an email.

After New High, Bitcoin Price Eyes $20k","Bitcoin bulls look set to push prices as high as $20,000 over the next few days, according to the price chart analysis.  As expected, solid dip demand around $14,000 levels seen over the weekend fueled the move to fresh record highs above $17,000 yesterday.  As of writing, the CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is at $16,743 levels. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has appreciated 0.72 percent in the last 24 hours, going by CoinMarketCap data.  While investors commenting on social media reveal fears of a minor pullback, the price chart analysis says the broader outlook is likely to remain constructive.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart shows:  Bullish doji reversal: Sunday's doji candle and bullish follow-through on Monday points to a continuation of the rally. Further, it validates the strong rebound from the 10-day moving average (MA) and the solid dip demand around $14,000.  The ascending 10-day MA favors further upside in prices, and suggests that any pullbacks are likely to be short-lived.  The relative strength index (RSI) shows overbought conditions, while the stochastic seems to have found a bottom and is pointing upwards again.

42428260,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6pJh,1513069236,2018: Another Growth Year for Blockchain,"Oliver Bussmann is founder and managing partner at Bussmann Advisory, the president of not-for-profit Crypto Valley Association and former group CIO and managing director at UBS.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      2017 was a year of tremendous growth for blockchain, though not in the expected ways.  At the beginning of this year, I and others predicted that 2017 would be the year that blockchain moved from proof-of-concepts into production. We did see some notable successes in this regard.  Ripple became a fully operational platform with over 100 members and payment volumes in the billions, and industries began to form blockchain business networks, for example, the Digital Trade Chain consortium (DTC) in trade finance.  But overall, I expected to see more ""go lives"" than we did. On the other hand, I don't think anyone expected the unprecedented growth in the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies or the related ICO boom.  So, what will the new year bring? Despite the obvious perils in making predictions, I feel confident that, among other things, we will see the following:  Blockchain solutions will continue to come into production as the ""low-hanging fruit"" are addressed.  Cryptocurrencies will continue to grow, fueled by traditional asset management players and techniques.  Companies will focus on changing business models as blockchain begins to transform market structures.  New ecosystems with smart contract technology will arise as integration platforms between existing industries.  The ICO will become ""professionalized"" and morph into IPO 2.0.  Scalability and performance of blockchains will become a critical issue, and there will be interesting new approaches  People will increasingly recognize that local blockchain ecosystems are a critical success factor.  Now, let's unpack the details.  Low-hanging fruit  Although it was quieter than expected this year, I believe we will continue to see blockchain solutions come into production as enterprises address the ""low-hanging fruit"" by digitizing businesses and use cases where blockchain can make the most impact.  In fintech, the two most promising use cases remain payments (where there are $50–60 billion of potential savings to be had) and trade finance (which stands to save some $15 billion).  As we saw payments do in 2017, I expect we will see trade finance begin to go live on blockchain in 2018. In payments, momentum will pick up and volumes will increase as larger banks, including correspondent banks, get into the act. These players will be tempted by the advantages blockchain brings in terms of real-time processing, lower risk profiles, lower costs and transparency.  Blockchain can serve as a stick as well as a carrot, simply by proving that there are better alternatives to the status quo in many industries. We can imagine, as an example, that blockchain has had a hand to play in the European Banking Authority's EU-wide transparency exercises.  We were all somewhat surprised – if pleasantly so – by how well cryptocurrencies did in 2017 as a speculative asset. Indeed, growth was spectacular, with the asset class rising from $14 billion in December 2016 to over $450 billion in December 2017 in terms of market capitalization.  I think this growth will continue to be fueled by traditional asset management approaches, including bitcoin futures, crypto hedge funds and the like, all of which will increase the demand for cryptocurrencies and tokens.  New business models  As blockchain continues to change market structures, companies will increasingly focus on changing business models.  In a world where middlemen are becoming obsolete, companies will have to learn to stop thinking in silos and be more open to becoming partners in ecosystems or on broader platforms. That, in turn, means deciding what kinds of business models they want – whether it's platform plays, product plays, omni-channel strategies, and so on.  These discussions will become multi-dimensional, encompassing both existing services and, increasingly, the new kinds of services that blockchain enables – particularly as blockchain combines with IoT and AI to create new kinds of marketplaces where industry silos come down in favor of broad, horizontal structures.  One of the most satisfying parts of 2017 for me was being able to see this start to happen close-hand among some of the companies I have the privilege to work with. (See disclosures below.)  Deon Digital has partnered with Mercedes Benz to develop a new operating system that will help break down silos in the mobility space. Skycell is a good example of IoT and blockchain opening up the pharmaceutical supply chain to embrace payments, invoicing and insurance. TEND is rethinking investment management by creating a Sharing Economy 2.0 for high-value assets.  One space I think we should keep a particular eye on in 2018 is the fund industry, where firms like Melonport are using blockchain to rethink asset management. I think we will see more of this, and that the fund industry will start to be significantly disrupted next year.  This will start with the management of crypto assets, but over time we will see traditional assets increasingly being tokenized, migrated onto blockchains and managed on-chain.  The morphing of ICOs  With startups raising over $3.5 billion in ICOs, 2017 was clearly the year of the token launch.  To me, though, the ICO boom is significant, not necessarily because of the amounts raised, but because we are seeing the beginnings of the democratization of venture capital. And though the concept had a great 2017, change will come to the world of ICOs in 2018 as more traditional players get involved.  Over the next 12-18 months, I expect people with experience and expertise in the IPO world will embrace tokenization as a technical platform, and the whole business will be professionalized, with book building, pricing, startup evaluation and so on happening more along traditional lines.  As we've already begun to see, it will be harder to get funding simply on the back of a white paper. Investors will demand sound business plans and high levels of transparency, with all that entails.  Scalability and ecosystems  One of the key challenges of existing blockchain technology is scale and performance. I predict that next year we will see alternatives to current blockchain technologies that will be more scalable, faster and minimize energy consumption.  IOTA, which has gained a lot of traction lately, is, I think, a project to watch in this regard.  I also believe people will increasingly find that local blockchain ecosystems, where critical services are co-located in one geographical area, are critical success factors for blockchain projects.  This is certainly what we see in the ""Crypto Valley"" in Switzerland. As the President of the Crypto Valley Association, I hope readers will forgive me for predicting – or at the least, pitching for – the continued success of Switzerland as a blockchain ecosystem.  Crypto Valley has a high concentration of all the services blockchain projects will need to raise money and set up shop, including legal, advisory, tax, accounting, smart contract platforms, KYC/AML utilities and marketing expertise.  This coupled with Switzerland’s other advantages, from its state-of-the-art infrastructure to its highly skilled workforce, will, in my opinion, mean it should remain a great draw for blockchain companies – in the new year and hopefully for many years to come.

42380100,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M6zX,1513058439,Hong Kong Regulator Issues Warning on Bitcoin Futures,"A Hong Kong finance regulator has published a new circular on bitcoin futures and other cryptocurrency-related investment products.  Released by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong on Dec. 11, the circular states that only licensed firms are allowed to offer such products within Hong Kong, specifying that it is a ""type 2 regulated activity"" under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.  It was notably released on the first full day of trading of the futures contract launched by Chicago-based CBOE, which officially went live late Sunday. It also comes ahead of a release by CME Group, which is kicking off its own futures contract next week.  ""Bitcoin Futures have been or will soon be launched by certain well-established futures and commodities exchanges in the United States which are regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) to provide automated trading services,"" the regulator wrote, adding:  ""Hong Kong investors may be able to trade in bitcoin futures through an intermediary which is a member of these exchanges....The industry is reminded that a party is required to have an appropriate licence with the SFC if it provides any other business services relating to bitcoin futures.""  The SFC also stressed that other forms of cryptocurrency-related investment products are available to investors in the country including cryptocurrency options. Failure to obtain a license to offer such services ""may be committing a criminal offence under the SFO,"" according to the circular.  SFC warned investors to check whether bitcoin futures products from unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges constitute ""futures contracts"" or ""securities"" under the SFO. It also reminded investors about the potential risks in trading cryptocurrencies including insufficient liquidity and price volatility.

42380115,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M7H9,1513051219,2017: The 'Butt' of Bitcoin's Joke,"David Gerard is the author of the book ""Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain"" (Amazon US, Amazon UK), editor of the news blog of the same name and a contributor to crypto parody forum r/buttcoin.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      The bitcoin world is relentlessly optimistic, in the face of all news, positive or ... differently positive.  It's no surprise then that in 2017 anything called a blockchain was quickly used as evidence of the impending world domination of bitcoin. ""Could"" becomes ""will"" becomes ""is"" ... even though ""could"" is a word that often means ""doesn't"" and tends to end up meaning ""won't.""  This is how we get to a state of affairs where the only Reddit subforum where you have any chance of talking sensibly about cryptos ends up being the one with ""butt"" in the name.  New to crypto? Don't worry, you too can learn the tools to deflect relentless advocates and company interests. Just ask yourself, ""Wait, what's the evidence this is even a thing?""  The results may surprise you...  Business Blockchain™  The first thing to know is it's not just bitcoiners who were being creative and aspirational.  Blockchain was great again in 2017, or Blockchain™ at least, where consultants did their best to convince people that a transaction ledger in a Merkle tree was a fantastic new innovation in business data processing, and not a structure we'd had since 1979 or software (Git) we'd had since 2005.  (Git users: ""Why yes, we've been using, uh, blockchain-related technologies since 2005, and ..."")  But, Blockchain™ did offer one key innovation. The trouble with ""the cloud"" or ""NoSQL"" is that these are specific technologies with measurable effects. Blockchain™ doesn't suffer this limitation!  A Blockchain™ doesn't even have to be a blockchain (e.g. Estonia's much-touted KSI Blockchain™) and you can even claim a Blockchain™ when you're running it as a database cluster with you as the only user (e.g. the World Food Programme's Building Blocks).  You see, we learned that distributed trustless immutable ledgers are vastly more efficient and easier to implement if you don't distribute them very far and aren't too strict on the trustless bit. Immutability turns out not to have a huge market in practice either!  In Distributed Ledger Technology™ will be a new and disruptive paradigm in which transactions are recorded on a single node at the hub of the network, with controlled access to this node to ensure security and privacy.  Distributed Ledger Technology™ is powered by smart contracts, which came along for the hype ride, even if adding immutable scripts so you couldn't fix bugs in your simplified version of Git is obviously stupid.  Paper gains  How about the markets though? Those have to be good. The price is through the roof!  Oh dear, dear. This isn't normal securities trading! Think you can assume your crypto exchange is basically competent and its systems well maintained? Think again. ""I know PHP – how hard could running an exchange be?"" isn't the best starting point.  You also can't assume a crypto exchange isn't going to mess you around. All manner of shenanigans that are completely illegal in proper security trading – bots painting the tape, wash trades, spoof orders, just front-running your customers – are completely normal in crypto. Your threat model is not just the other traders, it's literally the platform you are putting your money and coins into.  That is if you're even lucky enough to use real money... That's right, some of the world's largest exchanges don't anymore offer that luxury.  Take Tether, an increasingly famous as the Eurodollar-like USD substitute token for crypto exchanges. There are just under a billion of those, and they're being put to good and productive economic use for margin lending to bitcoin buyers. You can rest assured that every one of those Tethers is backed by an actual dollar. Definitely™.  What's that? You got in early? I'm genuinely happy for you.  Ignore bitter naysayers like me pointing out that your paper gains don't exist until you've not only cashed out but finally succeeded in getting your actual money from the exchange, through the delays and withdrawal limits.  Hopefully, you'll still have a bank account by the end of it.  Just be sure that you've actually made money, though, and remember two-thirds of holders haven't locked in a penny of tangible profit. This means I have personally realized more actual money from bitcoin than a supermajority of bagholders, without touching one.  The most difficult part of crypto trading is maintaining clear, evidence-based thinking when that would imply your paper balance is worth a fraction of what you've told yourself for months or years.  But, nevermind, your exchange will be just fine. It's backed by venture capitalists you can Google!  Good luck, sir. I just hope it doesn't go consistently down for maintenance whenever the price is crashing! Oh wait... How does this keep happening? Never mind, I'm sure it will be fine.  What's for dinner  But David, it's not about what's here today. It's about the principles, the ideology!  In crypto, you can't just issue money like a government! Because if a government issues money carelessly, competent people tell them to slow down, because in the real world this is a widely-understood problem.  Crypto has no such barriers to issuance, as we discovered with the first altcoin. More recently, there was the arrival of bitcoin cash, which boldly eschewed professional graphic designers who could make an official logo that was robustly reusable (they tend to want payment in legacy fiat). So, if you reuse it on a white background, it appears to say ""B Cash.""  Just like that, 21 million more bitcoin cash(es). But don't worry, we're sure that everyone will resist the urge to create free money, especially businesses.  We have Silicon Valley, after all, to vet the latest and greatest. There's no way they'll get disrupted?!  ME: Why am I doing this book rubbish, I could just set up an ICO and...  WIFE: No.  ME: But it could be...  WIFE: No.  Times are changing  Oh, you're just focusing on the negative, you might say.  What about all the positive change! The money dedicated to science! The discussion of World-Changing™ concepts! (Cut to pictures of Zimbabwe...)  You're right, there were smashing successes... The National Health Service in the U.K. took its first foray into the healthcare blockchain in May, when the WannaCry ransomware shut down emergency rooms across the country and introduced the British public to bitcoin.  Bitcoin also had huge success killing off the last scraps of its legitimate merchant interest. Fortunately, sidechains and the Lightning Network will definitely solve bitcoin's scaling problems in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018.  Then my personal favorite, the New Inquiry's Bail Bloc initiative actually asked people to mine monero for a bail bond charity, eventually posting an FAQ where they directly suggested you mooch electricity from your employer or school to mine.  The logic here was truly innovative: Potentially commit a crime to ... pay bail for people accused of committing crimes. The upside? If the way the industry is going is any indication... it may have a burgeoning market!  But always remember: all of the above is actually good news for bitcoin, the one true, digital, comedy gold.

42380099,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8M6yH,1513040710,'According to Plan': CBOE Bullish on First Day of Bitcoin Futures Trading,"The first day of bitcoin futures trading on the CBOE exchange is over and the day largely went according to plan, according to its CEO.  Overall, Monday saw the price of bitcoin push above $17,000 on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) to hit a new all-time high in the hours after the Chicago-based firm began trading the derivatives. That process began late Sunday, an event that coincided with a near-simultaneous crashing of CBOE's website.  The price of bitcoin jumped over $1,000 in minutes.  Reports indicate, however, that trading has gone relatively smoothly since then. As Bloomberg shows, CBOE's circuit breakers – essentially market backstops that pause trading during periods of heightened volatility – were triggered twice during the first six hours of trading yesterday.  No circuit breakers were activated during Monday trading, according to CBOE.  ""The trading has been orderly. We hit a couple of our circuit-breaker halts, but those were due to price movement in futures and not due to any systems issues. We halted like our rules said we would and opened back up,"" Michael Mollet, director of product development for CBOE, told the Washington Post.  Market data indicates that CBOE's January contract is trading at about $18,000, according to CNBC, with 197 contracts worth of volume since the Dec. 12 session officially began.  For CBOE, the results are very encouraging, according to its chairman and CEO.  Speaking with Fox Business' Neil Cavuto at the conclusion of the Dec. 11 trading session, Ed Tilly said yesterday's kick-off went ""according to plan.""  He said in the interview:  ""I think it’s pretty positive. Think about never having traded this contract in a lit futures market before. There was that kind of confidence in CBOE's systems to bring this contract up.""  Looking ahead  Yet, if today's trading is indicative of how the nascent market for cryptocurrency derivatives progresses, the next week should be a notable one as well.  Indeed, CBOE's launch is the first of two planned regulated futures launches happening this month. CME Group is expected to launch contracts on Dec. 18.  Wall Street investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, as indicated earlier this month by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (which oversees the U.S. market for derivatives), is preparing to create binary options tied to bitcoin.  And while it has slipped somewhat from the high it hit earlier today, the price of bitcoin has remained above $16,000, trading at roughly $16,680 at time of publication, according to data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.
