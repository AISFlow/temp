Anna von Reitz, who frequently writes about social justice and the US, argues that the problems in the country are the result of a century of rule ""by the criminals who have hijacked our government, wealth, and heritage"".  In her essays, von Reitz singles out the Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund and other organizations as emblematic of these issues. Late last year she went as far as calling for the arrest of President Barack Obama and the US Congress, gaining Internet infamy in the process.  However, in a 22nd January letter addressed to Pope Francis, von Reitz wrote that a distributed financial network could help solve those problems. While she she doesn’t name bitcoin directly, she arguably alludes to the digital currency by way of ""a common worldwide currency"".  Von Reitz explained:  ""Instead of taking one or two or three commodities and using them as standards of value – which always leads to scarcity and hoarding and manipulation of those commodities – why not flip this paradigm on its head, and use all the value of all labor and all natural resources to back a common worldwide currency delivered by blockchain technology, available to everyone, everywhere?""  A decentralized currency, she argued, would make it easier to deliver this kind of service because it removes the influence of greedy third parties.  ""Whatever service delivery problems there have been or which still are, can be overcome now via a truthful and honest worldwide currency and credit system using blockchain technology,"" she wrote, adding:  ""Please admit the Truth and end this blasphemy, this false claim of scarcity, once and for all. Admit that there are only two things of value on the Earth so far as trade among men is concerned----labor and natural resources.""  Later in the piece, von Reitz walks through how this theoretical system might operate, with allocations of resources based on national population. Yet each member of those societies would be connected via blockchain and receive their income through it.  She wrote:  ”There is no reason that every man, woman, and child on this planet could not be given a basic living stipend and an investment account. This could be delivered using two separate pre-paid credit accounts with transactions via blockchain.  She expanded on the idea in another letter, on the subject of China.  ""We can trade credit digits on ledgers and use blockchain transactions to track them – and allow each of us value based on our overall ability to work and contribute, plus our share of the world's natural resources,” she wrote.  ""No more fraudulent debt currencies. No more stealing from the future. No more phony controls and commodity manipulations.""  Reitz did not respond to inquiries regarding the letters, including whether they had actually been sent to Vatican City in Rome, the global seat of the Roman Catholic Church.  Von Reitz concludes her 22nd January letter with a call to action for Pope Francis and the Roman Catholic Church to reject the existing financial system and ""join with the people in putting an end to corporate greed and lack of accountability"".  ""The corporations have caused these problems. The corporations – not the people – need to pay for correcting them and cleaning them up,"" she wrote.

42398864,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh75x,1454698082,Putin Advisor: Accepting Bitcoin Payments in Russia is a Crime,"An advisor to Russian president Vladimir Putin has reportedly spoken out about bitcoin, going as far to suggest that taking payments in the digital currency is a criminal act.  Recently appointed Internet advisor German Klimenko told Russian-language online news service Lenta.ru that the acceptance of bitcoin payments constitutes a crime.  According to a translation by Russian bitcoin news site ForkLog, Klimenko told Lenta.ru:  ""Bitcoin is not the first one, there are other settlement means. Accepting bitcoin as a payment for anything is unacceptable because it is a crime.""  Klimenko went on to suggest that other countries will move to ban digital currencies should broader adoption take place.  ""Because no state in the world, while watching it in homeopathic doses with pleasure, but when it becomes critical, everyone will certainly ban it,"" he told the publication.  The comments come as Russia is moving ahead with plans to prohibit the use of so-called money surrogates, a class of non-government issued monies that include bitcoin. However, questions remain as to what form the ban would take if instituted, and further, how it would actually be enforced.  Klimenko has notably spoken out about regulating the Internet in the past.  As reported by Russian-language online news source Meduza, based in Latvia, the presidential advisor believes that the Internet needs more regulation because ""the Internet is flooded with money, and criminals and terrorists"".  ""Of course, all this needs to be regulated,"" he said.

42398856,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh703,1454686214,UN Commission Calls On Caribbean to Become Digital Currency Hub,"The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) has published a report examining digital currencies and how they can be used to address regional payments issues.  Written with the aim of providing local policymakers with a balanced appraisal of the benefits and risks of digital currencies such as bitcoin, the report examines the use of the technology in the Caribbean and discusses the broader context of its emerging use at the global level.  Notably, the paper recommends further exploration into the technology with the ultimate aim of turning the region into a FinTech and digital currency hotspot.  The author writes:  ""Given the deficiencies in the sub-regional payments infrastructure, and the broader need to increase participation in the digital economy, it is incumbent upon Caribbean authorities to ... examine the opportunities for innovation that digital currencies offer.""  The commission further considers how digital currencies could address regional deficiencies in the electronic payment infrastructure, and provides an overview of mobile money solutions and their relationship to digital currency.  The study was based on three main sources of data: a literature review of international and regional resources, input from experts in electronic payments and a formal survey of Caribbean central banks.  Inclusive approach  Overall, the author recommends an ""inclusive approach"" to the exploration of digital currency that provides sufficient opportunity for public input and policy review, similar to the process adopted by the UK.  He further suggests an alignment of policy across the different countries of the region, in order to reduce the costs of compliance and create a competitive marketplace in the region for the digital currency sector.  Officially recognised digital currency initiatives could also be beneficial, the paper says.  Predicting the future increased use of cryptocurrencies in mobile payments, it adds that policy makers, entrepreneurs and academics could look at developing specialised services and products for export, turning the region into a FinTech hub.

42398854,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh6y5,1454667117,Private Retreat to Unite Bitcoin Execs for Scaling Debate,"The invitation-only Satoshi Roundtable conference is set to convene for the second year in a row, this time at an undisclosed location in North America.  To be held from 26th to 28th February, the event follows the inaugural edition of Satoshi Roundtable, which garnered criticism at the time of announcement for an alleged lack of transparency and air of secrecy. Though it eventually opened its doors to limited media presence, this year's event, by contrast, will be closed to the public.  Among the 60 attendees will be representatives from the mining and development sectors of the bitcoin industry, including MegaBigPower CEO Dave Carlson, KnC Miner CEO Sam Cole and developers representing both of the major scaling initiatives, Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic.  In interview, organizer and Bitcoin Foundation executive director Bruce Fenton indicated that the event is to include ""TED Talk""-like presentations, longer keynotes and speeches by individuals outside the bitcoin and blockchain community.  Notably, given the participants, Fenton said that the long-standing question of how the bitcoin network should be scaled to increase transaction capacity would also be discussed by event participants.  Fenton said:  ""The event was planned long before the most recent developments in [the] bitcoin discussion, but given the timing and attendees, block size will be an important agenda item.""  The attendee list also includes bitcoin startup CEOs such as BTCC's Bobby Lee and Align Commerce's Marwan Forzley, as well as representatives from Bain Capital Ventures and Fidelity Labs.

42426645,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuonh,1454639775,Simplex Raises $7 Million for Credit Card Bitcoin Buying Service,"An Israeli bitcoin startup focused on enabling bitcoin purchases with credit cards has closed a $7m Series A funding round.  Backing Simplex are bitcoin mining firms Bitmain and Cumberland Mining, and FundersClub, a crowdfunding platform that previously invested in Coinbase. A group of angel investors, which Simplex declined to name, also contributed to the funding.  The amount adds to a previously raised $1.4m, bringing the firm’s total fundraising to $8.4m.  Simplex CEO Nimrod Lehavi said that the company acts as a payment processing layer for bitcoin purchases via credit card, with a focus on fraud reduction that reducing the consequences of chargebacks for businesses, such as exchanges or brokerages, that offer the service.  Lehavi told CoinDesk:  ""We launched the beta product about a year ago. We kept it kind of low key up until we were able to offer the service better. We came to the world to solve a very big and annoying problem: It's such a drag to buy bitcoin.""  In interview, Lehavi repeatedly invoked the firm’s commitment to fraud mitigation, pointing to the experience of CTO Erez Shapira and CRO Netanel Kabala, both of whom previously worked for PayPal in similar capacities.  Lehavi said that Simplex's customers benefit from offering a way to sell bitcoin more quickly than with wire transfer, and in the event of fraud or a chargeback, Simplex absorbs the cost.  ""Even if there's a chargeback, we're still paying them the money,"" he said.  According to Lehavi, the firm began beta testing its service about a year ago, and its website cites customers including cloud mining provider Genesis Mining and bitcoin exchanges Spectrocoin and Bits of Gold.  Lehavi says that since then, the service has processed more than $3m in bitcoin purchases via credit card, concluding:  ""We went live about a year ago with a few selected design partners, and we’ve managed to process, so far, about $4m in purchases and [be] able to fight fraud and fight it pretty well.""
