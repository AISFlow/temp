But given the unique characteristics of crypto, there's a need for “creating clear regulatory guardrails.”  Brainard is leading the central bank’s exploration of a digital U.S. dollar, and her role as the No. 2 person at the Fed makes her opinions on crypto quite significant. Brainard’s latest remarks echoed her previous statements that the sector needs to meet the same safety standard as traditional finance in order to prevent it from becoming a threat to the broader financial system.  The Fed vice chair also reiterated the risk of stablecoins in her speech. She predicted there will be a lot more of such tokens created by the private sector in the future, calling into question if the central bank should issue its own central bank digital currency (CBDC.)  “Stablecoins is one of those areas that I think has the most potential for risk if not properly regulated and of course those risks can easily spill into the main core financial system because of the runnable nature of stablecoins,” she said.  Back in May, some $60 billion in value evaporated almost overnight after the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST). Meanwhile, some worry that asset-backed stablecoins such as USDT or USDC may not be able to sustain significant amounts of withdrawals.  In November 2021, a committee known as the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets – whose members include Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen – issued recommendations on stablecoins. Brainard characterized its report as “very strong” and she said that she agrees with its recommendations that stablecoins should be subject to bank-like regulation, and that “credential guardrails and the liquidity backstop are the best way to situate stablecoins.”",NEUTRAL,USDC,FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/07/fed-vice-chair-brainard-calls-for-crypto-specific-regulations-notes-stablecoin-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ecc4fceff8fea8450a2b38cc16b4e3297e07dc6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now the structure of that fund has come into further focus with a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.  Brevan Howard, which had $25 billion in total assets under management as of July, submitted a filing for the Digital Asset Multi-Strategy Fund Ltd hedge fund, which has raised $184.15 million since sales opened on April 1. The capital came from four investors, and there’s a $10 million minimum set for any outside investments. The firm indicated “Indefinite” for total offering amount, essentially the fund’s target size.  The firm also updated its filing for the similarly named Brevan Howard Digital Asset Multi-Strategy Fund, L.P. to show $29.71 million raised from six investors. The firm first filed for the limited partner fund in January with $3 million raised at the time.  A person familiar with the Brevan Howard funds confirmed to CoinDesk that the filings represent the first two of several sub-entities of the broader crypto hedge fund that were created to satisfy different tax jurisdictions. The sub-entities’ assets under management will add up to the more than $1 billion raised overall, a figure that was first reported by Blockworks. The open-ended nature of the funds, however, mean that the sub-entities can keep raising money indefinitely.  A Brevan Howard spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by CoinDesk.  The BH Digital division was created to provide institutional investors with “access to the wide range of diverse opportunities presented by the structural disruption and innovation of blockchain technology,” according to its website. In April, Brevan Howard participated in the $70 million funding round for Lightning Labs, a protocol developer bringing stablecoins to the bitcoin network.

42422391,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kd1h,1662583843,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Inches Higher but Sluggish Volume Shows Reluctance to Invest,"Price Action  Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) traded higher early Wednesday, pausing a slide that began late the previous day.  As U.S. traders began the day, bitcoin (BTC) was up 1.8%, rising for four consecutive hours between 12:00 and 16:00 UTC. Trading volume for BTC was below normal, when compared to its 20-day moving average for volume. The lower-than-normal volume shows a lack of investor conviction. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is now trading below $19,000, and is down 59% year to date.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, followed a similar path to BTC, although its upward trend began during the 11:00 UTC hour. ETH volume was a bit stronger than BTC’s, with its trading volume exceeding its 20-day moving average. Ether is now down 58% in value for 2022.  Despite the prolonged downturns in both BTC and ETH, some investors see current levels presenting an attractive buying opportunity.  Economic Calendar: Today’s economic calendar is light on key data points that could influence crypto markets, but investors will be eyeing the 22:00 UTC (10 a.m. ET) release of the Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book.” The “Beige Book” is a report that summarizes information on economic conditions throughout the U.S., and is released eight times per year. Fed officials Thomas Barkin, Loretta Mester, Lael Brainard and Michael Barr are scheduled to make speeches on Wednesday as well.  A preview of Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Mester’s speech highlighted the Fed’s continued focus on taming inflation. Mester noted that “it is far too soon to conclude that inflation has peaked, let alone that it is on a sustainable downward path” to 2%.  U.S. Equities: Traditional financial markets rose across the board. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500 tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 1.4%, 1.8%, and 2.14%, respectively.  Commodities: Crude oil prices reversed course from the prior day, falling 5.6%, while natural gas fell 4%. The price of traditional safe-haven asset gold rose 0.92%, while copper futures declined 0.6%  Altcoins rose, as Polkadot (DOT), Avalanche (AVAX), and Uniswap (UNI) were up 3.5%, 2%, and 2.7% respectively.  Latest Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $19,307 +2.0%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,638 +4.6%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,979.87 +1.8%      ●Gold: $1,729 per troy ounce +1.7%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.26% −0.07      Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Bitcoin’s relationship to dollar strength highlights macro hurdles.  The strength of the U.S. dollar appears to be one of the only metrics that matters at the moment. In a vacuum, the technical indicators we have referenced often (Relative Strength Index, Bollinger Bands, etc.) indicate that bitcoin remains an undervalued asset. Bitcoin has fallen 59% in value for the year.  Bitcoin’s past RSI readings above 70 and below 30 have occasionally provided signals that bitcoin has been over and/or undervalued. Examples of this occurred in March 2020, April 2021 and November 2021, when BTC prices reversed course following a breach of those benchmarks.  RSI is a technical indicator that captures signals where BTC prices have accelerated too fast in one direction. BTC’s current RSI level of 31 is generally viewed as a signal that the crypto is undervalued and poised for a potential move higher.  Still, whether an asset is undervalued, and the time that asset remains undervalued, are separate questions.  A look at the relationship between the U.S. dollar index (DXY) and the price of bitcoin highlights the inverse relationship between the two assets that began in April and accelerated throughout the year. BTC’s correlation coefficient with DXY in early March reached 0.12, while it currently reads at -0.77. The correlation coefficients range between 1 and -1, with the former indicating a direct relationship, and the latter signaling an inverse relationship.  The Consumer Price Index for August was 8.5%, remaining at a 40-year high. The U.S. dollar index has plunged 14% year-to-date compared to BTC’s more precipitous decline. It has been buoyed both by increases in the Fed funds rate and the commencement of quantitative tightening (QT) by the Fed.  Quantitative tightening is an exercise by which the Federal Reserve reduces the size of its balance sheet by removing liquidity from financial markets.  Ultimately, while BTC technical indicators are signaling traders to buy, Fed actions and the strength of the U.S. dollar suggest that traders should wait.  Additionally, on-chain data also shows a 2% increase in BTC balances on exchanges since Aug. 29. Increased exchange balances suggest bearish signals, as investors often send BTC to exchanges for the purpose of exiting their positions.

42422361,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kcPh,1662582121,"Hawkish Fed Chatter Has Wall Street Betting on Big Rate Hike, Crypto Traders Shorting Bitcoin","Several Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday signaled that the U.S. central bank will continue to raise interest rates until there are clear signs that inflation is coming down for multiple months.  Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to stay above the crucial psychological threshold of $20,000 this week. The largest cryptocurrency has faced pressure – along with other risky assets including stocks – from hawkish chatter by monetary officials. On Tuesday, bitcoin dropped to as low as $18,559, which was its lowest price since June 30.  “We are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down,” Fed Vice Chairwoman Lael Brainard said Wednesday in a speech at a banking conference in New York.  The next rate hike decisions is set to take place on Sept. 21, when the Federal Open Market Committee will meet for the first time since last month’s annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium retreat in Wyoming.  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in July that upcoming decisions would be data-dependent, which means that all eyes will be on the consumer price index set to be released next week for the latest reading on inflation. Last week, the Labor Department’s jobs report for August showed that the labor market has started to cool slightly.  “Before I conclude that inflation has peaked, I will need to see several months of declines in the month-over-month readings,” Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said in a speech Wednesday.  Mester said that she will be “guarding against declaring victory over the inflation beast too soon,” and that the Fed needs to raise rates above 4% and keep them there for a while.  The market’s perception of the likelihood of a 75 basis point, or 0.75 percentage point, rate hike has increased over the past week. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the Fed “appears to be on a path” for another 0.75 percentage point rate increase.  That’s roughly three times the usual 0.25 percentage point increase made by the Fed in recent rate-hiking cycles – a sign of just how urgent a matter that inflation has become in the eyes of top officials.  Earlier Wednesday, the Bank of Canada raised its main interest rate by 75 basis points to 3.25%, the highest in 14 years. On Thursday, the European Central Bank is expected to make a similar move.  The CME FedWatch Tool, which shows how traders of financial futures contracts are betting on the Fed’s next move, now suggests a 78% chance that the central bank will hike by 75 basis points. Such a move would bring the federal-funds rate to a range of 3% to 3.25%.  Partly for this reason, many traders are betting on a continued price decline for bitcoin, reflected in the increasing record level of speculation seen in the crypto futures market.  “With rising rates, you’ve got this carry trade which all of the miners use as well and it’s unraveling in front of our eyes,” TheoTrade co-founder Don Kaufman said on CoinDesk TV. “It is difficult to support some of the trade opportunities that existed a few months ago.  “In a rising interest rate environment, it may not be worth it when the two-year Treasury yield is sitting at 3.5%,” Kaufman said. “Do you really want to carry overnight … and it unwinds a number of very key trades inside of the crypto marketplace?”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/07/hawkish-fed-chatter-has-traders-betting-on-75-basis-point-rate-hike-by-shorting-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Crypto mining equities have tumbled and some have lagged the price of bitcoin (BTC) over the past year, forcing them to sell their bitcoin holdings to shore up their balance sheets to survive the crypto winter. Participants also expect some mergers and acquisitions to occur.

Those with weaker balance sheets may also need to raise capital or cut capital spending, the firm wrote.  Miners with smaller crypto holdings relative to their market capitalization include Hive Blockchain (HIVE), Bit Digital (BTBT), CleanSpark (CLSK), Stronghold Digital (SDIG) and Greenidge Generation (GREE). Valkyrie said this batch of miners could be viewed as more “defensive” and less exposed to their liquid assets declining if crypto prices continue to drop.  Those with larger crypto holdings relative to their market cap include Digihost Technology (DGHI), Hut 8 (HUT), Marathon Digital (MARA) and Core Scientific (CORZ).

42421104,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSkH,1662575863,Ethereum’s Merge May Boost Public's View of Crypto,"The Ethereum blockchain's software update called the Merge may change the public's perception of both the network and crypto in general, according to journalist and author Laura Shin.  ""There's a lot riding on this,"" Shin, the host of the ""Unchained"" podcast and author of ""The Cryptopians,"" a book about Ethereum’s history, said on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Wednesday.  The Merge, which is scheduled to take place around Sept. 15, stands to greatly reduce Ethereum's energy use and, proponents claim, boost the price of ether (ETH), the network's security and overall confidence in crypto.  Ethereum’s move to a proof-of-stake mechanism from a proof-of-work one could reduce the network's energy consumption by as much as 99.95%, according to some estimates. That may change the way crypto is viewed. Shin points out there is still a perception of “high environmental costs to maintaining proof-of-work blockchains,” and adds if developers are able to turn that perception around, “then that would be huge.”  Yet the change may not come without a price. Ahead of the Merge, some users are concerned it “will lead to centralization factors,” Shin said. Liquid staking pool providers such as Lido and Coinbase (COIN) may take on bigger roles in how Ethereum is run.  Read more: Lido Dominates Booming Market for Ethereum 2.0 Staking Derivatives  Shin said users are worried platforms like Lido could take “80% of all the staked ether,” raising “significant concerns” about on-chain governance.  “Lido itself has on-chain governance with the LDO token. Ethereum does not have on-chain governance,” Shin said.  “There is a concern that this could be a way that Ethereum becomes centralized, especially in its governance,"" she noted.  Also, if the Merge is successful, it may reduce interest in Ethereum’s competitors, or so-called “Ethereum killers” Shin said, adding that she doesn't see other networks “taking off,” unless “a spectacular failure” with the Merge were to occur. Competing blockchains such as Cardano and Polkadot were founded by people involved in the creation of Ethereum several years ago.  “A lot of blockchain network effects really depend on perception around the individuals involved,” Shin said. “That will only be strengthened if the Ethereum Merge is successful.”  Read more: Ethereum Merge: What You Need to Know",POSITIVE,ETH,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/07/ethereums-merge-could-boost-the-publics-perception-of-crypto-overall,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c6cea07b1e92dfb3f002f36e95467ac46baf4e5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

And of course, over the past four months Fed policy tightening has taken a historic shift to combat entrenched energy inflation. The FOMC raised the target federal funds rate by .50% at the beginning of May, followed by two .75% increases in June and July. For perspective, there has only been one .75% or larger raise since 1990.The Committee has also instituted an ongoing, large scale reduction in the Fed&apos;s balance sheet, which will generally further tighten financial conditions and raise interest rates.

42422383,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kcvh,1662574165,"Crypto Oversight Should Resemble Traditional Bank Rules, Fed Official Says","Michael Barr, the former Ripple Labs adviser and Michigan University law school dean who is now the U.S. Federal Reserve’s vice chairman for supervision, said crypto activities need greater regulatory oversight.  In his first speech since occupying the Fed role, at a Wednesday Brookings Institution event in Washington, D.C., Barr said the U.S. central bank will work with other bank regulators to oversee any crypto activity that banks engage in. He also addressed stablecoin oversight, said crypto isn't yet living up to its potential to expand financial access and said that he doesn't think issuing a digital dollar is an urgent need from the Fed.  Barr, appointed by President Joe Biden, is widely expected to be a tough regulator of Wall Street banks. It’s been less clear what his view on digital assets will be, considering he once worked in the industry, holding a position on Ripple’s advisory board.  ""We plan to work with other bank regulatory agencies to ensure that crypto activity inside banks is well regulated, based on the principle of same risk, same activity, same regulation, regardless of the technology used for the activity,"" Barr said. ""I plan to make sure that the crypto activity of banks that we supervise is subject to the necessary safeguards that protect the safety of the banking system as well as bank customers.""  In the coming years, the Fed will be involved in deciding how the government treats stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC. It’s also expected to decide whether to issue a digital dollar – a move with major potential consequences for the crypto industry. Barr’s academic work has painted a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in a positive light, suggesting it could boost the government’s financial inclusion aims.  Barr carefully address the digital dollar question, saying he agrees with the current Fed position to study the issue carefully and to insist that Congress and the White House are ""on the same page"" before the Fed does anything.  ""I’m not in crisis mode about the need to issue a CBDC."" Barr said.  Barr also highlighted stablecoins as ""a priority,"" referring to these types of tokens as ""unregulated private money."" Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a peg with a real-world asset like the U.S. dollar.  “Congress should work expeditiously to pass much-needed legislation to bring stablecoins, particularly those designed to serve as a means of payment, inside the prudential regulatory perimeter,"" he said. Still, he said, federal regulators do have some existing powers that can be used if appropriate.  The one-time senior official at the U.S. Department of the Treasury has a wide-ranging authority as the Fed’s point person for overseeing and regulating financial firms. In the Fed’s case, that mostly means bank holding companies.  However, it also has a role in supervising nonbank financial firms that are considered large and complex enough to pose a threat to the rest of the system if they were to collapse. It’s possible that cryptocurrency companies will someday fit that mold.  The Federal Reserve published guidance last month detailing how it would evaluate non-traditional banks’ applications for Fed master accounts, something a handful of crypto companies have actively sought over the past year. While the vice chairman is technically subordinate to Fed Chair Jerome Powell when it comes to managing the central bank’s agenda, Powell has made it clear in past remarks that he intends to defer to Barr on oversight matters.

42411386,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQqM,1662571800,A Stablecoin Law May Not Happen This Year,"Hey folks. Monday was a federal holiday in the U.S. so we’re taking it easy today. Reporting from my colleague Jesse Hamilton suggests that stablecoin legislation we expected to see released this month may not be coming after all. Plus, a few other stories that caught my eye over the past week.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  A Stablecoin Bill is on Deck, But Expect Delays  The narrative  One of the few pieces of crypto-specific legislation we expected to see in 2022 was a stablecoin bill. It’s looking like this bill may no longer be ready in time for lawmakers to debate and vote into law this year.  Why it matters  Stablecoins might be the area in which we are most likely to see actual laws, as far as crypto regulation goes. Any possible bill is likely going to address issues such as how stablecoin issuers can tap banking services, what their reserves must look like, whether they can engage in fractional reserves, what sort of licensing stablecoin issuers need and what kind of consumer protections must be baked in.  Breaking it down  My colleague and Reg Team Deputy Managing Editor Jesse Hamilton reported late last week that the House Financial Services Committee’s (FSC) anticipated stablecoin bill may not actually be introduced, let alone passed, ahead of November’s midterm elections.  From his article:  “A legislative push toward the crypto industry’s first significant set of U.S. regulations remains bogged down over negotiations between the panel’s Democratic chairwoman and its ranking Republican, despite initial plans that aimed to release a draft of the bill as early as this week, according to three people familiar with the talks. There have been a number of points to iron out, including such thorny topics as the role of state regulators, the possibility of a future digital dollar in the U.S. and the treatment of customer money held by crypto platforms.”  That being said, the bill isn’t dead. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who chairs the committee, and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who is the ranking member, are the lead negotiators on this effort, and they’re both coming back in the new year (though it’s possible their titles will be swapped).  Of course, as I was writing this the new FSC hearing schedule for September came out, saying there may, in fact, be a markup for stablecoin legislation sometime this month, though “date and time TBD,” so all is not yet lost.  Stablecoins have always gotten a fair amount of interest, but as a regulatory issue this seems to continue to be the area lawmakers will tackle before getting to other issues such as whether a law is needed to treat crypto trading platforms similarly to national securities exchanges.  The problem is, timing-wise anyway, that the House is only one body. A bill needs to be passed by both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate to become a law, meaning every minute counts.  Right now Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the ranking member in the Senate Banking Committee, is at a guess the most likely lawmaker in the upper house to introduce a similar bill – if the House passes, or at least advances, the Waters-McHenry effort. He’s also retiring from public office after this year, to be replaced either by current Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman or former cardiothoracic surgeon and TV personality Mehmet Oz.  I’m not sure who might succeed Toomey as ranking member, but this bill is likely going to take some time to get through the Senate regardless.  Other items  In other stablecoin news, Binance is delisting USD coin (USDC), the Paxos dollar (USDP) and trueUSD (TUSD). It’s going to convert customers’ holdings in those stablecoins into its own branded Binance dollar (BUSD) (which is also issued by Paxos) on a 1:1 basis at the end of the month.  A Voyager creditor filed Monday asking a court to require the crypto lender to either refund him $10,000 or revert a 10,000 USDC buy order made minutes after the company claimed it suspended all buys and withdrawals. According to Shaik Taj Baba, he placed an order for 10,000 USDC at 2:07 p.m. ET on July 1, and placed a withdrawal order at 2:09 p.m. ET. Voyager processed the buy order, did not process the withdrawal order and announced shortly after that it had halted all activity at 2:00 p.m.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  I’m actually kind of curious if U.S. President Joe Biden can even nominate someone to fill one of the acting roles before the congressional term ends, given the upcoming elections.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Electronic Frontier Foundation) Peter Eckersley passed away over the weekend. You may not be familiar with this former cybersecurity expert and EFF technologist but I’ve recommended projects he worked on in the past, namely Privacy Badger, but he was responsible for far more.  (The Verge) Cloudflare dropped Kiwi Farms shortly after announcing it wouldn’t be doing that. The internet infrastructure player said this was due to “an immediate threat to human life.” The Verge has a good write-up of what all that means.

42411729,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXKY,1662570193,What Are Soulbound Tokens? The Non-Transferrable NFT Explained,"Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a type of blockchain asset that allows holders to prove ownership over an item, real or digital. Each NFT is unique and cannot be replicated and, in most cases, ownership of an NFT can be bought and sold.  NFTs are not tied to a particular person or group, and according to a recent Twitter poll, many people buy NFTs to make money. Popular NFT projects like CryptoPunks or Bored Ape Yacht Club can resell for hundreds of thousands of dollars on marketplaces like OpenSea, fostering an environment where NFTs trade hands frequently to whoever the highest bidder may be.  But what if there was a digital token tied to an individual that could not be bought or sold? In May 2022, a concept called soulbound tokens (SBT) was proposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, economist Eric Glen Weyl and lawyer Puja Ohlhaver to address the current limitations of NFTs and other decentralized structures. Here’s what soulbound tokens are and how they work.  What is a soulbound token?  The concept of “soulbound” assets on the blockchain was first discussed in a January 2022 blog post by Buterin. In it, he explained that in the popular fantasy game World of Warcraft there are powerful “soulbound items” that cannot be transferred or sold to another player once picked up.  “NFTs in their current form have many of the same properties as rare and epic items in a massively multiplayer online game,” he wrote, before describing some of their shortcomings. “While transferable NFTs have their place and can be really valuable on their own for supporting artists and charities, there is also a large and underexplored design space of what non-transferable NFTs could become.”  This idea was expanded on by Buterin and his colleagues in a May 2022 paper titled “Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul.” Soulbound tokens are described as non-transferable digital tokens that represent social identity in a decentralized society.  In the paper’s vision for a decentralized society, accounts called “Souls” will hold or issue SBTs that represent the “commitments, credentials and affiliations” of an individual holder. “Such tokens would be like an extended resume, issued by other wallets that attest to these social relations,” the authors explain.  In their simplest form, SBTs can be “self-certified” in the same way a person might add their education or employment history to their resume. SBTs could also be issued by Souls representing individuals, companies or institutions, just as a university could award a diploma to a graduate for successfully completing their studies.  Can you buy soulbound tokens?  Soulbound tokens cannot be bought and sold and are not designed to have market value. Instead, they can be issued by individuals or by another entity to symbolize an accomplishment.  NFT innovation platform Idexo claims that it launched the first soulbound token in April 2021 before the idea was formally named. Its non-transferable Early Adopter NFTs were minted on the Binance Smart Chain and are tied to the holder’s Telegram username.  Idexo also recently added SBTs to its software development kit, enabling the community to create SBTs on multiple blockchain platforms.  What can soulbound tokens be used for?  As of September 2022, the concept and its use cases are still being researched.  According to the white paper, SBTs could help propel Web3 forward by lessening the dependence on centralized structures in Web2. For example, it notes that many users rely on custodial wallets managed by central entities like Coinbase or Binance to store their crypto, and NFT artists depend on centralized platforms like OpenSea or Twitter to sell their work.  In addition, SBTs seek to move us away from the “hyper-financialization” of crypto and discourage the use of NFTs as status symbols.  SBTs can also help navigate the trustless and largely pseudonymous nature of Web3 by creating socially verifiable reputations. For example, anyone can claim to be a Harvard graduate, but holding an SBT from the university could be used to prove your educational credentials in Web3.  Reputation can play a large role in how much faith a community is willing to place in an individual or team. You’d likely be very cautious in dealing with someone who has a history of defrauding investors or abandoning projects. Alternatively, you’d be very confident working with someone who has a proven track record.  Some examples of how SBTs can be used include:  Managing medical records  Storing digital ID cards or memberships  Certifying achievements, like job history or education  Verifying attendance to an event, similar to a Proof of Attendance Protocol  Allowing people to build verifiable, digital reputations based on past actions. This could make it easier to track a user’s decentralized finance (DeFi) borrowing history and give out loans  Introducing reputation-based voting for decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance models. This could also help DAOs mitigate Sybil attacks  Using social recovery to gain access to an individual’s lost private keys  The future of soulbound tokens  According to the white paper, Souls and SBTs will serve as the foundation for a decentralized society, described as a “transformative, pluralist future” where social interactions and human relationships are important building blocks for your Web3 identity.  Soulbound tokens can help resolve the issue of trust in Web3 by establishing provenance and reputation. They are not transferable and theoretically lower the risk of people manipulating the ecosystem by buying status or lying about their achievements. This could also make Web3 scams less prevalent due to a more complex process of identity theft and impersonation.  Eric Glen Weyl, one of the white paper’s authors, predicts that SBTs will be available for early use cases by the end of 2022. In September 2020, cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced that it would be issuing soulbound tokens on the BNB blockchain to all users who complete know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.  Privacy remains a challenge for SBTs and creating a truly decentralized society. However, soulbound tokens have the potential for large-scale utility.

42422368,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kcdh,1662570057,Binance Seeks to Rev Up Its BNB Blockchain With Tech That Got Traction on Ethereum,"Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange by volume, is seeking to speed up transaction times and reduce fees for its BNB blockchain, becoming one of the largest players yet to embrace a technology known as a zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup.  The upgrade, planned for next year, will allow BNB to process between 5,000 to 10,000 transitions per second, according to a statement Wednesday. That vastly outpaces the current capabilities of the blockchain, which is the largest smart-contract chain in terms of user base and transaction volume, surpassing even the better-known Ethereum.  What Binance effectively announced is a separate blockchain where transactions can be offloaded and processed faster and more cheaply, with the results passed back to BNB. It’s a complicated technology and deploying it in live environments was, until recently, thought to be years out. The fact that Binance is putting its significant weight behind a ZK rollup suggests there might be more advances to the space sooner rather than later. Binance’s decision follows ZK rollups gaining traction in the Ethereum ecosystem.  Binance solutions architect Arnaud Bauer told CoinDesk the upgrade will provide greater security for decentralized application (dapp) transactions and enhance interoperability between chains, which will allow dapps to expand their user bases.  Rollups bundle up transactions, which can be anything from NFT swaps to token trades. They get processed on a layer 2, or companion blockchain, network, which then hands a summary of the results back down to the layer 1 blockchain, in this case, BNB.  There are other kinds of rollups, but developers tend to prefer ZK rollups because they use fancy cryptography to guarantee that the data they hand back to the layer 1 blockchains hasn’t been tampered with. Computation on layer 2 rollup networks tends to be faster and cheaper than layer 1 chains – making rollups a major boon for user adoption.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | ZK,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/07/binance-seeks-to-rev-up-its-bnb-blockchain-with-tech-that-got-traction-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98227ebf23cd9e8842f93dc11c2365270cb9fb22-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The auction will take place at the New York offices of Voyager’s investment bankers, Moelis & Company.  The auction results will become final during a court hearing approving the results on Sept. 29, according to the filing. Sept. 6 was the deadline for bids to have been submitted.  The identity of bidders has not been revealed but exchanges FTX and Binance are known to have had interest in acquiring Voyager’s assets. According to a presentation from Voyager’s company lawyers in early August, at least 22 investors had gone through due diligence and indicated their interest in bidding for Voyager’s assets, but it was not known how many had submitted formal bids by the deadline.  In a tweet on Wednesday, Voyager confirmed that it had received multiple bids for its assets as part of its restructuring process.

42411377,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQZp,1662568912,"Vermont Regulators Didn't Use the Word, but I Will: Celsius Was a Ponzi","A bombshell new filing by the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation in the Chapter 11 proceedings of the collapsed Celsius Network makes the case that the crypto lender was effectively insolvent, not just after the crypto market declines of early 2022 but as early as 2019.  Celsius itself admitted to investigators “that the company had never earned enough revenue to support the yields being paid to investors.” The filing further claims that its financial analysis “suggests that at least at some points in time, yields to existing [Celsius] investors were probably being paid with the assets of new investors.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Although the regulator never used the word, that’s the dictionary definition of a Ponzi scheme.  In short, contrary to voluminous public statements by CEO Alex Mashinsky, Celsius never really functioned as an investment middleman for crypto-asset holders, generating yields from institutional lending and passing them along to depositors. Instead, nearly from the beginning of its existence, it was paying depositors at least in part from non-revenue sources including other depositors’ funds, venture capital investments or the CEL token it printed from thin air.  I recently wrote about the inherent danger of unsustainable high yields as a customer acquisition strategy in finance. That encompasses other actors, including both BlockFi and the Terra blockchain's Anchor system. But Mashinsky and the Celsius team are in potentially much, much hotter water than even a delusional screwup like Terra founder Do Kwon. There’s a slim chance Kwon actually believed his own absurd claims about the UST “stablecoin.” That’s why I called him the Elizabeth Holmes of crypto – like Holmes, it remains at least slightly unclear whether Kwon was an outright fraudster or just not very bright.  Alex Mashinsky won’t get to exploit the same ambiguity. The Vermont filing, as the kids put it, has got receipts.  See also: Celsius and BitConnect: Not So Different? | Opinion  It again and again notes specific dates on which Mashinsky made public attestations to the firm’s financial health, at the precise moment Celsius was actually deeply in the red. Those deceptions may well form the foundation of a criminal fraud case against the CEO and his allies.  CEL-ing lies  The Vermont filing also explores the role of the CEL token in Celsius’ finances. “If Celsius’ net position in CEL is excluded, its liabilities exceed its assets in all of the Freeze Reports and Preliminary Balance Sheets provided to state regulators,” the filing claims, referencing reports beginning May 2021. Even more broadly, the filing claims that “excluding the Company’s net position in CEL, liabilities would have exceeded its assets since at least Feb. 28, 2019.”  In other words, Celsius was effectively insolvent nearly from birth. The only way it avoided acknowledging that was by tallying the value of its self-generated “Monopoly” money.  See also: Bankrupt Lender Celsius CEO Owes Creditors Transparency  And if that wasn’t enough, the Vermont filing further cites “credible claims [that] Celsius and its management engaged in the improper manipulation of the price of the CEL token.” Celsius spent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of depositor funds buying CEL tokens, with the possible intent of pumping the token price – including after Celsius halted user withdrawals on June 12.  Regardless of what any court concludes, that sure sounds like criminal behavior. It’s also a major question for regulators going forward – should centralized private companies be free to issue their own blockchain tokens at all? And if they can, how should they be required or allowed to account for those tokens financially?  Celsius, certainly, makes the case that printing your own money shouldn’t be treated as a legitimate path to corporate profit.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

With the current market at one of its lowest point in history, NEAR could become a bit flaky. A number of analysts forecast an entirely bearish future for the token. The coin has oscillated near the $3.75 support line and even attempted to escape the bearish market. The coin attempted to break out of its more recent low of $4.16 with a rally to $4.51, according to data from Coingecko. This upswing is one of the most recent bullish attempts to overcome the $4.44 resistance. Related Reading: Elrond Network Watch: Consider This Before Filling Up Your Wallet With EGLD NEAR Price Hounded By Massive Sell-Off A $4.4 long-rejection candle supports the completion of the previously described bearish pattern.

The price of NEAR token has decreased by almost 90 percent from its recent high of $4.51 to its current price of $4.02. Also, the coin experienced a massive liquidation between $4.18 and $4.02. This can be interpreted as Wednesday&apos;s sudden surge in trading volume. Even though the market has been extremely bearish recently, the coin&apos;s future may still be favorable.

42411379,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQWW,1662566919,NFTs Can and Will Be So Much More,"If you stop people on the street and ask what they think non-fungible tokens (NFT) are all about, what will you hear? Something about outlandish prices for cartoons of apes and maybe about Twitter profile pictures. Confused mumbling about cryptocurrency. A few celebrity names. The word “bubble.”  In sum, a tale of frivolity, bling and irrational exuberance. Which isn’t too far off the mark.  But NFTs can and will mean much more. In fact, if you dig below the surface, they already do.  As the market value and popularity of NFTs have crashed, many are questioning their longevity as a technology and a cultural trend. Were they just a speculative asset doomed to disappear as the NFT-market bubble burst? After all, what utility do NFTs have?  Ari Juels is a faculty member at Cornell Tech in New York and co-director of the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3). He is also chief scientist at Chainlink Labs. He has recently co-authored a paper on NFTs entitled “NFTs for Art and Collectables: Primer and Outlook” and is organizing an NFT gallery opening in New York City in October.  Utility, though, isn’t really the point of artistic or collectable NFTs today. After all, it’s not the yardstick by which we measure the significance of physical works of art by Rembrandt or Damien Hirst, or musical works by Mozart or The Beatles, or luxury goods like Fabergé eggs or Birkin bags. It’s true that most NFT artists aren’t quite Rembrandt, but at least one is Damien Hirst.  An important way to think about NFTs is as a new medium for producing art and collectables. Throughout the centuries, technological innovations – from oil paints to the electric guitar to photography – have irrevocably changed the way in which works of art are produced and exhibited. NFTs are part of this long arc of history. A vibrant community is experimenting with its expressive possibilities through machine learning-generated art, art that transforms itself as its environment changes, community-driven artistic production and much more.  Moreover, NFTs also can, and increasingly will, have utility. NFTs can, for example, help address key challenges in traditional art markets. Among those are provenance and royalty payments.  Provenance  Thomas Hoving, a former director of the Metropolitan Museum in New York, estimated that about 40% of the objects he examined – including many in the museum itself – were fakes, forgeries or misattributions. While many question this figure – and even the definition of fakes – it’s clear that problems in traditional art markets abound.  Many of these problems relate to provenance, the history of production of an artwork and who later owned it. Provenance is helpful in establishing the authenticity and value of a piece of art. Where it’s lacking, nasty surprises can turn up, like Steven Spielberg learning that he owned a stolen Norman Rockwell painting or the Getty Museum paying $10 million for a dubious ancient Greek statue.  With NFTs, provenance is recorded immutably on a blockchain. Ownership – at least as identified by blockchain addresses – is publicly visible and resistant to forgery. By making bids and identities transparent, strong provenance can also help address a couple of other rampant problems in art markets, like money laundering.  Royalties  There are countless stories of artists who died penniless before they became famous, like Vincent van Gogh. These stories are reminders of how often artists get the short end of the stick in art markets. It is striking that they generally don’t receive royalties for sales of their works in secondary markets in the U.S., despite the practice being common elsewhere. Famously, the artist Robert Rauschenberg was at the Sotheby’s sale where his painting “Thaw” was sold for $85,000 by a collector who bought it from the artist for $900. Rauschenberg yelled at the collector, “I’ve been working my ass off just for you to make that profit.”  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  NFTs enable royalty payments to be enforced automatically (although some poor technical choices have created loopholes). Perhaps more importantly, artists can in principle dictate a set of future terms of sale of their works. An artist can decide, for instance, that she does not want her NFT ever sold for more than, say, $1,000. Or she might decide she wants to exert a right like France’s droit d’auteur, which allows artists some degree of ongoing control over their works after they’re sold. In some cases, they can even destroy them.  While some buyers may object to this degree of control by NFT creators, the transparency of blockchain systems can ensure that all participants can make an informed choice.  Problems and potential solutions  NFT markets today are rife with problems. Unauthorized copying is rampant. So too is wash trading, artificially generated trading volume intended to stoke sales. Preventing the decay of physical works of arts – such as sharks in formaldehyde – is challenging. NFTs pose the same problem in digital form. The archival integrity of the NFT ecosystem could turn out to be a ticking time bomb, as many NFTs have content that is stored with paid cloud services and could disappear if payment lapses.  Another big problem is the incursion of bots. NFTs are often sold in drops, i.e., in the form of a collection of thousands of NFTs offered at once for sale. When a popular drop takes place, schemers will often deploy bots to snap up NFTs, later reselling them at a profit. Enforcing a fair cap on per-customer purchases has proven tricky.  Happily, blockchain systems are evolving in ways that will enable people to prove facts about themselves and present unique identities while protecting their privacy. My group at Cornell Tech, for instance, raffled off an NFT created by a digital artist. We staged the raffle in such a way that individual participants could obtain only one raffle ticket (for free) by proving possession of a Social Security number to us using privacy-preserving oracle technology.  Read more: Michael J. Casey – The Value of NFTs Is Belonging  The blockchain community is working toward a broad concept called decentralized identity. This is essentially a privacy-preserving system of user-controlled credentials. Imagine having a digital version of your driver’s license that you can present online in a selective way – e.g., proving that you’re a resident of California but hiding your birthdate. A system of decentralized identity will allow for NFT marketplaces to enforce purchase limits and much more. For example, one NFT artist has told my group he’d like to be able to offer discounts to fellow artists automatically. There’s no good way to do so today, but in a decentralized identity system that certifies artists such a thing will be possible.  A strong system of identities can also help ensure that people are buying NFTs from legitimate creators rather than impersonators.  Ultimately, NFT marketplaces can include a “policy engine” that empowers creators to shape the lifecycle of their works in a rich variety of ways. They can set sale and resale conditions. They can make their NFTs dynamic. They can offer discounts and rewards to fans. They can cultivate communities of aficionados in the world of NFTs like those that galleries aim to foster in traditional art markets. Perhaps a policy engine can also address problems like the fun-eroding “speculative pricing and investment mentality” that led the Microsoft (MSFT)-owned video game Minecraft to ban NFTs earlier this year.  Beyond digital art  The human race is migrating online, increasingly immersed in digital content and visual experiences often called the metaverse. Young adults are ditching physical possessions. A number of technologists believe that NFTs will come to represent goods in the metaverse – everything from parcels of land to magic swords. They will shape our experiences in the metaverse, in whatever form it ultimately assumes. It’s not a coincidence that Facebook, which recently rebranded itself Meta (META) in a nod to the emergence of the metaverse, just integrated NFTs into Instagram.  NFTs have many other applications as well, such as representation of real-world goods. In a possible harbinger of the future real-estate market, an apartment was sold as an NFT. Mainstream companies such as Nike (NKE), TIME Magazine, and Tiffany & Co. (TIF) are using or issuing them and they also offer a vehicle for a much more richly experiential system of ticketing for events.  Make no mistake. For all of their potential, NFTs are not an unalloyed force for good. No one should be an apologist for the excesses they’ve fueled – scam sales like those seen in some cryptocurrency markets, plus new crimes, like artist identity theft. For these reasons, technical tools like those described here as well as community-based means of consumer protection will be important.  NFTs will in any case continue to evolve in powerful and exciting ways. Like it or not, they – or something like them – are a cultural force here to stay.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Ari Juels,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/07/nfts-can-and-will-be-so-much-more,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9fa9a3748993fa8ecd3e82350bcb8ed005052a7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411083,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBzzD,1662566566,The Degens' Sports Club,"What do the rapper Ja Rule, the former National Football League (NFL) player Tiki Barber, and the actor Jerry Ferrara (“Turtle” from “Entourage”) have in common? They’re all part of a community called the “Knights of Degen,” a non-fungible token-based club that’s obsessed with sports, gambling and anything related to sports and gambling.  “The year is 2088,” explains the Knights website. “It’s a raucous Sunday at the renowned medieval sports bar, the Degen Tavern, where sports degens gather in their finest Knight gear to bet on sports, trade NFTs, share alpha and be their truest degen selves.”  To the uninitiated, as is the case with so much in crypto, that string of words can sound like gobbledygook. So co-founder Drew Austin has a simpler explanation. “What’s your ideal Vegas sports bar experience?” Austin asks. “You hang out, you talk with your friends, eat, drink and bet on games.”  The goal of Knights is to replicate that boozy and chummy sports bar experience – both online and IRL.  Here’s how it works. There are a total of 8,888 non-fungible token (NFT) “knights,” cartoon drawings that can be aliens, robots or punchable-looking men. If you buy one of these NFTs, you join the club and get certain perks. (The cheapest of these NFTs goes for 0.23 ether [ETH], or around US$385, at the time of this writing.)  Austin had the idea for Knights during the depths of COVID-19. He realized he was talking with his buddies about the same kinds of things again and again: sports, crypto, NFTs, betting, and more sports and more betting. They liked to “share alpha” and try to find a betting edge. (Think of a sportier version of Wall Street Bets.) Austin realized, “There have got to be other people like us having these same conversations.”  We wanted to build this decentralized Disney for degens.  It turns out there were. There are nearly 3,000 members of the Knights community, according to Austin, a crypto entrepreneur who has been scooping up NFTs since 2018 (he owns some of the most valuables steeds in the “Zed Run” horse racing game; for example, a horse he bought for $200 is now worth $10,000). He says the Knights have driven $10 million in total sales (primarily from NFTs), which helps fund a team of 14 and pays for the many events, parties and perks showered on the community.  A vocal member of this community is Celso Porto, a 40-year-old father of two who works in sales and marketing. “This is what I do anyways, for my life,” says Porto. “Watching football on Sundays. Talking to my buddies through a text chat.”  The Knights felt like his people. A die-hard New York Knicks basketball team fan, Porto was surprised to find himself talking hoops with celebrities, or watching football games (virtually) with [former NFL players] Brandon Jacobs or Marshall Faulk. “I’m like, okay, here I am talking Knicks in the Discord with Jerry [Ferrara],” says Porto. “The Discord events are great.”  Read more: Jeff Wilser – For the Fans: How DAOs Could Change Sports  Often, the Knights hang out in the Discord, but sometimes they meet in real life. The Knights threw a party for March Madness in Vegas, a party at NFT.NYC, a party at the Super Bowl. “We’re pretty much at every major sporting event and major NFT events,” says Austin.  They even create their own sporting events. On April 16, 2022, the Knights were involved in perhaps the most “meta” game in the history of football. The game kicked off play for the second season of “Fan Controlled Football,” or FCF, meaning that fans actually run the teams and manage the rosters and even call the plays. It’s a game of 7-on-7 on a 50-yard field.  The Knights had bought a partial share in one of the teams, meaning its NFT-holders could act as de facto general managers. Many of the Knights (including Austin and Porto, who streamed it on Twitch) attended the game in person. “Everyone has their mobile app out, and we’re calling the plays together,” says Porto.  He also had real-time contact with the team’s quarterback and offensive coordinator. “Our quarterback would reach out to me and be like, ‘They’re killing us on the pass-run option, let’s go pass!’ And I would relay it to the community.” (For football nerds, this is nirvana.) The Knights’ opponents? The Bored Ape Yacht Club (which also bought an FCF team), pitting one NFT project against another NFT project in a bizarro real-life manifestation of Web3.  When there’s already a connective tissue to the tribe, like sports and gambling? Then Web3 can put it on steroids.  The Fan Controlled Football team is part of a grander strategy. “We wanted to build this decentralized Disney for degens,” says Austin, explaining that just as Disney (DIS) has its own clear brand identity and intellectual property (IP), it also thrives across many verticals, from theme parks to ESPN to “Star Wars.” So the Knights are targeting new verticals. They’re now part owners in two sports teams – the FCF team and a soccer team called Crawley Town, in the U.K. With “KOD media” they’re creating online shows like “The Knight Shift” (started by Porto, a weekly recap of the knight’s “kingdom”), Yankees Morning Brew and KoD P2E (play to earn) gaming night.  But why stop at football? Somewhat incredibly, the Knights have a partnership with Bronx Brewery and will roll out their first beer – an IPA called “Degen Haze.” They’re working with local restaurants to somehow create a “degen sauce” that you can order on Seamless. As Austin puts it, “we’re basically putting vodka sauce on a bunch of [stuff] we really love,” and he hopes to roll this out to over 50 cities during the upcoming NFL season. The goal is to bridge the online and offline. “Now you can eat with your friends, drink with your friends, watch our teams, bet on games but do it globally with your digital friends at scale,” he said.  Zooming out the lens, there are many reasons to be skeptical about various corners of the crypto ecosystem. So much is bunk. But one thing crypto does well – for better or for worse – is build and unite communities. Some of these communities are inspiring and some are toxic, but they’re almost always connected, engaged and impassioned. This is the case even when the only thing the community has in common is a cartoon ape. But when there’s already a connective tissue to the tribe, like sports and gambling? Then Web3 can put it on steroids.  Just ask Porto, the father of two kids who loves the communal vibe so much – the betting, the sports, the camaraderie – that he views joining the Knights as a rare gift to himself. “I do everything for the kids,” he says with a laugh, “and now it’s my turn.”",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/07/the-degens-sports-club,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/852de91af88b25a218c6272afbe7bb1ee63900c1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422385,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0kczh,1662566400,Swan Bitcoin Moves Into TradFi With Platform for Financial Advisers,"Bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin is releasing a new product that’s targeting TradFi.  Called Swan Advisor Services, it provides a platform for financial advisors to allow clients to purchase bitcoin, the firm said Wednesday.  Andrew Edstrom, managing director of Swan Advisor Services, told CoinDesk that its latest product expands its reach to institutional clients and investors looking to step into crypto.  “Most advisers are still getting up to speed on [bitcoin] in terms of their research and their knowledge of it. This is really an untapped market,” Edstrom told CoinDesk. (Edstrom is a regular contributor to CoinDesk's Crypto for Advisors newsletter.)  Swan Advisor Services users can transact and manage their clients’ bitcoin positions on the platform, as well as access educational content to help onboard clients new to crypto. All tokens are held by crypto firm Prime Trust.  Swan has been bolstering its line of bitcoin products to make investment opportunities accessible to both crypto natives and crypto-curious investors. In March, it teamed up with Prime Trust to support its crypto retirement product, while in May, it kicked off the Bitcoin Benefit Plan to provide bitcoin bonuses to employees of participating companies.  The traditional finance world has been moving into crypto primarily through bitcoin (BTC) investments; however, Ethereum’s upcoming Merge may push TradFi into crypto through ether (ETH)-based products. Swan offers only bitcoin products, and Edstrom told CoinDesk that he views the Merge as an event that will make it easier for investors to differentiate between bitcoin and ether.  “There's likely to be a very large component of the advisor space that realizes that bitcoin makes a lot more sense for their clients than Ethereum or than a basket of assets,” Edstrom said.  Swan has already onboarded five advisors to its product ahead of its release date. One of those advisors, Isaiah Douglass, partner at Vincere Wealth Management, told CoinDesk in an email that he believes institutional adoption is well on the way, and he hopes to help onboard his clients to the asset.  “Bitcoin is ultimately going through the monetization process and I believe it will be the choice of money worldwide in my lifetime,” Douglass said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/07/swan-bitcoin-moves-into-tradfi-with-platform-for-financial-advisors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/381f80d0fdf3216403a46249dd6bc44d629b8af4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The country's top financial regulators, including the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service, met with industry representatives like the Korea stock market (KRX) at a seminar on Tuesday to gather feedback on how to approach new rules.  Based on the opinions gathered at the policy seminar, the FSC plans to publish guidelines for the issuance and commercialization of security tokens by the end of 2022. Afterwards, it plans to modify the country's existing electronic securities and capital market regulatory frameworks to cover security tokens.  South Korea is speeding ahead with new plans to regulate the digital asset sector following after a turbulent market earlier this year slashed crypto prices and brought down some industry heavyweights. The FSC has vowed to accelerate new rules for the crypto sector, while anti-money-laundering authorities are scrutinizing crypto platforms operating in the country.  The Korea Institute of Finance, which provides in-depth analysis of the country's financial sector, has warned the crypto industry poses a major threat to South Korea's financial stability.  The current capital market and electronic securities systems in South Korea do not support blockchain technology, a summary of Tuesday's seminar said, adding that incorporating the issuance and distribution of security tokens into these frameworks is necessary to protect investors and financial stability.

The current value of this indicator is 38.1%, the lowest level seen since the previous crypto winter in June 2018.

42411388,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQtf,1662562879,Why DeFi Insurance Needs a New Design,"The inherent risk in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market has been one of the most discussed topics in the last few months in the crypto market. It feels that not a week goes by in which investors are not suffering severe losses in DeFi via technical exploits or disproportional economic vulnerabilities. Robust risk management is paramount to catalyze the adoption of DeFi, particularly from an institutional standpoint.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a blockchain analytics provider.  Insurance models are one of the most important elements required to build a strong foundation for the mainstream adoption of DeFi. While conceptually trivial, the mechanics of building insurance mechanisms for the DeFi space are incredibly challenging and don’t quite align with what we see in traditional capital markets.  DeFi uses smart contracts to automate financial services. The initial wave of DeFi protocols focused on two fundamental primitives: lending and market making. These two areas account for the vast majority of the value locked in DeFi protocols, although there have been relevant progress in derivatives and insurance. With the latter, protocols such as Nexus Mutual or InsurAce have taken an innovative approach to address this problem (see below) in the first wave of DeFi protocols. But it’s pretty clear the problem is significantly more complex and the solutions require more development.  Insurance can be considered the missing link in DeFi. Every financial market in history has had insurance mechanisms. Granted, in traditional finance most insurance models are targeted to protect intermediaries that are absorbing the bulk of the risk in transactions. Insurance models for DeFi could be drastically different, and that’s what makes this a fascinating topic.  Technical versus economic insurance in DeFi  Establishing insurance-efficient models in DeFi starts by understanding the fundamental types of risks in the space. While there are many forms of risks in DeFi, from an insurance perspective they can be classified in two main groups: technical and economical.  Technical insurance directly targets the potential of smart contract failures or attacks. Smart contract exploits are the best known form of technical risk in DeFi protocols. Nomad, Wormhole, Cream, Ronin, Badger DAO, Horizon bridge and Beanstalk have been some of the notable DeFi exploits of the last few months. These types of exploit are obviously unexpected and regularly result in irreversible losses in DeFi protocols. They are a natural candidate for insurance models.  Economic risk represents one of the major barriers to entry for investors in DeFi protocols. Every day there are millions lost to economic inefficiencies in DeFi protocols, and this remains a largely unaddressed problem.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez – The Intelligent Crypto Thesis  A classic example in DeFi occurred when long-term ether (ETH) holders were earning yields in ETH-stETH pools in protocols like Curve or Balancer. The objective of many of those investors was to earn additional yield on ETH. But the recent events leading to the staked ether (stETH) de-pegging caused imbalances in those pools, leaving investors with significant holdings on stETH relative to their original ETH positions. A similar but more drastic example is when large holders participating in an automated market maker (AMM) pool withdraw their entire position in a single transaction, causing massive slippage to the remaining investors in the pool. From an insurance perspective, addressing both economic and technical risk is extremely relevant.  Insuring technical risk seems more important today given the nascent nature of DeFi where positions can be lost in a blink of an eye. A typical technical insurance model would guarantee the return of an investor position in case of an exploit against a given protocol or other technical infrastructure components like bridges. As DeFi matures and protocols become more robust, technical risk should become less relevant which, from an insurance perspective, translates into cheaper policies.  Insurance against economic risk in DeFi is trickier to achieve and needs to depart from the traditional models. The decentralized nature of DeFi means that economic risk can’t be absorbed by trusted intermediaries. Therefore insurance policies in DeFi should focus on enabling protection against impermanent loss or slippage in AMMs, liquidations in lending protocols or even de-pegging scenarios that are conducive to economic losses in DeFi positions. The economic risk present in those scenarios is likely to increase as DeFi evolves, making economic insurance policies in protocols even more precious to participating investors.  DeFi insurance with programmability  Adapt traditional financial insurance structures to DeFi protocols means relying on static analyses of DeFi risks and intermediaries that evaluate claims associated with DeFi protocols. The benefits of this model are that it can leverage on the insurance infrastructure used by traditional financial markets and would have an easy path from an institutional adoption and regulatory standpoint. The drawbacks are that it doesn’t quite fit the principles of DeFi.  Read more: DeFi Insurance Protocol Solace Goes Live  The programmable and decentralized nature of DeFi infrastructures continuously challenges established concepts in traditional finance. And just as DeFi brought us unique concepts such as flash loans in the lending space, there is an opportunity to reimagine traditional insurance models. Think about a universe in which economic and technical insurance policies for DeFi protocols are built in the form of smart contracts. That mechanism enables dynamics that are unimaginable in traditional insurance models.  For instance, an investor deploying capital in an AMM like Curve or Balancer could programmatically request an insurance policy that protects him against whale manipulation attack in a specific pool and a potential hack on the underlying AMM. The policy could be automatically paid and terminated after he exits the position. If a large token holder exits the pool causing our investor to suffer slippage beyond the risk thresholds, he can automatically file a claim and get immediately paid by the insurance smart contract. Additional claims that can’t be processed immediately can be evaluated via governance votes. All these interactions are completely programmable and don’t require trusted intermediaries.  DeFi desperately needs efficient insurance  The DeFi market has suffered massive shocks in the last few months, leading to a lack of trust in its value proposition. Insurance is required now to manage risk and restore the trust in DeFi among institutional and retail investors. Designing insurance policies that target both economic and technical risk is challenging but certainly doable. Even more exciting is that DeFi offers a blank canvas to reimagine insurance with programmability and decentralization as core constructs.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/07/why-defi-insurance-needs-a-new-design,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46a39ba7b6ab1da7d02c9762edb4143fc5b47f7a-4107x3080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Jessica and Eve Gale should have warned people about the risk of losses from crypto investments in posts made earlier this year, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said.  It appears to be the first time the ASA has taken action for crypto promotions placed by social media influencers, who, the regulator says, still have to apply marketing norms in full.  “We concluded the ads were misleading,” the regulator said, in part because they “did not include any risk warning making consumers aware that crypto assets could go down as well as up, or that the crypto assets were unregulated in the U.K.”  The twins appeared in 2020 on the popular dating show, in which a group of single people live and love in a luxury villa in Spain.  The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority is awaiting new legislation that would give it the power to treat crypto ads like other financial promotions, which would mean caps on holdings and warnings for buyers.  Until that happens, the ASA has said tackling misleading crypto promotions is a “red alert” priority.  The ASA itself previously took out ads to warn people about influencers who repeatedly failed to flag when posts are actually paid-for promotions, including the Gale twins.  Representatives for the Gales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Michael Hsu, the acting chief of the banking agency for most of President Joe Biden’s administration, is critical of crypto and had been quick to reverse course for the agency, which under previous management was the most welcoming corner of the federal government for digital assets.  The OCC – followed by the other banking regulators – established policies that insisted any lender has to ask permission before dipping a toe into any cryptocurrency activity, and they have to demonstrate that the activity will be totally safe.  Recent events have reinforced that position, he said Wednesday at a Clearing House and Bank Policy Institute conference – one of the largest annual events to discuss banking policy. Hsu cited the collapse of Terra and the LUNA token in May, which he said “sparked contagion across cryptocurrencies, resulting in several crypto platforms failing, forcing numerous exchanges to close, and driving large losses and reductions of staff at a number of publicly traded companies.”  “The federally regulated banking system, by contrast, has been largely unaffected,” he said. “I believe this is due, at least in part, to the careful and cautious approach that we adopted and intend to maintain for the foreseeable future.”  The OCC, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are all involved in U.S. government discussions over how to address oversight of stablecoins, such as Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC.

Wedbush maintained its outperform rating on the stock, but trimmed its price target for the company to $225 from $240. SBNY shares traded up 1% to $170 on Wednesday.  The “silver lining” is that core business deposits excluding digital assets increased by $2.64 billion for the quarter to date, the broker said. Given recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, this should be viewed as a relief for investors who may have been expecting larger overall outflows, Wedbush added.  Much of the anticipated fall in deposits should already be reflected in Signature’s relative valuation, the report said, noting that crypto prices have begun to stabilize recently.  The $4.3 billion contraction in crypto-related deposits was steeper than estimated but not a surprise, Raymond James said in a report, also on Tuesday. The bank’s growth is not dependent on “digital currency ecosystem growth,” the note said, adding that while the firm’s exposure to the cryptocurrency ecosystem remains a headwind, since the end of 2019 it has grown loans at an annualized rate of 25.4% and deposits (ex-digital assets) by 26.3%.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/07/signature-banks-crypto-outflows-mitigated-by-growth-in-core-deposits-wedbush-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa37d365c965630bcbc73ac3c21d687692b5affb-1446x1085.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The department, one of several state regulators probing Celsius amid its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, filed in support of the U.S. Trustee's Office motion to appoint an independent examiner, alleging Celsius has not been transparent about its financials.  The Vermont report is perhaps the most damning assessment of Celsius' management since the lender's collapse this summer helped plunge the global crypto market into a tailspin. The regulator all but alleged that Celsius may have operated at times with a Ponzi scheme-like structure, saying the lender admitted in a recent creditor call that it could not earn enough revenue to support its yields.  ""This shows a high level of financial mismanagement and also suggests that, at least at some points in time, yields to existing investors were probably being paid with the assets of new investors,"" the filing said.  Some 40 state regulators are now looking into Celsius' operations and financials, the filing said.  ""During the course of the multistate investigation, it has become clear that Celsius, through its CEO Alex Mashinsky and otherwise, made false and misleading claims to investors about, inter alia, the company’s financial health and its compliance with securities laws, both of which likely induced retail investors to invest in Celsius or to leave their investments in Celsius despite concerns about the volatility of the cryptocurrency market,"" the filing said.  Celsius was unable to pay repay investors as far back as July 2021, despite what CEO Alex Mashinsky claimed on Twitter or said in interviews, the department alleged.  The company suffered losses in 2021, including when crypto staking platform Stakehound lost access to 35,000 ether (ETH) and when a lender could not return collateral, the filing said.  Read more: What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn’t Telling Its Depositors  As a result, the company was ""misleading"" about its financial health, the filing said, including in its July 2022 bankruptcy filings when Celsius claimed it was filing due to the crypto market's 2022 downturn.  Celsius may have gone so far as to manipulate the price of its CEL token and boost its CEL token holdings to boost its balance sheet, Vermont's regulator alleges.  ""By increasing its net position in CEL by hundreds of millions of dollars, Celsius increased and propped up the market price of CEL, thereby artificially inflating the company’s CEL holdings on its balance sheet and financial statements. Excluding the company’s net position in CEL, liabilities would have exceeded its assets since at least Feb. 28, 2019. These practices may also have enriched Celsius insiders at the expense of retail investors,"" the filing said.  Celsius experienced over $450 million in losses in a 10-day period in May 2022 alone, the filing said.  Due to all of these issues, an independent examiner should investigate Celsius and its operations, the filing said.

42422411,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0khph,1662559948,Bitcoin Bets Look Bearish as Futures Trading Hits Record Level,"Bitcoin's (BTC) futures market is now bigger than ever, and investors appear to be adding to bets on a continued price decline.  The bitcoin-denominated open interest (OI) in futures and perpetuals (futures with no expiry) tied to the largest cryptocurrency has risen to a new record high of 565,579 BTC ($10.6 billion), surpassing the previous peak of 548,096 BTC reached in February 2020, according to Arcane Research. The data covers positions on traditional commodities exchanges such as CME as well as crypto exchanges like Binance and Bybit.  Open interest refers to the number of contracts outstanding. While an uptick in open interest indicates an influx of money into the market, it doesn't provide much information about market positioning.  So traders often read open interest in conjunction with other metrics like futures basis – the difference between prices in futures and spot markets – and funding rates, which represents the cost of holding bullish or bearish positions. If the funding rates are negative, it means the market is leaning bearish.  The latter seems to be the case with bitcoin. ""At the exchange level, open interest is always net neutral, but shorts [bearish trades] are definitely the aggressor now,"" Vetle Lunde, research analyst at Arcane, said.  Bitcoin short-term futures listed on major exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Binance, have been trading at a discount to the spot price since mid-August, indicating bearish flows.  The annualized discount in the CME-listed one-month futures slipped to 10% early this month, according to data tracked by derivatives research firm Skew. The CME is widely considered a proxy for institutional activity.  Outflows from U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) investing in the CME-listed bitcoin futures seem to have pushed the CME basis into the negative.  ""U.S. BTC ETFs have seen a poor month, leading the net BTC exposure to decline by 2,879 BTC. This has made August the second-worst U.S. ETF month since launching in October,"" Lunde noted in a report published on Sept. 5.  Bitcoin's perpetual funding rates, charged every eight hours, have primarily remained negative since mid-August, a sign of shorts paying longs to maintain the bearish position in anticipation of a continued market swoon.  Bitcoin fell to a two-month low of $18,558 early Wednesday, according to CoinDesk data.  The increasing leverage could bring more volatility to the market. ""I am very concerned about the vertical OI trend. Such level of leverage in the market is unsustainable if history is anything to go by,"" Lunde said.

Lau predicted that the Merge will boost the ETH staking total available market and drive Coinbase&apos;s (COIN) diversification efforts, he wrote in a note to clients. Coinbase (COIN) has recently taken steps to prepare itself ahead of the blockchain Merge. For instance, it recently launched wrapped staked ETH, allowing ether (ETH-USD) tokens to be staked, or locked in to earn rewards, through the exchange. That came after COIN expanded its staking offering with ETH at the start of August. From ETH staking alone, Lau thinks Coinbase (COIN) can generate $439M gross revenue and $68M net revenue, assuming ether&apos;s (ETH-USD) price of $2K, a staked ratio of 30%, a 4% yield and 15% market share for COIN. The world&apos;s largest altcoin by market cap, though, is changing hands at $1.54K at the time of writing. All in all, those &apos;numbers can increase meaningfully if ETH price goes up and with increased penetration of ETH and non-ETH staking.Similarly, J.P.

42422410,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0khnh,1662558581,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Now Below $19K as Merge-Fueled Ethereum Classic Hype Unwinds,"Price Point: Bitcoin approaches 2022 lows, sliding below $19K for the first time in months, as fears of hawkish Federal Reserve monetary policy continue to haunt traditional markets.  Market Moves: Even in a bear market, bitcoin’s share of the overall crypto market capitalization is shrinking.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading below the $19,000 threshold on Wednesday, down 6%, approaching this year’s lows. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value lost $1,000 in around four hours.  There was a mixed mood in markets. Futures tied to all three major U.S. stock indexes ticked up after two days of losses and European stocks were lower as the energy crisis prevailed in the region with skyrocketing natural gas prices.  Florian Giovannacci, head of trading at Covario AG, expects bitcoin’s weakness to continue in the mid to short term as he sees the energy crisis to be the leading topic for the next few months. “Right now it is really hard for investors to estimate the full impact on inflation and economic activity in general,” said Giovannacci in an interview with CoinDesk.  “A lot of uncertainty is creating a very risk-off sentiment, where the first assets to be hit are high risk assets such as crypto.”  According to data from CoinShares, bitcoin investment products saw redemptions totalling $11 million last week, representing a fourth consecutive week of outflows. However, short-bitcoin investment products saw a record $18 million inflows last week.  Ether (ETH), which had a considerably better day than bitcoin Tuesday, appeared to be making up the difference on Wednesday: It was trading down 10% over the last 24 hours.  ETC, the token for Ethereum Classic, seen as a possible destination after Ethereum’s Merge for crypto miners who want to stay on a proof-of-work blockchain, tumbled 17% over the past 24 hours. The move almost completely wiped out big gains notched earlier in the week.  In the news, senior executive departures from Pantera Capital, a major cryptocurrency hedge fund and venture capital investor with $4.7 billion in assets, are wider than previously reported, according to people familiar with the matter.  Curve Finance, a prominent stablecoin swap application is nearing the launch of its native stablecoin, dubbed crvUSD, as per the initial code released by its developers on Tuesday.

Bitcoin's dominance rate, or the leading cryptocurrency's share in the broader market, declined to 39.22% early Wednesday, the lowest since January 16, according to charting platform TradingView.  BTC's dominance could bounce, as pointed out by Scott Melker, popularly known as ""The Wolf Of All Streets."" The question is whether the impending rise in BTC's dominance will stem from a market-wide collapse or a continued ether outperformance.  ETH vs BTC reaches new high  The price ratio between ether and bitcoin - tickerized as ETHBTC – is currently trading at 0.0839, a new yearly high. Last year, ether traded above the current level versus bitcoin on nine occasions, emphasizing that ether is trading at rare highs versus bitcoin, according to Arcane Research. “This shows the strength of the Merge narrative in the market,” said Arcane.  Latest Headlines  Staked Ether Price Discount Widens to Most Since June Ahead of Ethereum Merge: The discount in Lido's staked ether is widening, perhaps due to holders switching to ETH ahead of the Merge.  Ether, ADA Lead Steep Crypto Slide Amid Dollar Strength: Some analysts said impending monetary tightening could add to a global rout across major asset classes such as equities and crypto.

42422404,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0khbh,1662555600,Crypto Lender Nexo Introduces Spot and Margin Trading Platform,"Cryptocurrency lender Nexo has introduced a trading platform that offers spot, futures and margin trading to retail clients, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.  The trading platform, named Nexo Pro, will aggregate liquidity from more than 10 trading venues and market makers to minimize order slippage, or the change in price that occurs between an order being placed and being executed. Slippage occurs when a market order is made into thin liquidity, which causes the average price to fluctuate.  Nexo has managed to survive this year's crypto winter, an achievement not shared by many of its lending rivals including Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, both of which filed for bankruptcy over the past few months following a dramatic slump in cryptocurrency prices.  Nexo's lending platform already featured a ""swap"" function that allowed users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another, but the decision to move into derivatives trading is a first for a yield-generating company like Nexo.  Trading platforms and exchanges are not a risk-free ventures, however. New York-based financial services firm Eqonex closed its exchange product last month, citing intense market competition, low margins and significant technology load. Coinbase (COIN) has also phased out its standalone Coinbase Pro product to integrate ""advanced trading"" into its retail app.  Nexo's co-founder and executive chairman, Kosta Kantchev, remains confident, describing Nexo Pro as ""a gateway to professional-like trading for retail customers"" in the statement.  ""We are the first platform to offer institutional-grade liquidity aggregation with this many venues as pure-play exchanges usually prefer to settle exclusively within their own order books,"" he said.

The mining rigs were purchased from hardware broker Cryptech Solutions for about $28 per terahash (Th), according to a Wednesday press release, versus the $96/Th marked on the manufacturer's website, on which they are sold out. Mining rig prices are often noted in dollars per terahash, a measure of computing power, instead of the machine price.  ""During the tail end of the bull market last year, we strategically focused on building infrastructure instead of following the then-industry trend of preordering equipment months in advance,” which has put CleanSpark in a position to buy rigs at discounts throughout the bear market, said CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford.  Indeed, the price of mining rigs has fallen by 40% in the past few months as struggling bitcoin miners are offloading their machines for cash.  It's the latest in a number of moves by CleanSpark to find spots for growth during the bear market. The company in June bought contracts for 1,800 machines, and in July acquired another 1,061 rigs.

Binance will start offering a 6% annual percentage yield (APY) to its U.S. customers for as low as 0.001 ETH ($1.51) staked, the exchange announced Wednesday.  Staking involves users locking up their digital assets to support the running of proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.  The Merge is the Ethereum's transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) network to PoS and is expected to take place around Sept. 13-15. The hope is that the transition away from the energy-intensive PoW mechanism will improve the efficiency and scalability of Ethereum and attract more mainstream adoption.  Binance first started offering staking to U.S. customers in June and now supports the tokens of blockchains Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT) and Polygon (MATIC), among several others. At the time, CEO of Binance.US Brian Shroder said the aim was to outdo the staking APYs offered by rivals such as Coinbase (COIN) and Gemini.  The timing of extending support to Ethereum suggests Binance.US sees ETH as a major staking battleground in the months ahead.

Despite surging inflation, war in Ukraine, concerns of a recession and volatile global currency moves, bitcoin is weakening relative to ether (ETH). The market cap ratio of the two tokens has dropped to around 1.9x, from as high as 20x in 2016, the report said.  “Even in a very harsh macro environment, where people need a store of value, bitcoin is still not holding up well,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  The growth of ether’s market cap, as well as that of stablecoins and alternate layer 1 blockchains, has meant that “bitcoin’s dominance is constantly declining in the overall crypto ecosystem,” the report said. A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain.  This supports the idea that cryptocurrencies have become “more of an innovation-driven, structural trend rather than a macroeconomic asset class,” the broker said.  Bernstein notes that bitcoin has failed to act as an inflation hedge in recent quarters, as the correlation with the stock market has increased in the post-COVID-19 era. Crypto “sits high on the risk-reward matrix,” and capital flows into cryptocurrencies grew when central banks loosened monetary policy and capital began chasing risk assets, it added.  Bitcoin will remain a macro-driven crypto asset, while the rest of crypto will be viewed as technology or innovation-driven digital assets. As BTC dominance in terms of total crypto market cap declines, the correlation between BTC and other tokens will also decrease, the note said.

According to a statement from the bank, the much-touted institutional-grade service enables its users to earn incentives on their Ether holdings monthly. Post-merge, it will implement variable lock-up periods. The Beacon Chain for Ethereum cannot accept any staked Ether until after a further network upgrade called Shanghai, which anticipates in the second quarter of 2023. Beacon Chain Merging With Its Mainnet One of the most eagerly awaited and essential breakthroughs in the project&apos;s history is the Beacon Chain merging with its Mainnet, which will occur around September 15. The event provides the foundation for switching to Proof-of-Stake, which seems to reduce energy consumption by more than 99% while increasing network scalability and security. With the switch to PoS, validators who stake Ether for the right to use the network will secure it rather than miners. There are currently about 422,000 validators operating globally, staking 13.5 million Ether, or about $20.5 billion at the current exchange rate. A validator will be activated by the bank on the user&apos;s behalf - who deposits more than 32 ETH (about $48,500) to SEBA.

42422416,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0khlh,1662551511,"Digital Euro to Focus on Personal Use, Not Web3, EU Officials Say","A retail digital euro will, in the first stage, only enable payments initiated by people, rather than allowing businesses to settle invoices, issue paychecks or be used in decentralized finance, European Union (EU) officials said Wednesday.  The bloc has not yet taken a decision on issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), or even whether it would use Bitcoin-style blockchain technology. But a bill to enable the digital alternative to banknotes and coins is due to be published early next year.  “We have singled out, for the first release of the digital euro, three use cases,” said Evelien Witlox, digital euro program manager at the European Central Bank, at an event hosted by the European Economic and Social Committee, a body that advises the EU government.  The three immediate applications will be peer-to-peer payments that enable transactions among family and friends; consumer-to-business payments in physical or online stores; and payments to or by governments, she said.  Other potential uses of the CBDC – including the payment of wages, settlements among businesses, payments initiated automatically by machine and the functionality required to support decentralized finance – could still be considered in a later phase, Witlox said.  “Whether or not blockchain will be used as a technology is currently not in the investigation phase,” she said, adding that officials would first consider the requirements of the system to be secure and have sufficient throughput. “Technology should not drive the functionality.”  Officials at the central bank still have to decide where they stand on issues like how transactions with a digital euro will be settled and intermediaries be compensated before finalizing the start of development in September 2023, Witlox said.  Read more: Major Banks Urge Caution With European Union's CBDC Plans  Officials at the European Commission, which is responsible for proposing the draft laws that could underpin a digital euro, want the CBDC to be future-proof and able to fit with Web3 – but appear to agree there’s no rush to do so.  “A digital euro needs to meet new payment needs. … we need to also be open and adjust and cater for those [Web3] users,” said Jan Ceyssens, head of the digital finance unit at the commission, at the same event.  While decentralized finance applications “are more trends which may be expected to take room in the future … they are not the reality today,” Ceyssens said.  Yet the industry has warned the ECB’s step-by-step approach could jeopardize the whole plan. Some earlier CBDC projects fell through when they didn’t improve the status quo in which people can easily pay via cash and card, said Jonas Gross, chairman of the Digital Euro Association, a think tank specializing in CBDCs and other forms of digital money.  “A digital euro needs to have clear advantages and use cases,” Gross, whose organization is supported by companies such as Ripple and Circle, said during the same event. ""It’s not sufficient from my perspective to say it’s used for peer-to-peer payments [or] for e-commerce payments ... it has to do something better than currently existing payment methods.""  Figures published by the International Monetary Fund last week suggest that about 97 countries are researching, testing or deploying a CBDC.

42422392,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0khNh,1662549993,Staked Ether Price Discount Widens to Most Since June Ahead of Ethereum Merge,"As Ethereum nears the Merge, the long-awaited technological change in the way it processes transactions, traders are deploying strategies to profit from the event, and their actions are injecting volatility into related markets.  In one such case, the discount between the price of liquid-staking protocol Lido's staked ether (stETH) and the price of ether (ETH) widened to 4.5% (or 0.954 ETH), the most since late June, according to data from Dune Analytics.  The discount partly stems from investors' concerns of missing the opportunity to gain a potential Ethereum forked token, ETHPOW, according to CK Cheung, an investment analyst at Defiance Capital.  Traders position for forked ETHPOW  While most of the Ethereum community favors switching to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism for validating transactions, some miners are looking to preserve the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. If they succeed, the chain will fork, splitting into PoS and PoW chains at the time of the Merge, scheduled for Sept. 13-15.  The latter would have ETHPOW as a native token, and ETH holders stand to receive it for free. Traders holding derivatives tied to ether or other ether-related tokens like stETH won't receive it.  That may have prompted stETH holders to sell their tokens in exchange for ether to position for a potential ETHPOW airdrop, or distribution. Each stETH token represents one staked ETH token and can be redeemed for ETH at some point after the Merge. However, stETH holders can swap their tokens for ETH on a decentralized exchange like Curve.  StETH may come under pressure as ""regular holders switch to ETH to gain upside on ETHPoW work,"" research firm Block Analitica wrote in its Aave risk mitigation plan published last month.  Aave recently closed the door for traders looking to borrow ETH ahead of the Merge on concerns the increased borrowing demand for ether would expose the decentralized lending and borrowing platform to liquidity issues.  That decision spurred bankrupt Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital to remove $33 million worth of staked ether (stETH) from Curve's stETH/ETH pool, according to Adam Cochran, the founder of crypto fund Cinneamhain Ventures.  Uncertainty drives demand  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said the lack of clarity on what happens after the Merge could also be driving stETH holders to switch to ETH.  The Ethereum Merge ""may introduce additional uncertainty and risk, so holding ETH would be more appropriate than stETH. In addition, stETH is still in the pledge process and has not been unlocked,"" Ardern told CoinDesk.  ""In a downward bear market, It is better to hold a spot [ether] than to hold a bond of the same face value,"" he said.  Read more: The Final Countdown to the Ethereum Merge Has Officially Begun  The May-June market pool showed that an imbalance stETH/ETH liquidity pool on Curve can complicate the exit for the stETH holders. At press time, the pool has reserves of 1,57,361.03 (22.94%) of ether and 5,28,460.73 (77.06%) of stETH.  A spokesperson for Lido told CoinDesk: “The stETH/ETH exchange rate fluctuation comes from a larger than normal movement of liquidity associated with the Merge, with users positioning themselves according to different strategies. It is to be expected with this event and can also be observed in the volatility of other liquid staking derivative prices.”  StETH is not supposed to maintain a 1:1 ETH peg in the way stablecoins should with their external reference.

42393794,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpB0Db,1662548400,Ethereum Merge: What You Need to Know,"We’ve spent the past several weeks of this newsletter wading into deep technical and philosophical debates around future of Ethereum – with topics ranging from maximal extractable value (MEV), to the threat of censorship on Ethereum, to what makes a ‘true’ zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, or zkEVM.  But now, at long last, the Ethereum Merge is finally around the corner. This week, I’d like to take a step back and quickly address a few of the myths and misconceptions that have popped up surrounding the Merge, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake scheduled for around Sept. 15.  I’d also like to request input from the Valid Points Community. If you have any questions that are not answered in the FAQ – no matter how technical – please send them to sam.kessler@coindesk.com.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  What is the Merge?  The Merge represents the Ethereum network’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS), its new system (also called a “consensus mechanism”) for authenticating crypto transactions. The new system will replace proof-of-work (PoW), the more power-hungry mechanism pioneered by Bitcoin.  Why is it called the Merge?  Ethereum already has a PoS network called the Beacon Chain (introduced in 2020), but it is not yet used for processing transactions. For now, it’s essentially just a staging area for computers operating the Ethereum network to prepare for the PoS upgrade.  Ethereum’s full transition to PoS requires merging the Beacon Chain (called the “Consensus” layer) with Ethereum’s PoW mainnet (the “Execution” layer).  How does proof-of-stake (PoS) differ from proof-of-work (PoW)?  Proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW) differ in how they decide who has the right to record the next “block” of transactions on the network.  In today’s PoW system, Ethereum miners compete to publish blocks by racing to solve cryptographic puzzles, much like in Bitcoin.  In the upcoming PoS system, validators that stake (lock up) at least 32 ether (~$50,000) with the network are randomly selected to create blocks. The more ether one stakes, the more likely one is to be selected.  In both systems, the miner/validator that wins a block is rewarded with a mix of transaction fees and newly minted ether (ETH). PoS validators also receive rewards for doing other activities to help secure the network.  Read more: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?  Will Ethereum fees decrease after the Merge?  No.  Ethereum transaction fees are not expected to change as a result of the Merge. Future network updates, like danksharding and proto-danksharding, may help to address Ethereum's high network fees, but these updates are not expected until 2023 at the earliest.  The main salve for Ethereum’s transaction fee woes remains rollups – third-party networks like Arbitrum and Optimism that bundle transactions and process them separately from Ethereum’s mainnet.  Read more: Scaling Ethereum Beyond the Merge: Danksharding  Will Ethereum transaction speeds increase after the Merge?  Yes, but barely.  On average, Ethereum blocks are issued once every 13 or 14 seconds in today’s proof-of-work (PoW) system. After the merge, proof-of-stake (PoS) blocks will be issued in regular 12-second intervals. This is not an improvement that most users will notice, and it still places Ethereum behind rival blockchain networks like Solana and Avalanche (though well ahead of Bitcoin, where a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average).  Just like with transaction fees, those looking for improved transaction speeds will need to look to Ethereum’s third-party rollups.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  Will the Merge increase the price of ether (ETH)?  It’s hard to say.  With so many variables and unknowns, it is impossible to predict what will happen to Ethereum’s token price as a result of the Merge.  The Ethereum community has for years positioned the Merge as a massive upgrade to the network’s core technology. Along with addressing concerns about the network’s environmental impact, PoS will introduce a new form of utility for Ethereum’s native ether (ETH) token in the form of staking.  But the Merge is not guaranteed to boost the ETH price. The Merge will also introduce changes to the rate at which ether is issued and how it is distributed. These changes could be positive or negative depending upon whom you ask. There is also a risk (however small) that the Merge will fail, or that PoS will prove less secure than PoW.  There is also speculation the Merge has already been priced in by the market.  Read more: Is Ethereum's Merge Priced-In?  Is proof-of-stake better than proof-of-work?  There are trade-offs.  According to the Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit that funds Ethereum ecosystem development, PoS will cut Ethereum’s energy usage by around 99.95%. PoS advocates also argue that PoW mining centralizes control in the hands of those who can afford to buy fancy crypto mining rigs, called ASICs. They say PoS – which hands network control to those who “stake” crypto with the network – makes attacks economically infeasible and self-defeating.  PoW proponents counter that PoS staking carries its own centralization and security risks, making it possible for malicious actors to directly “buy” control of the network. They also point out that PoS is a less battle-tested system than PoW, which has proven resilient as the backbone of the two largest blockchain networks.  When is the Merge happening?  Around Sept. 15, 2022.  Why no hard date? Each block on Ethereum’s PoW network carries a difficulty number representing how hard miners must work to add it to the network. Instead of kicking in at a specific date, the Merge is scheduled to take effect once the cumulative difficulty of all mined Ethereum blocks hits a certain number – the “total terminal difficulty” (TTD).  In August, Ethereum’s core developers set the TTD at 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000, which will be reached sometime around Sept. 14 or 15. We only have an estimate because block difficulty and issuance rate vary over time.  Can I become an Ethereum validator or staker?  Yes, if you have some ETH.  It is already possible to “stake” 32 ether and earn rewards for validating Ethereum’s PoS Beacon Chain. Staked ether will accrue network rewards, but it will be impossible to withdraw until an update expected around six to 12 months after the Merge.  Staking requires some know-how; if you screw up or go offline, your stake can be “slashed” (ie, reduced).  Those with less blockchain expertise can stake via centralized services like those offered by Coinbase (COIN) or Kraken. In addition to handling the technical nitty-gritty, these services – in exchange for a cut of users’ rewards – open up staking to those with less than 32 ETH.  Also popular for those with less than 32 ETH are liquid staking pools like Lido and Rocket Pool. When users stake via these services, they are handed “staked ETH” tokens which trade at a slight discount to regular ETH.  Read more: Top Questions on Ethereum Proof-of-Stake and Ether Staking  What will happen to staked ether after the Merge?  Staked ether will stay locked up with the network until around six to 12 months after the Merge.  At that point, those who have staked ether themselves will be able to withdraw their stake, along with whatever rewards it has accrued.  Those who stake via centralized staking services or pools will need to keep an eye out for announcements on how withdrawals will be handled.  Will Ethereum users or ETH holders need to take any action after the Merge?  No.  If you hold ether (ETH) today, you won’t need to claim new “PoS ETH” or “ETH2” tokens. Your balance will remain exactly the same after the Merge, and you’ll be able to resume using the network as if nothing has changed.  While Ethereum users will not need to take any action come the Merge, Ethereum software providers and node operators (the computers that operate the Ethereum network) will need to update their software to ensure they are communicating with the latest version of the network.  What’s all this noise about PoW “forks”? Will I receive free money if I hold ETH?  Some Ethereum miners, reluctant to let go of the network’s old consensus mechanism, have announced plans to “fork,” or form a splinter network from Etheruem’s PoW chain. From what we can tell so far, these miners intend to just clone the main blockchain – balances and all – and continue operating their own PoW versions of Ethereum post-Merge.  If you hold ETH before the Merge, you may automatically receive a balance of tokens on these new PoW forks. The process of claiming these tokens will differ depending on the chain. If you hold ETH on a centralized exchange like Coinbase, the exchange will need to list forked tokens in order for you to claim your share (and it’s not at all clear if they will).  But buyers beware. Some forked ether tokens might have value immediately following the Merge, but leaders in the Ethereum community warn that PoW Ethereum forks will just be thinly-veiled cash grabs.  Read more: Ethereum Proof-of-Work Forks: Gift or Grift?  Can the Merge fail?  Yes, but it’s unlikely.  Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake will mark the first experiment of its kind. If the Merge succeeds, it will represent a massive feat of engineering and human coordination. If it fails, it risks wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in value (ether’s market cap is close to $200 billion, and many other valuable tokens are built on top of the network).  The Merge is only now moving forward because its core developers and other stakeholders have run through over a dozen successful tests and Merge simulations (see: shadow forks and testnet Merges). There’s still a chance that the Merge might fail, but such an outcome seems extremely unlikely.  Read more: Merge Testing on Ethereum: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?  Will the Ethereum network “pause” as a result of the Merge?  No.  The Merge will happen instantaneously after the final PoW block is mined. From that point forward, the network will continue to operate with the issuance of the first PoS block.  Ethereum users will not need to take any action to upgrade to the PoS chain.  What’s on the Ethereum roadmap after the Merge?  After the Merge, Ethereum’s core developers will continue working on the open-source network as they did before, with improvements to network fees, speeds and security slated for the months and years ahead.  One focus for developers post-Merge will be sharding, which aims to expand Ethereum’s transaction throughput and decrease its fees by spreading network activity across several “shards” – almost like lanes on a highway. (Updates of this sort were initially slated to accompany the Merge – originally called “Ethereum 2.0,” or “ETH2” – but were deprioritized with the success of third-party rollups at addressing some of the same problems).  Also on the roadmap is enshrined proposer builder separation (PBS), which will separate the “builders” that add transactions to blocks from the “proposers” who put them forward for approval from the wider network. PBS is pitched as a way to help tackle Ethereum’s maximal extractable value (MEV) problem.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  What happens to proof-of-work miners after the Merge?  After the Merge, Ethereum miners – many of whom have invested in fancy mining-optimized computers – will be unable to mine new blocks on the network. Many miners will abandon mining and “stake” ether to earn rewards on the PoS network.  For those who wish to put their mining hardware to continued use, they’ll need to move to another proof-of-work network, like Ethereum Classic.  After the Ethereum Merge, some miners also plan to create a “forked” version of the proof-of-work blockchain – basically, a clone of the blockchain that still runs using the old miner-friendly system. It is unclear whether these chains will gain enough traction to become lucrative for miners in the long term.

WHY IT MATTERS: Activated on Tuesday, the Bellatrix upgrade is the network’s final “hard fork” before the Merge. The activation of the Bellatrix upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain triggers the beginning of the Merge, which will likely be completed sometime around Sept. 13-16. It prepares Ethereum’s proof-of-stake Beacon Chain – also called its Consensus layer – for a Merge with Ethereum’s mainnet Execution layer.Read more here.  Aave stopped loaning ETH ahead of the Merge.  WHY IT MATTERS: Between Aug. 30 and Sept. 2, the Aave community overwhelmingly voted to stop loaning ether, setting aside democratized finance’s free market principle to mitigate protocol-wide risks that may arise from crypto traders betting on the Merge, Ethereum blockchain’s upcoming technological overhaul. “Ahead of the Ethereum Merge, the Aave protocol faces the risk of high utilization in the ETH market. Temporarily pausing ETH borrowing will mitigate this risk of high utilization,” the proposal highlighted by research firm Block Analitica said.Read more here.

According to an official release, the SEC is collecting transactional information from Zipmex after the exchange halted withdrawals in July.  Zipmex and Akalarp didn't meet a deadline for delivering the information, prompting the SEC's action, the regulator said.  The Singapore-based exchange was one of several crypto companies that fell victim to an industrywide downturn induced by bad debts and high leverages. Zipmex loaned $48 million to Babel Finance and $5 million to Celsius Network, both of which failed to repay their loans. Last month Singapore's High Court granted Zipmex protection from creditors until Dec. 2.  ""Zipmex is currently in the process of compiling relevant documents that belong to both Zipmex itself and Zipmex Pte. Ltd., an entity which is not under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Thai SEC,"" a Zipmex spokesperson said an official response shared with CoinDesk. Zipmex Pte.

Given that many Ether miners are anticipated to continue mining on a forked PoW chain, or potentially even numerous chains, after the much-awaited Merge, the topic has gained steam over the past month or two. The comparable quantities of the new tokens would be airdropped to on-chain ETH holders who are using non-custodial wallets or holding on to exchanges that allow ETHPoW in the event of a fork. Votes Of Aave Governing Community The Aave governing community voted decisively in support of stopping ETH lending &apos;in the interim time leading up to the Merge&apos; on September 6. This suggestion first came up on August 24 due to the surge in demand for Aave ETH loans reaching levels that were beginning to exert pressure on the liquidity supply. The proposal states that if these holdings begin to lose money, users would probably hurry to unwind their holdings until the ETH borrow rate reverts to a steady level where the APY (Annual Percentage Yield) becomes acceptable. As a result, the liquidity supply of ETH on Aave would be put under substantial strain. The plan was implemented on the same day as the vote and yielded 77.87% in favor (528,290 voters) and 22.13% against (150,170 voters).

Ether (ETH) and Cardano's ADA have both dropped almost 9% in the past 24 hours, giving up a week's worth of gains to become the biggest decliners among major cryptocurrencies. Ether's slide came despite the activation of the Bellatrix upgrade – the Ethereum network's final ""hard fork"" before the Merge – on Tuesday.  Bitcoin (BTC) fell 5.5%, trading under $18,900 in early European hours. BNB and Solana’s SOL fell 5%; XRP dropped 4% and Polkadot’s DOT lost 7%. Futures tracking major tokens racked up $327 million in liquidations, while the total cryptocurrency market capitalization slid below $1 trillion for the first time since July.  Losses on meme coins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) averaged 6%. Outside of the majors, Ethereum Classic’s ETC fell some 16% after a double-digit rally on Tuesday, with Terra’s old luna classic (LUNC) tokens seeing a 20% slide after more than doubling over the past week.  Concerns about aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve monetary tightening were heightened when the dollar climbed overnight, hitting a 24-year high against the Japanese yen and setting a lifetime peak against the Indian rupee. The S&P 500 lost 0.4% and the Nasdaq 100 0.7% on Tuesday as tech stocks slid.  In a note Wednesday, analysts at Arcane Research warned of increased volatility in the coming days after the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for August is released on Sept. 13. Also, the European Central Bank will make its interest rate decision on Thursday. The ECB is forecast to hike rates by 75 basis points. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.  “These macro events, combined with the Merge, might be catalysts for going forward,” the analysts said, adding traders remained bullish on ether ahead of the Ethereum blockchain's Merge event.  As for bitcoin, the Fed’s expected tightening presented a “bad outlook,” according to Chris Esparza, founder of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Vault Finance.  “Tightening generally reduces the printing of cash to prop up the economy as we had in the COVID-19 pandemic years,” Esparza said. Bitcoin investors must focus on the fundamentals of the asset instead of relying on macroeconomic market gauges, he told CoinDesk.  “With countries formulating functional regulations to guide the nascent ecosystem, the level of adoption is bound to grow in the long term, creating a positive stance for investors to stack up now.""

2347877,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=501348,1662535715,Bear Markets Are The Greatest Buying Opportunities. Here’s why,"Crypto analysts and researchers explain the bear market as a period in which supply exceeds demand, morale falls, and prices decrease. As such, a bear market is a market that has experienced consistent or significant falls. A bear market is defined as any stock index or specific stock that has declined by at least twenty percent from its most recent high. As depicted here, &apos;consistent falls&apos; or declines refer to lengthy durations of downward oscillations. Ideally, markets are volatile on a daily (or even moment-to-moment) basis. Various factors can cause bearish markets, including weak or lagging economies, geopolitical crises, wars, and pandemics. Meanwhile, low employment, which can result from significant economic paradigm shifts, low discretionary income and low productivity, are all manifestations of a weak or deteriorating economy. Aside from a 20% drop in stock prices, the bear market condition is where investors frequently feel worried and depressed, and the country&apos;s economic outlook is not always favorable. It is, however, important to note that, while a bear market may indicate a decline in stock prices and possibly a failing economy, it is also an ideal time for new investors to enter the market and start building their portfolios. From analysis and predictions, coins are expected to have a bumpy ride ahead, implying that it will be some time before they pay off.

If approved, the proposal would give Maker a $528 million USDC annual dividend of 1.5 percent. Maker&apos;s $1.6 Billion Peg Stability Module (PSM) After the Covid crash in 2020, when the protocol saw the peg move above $1, Maker&apos;s PSM was developed to hard-peg the price of DAI to $1. Because ETH fell by more than 40% during the meltdown, there was an increase in demand to pay off debt liquidations. Although PSM has been successful in keeping DAI&apos;s peg, one of the critical problems mentioned on the forum by adcv, a member of Maker&apos;s strategic finance core team, is Maker&apos;s capacity to invest its balance sheet properly. Adcv wrote, Maker&apos;s current PSM asset allocation is &apos;highly underinvested,&apos; which &apos;reduces the protocol&apos;s ability to take the risk and its attractiveness as a stablecoin,&apos; USDC Using Coinbase Prime If the proposal is approved, Maker can freely mint, burn, withdraw, and settle its assigned USDC using Coinbase Prime and pay no custody costs on its PSM allotment to Coinbase.

42422400,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0khXh,1662535170,DeFi Platform Curve Finance Takes First Steps Toward crvUSD Stablecoin,"Prominent stablecoin swap application Curve Finance is nearing the launch of its native stablecoin, dubbed crvUSD, as per the initial code released by its developers on Tuesday.  The code library will act as an interface to the yet-undeployed crvUSD smart contracts and mark the first step toward the eventual issuance of the much-anticipated tokens.  Details on the usage of crvUSD were scarce at writing time, and Curve developers declined to share more information about the tokens with CoinDesk.  Curve uses smart contracts to offer an efficient way to exchange stablecoins while maintaining low fees and low slippage, according to developer documents. Depositors on Curve earn annual yields of up to 4% from one of the many pools on the platform, which locks over $5 billion worth of Ethereum-based tokens on its platform.  Curve tokens (CRV) are issued as yield farming rewards to liquidity providers on Curve Finance, and can be converted into vote-escrowed CRV (veCRV). Holding veCRV allows users to participate in platform governance, earn higher rewards and fees and receive airdrops.  Curve’s plans to deploy a dollar-pegged asset first became public in June. The stablecoin was confirmed by founder Michael Egorov last month, who said it was “possible” that crvUSD would be issued in September.  Meanwhile, some market observers have weighed in on the impact of crvUSD in the broader crypto ecosystem once it is issued.  “The crvUSD could be a very interesting development, as we haven’t yet seen a stablecoin that is issued by a major DEX,” (decentralized exchange) Daniel Zlotin, senior DeFi developer at Orbs, wrote in a Telegram message.  “Connecting a stablecoin with a viable [decentralized finance] platform could open up some interesting possibilities in terms of new models (such as using LP tokens as part of the backing system),” Zlotin added, cautioning that there would “definitely be some challenges” in implementing such a concept.  Others said Curve’s native stablecoin would help make the platform even more liquid, ensuring long-term sustainability.  “The approach that Curve chose will potentially make the liquidity more sustainable,” said Alex Pipushev, founder of GTON Capital, in a Telegram message. “That’s a good experiment in pursuit of more reliable stablecoin models.""

Bitcoin Plunges Below $19K; Ether Falls as Well  By James Rubin  After cruising along at just under $20,000 for much of the past four days, bitcoin took a late Tuesday plunge below $19,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $19,850, down more than 6% over the previous 24 hours, as investors burrowed more deeply into risk-off mode. The decline followed the release of the Institute of Supply Management's (ISM) monthly services index showing an unexpected increase in activity among the 15 industries measured in the report. The August ISM underlined the likelihood of further steep interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve to slow the resilient economy as it seeks to tame inflation.  ""The September swoon is in play as a resilient economy paves the way for more Fed tightening,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email.  Moya added: ""The retail trader is starting to panic again as meme stocks and cryptos fall under pressure. Bitcoin is breaking below the key technical levels.""  After surging early Tuesday and outperforming bitcoin, ether also plummeted. The second-largest crypto by market value was recently trading near $1,530, off roughly 8% as ETH excitement over the Merge, the change of protocol from proof-of-work to more energy efficient proof-of-stake lessened.  Other major cryptos were solidly red after promising beginnings on the first work day following the long U.S. Labor Day holiday weekend. ETC's price, whichhad risen 28% early Tuesday over the previous 24 hours to trade at $41, was more recently down 14% and changing hands below $35. UNI was off almost 16%.  Equity markets also closed down, albeit less dramatically, with the tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all down by a few fractions of a percentage point. ""Stocks are going to struggle because too much of the economy is doing well and that leaves Wall Street vulnerable to an extended period of rising interest rates,"" Moya wrote.  Moya noted bitcoin's continued correlation with tech stocks, and he called ""the surge with Treasury yields, which rose to nearly 3.5% – their second-highest level of 2022 – ""a troubling sign.""  ""Many are starting to doubt that the peak in yields is in place and that could spell trouble for bitcoin,"" he wrote. ""Bitcoin selling pressure will next eye the summer lows just ahead of the $17,500 level.""  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

But that’s a surface-level analysis.  The reality is not quite that. Binance will still support other stablecoins. It will allow the deposit and withdrawal of USDC, TUSD and others (just not tether). What the exchange is hoping to accomplish is having one big pool for USD stablecoins to be used for trading – powered by Binance’s USD stablecoin – similar to how FTX pools all stablecoins together under a generic USD and stablecoins category.  “Removing most stablecoin pairs is a good thing. Liquidity doesn’t have to be split between multiple stablecoins, making market makers’ jobs easier and markets overall more liquid,” Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of Wintermute, a market maker for digital assets, tweeted.  Gaevoy highlighted that this change actually makes transactions more seamless and frictionless. Binance’s margined products were all denominated in BUSD anyway so there was a conversion required.  “Now you can skip the conversion step both ways (for BUSD margined products). It’s a better customer journey all while keeping USDC useful (I’d even argue more useful),” he tweeted.  But why isn’t tether (USDT) included in this list of stablecoin products Binance will convert to BUSD?  Gaevoy thinks it's because U.S. regulators hate tether, meaning that Silvergate and Signature, two large crypto-friendly banks in the U.S., won’t touch it.  All this is similar to how FTX treats tether. USDT is viewed as an asset being 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, but not a stablecoin.  Burak Tamac, senior researcher at CryptoQuant, has a slightly different view. This move by the exchange is all a play by Binance to absorb the liquidity of USDC in order to undermine USDT.  “According to our recent research on stablecoin efficacy, USDT and BUSD have been the top contender for market velocity,” he told CoinDesk, while pointing out that USDC’s one-year velocity is 0.08 compared to USDT’s 0.83 and BUSD’s 0.33.  “Since USDC does not seem competitive with BUSD, I believe Binance aims to absorb USDC’s liquidity to undermine USDT in the long run,” he continued. “BUSD’s issuer Paxos is under the New York Department of Financial Services regulatory umbrella. Regulatory clarity and a higher Peg-Robustness score will give BUSD a better ground to compete with USDT.”  Behind the scenes  Nansen analyst Martin Lee wrote in a note to CoinDesk that Binance has “massively reduced its holdings from the middle of August, while most exchanges typically range sideways.”  Data shows that Binance reduced its holdings of USDC from 2.2 billion USDC on Aug. 14 to one billion USDC on Aug. 22.  The most notable transaction is a transfer of 1.78 billion USDC from a Binance peg wallet to a Binance deposit wallet, Lee wrote. It's significant, he believes, because the Binance peg wallet contains tokens that are wrapped and pegged by Binance on a 1:1 ratio to the corresponding native token.  Binance’s intent  The core question remains what Binance’s intention was in removing USDC and other stablecoins as a trading pair.  On the one hand, the fact that the exchange is removing, behind the scenes, USDC as one of its pegs would suggest that it might be a grander play to delete the stablecoin from history after it gets absorbed. After all, one of the functions of stablecoins, aside from their use in trading pairs, is to provide the dollar stability that their name endows.  And if Binance is attempting to remove USDC’s functionality as one of the important pegs for other tokens, then it just might have more sinister plans for the stablecoin market to solidify BUSD’s lead.  But on-chain data doesn’t always paint the full picture. This could all just be a harmless reshuffling of assets.

For those skeptical of the crypto space due to volatility, stablecoins become handy as their sailing means.

Also, some come pegged to tangible assets and cash that facilitate their stability.
