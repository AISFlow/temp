42381683,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nrxV,1551740407,Bitcoin's MACD Prints Strongest Bull Signal In Over a Year,"The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) has become the latest charting indicator to signal bitcoin may soon see a trend reversal that could put an end to its months-long price decline.  As reported, the money flow index (MFI), an indicator used to identify buy and sell pressure, created a divergence Sunday widely considered to be an early sign of a bearish-to-bullish trend change, while last week, bitcoin saw a bearish crossover of its 50- and 100-week moving averages, a first since 2015.  As such, the MACD became the latest in a series of indicators, that when applied to bitcoin point to seller exhaustion and a potential trend reversal as of Monday.  The MACD, by definition, turns two trend-following moving averages into a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer-term moving average from the shorter-term moving average.  The price trend is considered to have turned bullish when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, the 9-period exponential moving average of the MACD line, at which point the histogram rises above the zero line. The higher the histogram, the father apart the MACD and signal line are, indicating stronger momentum.  As can be seen in the chart below, both bullish indications have indeed taken place.  BTC/USD Weekly Chart  Bitcoin's MACD line and signal line completed a bullish cross in early February suggesting a reversal to the predominant downtrend may be in order. Since then, the histogram, representing the space between the two lines, has gradually increased to where it stands now at 102.38 - its highest value since January of 2018.  Further, the histogram failing to set lower lows during its plunge from $6,000 to roughly $3,000 is another form of bullish divergence that points to weakening bearish momentum.  It's worth noting the MACD did make a bullish cross accompanied by a positive histogram value in September of last year before the fall to $3,000, but the lack of separation between the MACD and signal line was evident and an indication the crossover was weak or invalid.  This time around, the follow-through after the crossover is much more substantial.  BTC/USD Weekly MACD 2015  It can be seen in bitcoin's weekly price chart from 2015 that the strong bullish MACD crossover accompanied by rising, positive histogram values indeed confirmed the cryptocurrency's price bottom had been set. What's more, bullish divergence within the histogram was evident before the positive cross of the MACD and signal line, similar to how it is in bitcoin's current MACD readings.  While indications of bitcoin's price having bottomed out continue to emerge, caution is still the name of the game, so a break to new price lows backed by high sell volume would invalidate the bullish MACD signals.

42381668,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nruz,1551734141,Bitcoin Coders Send International Lightning Payment Over Ham Radio,"In what appears to be a first-of-its-kind transaction, two developers working in separate countries have successfully sent a bitcoin lightning payment over radio waves.  Organized over Twitter this past weekend, the transaction was sent by Rodolfo Novak, co-founder of bitcoin hardware startup CoinKite, to developer and Bloomberg columnist Elaine Ou. The completed payment effectively moved real bitcoin from Toronto, Canada, to San Francisco, California.  While radio technology is most commonly used for broadcasting music or talk radio, it's actually capable of much more than that. As the two developers showcased, radio can also be used to boost the resilience of the bitcoin network.  “Bitcoin is making ham radio cool again!” Ou tweeted after sending the transaction to Novak, referencing ""ham radio,"" the use of radio by hobbyists who fiddle with radio technology.  But sending bitcoin over radio isn’t just fun. Some researchers argue it actually has a necessary use case.  In fact, the idea itself is the brainchild of Nick Szabo, inventor of the smart contract. Ou and Szabo presented the idea in 2017 at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in San Francisco, arguing at the time that it could help bitcoin build resistance to partition attacks researchers argue could potentially be used to attack the network.  The idea is that, while the internet can potentially be censored, it’s not the only form of technology that can be used to send data from one part of the world to another, ""in case China decides to censor bitcoin via the Great Firewall, or places like North Korea where there is no internet at all,"" as Ou put it in an email to CoinDesk.  Technology infrastructure startup Blockstream licensed satellites that beam bitcoin to users around the world for similar reasons. Still, there are limits to the concept.  ""It was a fun demo, but obviously unrealistic because we coordinated everything online before sending the radio signals,"" Ou acknowledged.  She continued:  ""The equipment is currently the hard part: You need a radio that supports these frequencies. The cheapest way is with a software-defined radio, which is about $200 for something that can transmit low-power signals, or thousands for a high-power transmitter.""

The deal, announced in October, is now officially completed after Circle obtained approval from the self-regulatory organization FINRA, the company's co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire announced Monday in a blog post.  ""The acquisition is a further step toward realizing our vision of a more open, global, connected, and inclusive financial system,"" they wrote. ""Today [SeedInvest] are at the forefront of enabling startups to raise capital directly from investors over the internet — creating new capital formation options for startups and growth companies, and giving average retail investors the opportunity to invest directly into innovative private companies.""  Although in the near term, it'll be business as usual at SeedInvest, over time ""we will also explore future opportunities enabled by tokenization,"" Neville and Allaire wrote, explaining:  We believe that the tokenization of financial assets will ultimately unlock capital for growing companies and investment opportunities for people everywhere. Over time, more functions of private equity will be tokenized — including voting and governance, dividend payouts, and other economic features. Tokenization will also create new opportunities for businesses to build better relationships with their customers by leveraging tokens linked to ecosystem behaviors.  Dry powder  Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The entire SeedInvest team joined Circle, including the two co-founders, chief executive officer Ryan M. Feit and chief operating officer James Han. They also published a joint post on SeedInvest's webpage, emphasizing that after the acquisition, the company will keep working as usual, ""focused on democratizing startup investing, just with greater resources.""  Those resources would include the $250 million Circle is reportedly seeking to raise, on top of the $246 million it has cumulatively raised from investors like Goldman Sachs, IDG Capital, Accel, CICC, General Catalyst, Bitmain and Jim Breyer.  ""We are confident that we can achieve significantly more and at a higher velocity with Circle,"" SeedInvest's co-founders wrote.  SeedInvest was founded in 2012 by Han and Feit, alumni of Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers, to help smaller U.S. companies raise capital. Over the seven years of its existence, the company led more than 220 fundraising campaigns with an average investment of $500,000, according to SeedInvest. The company was featured last year in Inc. Magazine's 5,000 fastest-growing private companies in the U.S., placed in the 117th position.

42381655,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nred,1551718871,Tether to Launch New Version of USDT Stablecoin on Tron Blockchain,"Tether is gearing up to launch its controversial stablecoin as a native token on the Tron blockchain.  For the effort, Tether is partnering with the Tron Foundation to launch the dollar-pegged USDT stablecoin as a TRC-20 token, the companies announced Monday. TRC-20 is a technical standard used by the Tron blockchain for implementing tokens, similar to and compatible with ethereum's ERC-20 standard.  The addition would allow users to more easily transact with decentralized applications (dapps) and protocols based on the Tron blockchain, the firms said. Specifically, they hope to improve decentralized exchange liquidity and make Tron more accessible to institutional investors by providing the stablecoin option to the network.  Tether already exists as a stablecoin built on the bitcoin and ether blockchains.  In a statement, Tether CEO Jean-Louis van der Velde praised the partnership, saying:  ""This integration underlines our commitment to furthering innovation within the cryptocurrency space as we continue to anticipate the needs and demands of the digital asset community.""  The new version of USDT is expected to launch sometime in the next quarter.  Tether is the world's most popular stablecoin (and is a top-10 cryptocurrency by market value, according to CoinMarketCap). However, questions have long existed about whether the cryptocurrency is actually backed by U.S. dollars at a 1:1 ratio.  While the company has promised to hire an auditor to verify its holdings, it has yet to do so after parting ways with Friedman LLP last January.  Bahamas-based Deltec Bank & Trust, which provides banking services to the company, did release a letter verifying that Tether had an account and maintained assets worth $1.8 billion at the time (total USDT tokens in circulation add up to a little over $2 billion at press time).  Asked if Tron had any concerns about these questions, a representative referred CoinDesk to a Bloomberg report which suggested the company had sufficient holdings to back the total number of USDT tokens in circulation, at least for a four-month period.  Tron CEO Justin Sun said in the announcement that the ""collaboration with Tether to bring a USDT TRC-20 token to TRON will bring incredible stability and confidence to users.""  These users will be able to ""easily redeem their tokens for U.S. dollars,"" he added.

42381667,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nrwF,1551718821,Bitcoin Betting Game Hxro to Add Thousands of Waitlisted Users,"The team behind buzzy bitcoin trading game Hxro is about to open its app to thousands more players, with 35,000 emails on a waiting list of 115,000 to be whitelisted today.  For those who haven't caught up on crypto's latest gaming craze, Hxro (pronounced ""hero"") gamifies crypto trading with its own token, HXRO. The team behind it seeks ways to take normal trading behavior and amp up the excitement, with real money at stake. For now, there's just one game on the site: betting on whether BTC's price will go up (MOON) or down (REKT) over a five-minute interval.  There's a new card every five minutes into perpetuity, and it doesn't matter how much or how little the price goes up or down. If BTC is one penny lower at the end of the interval, everyone on the REKT side shares the HXRO placed on the MOON side.  Dan Gunsberg, CEO of Hxro, the startup behind the game, told CoinDesk:  ""We are really intersecting trading and skilled- and social-gaming. And that's really uncharted territory.""  The company was founded by partners with prior experience in trading and gambling. Gunsberg has 20 years experience, primarily in derivatives. He got into crypto in 2015 and went full time in 2017.  He and his co-founders started developing the application in May of last year and the beta opened Jan. 1. It only has about 600 people in it now, many of whom got some free tokens to play with. (Full disclosure: Hxro gave CoinDesk 500 HXRO to try it out in an account that can't make withdrawals.)  Minimum bets are 10 HXRO, or a little under $1. As of this writing, CoinDesk is down, but not that badly. Our strategy: mainly bet REKT, but sometimes impulsively bet MOON. Also, forget about it a lot and then maybe throw a few more in at random times. We're still working out the kinks.  “I can tell you from my own experience that if you play actively your day can quickly get away from you,” Brian Krogsgard, a crypto Twitter personality known as @LedgerStatus, told CoinDesk.  The main purpose of the tokens right now is to play them on the site. Krogsgard got into the beta early, with 2,000 free tokens to his name. He hasn't put any in or taken any out since, but the leaderboard shows him up 337,000 HXRO, enough for second place on the leaderboard.  Krogsgard told CoinDesk that he's found it fairly addictive. He recommends new players never bet larger than 10 percent of the pool on a card and err on the side of not putting more than 1 percent of their holdings on any one card.  ""It doesn't take much in terms of price movement of bitcoin for the game to be exciting,"" Gunsberg said.  How it works  As for the game itself, its user-experience embraces crypto culture full-on. It's 100 percent geared around price movement and mass psychology.  There's this concept in the game called ""the ratio."" When a player goes to bet on a card, all they can see before their wager goes live is how much HXRO has gone into the pool. They can't see which side people are betting.  That said, users can see how many people bet on each side on all the prior cards. So, if BTC has been getting REKT for the last three cards, it's a very safe bet that the crowd is favoring REKT for the current card. That's the safe bet.  The trouble with being on the side with more HXRO – the safe side – is that the winnings are less. So, it goes when betting the favorite, be it on bitcoin or horse racing. ""You can win seven out of 10, but if you're only getting 1.2x, you still lose,"" Krogsgard explained.  There's a second level that develops in the game. The longer BTC goes in one direction, the more likely people will start to take the other side, chasing the long-shot odds and a big win.  That said, other players may stick with the trend just because they know the other side will grow the longer a streak goes, marginally increasing the safe-side bet.  One way a player can make their guess more educated is by reading or even engaging in the trollbox on the site (basically, a chat window) as well as joining in its beta Telegram channel. By stirring up those hornet nests, a player can potentially move bets in the direction they desire.  ""The social gaming layers over the top of it has been the most shocking thing to me,"" Gunsberg said.  CoinShares' Meltem Demirors got in on the beta test (she's not an investor in the project), and she told CoinDesk:  “Hxro is all about understanding the psychology of the other players and strategically betting when odds are good. After three moons in a row, will everyone go moon or rekt? Since it’s a paramutuel game, you want to be on the side of the order book no one else is one. Being a contrarian pays.”  Place your bets  Down the road, the Hxro team sees the website going beyond a game to a full-on product that larger investors use as part of their real strategy.  Hxro did a $500,000 pre-seed round last year to fund development and is currently raising a $2 million equity round, with another $500,000 already sold, according to Gunsberg. While it did not do an initial coin offering, Hxro did do a small token pre-sale for $250,000. It actively sells tokens to users on the site as needed, too. In addition, the company takes a small cut off of each card.  There are a maximum of 1.575 billion HXRO tokens, but 325 million are locked up indefinitely. Only a little over 52 million are circulating right now. The price as of this writing for a HXRO token is $0.08, according to CoinMarketCap.  Right now, hxro only trades on Bittrex and IDEX, with about $15,000 in volume over the prior 24 hours of trading on Monday morning. The game itself will undoubtedly change when thousands more people are given a chance to play.  ""If we're starting to see some saturation then it's a good signal that it's time to start spinning up new games,"" Gunsberg said.  To accomplish this, the company could launch games with different time intervals or games that follow different currencies. Hxro also has another forthcoming game called ""MUHBAGS,"" which will work something like fantasy sports, but for altcoins.  While it has largely been insiders who've made it in so far, Gunsberg says the product has had an interesting effect on trading n00bs. He told us:  ""I guess more from the game side of it, it really, a lot of the people who've come on who've been enthusiasts, they learn more about trading crypto faster in a unique new way.""

42381651,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nrar,1551713426,Bitcoin's Lightning Torch Enters Iran as Payment Experiment Blazes On,"Bitcoin's ""lightning torch,"" an ongoing experiment meant to test and showcase the next-generation payments technology now in beta, has officially made it to a user in Iran.  The lightning torch finds bitcoin users testing out the network by passing around a small payment, each adding roughly 30 cents-worth of bitcoin before passing it on. As such, the payment to Ziya Sadr on Sunday marks the latest milestone in a six week-long effort that has seen participation from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, among other technology figures.  Yet, the payment to Sadr is notable given the question of international sanctions had begun to impact the exercise. One of the goals of the effort is to demonstrate bitcoin's power as a global payment system that can be sent anywhere, and the torch has smoothly passed through at least 40 counties so far.  Yet, pseudonymous lightning torch creator ""Hodlonaut"" told CoinDesk that the question of whether the torch could be passed to Iran had proved an obstacle.  ""The cooling effect of US sanctions seemed to be a big factor,"" he said.  Indeed, despite early efforts to participate, Sadr kept being passed over as a recipient. One user even decided to pass it to someone else over concerns it might violate U.S. sanctions.  That the torch couldn't get to Iran seemed to betray the game's principles. So, when it finally got to Iran Sunday morning, participants responded with excitement to the news.  ""The #LNTrustChain Torch is LIT in Tehran!"" Sadr tweeted, confirming he was sent the payment by ""Bitgeiniog,"" a pseudonymous bitcoin enthusiast from Wales.  In interview, Bitgeiniog noted his feeling, too, that he had helped further the lightning torch experiment by proving the strengths of the technology in international value transfer.  ""I see bitcoin as the great leveller for human affairs, the ultimate tool for non-violent resistance,"" Bitgeiniog told CoinDesk. ""When I saw Ziya asking and asking for the torch [...] it was clear what I needed to do.""  That said, Bitcoineig also ran into other obstacles in trying to make the payment, meaning some Twitter users were celebrating the torch's arrival a bit early. ""We hit a technical dead end last night and went to bed. They’ll be waking up soon so we‘ll finish the process,"" Bitcoineig told CoinDesk Saturday night.  But the payment did eventually make it to its intended target, with Sadr proposing that the torch continue to be sent to others promoting ""censorship resistance,"" like the privacy-focused browser Tor.  Other users seemed to agree with the sentiment and the proposed direction of the experiment.  ""Great to see that finally someone had the balls! Keep it to the real cypherpunks!"" tweeted decentralized exchange Bisq founder Manfred Karrer.  In its latest move around the globe, the lightning torch passed to a recipient in Israel on Monday.

This includes blockchain and crypto native offerings and solutions, but it’s much bigger than that,"" she said. ""It includes other things like legacy transformations at our clients to help them to drive efficiency and maximize digital capabilities, as well as things like mutualization of services and development of new revenue models where blockchain will, for sure, be part of the picture.""  Not to put too fine a point on it, McNamarra added:  ""I don’t want to just focus on blockchain.""  Blockchain evangelist  McNamara was the public face of PwC's blockchain practice over the last few years. For example, she represented PwC at a panel on blockchain convened by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2016, explaining to the regulators how the technology can help them to move proactively in their auditing practices, monitoring transactions on private blockchains in real time.  The following year, she made even bolder pronouncements for a corporate consultant, suggesting at a banking conference that a new type of economy powered by cryptocurrencies would lower the barriers to entry for those who are now excluded from the world economy. Under McNamara's supervision, PwC sponsored the digital identity-focused ID2020 event at the United Nations in 2017.  PwC has been particularly active in the blockchain space recently, advising a stablecoin project by the Loopring Foundation, auditing the Tezos Foundation and launching a blockchain-based supply chain solution with the Australian Chamber of Commerce in 2018.  It also has launched a two-year digital skills training program for its employees last August, signing up 1,000 staffers to study various technologies, including blockchain.  But McNamara's new employer, EY, has notably been out front in advocating for the use of public blockchains, and tokens, by enterprises. Paul Brody, the firm's blockchain innovation leader, wrote in a January opinion piece for CoinDesk that the dramatic plunge of crypto prices cannot overshadow ""an enormous amount of real progress for the technology"" happening in the industry.

42381658,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nriP,1551702612,"A New Exchange Launches, Letting Institutions Custody Their Own Crypto","A new crypto exchange for institutional investors is launching this month with an unusual approach to custody.  LGO Markets, based in New Jersey, officially launched Monday with limited functionality, allowing new users to set up and fund their accounts. However, spot trading in bitcoin will start on March 11.  According to CEO Hugo Renaudin, the company has secured 10 institutional clients already – mostly over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks, plus several hedge funds, crypto businesses and market makers. Another 56 clients are in the process of onboarding, he said.  The firm will soon face stiff competition, with large financial players like Fidelity Investments and New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange planning to launch institutional crypto trading platforms this year, not to mention the already-live up-and-comer SeedCX. But Renaudin said he sees plenty of potential clients out there.  “There are roughly 400 institutional clients that are currently trading in the cryptocurrency market,” Renaudin told CoinDesk. “We estimated this by talking to the crypto-friendly banks. Among these 400, it’s mostly hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, OTC brokers, a few family offices, asset managers and purely crypto players like lending providers that consider trading bitcoin as a part of their business.”  The LGO Markets team is a mix of youthful entrepreneurs and seasoned finance professionals. Renaudin, for example, interned at BlackRock and Societe Generale before joining the blockchain startup BitSpread and then LGO. Yet the firm also recruited Bank of America’s former director of prime brokerage sales, Camilla Churcher, to be the startup's head of sales.  To finance development of the platform, LGO's French branch raised 3,600 bitcoin (roughly $32.5 million at the time) through an ICO in February 2018, when it was known as Legolas Exchange, Renaudin said.  The ICO was conducted in compliance with French law and excluded U.S. residents, but sold tokens to 9,000 retail buyers from more than 50 countries. Eventually, the native LGO token will be used to pay trading fees at the exchange, though that won't be the case for some time after the launch.  But what may truly set this exchange apart from other institutional-focused players is that it will not hold clients' funds in either bitcoin or fiat.  Three's a trade  To start trading on LGO Markets, a client will need to set up a multi-signature wallet that requires two out of three private keys to move funds. One key is controlled by the client, the second one is held by LGO Markets and the third by a Swiss company, Altcoinomy, which will serve as a clearinghouse.  Users will also need an account with Signature Bank, which will serve as LGO Markets' fiat on-ramp. To send fiat for the bitcoin they buy, they will use Signet, a blockchain-based settlement system the bank launched in December. (Signature's spokesperson said it is the bank's policy not to comment ""on vendor or client relationships."")  To sell their bitcoin, users will need to sign a trade with their own key, then wait for LGO Markets to pass the information to the clearing firm and for the clearing firm to sign the trade with its key and settle it. It's Altcoinomy, not LGO itself, that will be responsible for moving bitcoin between the users’ accounts.  Renaudin said that if LGO moved funds itself, it would pose a “conflict of interest” and too much risk for big clients. Maintaining their own custody, on the other hand, will mean they are always in control of their funds and don’t need to care if the exchange fails in any way.  As he put it:  “Even if, say, we get hacked or I die like the guy from QuadrigaCX, or the office gets burnt down, the clients still can retrieve their funds, because with their own keys and the keys of the clearing firm they can move their funds and go back to their normal life.”  To bolster its credibility with institutional investors, LGO will be audited by PwC — a ""Big Four"" auditor that has recently been actively involved with the crypto space and this year announced it will audit the Tezos Foundation. (PwC declined to comment on the LGO relationship.)  Semi-decentralized  LGO’s model combines elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).  Like on a DEX, clients will store their funds independently, but the order book will run on a central server and the trades will be settled by the clearing firm. At the same time, all orders will get broadcast to the bitcoin network and recorded on the blockchain, timestamped and visible to everyone. This will eliminate the risk of LGO front-running its own clients, Renaudin says.  Renaudin emphasized that execution, clearing and settlement at LGO will be done separately — the way it is done with traditional securities trading. While some think the old-fashioned way is too cumbersome and should be streamlined with blockchain technology, Renaudin maintained that mimicking the traditional markets will give institutional clients the level of security they need to trust crypto trading.  “If you’re a large hedge fund or asset manager and you want to trade on Coinbase, you cannot apply the same control as you would use with the traditional trading. And we allow them to apply the same processes as to any other asset class,” he said.  Another advantage compared to existing crypto exchanges, Renaudin said, is that, as only institutional investors will be trading at LGO Markets, big orders won’t move the price as dramatically because all trades will be big. “You want to have a large trade but you don’t want the price to slip because you don’t have enough liquidity,” he said.  However, LGO plans to launch a separate trading service for retail investors in the second half of the year, Renaudin said. (The exchange has applied for a New York BitLicense, a FINRA broker-dealer license and a National Futures Association introducing broker license.)  Further, he said he sees this bifurcation of the markets as temporary, concluding:  ""The promise of the blockchain technology applied to financial markets is a perfectly scalable market infrastructure and direct market access for every participant. ... So it makes sense in the short term to create a platform for Fidelity and a platform for John Smith, and potentially join them together in the long term – not just for cryptocurrencies but for any kind of tokenized asset.""

42381669,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nrsT,1551698419,Bitcoin Price Drop Puts a Dent in Short-Term Bullish Outlook,"View  Bitcoin's drop to six-day lows below $3,700 has taken the shine off the bullish ""long-tailed doji"" created on Feb. 27. A bearish reversal would be confirmed if prices see a UTC close below $3,658 (low of long-tailed doji) and could yield a sell-off to recent lows near $3,300.  A bearish move below $3,658, however, may not happen or could be short-lived, as a number of technical indicators on the weekly chart are flashing early signs of bullish reversal.  On the higher side, a break above $3,897 – high of the candle with long upper shadow created on Feb. 28 – is needed to strengthen the bullish case. A UTC close above that level would open the doors to $4,190 (February high).  Bitcoin (BTC) has taken a knock Monday and the sell-off could intensify if key support near $3,650 is breached.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $3,700 on Bitstamp, down more than 3 percent on a 24-hour basis, having clocked a low of $3,670 earlier today.  Essentially, BTC has revived the sell-off from the highs near $3,900 hit on Feb. 28 with a drop to six-day lows below $3,700 and bearish pressures would further strengthen if prices find acceptance below the support at $3,658. That would invalidate the bullish view put forward by the ""long-tailed doji"" created on Feb. 27.  It is worth noting that the longer duration indicators are increasingly calling an upside move. For instance, the weekly chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has jumped to its highest level since January 2018.  Therefore, any dip below $3,658 (low of long-tailed doji) could be short-lived, unless the breakdown is backed by a surge in daily trading volumes to levels above the recent high of $10.79 billion.  Daily chart        As seen above, BTC is currently probing the support at $3,683, which marks the confluence of the former resistance-turned-support of the upper edge of the triangle and the 100-day moving average (MA).  A UTC close below $3,658 (low of long-tailed doji) would put the focus back on the high-volume bearish outside reversal candle carved out on Feb. 24 and open the doors to recent lows near $3,300.  On the higher side, a move above $3,897 (high of the candle with long upper shadow) would strengthen the bullish case and allow a rally to $4,190 (February high).  The bullish scenario looks likely, courtesy of growing signs of seller exhaustion on longer duration charts.  Weekly chart  The 5- and 10-candle MAs on the weekly chart have produced a bullish crossover for the first time since the third quarter of 2018.  Further, the money flow index has taken out the upper edge of the triangle, validating the bullish divergence  carved in December. The MACD histogram is most bullish in over 12 months, as noted earlier.  And last but not least, the bearish crossover of the 50- and 100-week MAs – a big-time lagging indicator – is signaling seller exhaustion, as discussed last month.

A report from The Information on Saturday, citing a source with knowledge of the matter, said that Circle is seeking to raise the funding via a combination of equity and debt financing.  They added that the reason for the move is that the firm's business has been affected by the prolonged cryptocurrency bear market. Circle has not confirmed the source's claim, The Information said.  The Goldman Sachs-backed firm has previously raised at least $246 million, according to Crunchbase.  Circle raised $110 million in a Series E funding round last spring that effectively valued the startup at nearly $3 billion. The round was led by Chinese crypto mining giant Bitmain, with Accel, Blockchain Capital, Digital Currency Group, IDG, Pantera and others also participating.  Jeremy Allaire, the firm's CEO, told CoinDesk at the time that the round would help the firm position itself as a conglomerate of cryptocurrency services.  The company offers several services, including crypto buying via its Circle Invest app, an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk launched for institutional clients last September and cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, which it acquired in February 2018.  Circle also has a dollar-pegged stablecoin called USD Coin (USDC) that it developed with help from the CENTRE affiliate consortium. It was seeking to register as a federally licensed bank in the U.S. back in June.  With its March investment round, Circle became a part of the ""crypto unicorn"" club, alongside U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.

Republican senator Daniel Hemmert filed senate bill 213 last week, proposing that any person who “facilitates the creation, exchange, or sale” of certain blockchain-related products should be exempted from the state's Money Transmitter Act.  The bill also aims to create a legislative group called the “Blockchain Pilot Project Evaluation Task Force” to study the potential of the technology in government services.  The 12-member task force would also recommend a pilot project using the technology in Utah at a state or municipal level and examine commercial applications of blockchain for ""future economic development in Utah.""  Finally, it will prepare a report, including any proposed legislation, to the Business and Labor Interim Committee and the Legislative Management Committee, on or before Nov. 30.  In a similar move, Pennsylvania clarified that crypto exchanges and service providers do not require a money transmission license to operate in the state in January.  However, North Carolina state took the opposite stance in 2016, passing an update to the state’s Money Transmitters Act that mandated that companies working with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies obtain a money transmitter license.

42381666,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nrtj,1551675637,Another Bitcoin Indicator Signals Price Bottom May Be Forming,"A technical indicator that incorporates both bitcoin's price and trading volume is signaling the cryptocurrency may have bottomed in December.  The money flow index (MFI), also known as the volume-weighted relative strength index, is used to identify buying and selling pressure and oscillates between zero to 100. A rising MFI indicates an increase in buying pressure, while a falling MFI is considered a sign of increasing selling pressures.  Essentially, the MFI validates or confirms price trends. Many times, however, the indicator diverges from the prevailing market trend.  For instance, BTC dashed hopes of a long-term bullish reversal with a break below $6,000 on Nov. 14 and hit a 15-month low of $3,122 on Dec. 15. The 14-week MFI also nosedived from the high of 43.00 in mid-November, confirming the sell-off in prices.  The indicator, however, bottomed out with a higher low at 22.00, contradicting the lower low in bitcoin's price. That bullish divergence is widely considered an early warning of a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal. Supporting that argument is the fact BTC snapped its record six-month losing streak with a 10 percent gain in February and the MFI rose from 25 to 44.  Other indicators like the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the bearish crossover of the 50- and 100-week moving average are also signaling long-term bearish exhaustion. These tools, however, don't incorporate trading volumes. The MFI, therefore, stands out as a more reliable technical tool.  That said, with a number of indicators pointing to bullish reversal, the probability of BTC picking a strong bid a year ahead of the mining reward halving appears high.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,785 according to CoinDesk data.  Weekly chart  As seen above, the MFI diverged in favor of the bulls in mid-December, despite BTC sliding to lows near $3,100. Further, it carved out another higher low at 25 at the end of January and is now rising toward the upper edge of the channel. A breakout on the MFI, if confirmed, would reinforce the bullish divergence witnessed in December.  When it comes to BTC, $4,190 is the level to beat for the bulls, as it is the high of the inverted bullish hammer carved out last week. That candlestick pattern indicates the bulls are beginning to test bears' resolve to keep prices low – a sign the market is bottoming out.  A convincing move above $4,190, if backed by a rise in the money flow, could yield a rally toward the psychological resistance of $5,000.  The bullish case presented by the MFI would weaken if the February low of $3,328 is breached with high volumes.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381652,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nrZb,1551669627,What Coinbase Needs to Learn from the Neutrino Scandal,"UPDATE (5, March 3:00 UTC): Coinbase has announced via a Medium blog that it will let go Neutrino employees who worked for the controversial Hacking Team project.    ___________    Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ___________    If you want to test a cryptocurrency newcomer’s grasp of the design principles of permissionless record-keeping networks, tell them it wouldn’t matter to bitcoin if ISIS were running a node.  The statement can provoke a look of alarm. But it helps to make the point that the security model behind bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies – the way they resolve the Byzantine General’s Problemhttps://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs174/byzantine.pdf – is independent of the question of who is participating in the network. ISIS’s intent, evil as it would no doubt be, is irrelevant if it has less than 50 percent control of the network.  It’s also a good way to draw a distinction between the ostensibly “trustless” nature of the underlying ledger and the fact that so many of the businesses that provide services for cryptocurrencies – exchanges, custodians, price feeds and so forth – actually function as trusted third parties.  The point is that once you have to trust someone or some entity, then the question of who they are really does matter. That’s the lesson everyone should take from the PR disaster that Coinbase brought upon itself with its recent acquisition of the rather dodgy blockchain analytics firm Neutrino.  Precisely because it acts as a steward and custodian of a very large amount of people’s funds and assets, Coinbase’s business model depends on it building up and maintaining trust with its customers.  And as it learned last week, that can be a complicated exercise, one that goes far beyond what the entity does, to include how its messaging and its dealings with others are perceived.  The Neutrino-Hacking Team connection  After BreakerMag’s David Z. Morris pointed out that the founders of Neutrino were the same folks who headed up Hacking Team, a notorious Italian IT firm whose software has helped authoritarian governments spy on their citizens, a #DeleteCoinbase movement arose on Twitter and elsewhere.  The backlash isn’t surprising. In a report that identified Hacking Team as one of five “corporate enemies of the Internet,” Reporters Without Borders documented the outfit’s cooperation with a wide range of governments around the world, including Sudan and Morocco, enabling them to “commit violations of human rights and freedom of information.”  The Washington Post reported that Hacking Team once worked with the Saudi enforcement unit that was later involved in the murder of the newspaper’s correspondent, Jamal Khashoggi. A Toronto human rights group found that the firm had helped the repressive Ethiopian regime monitor expatriate dissidents’ activities.  It’s not clear how many users have actually deleted their Coinbase accounts in response to these revelations. Some reported difficulty in withdrawing their bitcoin balances to zero, a pre-requirement for closing an account; the amounts left were too small to easily transfer on-chain.  That prompted developer Udi Wertheimer to create #DeleteCoinbaseTrustChain – a play on the Lightning Network Trust Chain – to create a chain of Coinbase users transferring residual bitcoin to each other on the company’s books so they could drain and delete their accounts.  Either way, it’s impossible to put a positive spin on the branding impact of the Neutrino decision – which is why it’s also really important to look at Coinbase’s response to it.  Misplaced messaging  As of the time of writing there had been no update on the Coinbase blog beyond the upbeat announcement of the acquisition from engineering director Varun Srinivasan.  In a statement to The Block, however, Coinbase said it was “aware that Neutrino’s co-founders previously worked at Hacking Team, which we reviewed as part of our security, technical and hiring diligence,” adding that “Coinbase does not condone nor will it defend the actions of Hacking Team,” but “it was important for Coinbase to bring this function in-house to fully control and protect our customers’ data and Neutrino’s technology was the best we encountered in the space to achieve this goal.”  Elaborating on why this was important, Christine Sandler, the company’s head of institutional sales, told Cheddar that the previous third-party providers ""were actually selling client data to outside sources.""  Well, good thing that's coming to an end. But the company’s argument – that this is best-of-class tech and that by bringing it “in-house” the company can be sure that it will “fully control and protect our customer’s data” – depends entirely on the presumption that users can trust Coinbase to act in their interests.  And trust isn’t as easily maintained as Coinbase seems to think it is. Hiring people who worked on such unsavory projects as the Hacking Team is a good way to lose it.  I’m not suggesting that Coinbase intends to surveil or otherwise abuse the rights of its customers. It has been a mostly faithful and trustworthy steward of its more than 20 million users’ assets. There’s nothing to indicate that it won’t continue to work hard to protect them.  But Coinbase is a trusted third party. To succeed it must develop, nurture and maintain the public’s trust. And as the saying goes, it’s very difficult to engender trust and easy to lose it.  This requires more than just living up to legal and de-facto fiduciary duties. It’s about how the entire company behaves, with everything from its blog posts to its corporate decisions under scrutiny.  An alternative that can be trusted  Banks and other financial institutions have been well aware of this challenge for years. It’s why they work hard on their branding – using words like “trust” and “fidelity” in their names and product offerings, and associating their logos and other corporate iconography with images of strength and dependability.  Even so, because of their poor behavior in recent years, public trust in banks is near all-time lows. Not that this has caused them to lose much business; most people feel they have no choice but to deal with banks if they are to transact in the real world. (Even among competing banks, switching costs, such as the hassle of changing direct deposit for paychecks, have historically made consumers “sticky,” or disinclined to switch providers.) It’s a captive audience, but a miserable one.  Perhaps Coinbase is relying on similar inertia, and maybe it can even afford to, given its massive user base and relative ease of use compared to most crypto exchanges. But if it wants to be a real alternative to the complacent, too-big-to-fail banks, Coinbase and others like it must hold themselves to a higher standard. They have to win the public’s trust.  Even if the Lightning Network and other decentralized technologies start to allow cryptocurrency users to more easily “be their own bank” and manage their assets without relying on exchanges or custodians, trusted entities will continue to play vital roles in the crypto ecosystem. In any case, we’re a long way from having those new technologies operate at scale.  Can Coinbase survive the Neutrino controversy and the #DeleteCoinbase movement? Possibly.  Yet the fallout from its decision and response affect confidence in the entire field of cryptocurrencies.  If the company and other such intermediaries want to help the industry grow and, in so doing, succeed in building their own respected brands, they need to work a lot harder at winning the trust of the people they serve.
