In order for the Avalanche price to experience some relief, it needs to break above the $18 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $25,000 Or $30,000? Crypto Analyst Weighs In However, the $17 price level has acted as a supply zone for the altcoin. If bulls cannot defend the current price mark of the altcoin, the bears may take full control of the asset’s price. Similar to other prominent altcoins, major market movers have been struggling to break their crucial resistance levels. The decline in AVAX’s market capitalization indicates a decrease in buying pressure in the market. Avalanche Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, AVAX was priced at $17.17. The immediate resistance for the altcoin was at $18, and if breached, could lead to a push towards $19, thereby strengthening the bulls. However, if Avalanche continued to trade sideways, a fall below the $17 level was expected. In such a case, the next support level for the asset was $15. The altcoin’s recovery was dependent on buyers stepping in to push its price above the $18 mark. The recent amount of AVAX traded was red, which suggested an increase in selling pressure in the market. Technical Analysis Over the past week, there has been a significant drop in demand for the altcoin, leading to a decline in its value. Despite efforts by bullish investors to regain buying strength, it is essential to surpass immediate resistance to make progress. The Relative Strength Index indicates that sellers outnumber buyers, with the index below the 50-mark. Though there has been a minor upswing, the bearish influence continues to dominate. Additionally, the AVAX price remains below the 20-Simple Moving Average, indicating that sellers are gaining momentum and steering the market’s price action. In addition, further technical indicators suggest that bearish momentum is prevailing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator shows the price momentum and reversals in the market. On the one-day chart, red histograms have formed, indicating sell signals.

12037910,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528153,1682251095,"What’s Next For Ethereum Price As It Drops Below $2,000?","The price of Ethereum has fallen below $1,900, dropping from the $2,000 mark that was previously held by bulls. This has led to another sell-off and the bearish influence remains strong despite attempts at recovery. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum has risen by only 1.2%, but on the weekly chart, the altcoin has seen a significant drop of over 10%. The technical outlook for Ethereum is also in favor of the bears, as demand and accumulation for the altcoin have decreased. In order for Ethereum to make a recovery, it is crucial for it to breach the immediate resistance strength from buyers. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Drops 11%, Sheds All Gains From Shanghai Rally Despite this, most altcoins, including Ethereum, have remained bullish on the higher time-frame structure. However, bulls must defend the following support line or supply zone for Ethereum to start its recovery. With Bitcoin struggling under the $30,000 price mark, many altcoins are also experiencing difficulty in breaking through their immediate price ceilings. On the one-day chart, the decline in the market capitalization of Ethereum indicates a decrease in buyers. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ETH was valued at $1,880, having fallen below its bearish block ranging from $1,900 to $2,000. This drop in price is likely due to a routine price pullback, as Ethereum had traded above the $2,025 price mark after approximately eight months. However, as selling pressure increased, the bears have taken control. The immediate overhead resistance for the altcoin is $1,910. A move above this level could potentially push ETH to touch $1,950, which may help to facilitate a price recovery. Conversely, the support levels for ETH are currently at $1,840 and $1,820. During the previous session, the amount of ETH traded was in the red, indicating an increase in selling pressure. Technical Analysis As demand for ETH decreased, buyers also began to lose confidence in the asset. The Relative Strength Index showed that sellers outnumbered buyers on the one-day chart, as it was positioned just below the 50-mark. Additionally, ETH dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating that sellers were in control and driving the price momentum in the market. However, with a slight increase in demand, ETH has the potential to trade above the 20-SMA line once again. In line with other technical indicators, ETH began to exhibit sell signals on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which measures price momentum and reversals, formed red histograms. This reading corresponds to sell signals for the altcoin.

In a crypto market that is generally bleeding red, PepeCoin, along with a host of other memecoins, has been quite profitable for investors. PEPE Gains 42% In 24 Hours According to data from CoinMarketCap, PEPE’s market price has increased by 42.03% in the last day, making it one of the biggest gainers in the crypto space. More interestingly, PEPE has gained over 528.17% following its launch on Monday, April 17. As earlier stated, PepeCoin (PEPE) is a memecoin; however, it differs from most popular memecoins as it was inspired by the cartoon character Pepe the Frog rather than the Shiba Inu dog. According to the bio on its official Twitter handle, PEPE is described as “the most memeable memecoin in existence” by its developers. Interest quickly grew around PEPE following a high-profile purchase that saw an investor reap nearly 4,500 times his initial investment. Barely days after purchasing 5.9 trillion PEPE tokens with 0.125 ETH, valued at $250, this memecoin investor saw his investment surge to a peak value of $1.8 million. As expected, this led to a massive influx of investors into the PEPE market as everyone is seeking to make a quick profit. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Plunges Over 13% – Will It Bounce Back? However, there is still much concern about PEPE, as with all memecoins. For PepeCoin, its major concerns center on the currently low liquidity of the token. Without a moderate liquidity level, it may be hard for investors to convert their tokens to profit regardless of how high their value rises. At the time of writing, PepeCoin is trading around 0.0000003341, with a daily trading volume of $87.98 million. Based on additional data from CoinMarketCap, the token has also attained an impressive market value of $145.66 million.

While these tokens are usually criticized for their lack of utility, they can serve as a source of quick and large gains – especially upon launch – as seen with PepeCoin. In addition to PEPE, some other meme coins have generated significant profit in recent times, even amidst the general crypto market dump. Examples of such tokens include Tamadoge (TAMA), ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE), and Good Gensler (GENSLR), which have gained by 160.34%, 608.36%, and 1719.46%, respectively, in the last seven days.

In fact, some analysts are backing the meme-inspired token to embark on an impressive bullish run anytime from now. Over the past 24 hours, Shiba Inu seems to be on a reversal after losing nearly 10% of its value during the week. Today, SHIB is up by 2%, and it appears to be building momentum for a price rally. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Remains In Red Despite Whales SHIB Buying Spree Shiba Inu Holds Above Critical Support Shiba Inu has been on a downward trend in the past few days, despite the buying frenzy by the SHIB whales. It is, however, worth noting that this whale accumulation trend has somewhat slowed down in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, experienced a significant price drop in the previous week, which affected the entire crypto market. It is understood that the latest bearish trend of the blue-chip crypto impacted the value of several altcoins, including SHIB. The Shiba Inu price decline started on Wednesday, 19th April, with the coin losing more than 5% of its value in one day. The meme token would fall by a further 7.47% in the next few days. However, SHIB has displayed remarkable strength and stability by not sliding beneath the $0.00001 price level, which was last breached on March 10. Since rising back above this level on the same day, the Shiba Inu market has been in consolidation, with its price ranging between a low of $0.0000101 to a high of $0.0000117. Time For A Rally? As of this writing, a SHIB token is valued at $0.00001046, according to data from CoinGecko. This reflects a nearly 3% increase since the coin found support at the critical $0.0000101 level. Shiba Inu trading at $0.00001041 | Source: SHIB/USD chart from TradingView Shiba Inu’s ability to hold above this significant support level is a strong indicator of bullish momentum. After all, this threshold has proven to be a vital point a couple of times already. A sustained hold above this level would likely lead to a major price upswing. Additionally, going by past price action, Shiba Inu looks set for another retest of the range high at $0.0000117. If there is prolonged buying pressure, we could see SHIB break this level to the $0.0000126 point. This move would represent a 20.4% increase from the current price. While this projection looks very much plausible, it may not go as planned if the SHIB price does not gather enough bullish momentum from this current run.

SOL has held above $20 since it jumped from $18 to $24 on January 14. However, the coin has seen a drop of 12.54% in price in the last seven days. Now, investors wonder if there are any signs of recovery. Related Reading: OKB Token Shines With 23% Gains On Weekly Chart, What’s Pushing It? Crypto Market Plunge Affects Solana After the collapse of Alameda Research and FTX last year, SOL price joined the trend of price losses in the market. The Solana blockchain raised funds from FTX and Alameda Research, the trading firm of FTX former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. However, when Binance withdrew from its planned takeover of the exchange, it spooked many investors as it meant the termination of support for Solana. Following the incident, many key investors pulled out from the Solana blockchain. This action led to a drastic drop in price, leaving SOL to struggle. However, the asset started recovering in 2023. It started the year at $9.9610 but gradually climbed, recording rallies and pullbacks until it hit $25 on January 21 before retracing. The past weeks were eventful for SOL, as it touched a significant high of $24.7 (April 15). But recently, Solana’s price has also been facing challenges as the crypto markets portray several signs of fear due to the threat of economic recession. At the time of writing, Solana’s price stands at $21.33, indicating a drastic plunge in price by over 13% in the past week, compared to its past week’s performance. For instance, on January 10, 2023, Solana enjoyed a 12% price increase after the blockchain’s Shiba-Inu-themed token, BONK, launched.

The asset has declined to the $21 price level as the bears seize market control. Solana is trading a bearish signal below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). However, it remains above its 200-day SMA, sparking hope of a long-term revival. SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 44.61, confirming the bearish trend. Notably, the indicator moves sideways, reflecting trader indecision in today’s market. SOL’s trading volume is down by over 26% today, thus halting its price gains. Solana’s support levels are $14.96 and $19.87. Also, its resistance levels are $23.99, $26.04, $29.79, and $30. Solana will likely drop below $20 in the short term. However, the $19.87 support level will prove critical to the asset and could be the pivot point for an uptrend if the bulls prevail.

The price decline cuts across the entire crypto market, with strong signs of bears. The cumulative market cap has dropped by 2.58% to sit at $1.25 trillion in 24 hours. Related Reading: OKB Token Shines With 23% Gains On Weekly Chart, What’s Pushing It? DOT has finally lost its grip on the $6 region as the bears became aggressive on the token over the past 24 hours. The market is wondering if Polkadot still has a chance to reverse the downtrend. Polkadot Price Drops Drastically With Prevailing Bearish Trend The past few days seem to be turning out more negatively for DOT. The asset hovered between $6.1 and $6.9 last week except on April 21, when it dipped. Currently, the 60-day and 90-day price action for Polkadot shows negative values of 4.45% and 5.36%, respectively. Also, DOT dipped by 12.46% over the past 7 days. Related Reading: These Top 5 Cryptos Are Thriving Despite A Slippery Market After losing its hold on the price level of $7 in February, DOT has maintained a trading price within the $6 region. As of April 21, the price of DOT dropped to its resistance point of $5.8 before correcting. However, the price analysis of DOT for the past 24 hours shows the token is gradually going down again within the past few hours. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $5.921, indicating a slight reversal after plunging. The bearish push on DOT from the past few days has spilled over to the weekend. The crypto market is undergoing a bearish trend, with most crypto assets battling for price stability. Polkadot is included in the market performance. Hence, the selling pressure for the token has exceeded its buying pressure, forcing the price of DOT below the $6 region. Bears Push DOT Below $6 After three consecutive red days, DOT has formed a green candle on the price chart. However, the bears are still in control as they struggle to reclaim past price levels. DOT has dropped below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), indicating a bearish sentiment in the short and long term. DOT’s support levels are $5.15 and $5.75. A decline below its support will bring further price fall. Also, the resistance levels are $6.71 and $7.89. However, the $6 price level has transformed into a psychological resistance level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is 39.74, close to the oversold region of 30. However, the indicator points upwards, suggesting a bullish reversal in the short term. DOT’s indicators are mostly bearish. Its next price action depends on traders’ decisions in the coming weeks. Further drop into the oversold region will likely lead to a trend reversal at the $5.75 support level.
