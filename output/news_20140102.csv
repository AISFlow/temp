42376793,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRXV,1388682947,Wall Street Analysts: Bitcoin Could Revolutionise the Non-Financial World Too,"Bitcoin technology has the potential to revolutionise the way we buy and sell property, enforce legal documents and even place bets, according to a new report from financial services and investment firm Wedbush Securities.  The system of decentralized trust, meaning that there is no central authority, that underpins bitcoin could have applications beyond the payments world that is most commonly associated with the cryptocurrency, write the report’s authors Gil Luria and Aaron Turner. The report reads:  ""We see the potential for bitcoin technology to digitize and decentralize trust. The implications of eliminating the need for centralized trust may go beyond payment networks to areas such as securities markets, sports gambling and even legal contracts.""  The report, titled ‘Digitizing Trust: Leveraging the Bitcoin Protocol Beyond the ""Coin""’, cites the Bitcoin Foundation’s October decision to allow meta data to be embedded in the blockchain as opening the door for people to “leverage the blockchain protocol in other ways beyond traditional financial transactions”.  Decentralized Trust  At its core, bitcoin is merely a way of recording transactions without the need for a central authority to confirm or verify those transactions.  The bitcoin protocol creates a digital ledger, called the “blockchain”, tracking each and every transaction on the network. That ledger is stored and updated not by a central bank, but by every single person who downloads the bitcoin software.  Therefore it is decentralized. Whenever a new transaction occurs, the record of that transaction propagates through the network and everyone updates their ledgers.  This distributed and decentralized system, backed by cryptography, does away with the need for trust in the “having to take someone’s word for it” sense – everything can be checked and verified digitally on the ledger.  (Of course, this is a simplified explanation and not the whole story. This video gives an in-depth view of the bitcoin protocol.)  Goodbye Lawyers  The bitcoin blockchain, for a long time, only contained data about transactions, but in October 2013 Bitcoin’s lead developer Gavin Andresen “reluctantly” allowed other data to be embedded into the blockchain. He said:  ""The idea is to give people a way to do what they clearly want to do (associate extra data with a transaction that is secured by the blockchain), but do it in a responsible way that strikes a balance between 'you can put whatever you want into the blockchain”'and 'you will have to be tricky and inefficient to get your data in the blockchain'.”  So potentially, a person could store data about a legal contract there. Here’s how Gil Luria explains the concept:  ""If the contract is in the blockchain and can be triggered by data feeds there is less need for lawyers, debt collectors etc. If the ownership and financing terms of a car is on the blockchain, and the car can only be started by the rightful owner, you don’t need debt collectors. The car will not let the driver operate it if they have not paid their car payment.""  The current bitcoin software only allows developers to add 80 bytes of other data to transactions, so the argument is less that bitcoin right now could become a system for enforcing legal documents, but rather that a bitcoin-esque system of decentralised trust could prove powerful in domains outside of traditional financial transactions.  ""We believe the protocol will be leveraged beyond financial assets and fulfill the role of trusted intermediary in a variety of settings, including property, legal documents, escrow and sports betting,"" write Luria and Turner in the report.  Regulation and investment in 2014  Investment from venture capitalists in bitcoin businesses really began to take off in 2013, with Coinbase raising $25m, BitPay raising $2m and Circle raising $9m.  According to the report, this level of investment will continue in 2014, allowing new innovation in the bitcoin space and the creation of technologies that will make bitcoin truly accessible to the mainstream, just as the creation of web browsers opened up the internet to new audiences.  “VCs that are not currently involved are looking for ways not to miss the trend,” says Luria.  Standing in the way of innovation is the increasingly hostile regulatory environment. China, India and the United States have all taken steps to restrict and regulate the operation of bitcoin businesses.  “I think the regulatory environment is more set than it seems,” says Luria, warning against undue optimism that regulators will change tack in 2014.  But with the bitcoin market burgeoning – BitPay says it gets 400 new merchant requests a day and Wedbush’s report estimates over $200m was spent on bitcoin mining equipment in 2013 – it remains to be seen whether or not these countries are shooting themselves in the foot by clamping down on bitcoin.  “Innovation and innovators gravitate to the country with the most accommodating regulatory environment,” notes the Wedbush report.  And now, with the potential for bitcoin technology to change not only payments and money transfers but other legal arenas, the stakes have never been higher.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/02/wall-street-analysts-bitcoin-could-revolutionise-the-non-financial-world-too,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aae2662eb4d85bd681c9a99153a4031e8ba107e5-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376797,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRbH,1388678403,56% of Bitcoiners Believe the Bitcoin Price Will Reach $10k in 2014,"More than half of bitcoiners believe the price of their favourite digital currency will reach $10,000 this year, a CoinDesk poll has revealed.  2013 was a turbulent year for bitcoin, with the price of the digital currency fluctuating between $13 and $1,147, but the bitcoin community largely thinks it will soar way higher than this over the next 12 months.  A whopping 56% of the 5,500 people polled so far said they believe the price will reach $10,000 this year.  Some 31% said they didn't think the price would rise to this level and 13% thought the notion of it reaching $10,000 was ridiculous, replying ""WTF are you smokin ???"".  Twitter reaction  Bitcoiners in the Twittersphere also shared their varied views, with @jsbarretto expressing that he hopes the price will not reach $10,000 this year.    @Bitcoin I hope not. Keeping the exchange rate stable means that Bitcoin will become more of a serious currency.      — Joshua Barretto (@jsbarretto) January 1, 2014    @m52go chipped in:    @AbeyuM @coindesk @Bitcoin i believe in the technology...the price will go where it goes!      — Steve Jain (@m52go) December 31, 2013    Rather more optimistic was @oleganza, who predicted that the price could rocket to $10,000 within the next few months:    @Bitcoin @coindesk $10K before May 1st.      — Oleg Andreev (@oleganza) December 31, 2013    @jebus911 said:    @BitcoinMania1 @Bitcoin @coindesk I think the odds of 10000 are much higher than people think      — Jeremy (@jebus911) December 31, 2013    Bullish predictions  The Winklevoss twins certainly think it's possible for the price of bitcoin to reach $10,000 (and even higher), perhaps not in the next year, but eventually.  They said they expected bitcoin would one day be worth 100 times what it was at the time ($343).  Back in early December, a report from Wall Street analysts Gil Luria and Aron Turner predicted that the price of bitcoin could increase to almost $100,000.  Titled 'Bitcoin: Intrinsic Value as Conduit for Disruptive Payment Network Technology', the report predicted the price of bitcoin could increase to 10-100 times its value at the time, which was around $1,000.  Ex-Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya also believes the price of bitcoin will rocket to much higher than levels seen to date. He said each bitcoin could go on to be worth more than $400,000, provided it establishes itself as a ""useful reserve currency"".  While these may be long-term predictions, political and financial pundit Max Keiser thinks a $5,000 price mark is on its way:    As predicted, 2014 will see hedge funds and PE funds (like Fortress) enter BTC space. Hello $5,000!      — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) December 31, 2013    Keiser has long been bullish about bitcoin. Back in March, he said: “It is inevitable that Bitcoin will become a multi-trillion dollar enterprise because every other currency in the world is tied to dying central banks that are encumbered with impossible-to-pay debts and bankrupt counter-party risks.”  Mainstream opinion  It's important to note that CoinDesk's poll targeted those who already know about bitcoin, so it isn't clear what the general consensus is on the future price of bitcoin.  What we do know, thanks to a recent poll conducted by Bloomberg, is that 42% of Americans have heard of bitcoin and know it is a digital currency. It's worth noting that they only quizzed 1,000 people, though.  Of those who identified bitcoin as being a digital currency, 46% said they favoured bitcoin regulation, 39% said bitcoin should not be regulated and the remaining 16% were unsure.  The price of bitcoin is currently $775, so it's still a long way off reaching anywhere near $10,000. That said, the price increased 8,723% in 2013, so it's entirely possible that this could happen again this year.

42376791,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRWF,1388671185,PayPal May be Planning Virtual 'Tokens' According to eBay Patent Proposal,"A patent application by eBay, the parent of PayPal, may signal that the company is making plans for its own virtual currency.  The patent, which was applied for in summer 2012, is for something called a “gift token”. It appears that eBay may have designs on developing a new way to distribute monetary value within the digital realm.  “A gift can be given from a user of a payment provider to a gift recipient,” according to US patent application 20130339188, which was published on 19th December 2013.  “The recipient can be a member of the user's family, a friend, or any other person or entity. The recipient can use the token to purchase a product using a checkout through the payment provider.”  It’s clear that eBay’s intention is to use the idea of gift tokens with PayPal, which has been the company’s payment arm since it was acquired in 2002 for $1.5bn.  The application states:  “A gift or payment instrument can be given from a user of a payment provider, such as PayPal, Inc.”  What’s interesting about the application is that the tokens may be designed for more ubiquitous use outside of PayPal, which could encourage wide adoption.  The patent application continues, saying that:  “The purchase can be made without requiring the user to create the user’s own payment provider account.”  Widespread payment adoption is likely a determinant as to whether a virtual currency will succeed or not.  An example of this would be the alternative decentralized virtual currency to bitcoin known as dogecoin, built off of litecoin’s source code. Dogecoin’s use as a tipping mechanism as well as its association with an internet meme has contributed to its rise in popularity over a short period of time.  PayPal president David Marcus has said that he believes that bitcoin is a part of the future of money. But according to him, the general public has an identity problem with bitcoin, commenting on the issue at LeWeb:  “People are confused. They think because it’s called cryptocurrency it’s a currency. I don’t think it is a currency. It’s a store of value, a distributed ledger.”  And in a Bloomberg BusinessWeek article in December, Marcus was quoted saying that mobile was the future of payments for PayPal. The patent application could signify that PayPal expects virtual gift tokens to eventually replace the functionality of gift cards.  “Mobile is going to be at the center of your money and all the transactions you make,” Marcus said on Bloomberg TV.

42376788,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRPx,1388667692,2013: The Year Merchants Learned to Love Bitcoin,"Tomorrow sees bitcoin’s fifth anniversary. When Satoshi Nakamoto flipped the switch on the first bitcoin client on 3rd January 2009, there wasn’t a single merchant for the product. Now there are thousands. But why did they begin accepting the virtual currency, how are they faring, and what have they learned during the last, turbulent year?  “Merchants give several reasons for accepting bitcoin,” says Stephanie Wargo, VP of marketing at payment processing firm BitPay. These include lower transaction fees, no chargebacks, easy setup and the ability to reach more customers worldwide, she says.  “We have seen tremendous growth. We are averaging over 400 new merchant requests a day.”  Nevertheless, there are some challenges for merchants wanting to accept the virtual currency. The biggest one last year was price fluctuation, says Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind the WordPress-hosted blogging service which introduced bitcoin support in November 2012. With an Alexa ranking of 18, the firm is arguably the biggest commercial bitcoin merchant online, in terms of popularity.  “BitPay made the integration straightforward, but the biggest challenge has been [that] people don’t want to spend bitcoins when the value fluctuates so much,” Mullenweg says. “When we introduced support bitcoin was around $12, so our nominally $100 upgrade in bitcoins would be worth over $6,000 now.”  Nevertheless, like many merchants, Automattic took a punt on bitcoin. After all, why not? The cost of entry is practically zero and it provides another payment channel for customers. For Mullenweg, however, it also served another purpose.  “The benefit has been mainly that bitcoin aligns strongly with the philosophy of our company,” he says. “It’s a decentralized, open source way to exchange value and a platform, just like WordPress is an open source, often distributed way to publish on the web.”  The education problem  Mullenweg is naturally clued into bitcoin, but the same isn’t true for many online vendors. Education has been the biggest hurdle, says Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, which offers a payment processing service for merchants in addition to its wallet service.  “99.9% of merchants do not currently accept bitcoin or have a good understanding of what it is.""  This is gradually changing as bitcoin gains mind share, he says. But the next biggest question from merchants is how much people will actually use it. Bitcoin payment processors face a catch-22 problem. Their business model rests on two types of person: the merchant and the customer that wants to pay that merchant in bitcoin. Before they can build up a sufficient quantity of merchants, enough potential customers for those merchants must exist to make it worth the merchant’s while. Without enough merchants, customers won’t bother trying to spend their bitcoins.  “The biggest thing I've learned is how important consumer adoption is to merchants – more so than the economics themselves oftentimes,” Ehrsam says.  Customer adoption is still an issue. Bitcoin-based revenues have been marginal, says Mullenweg, although he won’t confirm actual numbers.  Nevertheless, merchant adoption is increasing, as larger numbers of online and real-world vendors decide that if they build bitcoin support, the customers will surely come. Coinbase launched its merchant tools just over a year ago, and now it has about 17,000 merchants on the platform.  “Growth is similar to what we've seen on the consumer side, albeit on a different order of magnitude as merchants have been the natural laggard to consumers, at about 30% month over month growth,” Ehrsam says.  Safety in numbers  BitDazzle  , an e-commerce marketplace designed purely for merchants wanting to sell their goods in bitcoin, says that bitcoin transactions have doubled each month since it launched in mid-October.  The service, operated by Cashie Commerce, uses Coinbase’s merchant tools. Revenue numbers are proprietary, but it saw a 300% increase in transactions on Black Friday, and a 400% increase in transactions on Cyber Monday, says Cashie Commerce CEO Hieu Bui.  One of the advantages for merchants selling through a site like BitDazzle is that aggregating vendors creates an easy, visible place for customers who want to spend their bitcoins.  “The advantage for our sellers is that we are allocating significant resources to drive traffic to BitDazzle,” says Bui. “They get the benefits of those efforts on top of anything else they are doing to market their products.”  Accounting can still be a challenge for vendors who accept bitcoin, although the real issue here is for those who fail to convert their bitcoin into fiat currency immediately at the point of sale. BitPay converts bitcoins to dollars at transaction time for Automattic, meaning that it is accounted for like any other payment.  The vast majority of Coinbase merchants, too, use its instant exchange feature where they lock in the local currency amount of each purchase to avoid volatility risk. The firm provides a downloadable CSV file that merchants can export for their accountants.  However, a surprisingly sizeable number of BitPay merchants are holding a bitcoin balance. About 45% of its merchants choose to get some if not all of their settlement in bitcoin, says BitPay's Stephanie Wargo.  This year, many bitcoin merchants will still be testing the waters, hoping for revenues from a relatively new virtual currency that vast numbers of people still have no affinity with. However, with the value of the currency going up and with new payment features beginning to work their way into wallet software, things are likely to change. What will really encourage customers to get involved with the virtual currency is support for bitcoin by larger brand names. Given the mind share that the virtual currency gained last year, this could be something that we’ll see in 2014.  As more people begin carrying the currency, more bitcoin revenue will begin trickling down to lesser-known vendors, but most merchants shouldn’t expect the virtual currency to become a significant portion of their revenues for a while.

42376783,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRNR,1388663480,Man Uses Bitcoin to Buy a Piece of Paradise in Nicaragua,"Many people dream of quitting their job, collecting their bags and jetting off to a tropical paradise forever. Many people dream, but few people act. Gregory Simon is one of the few who decided to act.  This year he moved to Nicaragua and bought a 0.3-acre plot of land with bitcoin.  Just minutes from the beach in an area of San Juan del Sur called Paradise Bay, he’s hoping to build a home there with his girlfriend.  “By using BTC we were able to complete the transaction quickly with no need to involve banks or other third party intermediaries. I don’t know yet what the house design will be, my girlfriend and I will be designing it together in the coming months,” he told CoinDesk.  A former banker, Simon first travelled to Nicaragua in mid-October after quitting his job in institutional equity at the end of 2012.  “The current banking system is beyond immoral. It takes advantage of the most helpless and poor people on earth,” he said, explaining why he left banking after a 12-year-career.  One of the decisions he made when he left his job was to buy some bitcoin. On his blog he wrote that it has the potential to bring about “less wars, less government dependency, smaller governments, more liberty”.  “I believe bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize the money industry to a degree few people to date fully understand,” he said.  In order to buy land using bitcoin, Simon needed to persuade his seller to play ball. In this case, it was his realtor Sean Dennis from Nica Life Realty. Simon said:  “He showed us a number of land lots around town and during the time we spent together, Sean and I began to talk about bitcoin. He quickly showed interest and I proposed to him the idea of transacting the purchase of the lot in BTC instead of US dollars.”  On 3rd December he paid the deposit in bitcoin and then completed the rest of the transaction in the following weeks. He declined to say how much the land cost.  This won’t be the first time that someone had the idea of buying or selling land with bitcoin as a possible way of paying.  Former casino owner Jack Sommer is selling his luxurious Las Vegas mansion for $7.85m and he’ll take it all in bitcoin if you happen to be a bitcoin millionaire.  The 25,000 square-foot home is in a gated community, backs onto a golf course and even the staff quarters (yes, it has staff quarters) has a Jacuzzi.  For those of us with slightly more modest incomes, Canadian Taylor More’s home in Alberta would have been a more plausible option, listed back in March of this year as selling for CA$405,000 (US$382,616), with a discount for those paying with bitcoin.  More recently, another property in Alberta went on sale with bitcoin as a payment option. The CA$1m (US$944,733) property has four bedrooms and a private forest, according to the National Post.  For Gregory Simon, his new plot of land is an opportunity to build something new from scratch. He says that he’ll try to pay for the construction with bitcoin.  And when I ask, he confirms that “yes, it will have a pool”.

42376784,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRMB,1388657280,Lebanon's Central Bank Issues Bitcoin Warning,"The Bank of Lebanon, the country’s central bank, has issued a bitcoin warning, the first such warning in the region. The warning was issued on 19th December 2013 and outlines a number of risks associated with digital currencies, many of which we are all too familiar with.  The Bank warns of several risks:  Transactions made through unregulated networks cannot be guaranteed and losses cannot be recovered.  Unauthorized and incorrect transactions using digital currencies are irreversible.  The highly speculative nature of digital currencies and the fact that they are not guaranteed by any central bank makes them very volatile.  Digital currencies can be used for criminal activities, including money laundering and terrorism.  Since Lebanon is in a rather tough neighbourhood, the terror warning makes sense, which can’t be said of similar warnings issued in many other jurisdictions.  The bank continued, stating that:  “As a result, and to avoid dangers and losses that might result from using e-money, the central bank of Lebanon warns against purchasing, keeping or using e-money.”  Although Lebanon tends to end up in the news for all the wrong reasons, the picturesque Middle Eastern country has a vibrant economy and an impressive banking system, with more than a hundred different banks.  With a huge diaspora in Europe and the US, Lebanon also gets billions in remittances every year. In 2012 the volume of remittances stood at $7.57bn and it was second only to Egypt in the MENA region. It was substantially higher than the inflow remittances to several much bigger countries like Syria, Algeria, Iraq and Jordan.  Remittances account for roughly one fifth of Lebanon’s nominal GDP. With that in mind it is easy to see why bankers may be anything but enthusiastic about the prospect of a cheaper, unregulated payment network competing with traditional wire transfers.  The notice points out that issuance and use of “e-money” is prohibited under a decree issued in 2000.  The notice is issued for financial institutions and exchange institutions, so it prohibits the use of bitcoin by financial institutions in the country.

42376792,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRUz,1388624450,Why Are So Many Digital Currency Players Anonymous?,"Sunny King may be the mastermind behind two different altcoins, but that doesn’t make him any less difficult to pin down. When CoinDesk interviewed the creator of peercoin and primecoin, he refused to chat via any of the normal channels that we use – telephone, Skype, or IRC – and instead restricted himself to either the secure, private online chat program Cryptocat, or the online chat system at peercoin’s web site. In the age of NSA spying, we understand the difficulty in finding secure channels – but the question is, why be anonymous at all?  Anonymity is understandable in some digital currency-related activities. Bitcoin was used exclusively to trade for illicit goods on the Silk Road online black market, and Ross Ulbricht, its founder, was paranoid about his anonymity because he didn’t want to be arrested. He wasn’t paranoid enough, and was apprehended anyway.  But bitcoin itself isn’t illegal, and neither are the alternative currencies introduced by people like King. On the face of it, you might think they have nothing to hide from. But the prevailing sentiment among those that do choose to remain anonymous is that they might, in the future, if governments change their minds.  Worries about the political climate  “I just think the current political climate is not very nice, so I could buy some more time if it turns bad,” King said when we first spoke to him. “If an authority bans currency development that [sic] maybe I can still continue for a while.”  “If you know a bit of history about online currencies (eg e-gold) and peer-to-peer file sharing networks (eg grokster), even software developers are not safe from government prosecution/persecution,” he added recently. “I think many people share these concerns, and not surprisingly, the father of cryptocurrency, Satoshi Nakamoto, was also of similar opinion.”  King isn’t alone in wanting anonymity. After all, bitcoin’s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared from the community two years after he launched the project, and hasn’t been heard from since. Others in the community, such as those running pools, often seek to preserve their privacy, going by online handles rather than revealing their true selves.  Others choose anonymity to keep personalities away from altcoin projects. A researcher going by the name Eric Gonzales, who published a paper in July 2013 proposing an alternative to bitcoin, told us that he and his colleague decided to remain “pseudonymous” because their paper was about the message and not about personalities.  Like others, he hinted at fears over possible government retribution in the future.  “It is potentially counterproductive for the project to have faces attached, especially if it gets implemented,” he said at the time. “Satoshi Nakamoto's decision to stay anonymous was very wise and I don't think it was a coincidence that he left the scene just after Gavin Andresen gave his talk at the CIA.”  Charles Lee, the founder of Litecoin who now works at Coinbase, has been less publicity shy, although he was taciturn about admitting that he worked for Google when he was there. He understands the reasons why some prefer to remain anonymous, however.  “People are always afraid of government intervention. Cryptocurrency is such a powerful concept that it can almost overturn governments,” he told us when we first interviewed him. “Controlling the coin is so important to a government. So if BTC comes along and disrupts the reserve status of the USD, the USD would probably do something about that.”  The need for accountability  The problem with all of this is that anonymity can also lead to a lack of accountability. When people are identifiable only by an online handle, it makes it easier for them to change direction or renege on agreements. When the developer for Phenix exchange, an exchange for the Phenix altcoin, went AWOL with the exchange’s code, leaving many of the coins stuck in the exchange, it was difficult for the community to track him down and hold him accountable. A combination of anonymity, and the concentration of power in the hands of one or two individuals, created the perfect conditions for the implosion of the coins.  John Manglaviti, who left the UNOCS initiative to bridge phenixcoin, feathercoin and worldcoin after it fell apart, became the frontman for peercoin earlier this year, working alongside Sunny King.  For a coin to really flourish, it needs a public face which is easily contactable, Manglaviti points out. “When we talk to different magazines and publications, they want someone that they can talk to,” he says, pointing out that he became involved in the coin after it had already been conceived and launched.  “I was just a projects guy that wanted to help out. My name was already out there. You can’t put the genie back in the bottle,” he says. “I’ve nothing to hide. I’m just kind of the middle man, and I have no say over what direction the currency is headed.”  For those people seeking to deal with large investors in the digital currency space, it’s difficult to be anonymous. Venture capitalists like to know who they’re dealing with. This seems to draw distinct lines between the hobbyist/grassroots communities, and those trying to move digital currencies into the mainstream commercial space.  However, this doesn’t mean that all grassroots altcoin founders or core devs are anonymous. The founders of altcoins such as feathercoin and freicoin are open about their real names and backgrounds. And of course, those currently guiding bitcoin, especially those guiding local or international organizations to promote it, publicize their true identities.  Nevertheless, there are still some people who consider governmental displeasure – and worse – a serious threat.  “Bitcoin ownership may prove to be a bigger threat to state control than gun ownership,” said one prominent bitcoin entrepreneur, always outspoken in the community, who asked us to keep his comments non-attributable for this article. “For that reason, many bitcoin owners may want to remain anonymous.”  What do you think? If you’re not trying to score venture funding and charm the regulators into accepting digital currency, does it pay to keep your head below the parapet, and stay anonymous? And should you try to stay unidentifiable even when simply holding bitcoins?
