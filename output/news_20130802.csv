42376575,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W2z7,1375461371,Litecoin creator Charles Lee has left Google to work at Coinbase,"Charles Lee, the founder of Litecoin, has left his job at Google after being signed full-time by Coinbase. He started this week.  The California-based coder and MIT graduate decided to work for the digital wallet company after six years at Google, where he worked on projects including YouTube, ChromeOS, and Google Play Games.  Coinbase isn’t the first bitcoin company to employ someone from a cryptocurrency’s core development team. BitPay hired Bitcoin core developerJeff Garzik in May. That hire, however, was designed to get the former Red Hat engineer working full-time on bitcoin, which had been a side project for him before. This won’t be the case with Coinbase and Lee.  “I will be working on Coinbase code. Basically, whatever's necessary to help Coinbase succeed,” he told CoinDesk, which conducted an in-depth interview with him earlier this year. “Litecoin will still be a side project, but Coinbase is fully aware of this and support it. And Litecoin is not going anywhere. We have a dedicated team working on it and we are actively working on releasing the latest 0.8 client.”  Lee was secretive about his Google job when he worked there. Now, he’s opening up. “The main reason why I didn't publicize that I worked for Google previously is because I didn't want to make it seem like Google endorsed Litecoin or Bitcoin in anyway,” he said. “Litecoin was just an open source project I worked on in my free time. Now that I'm no longer at Google, I'm ok with it being more public.”  Google has a wallet product for mobile payments, and people in the cryptocurrency space have speculated that it might make sense for the company to launch its own virtual currency in the future.  Lee confirmed that there would be a virtual wall between his job at Coinbase and his Litecoin activities. “One of Litecoin Project's core principles is to remain vender neutral and that won't change with me working at Coinbase,” he said. “Plus, it's no longer just me running the show. We have quite a few talented people on our team now and we do things in a democratic way.”  Image Credit: Flickr",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | LTC,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/02/litecoin-creator-charles-lee-has-left-google-to-work-at-coinbase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c0ad7e633d867c65ff736d3914262bce7b608bf6-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376580,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W349,1375457679,Bitcoin’s lessons on the bahts and the bees,"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 2nd August 2013 — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law  Exchanging panic for patience  Once upon a time, people got their news from papers and the six o’clock news. Both were delivered daily, which gave the journalists involved time to pick up telephones, check with sources, and generally get the story right before passing it on.  You can forget about that now. Once something happens - and often if it doesn’t - the first frantic take by J Random Blogger gets thrown around the planet faster than the smell of cabbage through a school kitchen. Such was the case with the shock-horror news that “Thailand has banned Bitcoin!”. Microseconds later, as predictably as a schoolkid’s instinctive revulsion, comes the insta-analysis of delighted disdain and doomsaying. Either Thailand was being idiotic, or cryptocurrencies were in serious trouble: ideally, both.  At a very basic level, none of this seems to be true. A decision by Thailand’s central bank, the Bank of Thailand, certainly said ‘don’t play with bitcoin or its ilk’, but that’s not the same as a government ban. Rather, an independent agency with considerable corporate and political power was slamming the brakes on while not perhaps being quite prepared for the global attention it attracted.  John Law, who learned long ago that governments make bad companies and companies make bad governments, is unsurprised. Central banks, with their dual role as economic cornerstone and de facto regulator, are deeply conservative and not prone to quickly understand things that they have not encountered before.  This is good and bad; a lot of dangerous fiscal engineering gets closed down, but if you wrap unstable ideas up as things the bank thinks it knows about, you can get them through without too much trouble - credit default swaps, anyone? Bitcoin has been too busy being born to have learned the skill of disguise, so it can trigger the “unknown, therefore risky, therefore stop it” instinct.  Which seems to have happened in this case, a response amplified by the Bank of Thailand having exceptionally broad powers. These include a very close regulatory interest in foreign currency exchange for the Thai Baht - which until 1997 was pegged to the US dollar, when the Asian financial crisis forced it to float and devalue. Unsurprisingly, forex still gets a lot of attention, and since bitcoin looks like a foreign currency but isn’t handled by any licenced exchanges, it can seem like a good idea to put the brakes on while its real nature is scryed.  Fortunately, despite its extreme youth, bitcoin is rapidly evolving the ability to talk to central banks and other regulators in their own language, so you can be sure that contact is being made and discussions started. The upside to having a central bank that can make arbitrary decisions with almost the strength of law is that they can be undone just as easily - undoing actual government decisions is far harder.  So the lesson is, as always, not to panic, not to jump to conclusions and not to assume that everything is done the same way all over the world. And you don’t have to eat the cabbage.  Bitcoin: helping youths come out in hives  There’s nothing CoinDesk readers like more than a good pun. Waxing lyrical with “what a buzz” and “hope it’s not a sting operation” comments, they responded in typically a-pollen fashion to the story of the Bees Brothers.  Which is as feel-good as you like, and a splendid antidote to international machinations and tech-heavy ASIC miners. Said brothers are three kids from Utah, all under 15, with a good claim to be the youngest BTC entrepreneurs on the planet. They keep bees - a home-schooling project that went a bit crazy - and sell a variety of tooth-threatening and beeswax-based delights. As their apiarian activities grew, they started shifting product to their immediate neighbours, then local markets and further afield. It was natural, and very easy, to expand into mail-order online, and since you can accept bitcoin even if you’re ten years old and invisible to banks, that was the logical way to cope with payment.  John Law is most taken with the Bees Brothers demonstrating yet more proof that bitcoin makes everything old new again. In this case, the brotherhood lives in Cache Valley, a part of Utah that was home in the early 19th century to mountain men - fur trappers and traders who lived independently from the trappings of statehood and showed a high degree of adaptability. They led the way where settlers and gold-rush colonists followed: the similarities between bitcoin fever and gold prospecting madness has long been noted, but here the system is working as the trade routes that lets individuals thrive connected to, but not bound into, the system.  Admittedly, very few of the mountain men started off before they were teenagers and there’s no record of them getting interested in cryptography, as some of the Bees Brothers are now doing. As for the honey caramel almonds: clearly, much research needs to be done.  A crack in the law  Bitcoin can, alas, be used for trade of a considerably less wholesome nature. You will probably know about Silk Road, the anonymous, Tor-based trading outpost that arranges the sale of disreputable goods by unknown parties to unknown parties through the exchange of BTC. One of the most popular classes of product is the controlled substance; if you’ve heard of it and want to snort, poke, imbibe, smoke or rub it into yourself, someone will claim to be able to help out.  Yet still greater levels of abuse are possible, as American computer security investigator and journalist Brian Krebs knows far too well. He has spent many years writing about cyber-attacks and the people behind them, and is thus not much loved in certain Russian quarters. They express their feelings in a wide variety of ways - faking phone calls to the police so armed response units are despatched to Krebs’ home, creating vast lines of credit in his name, and so on.  The latest wheeze, documented in Kreb’s blog, was to have a BTC whip-round, order a significant amount of heroin on Silk Road, and ask for it to be despatched by post to the man. The idea, apparently, was to then pretend to be his neighbours, call the police again, and sit back and chuckle as he tried to explain the strange white powder in his possession.  That may have worked somewhat better had Krebs not been reading the secret bulletin board where the villains were gleefully planning their jolly jape. He got to the plod first - you get the feeling that the local constabulary have tired of the novelty of being caught in the middle of such international intrigues - and told them what was going to happen.  Smack-By-Mail duly delivered, he handed over the package to the law and now awaits confirmation that it was actually as advertised. Smart Guy 1; Puerile Cybernasties 0.  What most distracts John Law about the business, which seems to have harmed no one and lost the bad guys some dosh, is whether it was actually illegal. Drug laws revolve around possession, which is why it’s so difficult to get the big guys who pull strings but never come close to touching the stuff. Worse, it’s not clear if the Ruskies ever technically owned the heroin, any more than you own the bottle of whisky you order online for delivery to your dad for his birthday. At what point does the gifting occur? Under what jurisdiction?  Which raises the rather fascinating prospect that instead of being used to commit old crimes in a new way, bitcoin is implicit in doing something that should be a crime but isn’t. A canny writer with a sufficiently twisted imagination could probably concoct a set of true un-crime short stories which explores this brave new world: the lawyers, one feels, will find gainful employment for years to come.  John Law would just like to make it clear that if you do wish to send anonymous, bitcoin-funded substances through the post to him, he’d much prefer the honey caramel almonds to even the finest pharmaceuticals. Test cases are for other people.  John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude. He has returned to write for CoinDesk on the foibles of digital currency.

42376577,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W31d,1375447427,"Altcurrency exchange Crypto Street converts bitcoin, litecoin and feathercoin","Crypto St.  is a new US digital currency exchange that recently launched into its beta testing phase. The exchange, based in Delaware, is the first of its kind in the US and is focusing its attention on supporting up and coming altcurrencies.  While there are already altcurrency exchanges, such as Bulgaria-based BTC-e, Crypto St. is bullish about its chances. ""People like and trust an American-based platform and that's presently what we offer for an altcoin exchange"", said Shamoon Siddiqui, the company's founder and CEO, when we contacted him.  In its current state, Crypto St. is supporting trades between bitcoin, litecoin, and feathercoin. There is as yet no fiat currency exchange, so you'll have to provision your binary bullion elsewhere for now. Crypto St. cites ""complex money transmission laws that vary per country and states"" as the reason for the lack of fiat support, but that it is working towards that goal. Siddiqui told me that Crypto St. is currently working with its advisors to resolve FinCEN compliance.  To celebrate the launch, the company has zero fees to trade and withdraw. “We want to encourage a strong economy between the various altcoins,” said Siddiqui, “and that’s why we’re starting with a no-fee model. But of course, that will change in time.”  Crypto St. also states that its next release will bring support for Namecoin, and Primecoin. The former is used for buying .bit domains which are a decentralised form of the DNS system. The latter is a new currency based on (the useful process of) discovering prime numbers as its proof of work algorithm.  Crypto St. is self-funded out of Siddiqui's pocket and is currently a three man operation, with Yaniv Sofer as COO and Andrew Font as CTO.  One smaller difference that people familiar with forex trading may find comfortingly familiar is the order in which trade ratios are quoted. Crypto St. puts the strongest currency first, so that the trade ratio is shown as a greater than zero figure, rather than the long zero point floating-point figures that we see elsewhere.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LTC,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/02/altcurrency-exchange-crypto-street-converts-bitcoin-litecoin-and-feathercoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59254e2415dd14eed0235d52e5e8779e5925b097-500x282.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376586,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W39B,1375438342,"DATA reveals plans to get US government, states and banks on board with virtual currency","Two founders of the committee to form a self-regulatory organization called DATA (Digital Asset Transfer Authority) gave out some more detail about their plans to CoinDesk this week.  DATA was announced  on Tuesday, and hopes to stave off the potentially aggressive regulation of virtual currency companies by federal and state agencies in the US. It will have a board, which will be advised by two other sub-boards.  One of these will be a technology advisory board, while another will be a community board, containing DATA members from the virtual currency industry and supporting community.  “We have been recruiting board members including ex-regulators, a prominent technology professor involved in privacy and technology, and someone from finance who understands what the potential innovations are,” said Constance Choi, secretariat lead and co-founder of the committee. “It will represent a broad cross-section.”  There will also be a series of subcommittees when DATA is officially formed, she added, although how many and what areas they will target has yet to be decided.  Choi is the general counsel at Payward, the company behind the Kraken bitcoin trading platform. She conceived the idea for an SRO with Stan Stalnaker, the founder of Hub Culture, a social networking service that operates the Ven virtual currency.  The pair developed the concept after the Bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose in May. “Everyone was asking what the FinCEN guidance meant,” she says. “We needed a common answer to a common problem. Immediately after that conference, we started taking steps to build the coalition.”  “What we saw was that the technologies here have so many benefits, but digital coins suffer from a PR problem,” Choi continues. “As a tech lawyer, I have seen this happen in the context of copyright law and file sharing. The question is what do you do in that grey area of regulatory uncertainty? How do you establish trust at the digital level?”  The pair gathered a core group of early adopters who formed the core of the committee. They began courting regulators directly, speaking directly with the US Treasury Department’s FinCEN agency. They floated the concept of a self-regulatory body, and say that the Treasury Department liked the idea (although they add that the Treasury hasn’t officially sanctioned it as a way to stop regulatory involvement by the US Government).  The idea is to take the conversation to regulators, rather than the other way around, says Stalnaker. “As the people who created these technologies it's important that we have a voice around the table as these standards are fought out,” he says. “What we don't want to see is the ones that don't get it derailing progress.”  More than one stakeholder  The US federal government is not the only stakeholder that the self-regulatory organization (SRO) has to get on its side. The US states mean that there are effectively 50 sovereign governments to court, points out Choi. “Each of these states define money and currency differently.”  There’s also the danger that a third obstacle could appear: the incumbent financial services industry. As it stands, bitcoin and other virtual currencies barely register on their radar. After all, the market cap of bitcoin today is less than Apple’s quarterly revenue. But the potential is there for it to grow dramatically.  As it stands, companies converting between bitcoin and fiat currencies who can’t get approval in every state need businesses with a money transmitting business licence (often a bank) for what is called an agency relationship. Under this model, the bitcoin business serves as an agent of the MTB, allowing it to carry out its business without regulatory interference.  The worry is that if the traditional financial community takes a dislike to bitcoin and other virtual currencies, it could easily render it illegal via government lobbying if it wanted to – SRO notwithstanding. “At the moment, banks see a big hole, with money coming out [of the financial system], and going in,” said one source close to the DATA movement, adding that this makes financial institutions nervous.  However, where there is money to be made, banks will rarely leave it on the table. DATA wants to provide more certainty for all stakeholders, including banks, by introducing acceptable standards for know-your-client (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) practices. This will hopefully placate powerful movers concerned about compliance, and make the virtual currency concept more palatable for them.  There are signs that tentative connections between the two worlds are already growing. At least one bitcoin company has already signed an agency relationship, while others are in talks to do so. And bitcoin-focused firms are headhunting veterans from the traditional financial services sector to help build bridges.  One of the biggest challenges for this organization will be to placate all sides. On one side is a community of developers and early adopters driven by the idea of anonymity and decentralization, who are suspicious of centralization and the loss of anonymity. They might hope for the currency to simply route itself around regulation. On the other hand, those companies wanting to build more intuitive, usable infrastructures and services for bitcoin are negotiating with regulators and traditional financial players who have their own requirements when it comes to user accountability.  DATA will find itself negotiating these issues. “At the institutional level, the exchange level, and the banking level, we need to understand who we're doing business with,” Choi says. “But that doesn't mean that privacy isn't important. Privacy is an important issue for any sophisticated business.”  Why was the Bitcoin Foundation not an appropriate vehicle for such a venture?  In part, because this isn’t a problem exclusive to bitcoin. “Bitcoin is a digital asset with very unique attributes, but the organization has to address the largest asset class,” Choi explains. “That's where we come in.”  The Bitcoin Foundation’s general counsel Patrick Murck is on the members list for DATA. Murck will be a valuable addition to the team, as the Bitcoin Foundation has been dealing directly with regulatory squabbles after receiving a letter from the Californian Department of Financial Institutions in June. Another supporter who was in from the start was OpenCoin, the company behind the Ripple payment network.  “We hustled. I had to call and convince people,” said Choi. “Everyone comes from a unique perspective. What was really important was to get everyone to coalesce on the issues that were common.”  People were still hopping on board relatively late as momentum gathered. One person phoned up on Monday night, asking to be on a list of members before the announcement went out early Tuesday morning. This gives a sense of how fluid things still are with the DATA effort.  So, what next? There will be another meeting this month (August) following two plenary meetings in July. The board will have been selected soon, and will meet in the autumn. “We are finalizing the candidates,” said Choi, adding that the organization will be able to report more in a month.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/02/data-reveals-plans-to-get-us-government-states-and-banks-on-board-with-virtual-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e37dfe27978492deb3f59b887c1dbf34d514b77-1000x669.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
