42376491,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ak9v,1369345378,BTC.sx revives bitcoin margin trades,"Bitcoin margin trading is back. A new trading platform, BTC.sx, is offering investors the chance to take short and long positions on future bitcoin price movements against the dollar. The platform, which is in private beta, enables a position is to be opened for varying lengths of time, from a few hours to weeks.  Founder Joseph Lee, a Brit-based in Australia, works in the finance industry. He developed the trading platform himself, having used his own scripted trading bots to generate a $150,000 profit in bitcoins, he said.  Like other margin trading sites, BTC.sx uses leveraged positions. This means that when you ""bet"" a certain amount of bitcoins on Bitcoin movements against the US dollar, the site effectively lends you money to increase your position. These ""geared"" trades are placed at approximately 100 times the value of your bet. If you bet a hundredth of a bitcoin on a position, the site bets approximately one bitcoin for you.  In conventional margin trading, a broker would require a maintenance margin reflecting a certain percentage of the leveraged amount to sustain the account. BTC.sx requires users to put down a deposit covering each position. The deposit is the size of their trade multiplied by 1500. If you bet one hundredth of a bitcoin, you have to make a deposit of 1.5 bitcoins to support the bet.  The site protects itself by automatically liquidating a position if the loss gets too close to the deposit amount. In the above example, if you came close to losing your 1.5-bitcoin deposit because the price of bitcoins moved against you, the site would execute an automatic stop on your trade and liquidate the position.  On the other hand, if your position moves in your favour and you make money, you stand to make a lot, because you’ll be betting with BTC.sx’s bitcoins. The site charges a daily funding amount based on the trade. In the example trade above, the daily funding cost would be 0.1010 bitcoins.  The deposit requirement will naturally restrict the size of a trade, but Lee also imposes a limit, both on the size and number of trades that a person can place at any time.  The numbers are slightly more complex than this. The actual available leverage, in addition to the stop amount, varies based on market volatility. In some cases of extreme volatility, the site may also force liquidations to limit growth broker and client loss.  Users don't have to maintain a fiat currency balance, says Lee – everything can be held in bitcoins.  ""At any point in time, the bitcoin in their wallet has an intrinsic US dollar value,"" he said. ""I take that trade at that point in time, I execute the trade, and then when the trade is liquidated I recalculate what it is worth at the new value.""  Bitcoin veterans will remember the drama surrounding Bitcoinica, a margin trading platform launched in 20011 by teenager Zhou Tong. The site was hacked several times, and traders' bitcoins were lost. Tong issued a public apology after the site closed down. Lee is eager to ensure that this doesn’t happen again, and isn’t yet sure when his private beta will be publicly available.  “My motivation is to add liquidity into the Bitcoin market in general -- the more liquidity there is in a market, the faster it will grow,” Lee said. “My site can be used to make a quick profit, but I’d more encourage users to only do it if they know what they’re doing.”  In short, in a volatile market frequently stymied by DDoS attacks and exchange hacks, never bet more than you can afford to lose.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/23/btcsx-revives-bitcoin-margin-trades,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e9d0870499ff8abd575d44afcff9f24fd601499-628x356.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376502,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AkMV,1369326390,5 countries that should be adopting Bitcoin right now,"Bitcoin is a new way to think about money, and there are people in places all around the world who could use it for purposes other than speculation. Maybe they don’t have faith in the financial system of the country they live in. Or maybe national regulations put limits on what kind of assets they can invest in. Bitcoin could assist with these and other economic problems in some countries in particular.  For a country’s currency to be successful, its citizens must believe in the good faith and credit of its government. Whether it is dollars, pounds or euros, money has value in part because of the government that backs it, along with some other factors.  So let’s take a look at five countries where citizens might have more than the usual reasons to adopt Bitcoin … whether that’s as a means of payment, as an investment or simply as a store of value.  1. China  Chinese people have a reason to be interested in Bitcoin since – other than pricey real estate and slow-growing bank accounts – they don’t have many other places to store their money. While China has national stock markets, Bitcoin is an attractive option because of its global reach. There is already a China-specific exchange called BTCChina.  2. Iran  Throw in the fact that the flow of US dollars in Iran is relegated to the black market, and Bitcoin seems like a golden opportunity in the Islamic Republic. And the country’s inflation rate – as the chart above shows – is getting worse, especially in the last few years. Strange as it may seem, bitcoins might just be less volatile than that of Iranian rials. That might convince those who want to their money to remain valuable to use something else … possibly Bitcoin.  3. Greece  While the youth of Greece cannot find a job, the elite are trying to get their money out of the country. Riots have been a reality in Greece as a result of diminished government services and the terrible labor market, so investment in Greece is flowing out rather than coming in. Most likely, some of it is probably going into Bitcoin.  4. Argentina  “Argentina has a terrible legacy of currency crises, and it is going through one right now”, says Fergus Hodgson, an economist and policy advisor with the Future of Freedom Foundation. “Bitcoin offers a vehicle for convenient civil disobedience. That is acting in a peaceful manner to engage in relatively freer trade and transfer wealth across nationalities with ease.” In fact, Tradehill, a Bitcoin exchange, is planning to open an office in Argentina.  5. Italy  The resulting problem is that there is a lack of liquidity in the banking market of Italy. It’s like paying only the interest on nearly maxed-out credits cards: you can’t get out of the debt holding you down. Italians could increasingly look at Bitcoins to hedge against this uncertainty. It’s possible that Italy’s debt will hit 130 percent of GDP this year, leading to fears that debt could balloon out of control.  What these countries could do  These five countries have unique and intertwining problems with their money. But cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could influence nations to adopt different economic or monetary policies. The actions government leaders in these countries take will be interesting to watch. They cannot stop Bitcoin itself, so they will take actions in ways that will reveal what they really think about it.  Some of these countries can do things to control the flow of information to the masses. Since Bitcoin is a purely electronic currency, countries with control over their telecommunication industries could take steps to block access to web-based Bitcoin exchanges and wallets. That might slow down adoption, but is unlikely to stop it completely due to the digital currency’s decentralized nature.  What countries do you see Bitcoin being an influence in? Can countries do anything to stop Bitcoin?  Sources:  [1]. Market Oracle  [2]. Trading Economics  [3]. Greek Suicides up 27% - Quartz  [4]. Scott Grannis  [5].

42376495,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AkCR,1369314822,Coinpunk offers DIY Bitcoin wallet,"A new ‘roll-your-own’ bitcoin wallet project showcased at the Bitcoin 2013 conference last weekend. Coinpunk is a web application that allows anyone to run their own self-hosted Bitcoin wallet service, accessible from their browser.  Until now, online bitcoin wallet services have been hosted by third parties, meaning that users have to trust them with their bitcoins. If the third party is hacked or experiences some other technical problem, users could lose their bitcoins. The alternative is a mobile application, but iPhone and iPad users are out of luck - Apple won't allow them in its app store.  This software would put the control – and the risk – into the users’ own hands.  There are a variety of bitcoin wallets on the market, and they come in three main flavours: software wallets installed on your computer, mobile versions that run on a smart phone, and web wallets, that host your bitcoins in the cloud. Bitcoinqt is the original bitcoin client, but other clients have been built on it. For example, Armory is Bitcoinqt-based, but features backup and encryption capabilities, alongside ‘cold’ storage of bitcoins, offline on a computer. Other services, such as Electrum, span Android mobile devices, alongside traditional computing platforms.  Kyle Drake, the project's author, explains in the online documentation for the project that he wanted to build something that allow people to use bitcoin in a decentralised way, while still having the convenience of an always on web service. ""Also, running the desktop client's CPU is memory intensive, and requires a constant Internet connection, which a lot of people would rather not run on their personal machines,"" he said.  The software project, which was showcased at a software Hackathon during the Bitcoin 2013 conference, is built using the Ruby programming framework. It includes the ability to create and name new addresses for receiving bitcoins, and is designed to display well on mobile devices, Drake said.  New features coming soon will include the ability to receive notifications when new bitcoins arrive, and a function to send bitcoins via email.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/23/coinpunk-offers-diy-bitcoin-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f3c1909f45497f802433b87da12260cb9d0c3d1-719x362.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376496,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AkGD,1369302896,Welsh teen guilty of virtual money theft from RuneScape,"A Welsh teenager has been found guilty of computer misuse offences relating to the theft of virtual currency from a RuneScape account.  Nineteen year old Kieron Belmont of no fixed abode was staying on a friend's sofa at the time of the offence.  The two fell out and after his host had gone to bed Belmont logged onto her computer and got into her partner's RuneScape account. He then traded away the credits which had taken six years to accumulate.  He left early the next morning, taking two bottles of booze with him.  Defence solicitor Stuart John told Swansea Magistrates' Court:    ""He saw an opportunity to carry out a spiteful act — he knew the password to the computer because he had used it before.      ""He effectively decimated the credits Miss Jenkins's partner had built up over the previous five or six years.    ""These credits do not have any real value — their only value is in the game.""    RuneScape explicitly forbids 'real world trading' of RuneScape items. The ban was brought in after the game was hit by gold farmers - mainly Chinese companies which play the games in order to sell on credits earned.  Belmont was told to pay £16 compensation for the stolen booze, £85 prosecution costs and £15 victim surcharge.There was no separate punishment for the computer misuse offences, This is South Wales reports.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | TRADING,John Oates,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/23/welsh-teen-guilty-of-virtual-money-theft-from-runescape,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43e6fa9395bcfd4e18f2e3bcbee666a4ae35a382-1434x869.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376484,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ajzr,1369300077,Sealand to adopt bitcoin?,"We've seen bitcoin gaining traction among companies ranging from porn merchants through to car dealerships. But this may be the first time we've seen a country adopting it as a currency – well, a country of sorts. The Principality of Sealand has expressed an interest in adopting bitcoin.  ""Prince Michael"" Bates, of the quirky, self-proclaimed independent state, expressed interest in the virtual currency during an interview on the Reddit site. Speaking in an 'ask me anything' (AMA) interview, the son of Sealand founder Roy Bates was asked if the state could print its own money. ""Yes, we are looking at ways to do it securely. Also bitcoin sounds really interesting if they stabilise,"" Bates said.  Sealand used to be a Royal Navy fort. Located six miles off the coast of Suffolk, it lies outside UK territorial waters. Occupied by Roy Bates in 1967, it was to be the site of a pirate radio broadcasting station. The station never made it to the site, but Bates decided to stay there with his family.  Today, Sealand uses the Sealand Dollar, which it pegs to the US dollar. It also runs its own gift shop, selling coffee mugs, T-shirts, and other paraphernalia. There’s no sign of a bitcoin address up there yet, though. Clearly, Prince Michael is still floating the idea...",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/23/sealand-to-adopt-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376489,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ak69,1369293074,Lamassu Bitcoin machine aims for 'cash to bitcoins',"Lamassu's Bitcoin Machine isn't exactly a Bitcoin ATM -- instead, it's designed to enable one-way exchanges only: cash to bitcoins.  But, for now, that's good enough in a world where changing fiat currency into the digital stuff is still a complicated, circuitous process that's not easily available to everyone.  ""(T)he core intention is to simplify obtaining bitcoins,"" says Zach Harvey, one of the three people behind Lamassu Bitcoin Ventures, which plans to roll out the machines starting this summer.  The other two founders are Zach's brother, Josh Harvey, and Matt Whitlock, a network security expert and software/hardware engineer. It might seem like a bit of an unlikely trio -- prior to Lamassu, the Harvey brothers owned guitar stores -- but Josh Harvey has a background in software engineering, and the brothers have been Bitcoin enthusiasts for longer than many people ... since 2010.  Zach says Bitcoin's a great solution to the troubles of doing business with cash (messy, needs physical counting and storage, easy to steal) and credit cards (high fees, ""major fraud issues,"" chargebacks and risk of theft) ... if people can easily access the digital currency.  ""However,"" he continues, ""if Bitcoin is hard to obtain and difficult to use, its advantages aren't relevant to small businesses.""  Zach says that, just as BitPay delivers ""an amazing solution to the payment side,"" Lamassu aims to provide ""the solution to customers obtaining bitcoins.""  He was in San Jose last weekend for Bitcoin 2013, and notes, ""the convention was great.""  While on display at the conference, ""our machine processed about 25,000 USD over the weekend,"" he adds.  Zach says his company's machine promises to deliver advantages over other, similar devices. Rather than modify the design of a legacy ATM, the way some Bitcoin businesses have done, he says, Lamassu built the Bitcoin Machine ""from the ground up to utilize the speed and simplicity of the Bitcoin protocol.""  The Lamassu device is also more portable than other machines.  ""Ours is about a sixth of the size of any other Bitcoin dispenser, and is easily shipped anywhere in the world,"" he says. That will probably prove handy late this summer, when the company plans to ship its first 10 to 20 machines. The most likely destinations at the moment: Canada, the UK, Argentina, South Africa, Israel and Australia.  Rather than selling licenses or charging software or franchise fees for the Bitcoin Machine, Lamassu plans to sell the devices outright. Zach adds the price of the machines will also be ""considerably lower"" than for other devices on the market.  While the company is currently focused just on cash-to-bitcoins, it does plan to design a bitcoins-to-cash one in the future, Zach says.  ""Bitcoin to cash is trickier due to development, size, price, Bitcoin security and regulatory issues,"" he says.  For now, just offering an easier way to obtain bitcoins is a good start. Zach says he found plenty of interest in the machine while attending Bitcoin 2013.  ""Talking to interested parties from all parts of the world, we realized how universal the need for our Bitcoin Machine really is,"" he says. ""In fact, there are countries that simply have little or no access to online exchanges, such as Argentina and South Africa. I also realized that other countries are a lot closer to reaching an understanding with their governments, such as Canada and Great Britain, and that the US may be late to the Bitcoin party (and not in a fashionably late cool kind of way).""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/23/lamassu-bitcoin-machine-aims-for-cash-to-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da272e42117ca4a45d3157e64b9b9a4403e6be67-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
