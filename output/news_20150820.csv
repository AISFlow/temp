42426457,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJsx1h,1440108503,Research: Federal Reserve Needs Power Over Bitcoin,"The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank should be given a mandate to monitor threats bitcoin and digital currency systems pose to the broader financial system, a new report from a Suffolk University researcher argues.  Entitled ""$=€=Bitcoin?"", the report speculates as to the potential dangers that the more widespread use of bitcoin as a digital money with no government backing, analyzing how circumstances arise where this threatens national and international economies.  The paper follows a February 2014 statement from Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, who said that the US central bank does not have the authority to regulate digital currencies. Further, the European Central Bank published a report last year that, while largely dismissive the technology, indicated the bank is monitoring developments.  More broadly, the report argues that the mandate is necessary given that the general population is not aware of central bank boundaries, meaning the central bank could ""bear responsibility"" for a systemic crash should it affect either or both markets.  The report reads:  ""Even if the central bank had no mandate to regulate virtual currencies, a failure of a widely-used virtual currency could imperil confidence in the central bank, which could adversely affect its ability to govern the more traditional money supply and payment systems.""  The author argues that the decentralized nature of bitcoin suggests government action will be necessary should any ""bad conduct"" materialize in the market.  ""The result is likely to be an increased need for ex-post intervention, and it would be preferable if the intervention plan were well thought-out, rather than a messy, ad hoc plan developed in the heat of a crisis,"" it continues.  Overall, the author makes the plea for action to be taken to address how governments should respond in times of digital currency crises before they become more widely used as a store of value and payment method.  Elsewhere, the full paper explores the definitions of money, while providing detailed overviews of the history of bitcoin, the US dollar and euro, as well as the variations in responsibilities between entities such as the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank.  New shadow banking  For purposes of the report, the author argues that potential bitcoin crises are perhaps best considered as analogous those that have occurred in the shadow banking system, the network of non-bank financial intermediaries that provide services to traditional commercial banks.  The author argues this should hold true, even though in the bitcoin ecosystem, the blockchain effectively replaces traditional financial intermediaries like non-bank institutions.  Of note, the author contends, is the absence of an intermediary should bitcoin face a crisis, something she argues could incentivize speculators to drive down its price. A lower price, the paper continues, would likely lead the digital currency to be a less attractive means of spending, damage that would perhaps not be limited to the alternative economy.  ""If the failed virtual currency had previously been widely used to affect everyday purchases, the resulting payment system failure could impact the normal flow of funds in a way that could retard broader economic growth,"" the paper said.  Furthermore, it contends that the failure of a widely-used virtual currency could contract the available money supply, thereby slowing economic growth.  Hybrid system  Should digital currencies be more widely adopted, the paper argues, financial institutions could be adversely affected by any extreme fluctuations in the price of digital currencies.  In this scenario, the paper suggests financial institutions could be caught in situations where they no longer have the funds to cover needed obligations.  ""In a panic, the financial institution would no longer be able to exchange the virtual currency for the fiat currencies needed to discharge the fiat currency-denominated obligations,"" it reads. ""Instead, the financial institution would either have to sell other assets, or borrow, to raise the necessary fiat currencies to discharge its fiat-currency denominated obligations.""  This situation could be compounded as institutions seek to sell assets that are depreciating to reduce their exposure and stem their shrinking balance sheet, which in turn, could limit their ability to borrow more funds.  However, the paper does note that bitcoin swaps, such as those offered by CFTC-approved TeraExchange, could be used to allow financial institutions exposure to digital currency without the burden of owning the asset.  Interbank exchange  Should the blockchain take off as a way for institutions to settle obligations, the author implied that the collateral for repo agreements would be affected, which would again limit their ability to secure short-term funding.  In turn, the paper speculates on the effects of this development on the larger economy.  ""If a serious systemic crisis were to result, interbank lending would seize up entirely because of a general lack of confidence in financial institutions and their collateral – and if interbank lending seizes up, then the flow of credit to the economy at large will also seize,"" it reads.  If financial institutions face such a crisis, they would in turn need liquidity assistance, which would most likely come, ironically, in the form of a government intervention.

42398601,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcIzw,1440106273,Harborly Becomes Latest Bitcoin Exchange to Shut Down,"Another bitcoin exchange is closing down in North America.  Texas-based Harborly said in a 14th August blog post that it was shutting its doors as a result of work on a separate project that co-founder and CEO Connor Black described as “a growth hacking tool and service” currently in private beta.  The past year has seen a number of exchanges call it quits in North America, including Vault of Satoshi, Cavirtex and Buttercoin.  According to the post, the closure is not related to security or fraud issues, and the exchange is up for sale.  Black told CoinDesk that the team – which will migrate in its entirety to the new project – opted to shutter the exchange rather than devote only part of its resources, explaining:  “We made the decision to close down Harborly around the time we started seeing results with a side project we had been working on internally. Given the nature of the project, we realized that 1) we have to move as fast as possible on it, and 2) we don't have enough resources to continue doing both. Ideally we would love to keep growing Harborly along with this new project, but a bitcoin service is not something you run at 50% capacity.”  When asked if digital currency regulation played into the decision, Black said that “I'll admit that we underestimated the regulatory and financial burden of running a bitcoin retail service.”  Black went on to say that the regulatory landscape for digital currencies is ""shaping up"", noting that any startup should overestimate how much time and money it will be required to devote to compliance.  “We were surprised again and again by the resources it took to effectively adhere to the compliance requirements laid out in the US and beyond,” he added.

42398618,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJCj,1440088331,Gartner Report: Cryptocurrencies are Still Over-Hyped,"Over-hyped cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are still in a period of ""inflated expectations"", leading tech advisory firm Gartner has found.  As part of its 2015 'Hype Cycle' report on emerging technologies, it included cryptocurrencies among the sectors marked by ""over-enthusiasm"" and ""unrealistic projections"".  Gartner's annual release – marketed at R&D teams – tracks the maturity of more than 2,000 nascent technologies on the road to mainstream adoption. It has five key stages that follow expectations over time: innovation trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, plateau of productivity.  Cryptocurrencies first appeared in Gartner's hype cycle in 2014, just after the 'peak of inflated expectations'. This year they have moved a fraction lower, toward the so-called 'trough of disillusionment'.  Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchanges – a new entry on the chart – find themselves squarely in the middle of this trough, which is characterised by waning media interest.  They are predicted to 'plateau' in two to five years, much faster than cryptocurrencies, which Gartner estimates will 'level out' in five to ten years.  Digital business  The firm's vice president, Betsy Burton, said Gartner had featured the technologies in its report due to ""high levels of interest"" and the potential for ""significant impact"".  Both cryptocurrencies and exchanges are placed in the firm's 'Digital business' category, which focuses on ideas at the convergence of people, business and things. Augmented reality, the Internet of Things and wearables also feature.    ""Physical assets become digitalized and become equal actors in the business value chain alongside already-digital entities, such as systems and apps,"" the report explains.    Cryptocurrencies are rated 'high' for transformational impact, meaning they can create new ways to save or make businesses money, while cryptocurrency exchanges are 'moderate', meaning they provide 'incremental' improvements to established processes.  Over the hill?  Although bitcoin has received over $860m in VC investment to date, our most recent State of Bitcoin report indicated that mainstream media mentions have been on the decline this year – as 'blockchain' grows as a buzzword.  Even back in 2014, Jerry Brito, now executive director at Coin Center, told CoinDesk he had started to witness a hype slump:  ""At one point, bitcoin and virtual currencies were a novel and interesting story. The sexier angles including Silk Road were there. Since the novelty has worn off and the bad actors are being driven out of the ecosystem, they have lost interest.""  Last November, researchers in Poland found a strong correlation between bitcoin's price and media 'hype', whether this – or the descent into the 'Trough of Disillusionment' – could explain the currency's recent dip remains to be seen.

42398611,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcJ7o,1440071412,Nigeria's Central Bank Calls for Bitcoin Regulation,"Nigeria's Central Bank has reportedly called for bitcoin regulation in an attempt to stop money laundering and avoid international penalties.  Speaking at the second Anti Money Laundering/Combating Financial Terrorism Stakeholders Consultative Workshop held in Abuja – the country's capital – Dr Okwu Nnanna, deputy governor of financial system stability at Nigeria's Central Bank (CBN) said:  ""Virtual currency was dangerous because it was not a legal tender of any country hence it has a borderless nature without jurisdiction which makes it a channel for money laundering.""  According to media reports  , the event – organised by the Association of Certified Anti Money Laundering Specialist – also featured comments from Obot Akpan's, deputy director of Financial Policy and Regulation Department at CBN.  Akpan added:  ""Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) has observed that virtual currency payment products and services (VCPPS) present opportunity for money laundering and other crime risk that must be identified and mitigated. Virtual currencies present a wide range of issues and challenges that require financial authorities to consider and the challenges posed are unique and call for urgent regulator responses.""  The comments follow on from the FATF's recommendations which stated that digital currency exchanges and gateways should be monitored closely in an attempt to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist activity.  Other regulatory efforts  Nigeria's alleged interest in regulating digital currencies comes amid similar efforts elsewhere.  Last month, Brazilian congressman Manoel Junior proposed a public hearing to discuss bitcoin and digital currency regulation.  In the meantime, the BitLicense, a local regulatory framework formulated by New York's Department of Financial Services is already in place to regulate digital currency businesses operating in the state.  CoinDesk has contacted CBN for comment.

42398597,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbcIwz,1440066038,Mt Gox CEO May Face Rearrest Over $2.6 Million Customer Fund Theft,"The CEO of bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt Gox may face fresh embezzlement charges from Japanese police tomorrow, reports claim.  Mark Karpeles has been in custody for three weeks, the maximum time suspects can be detained without formal charges, following claims he manipulated volumes on the once-leading exchange prior to its collapse last February.  New allegations, reported by the Yomiuri newspaper, claim the 30-year-old embezzled ¥321m ($2.6m) of customer deposits to support other personal projects, including a 3D software company. If enforced, these will 'reset the clock' on how long the Tokyo Metropolitan Police can hold Karpeles, giving him up to another 23 days in custody.  Mt Gox was once responsible for 80% of bitcoin trading volume, however it has been rocked by scandal following its closure. At the time of the company's insolvency, as much as 744,400 BTC (then worth $340m) was reported missing.  Some 200,000 BTC was later discovered in a cold wallet under Karpeles' control, however questions remain about insider involvement and just how long customer funds had been missing.
