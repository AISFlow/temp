According to a notice from Korea exchange Upbit, transaction support for monero (XMR), dash (DASH), zcash (ZEC), haven (XHV), bittube (TUBE), and PIVX (PIVX) will end Monday, Sept. 30.  Upbit announced its investigation of the 6 coins at the beginning of September. The exchange was determining if the privacy coins met the requirements listed by the FATF guidance issued last June.  Generally speaking, privacy coins conduct transactions on public ledgers without exposing an individual's address or identity. Other exchanges have begun delisting the coins as well, such as Coinbase and zcash this summer in the UK or other Korean exchange OKEX dropping five privacy coins earlier this month.  Writing on a company blog, Upbit said money laundering and the possibility of inflows of privacy coins to the exchange were the leading reasons for delisting.    ""There are also crypto-assets that can selectively utilize anonymity features among projects that are subject to end of transaction support. For these crypto-asset, Upbit has only supported transparent withdrawal/deposit support.      Nevertheless, the decision to end trading support for the crypto-asset was also made to block the possibility of money laundering and inflow from external networks. Upbit will continue to consider crypto-asset that represent anonymity functions as candidates for designation of investment warning crypto-asset.""    Recent exchange delistings have been blamed for flailing privacy coin prices.

42430970,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMz49h,1569002435,Seed CX Slashes Rates as Crypto Trading Fee War Looms,"Cryptocurrency exchange Seed CX has cut its fees to gain market share as competition piles into the crypto trading space.  Margin compression across the industry is the result that the most popular exchange services become commoditized as crypto usage proliferates.  Fees for takers is down to five basis points from eight bps on the Seed Digital Commodities Market, while makers, who previously traded on the exchange for free, receive one bp rebate.  In an interview, Seed CX co-founder Edward Woodford told CoinDesk that the fee cuts came on the heels of a record $20 million daily trading volume recorded last week, beating out top players Bittrex and Gemini in the league table.  “The new fees will allow us to compete with the deals that the bigger exchanges are making with some of our biggest clients,” he said. “Fees are compressed over the past few months.”  Launched in January, Seed CX provides institutional investors with execution and settlement services. Beside the spot market, the company is also active in the crypto derivatives trading through subsidiaries.  Rather than a multi-tiered fee structure offered by several major exchanges, where traders get lower rate if their transactions reach a certain volume, Seed CX aims to give every participant the best rate possible, Woodford said.  Woodford also revealed that its platform will add several fiat-crypto pairs including euros and Japanese yen, on top of its existing currencies.  Fee compression is already at an advanced stage at Seed CX, while other crypto exchanges still have room to cut, David Martin, chief investment officer at asset manager Blockforce Capital, told CoinDesk.  “The fees are extremely competitive on the lower end,” he said. ""I don't see it getting much lower than what Seed CX is offering today.”  According to Martin, one of the best rates in the market is on Coinbase’s exchange: zero for makers that create liquidity and ten bps to those who take liquidity out of the platform, while a few other exchanges also give rebates to makers.  A More Competitive Landscape  With the aggressive fee schedule, Seed CX is trying to attract a bigger following and increase volume and liquidity on its platform as fee compression hits all crypto exchanges.  “Last summer, you had more retail-type exchanges, then companies like Seed CX came on board for the institutions,” Martin said. “The company is in a more competitive landscape today than they were at that time.""  Besides a more crowded space for the institutional exchanges, more alternative crypto providers are marching into the field.  “We have seen a bunch of exchange startups and then a number of additional over-the-counter desks providing liquidity,” Martin said. “These new entrances to the market over the past one and a half years has made execution more competitive.”  A race-to-zero price competition, as in the traditional asset management industry, is likely to happen in the crypto trading space, Martin said.  “I think the compression is here and other people are going to have to adapt in order to maintain their relevance, especially for startups that do not have much volume and liquidity,” he added.  A Big Pie  “Crypto exchanges charge five to 20 to 25 times, potentially, as what you would charge in equity trading,” Martin said. “A substantial amount of money is being generated by the exchanges and other counterparts.”  Meanwhile, global crypto trading will continue to grow as it expands into the derivative markets. While crypto derivatives are not actually digital currencies like Bitcoin, they still count as trading volume for the currencies, Martin explained.  Bitcoin trading volume reached $11 billion for the second time in March since April 2018. Another major cryptocurrency, Litecoin, followed a similar trajectory during the same period.  Weekly trading volume for the second largest crypto currency by market value, Ethereum, hit its highest notional value since late 2017 on cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase that serves both retail and institutional investors.  “The industry is going to attract more institutional players that have serious capital behind them."" Martin said. “The more Bitcoin is around and doesn't die, the more people are curious and interested in what it is.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/20/seed-cx-slashes-rates-as-crypto-trading-fee-war-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4cfb37982c69c1814bf198fe469131c014bd162d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430977,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMz4Lh,1568994317,CipherTrace Scout App Takes Crypto Investigations Mobile,"Blockchain forensics firm CipherTrace has developed a mobile tool for flagging bitcoin and ethereum tokens with a criminal past.  Announced today, CipherTrace Scout grants street-level investigators more freedom to identify, track and document illicit crypto transactions from the field, company representatives and law enforcement experts said.  The software builds on a suite of investigatory tools investigators already use. An app-based interface “traces” addresses through the blockchain to identify what coins may have been used by the crypto underworld, in dark market purchases or in ransomware extortion attacks.  Users input an address and CipherTrace Scout generates an instant report. It flags potentially criminal addresses “with a high degree of certainty,” according to Julio Barragan, a financial crime and compliance analyst at CipherTrace.  “You can imagine some beat cop in a high risk area, literally finding something that appears to be tainted,” Barragan said. “He can share a case with an analyst at headquarters and that analyst could do the tracing very quickly to determine where the source of the funds were.”  Casey Bohn, a high-tech crime specialist and educator for the National White Collar Crime Center who trains agents to use CipherTrace, said that the new technology will be of immediate use in the field.  “I think a scenario like this [CipherTrace Scout], where I can put an address in and see: ‘hey, this [address] has been involved in some sort of nefarious activity,’ I think that can be huge,” Bohn, who teaches law enforcement officials how to use tracking services, said. “You can almost rule in and rule out things at that point.”  New Spin on an Old Service  Federal agencies, police investigators and auditors already use cryptocurrency tracking software for finding crooks.  The Internal Revenue Service contracted crypto transaction tracer Chainalysis from 2015 through at least 2017. Then, America’s tax service called the software “necessary to identify and obtain evidence on individuals using bitcoin” for criminal dealings.  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents cross-reference ransomware attacks against an internal database called the Internet Crime Complaint Center, which maintains a list of every such instance. They also use a blockchain-based tool to process victim addresses.  Federal agents want to move their tracing ever deeper. In a pre-solicitation document at the end of last year, the Department of Homeland Security mulled the feasibility of tracing privacy tokens, which confound easy research with complex security.  Technologies such as CipherTrace and Chainalysis now pervade law enforcement agencies across the country, according to Bohn, the tech crimes expert. He says that Chainalysis is something of a federal standard.  But CipherTrace Scout builds on what Bohn called a law enforcement favorite: visualization.  “We can visualize the transactions [using the software]. I can see ‘from A to B” and then I can start pivoting from there in a visual manner, which is often times easier for someone to understand.”  “I like the visualization, the students like the visualization,” he noted.  Adapting to Trends  CipherTrace Scout’s rollout comes alongside a spike in street-level cryptocurrency use.  Bohn said law enforcement partners reported a surge in low-level uses cases: prostitution, drug sales, child pornography trades.  “We have found that your drug dealer on the street has gotten savvy. They’ve gotten a little more savvy and they have started to develop these trades online, using other cryptocurrencies.”  Barragan, the CipherTrace analyst, credits the proliferation of Bitcoin ATMs and other crypto-capable kiosks.  “There are approximately 900 Coinstar machines embedded in Safeways across the U.S. that spit out crypto,” he said. “It’s becoming very very easy anyone to acquire crypto, and it's starting to be used for street crimes.  The Scout flags nefarious addresses. But it also ignores every-day users, a feature Bohn calls critical.  “While there is criminal activity that occurs with these technologies, there’s a lot of normal, regular people who are taking part in this technology as well.”  Hacker image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/20/ciphertrace-scout-app-takes-crypto-investigations-mobile,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/375f82302fedf0a80b1f4726d3aee072221f429b-1000x562.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Chicago-based company first launched its futures product back in December 2017, at the same time as its Windy City rival, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).  In its announcement on Friday, CME said the launch of bitcoin options is aimed to provide clients with ""additional tools for precision hedging and trading."" The launch is pending regulatory review.  Tim McCourt, CME Group global head of equity index and alternative investment products, said:  “Based on increasing client demand and robust growth in our Bitcoin futures markets, we believe the launch of options will provide our clients with additional flexibility to trade and hedge their bitcoin price risk. These new products are designed to help institutions and professional traders to manage spot market bitcoin exposure, as well as hedge Bitcoin futures positions in a regulated exchange environment.”  The firm detailed that, since the 2017 launch, it has seen 20 ""successful"" futures expiration settlements, with over 3,300 individual accounts trading the contracts. Close to 7,000 CME bitcoin futures contracts are traded on average each day, the firm added.  In March 2019, CBOE abruptly changed tack and halted the futures product. That left CME as the sole provider of bitcoin futures in the U.S.  CME will have a new rival from on Monday, however, when the Intercontinental Exchange and its subsidiary Bakkt begin offering a new futures product. Unlike CME's cash contracts, though, ICE will be offering a physically settled product, meaning customers will receive actual bitcoin instead of the cash equivalent.

42430980,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMz4Th,1568984458,Verizon Just Won a Patent to Create Virtual SIMs on a Blockchain,"Telecommunications conglomerate Verizon is eyeing the use of blockchain technology to underpin the dynamic creation of virtual SIM cards.  The company was granted a patent with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the concept on Sept. 10, in which it sets out how it the invention could do away with pre-inserted, branded physical SIM cards.  The patent describes how a physical SIM card can be replaced by a software equivalent – a virtual SIM (vSIM) – that is secured with blockchain-based encryption.  A device on the mobile network would create a user account for storing one or more vSIMs and a selection of network services to be associated with the account.  The network device then creates a blockchain record including a vSIM certificate for the network services and an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) – a number that uniquely identifies all users of a cellphone network. The vSIM certificate is then linked to the user account and can be activated on a client's mobile device.  Participating nodes on the ""distributed consensus network"" would maintain a list of records that Verizon calls a vSIM blockchain. This would be secured from malicious tampering by storing time-stamped transactions in cryptographically secured blocks. Records on the vSIM blockchain would be stored in a hash tree structure for efficiency and to ensure that blocks are received ""undamaged and unaltered,"" according to the patent.  Notably, the vSIM can be assigned any of multiple mobile devices linked to the user account and transferred between the devices. It could also be temporarily assigned to other users, says Verizon.  Backing it all up would be a vSIM platform hosted by the mobile network provider that stores a user repository of vSIMs using a number of application programming interfaces (APIs).  According to the patent:  ""In one implementation, users can accept new vSIM certificates into a user account, transfer a vSIM among client devices associated with the user account, or deliver a vSIM certificate to another user.""  This would appear to suggest that, say, a company could purchase a number of vSIMs, assign them to its staff at will and later re-assign them to other employees using the system.  Verizon has previously backed a $15m funding round for Filament, a firm working on blockchain hardware for the internet of things.

42430990,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMz4jh,1568980841,"Wells Fargo's Stablecoin 'Faster, Cheaper' Than SWIFT, Says Exec","Banking giant Wells Fargo says its blockchain for internal cross-border money transfers is faster and more efficient than SWIFT, the global messaging system used by over 11,000 financial institutions.  Unveiled this week  , Wells Fargo Digital Cash uses R3’s Corda Enterprise software to handle internal book transfers, when funds move from a payer’s account to a payee’s account at the same bank.  “When we move money across the world and we need to exchange currencies, we have to go through third parties such as SWIFT and other banks,” said Lisa Frazier, head of the Innovation Group at Wells Fargo. “That’s a long process and every time there's a connection with external parties, it takes time and energy and effort.”  Using the digital cash would allow the bank to move funds 20 hours a day, up from only six to nine hours, five days a week when it relies on wire transfers and systems like SWIFT, Frazier said.  She told CoinDesk:  “It’s faster than SWIFT, cheaper and definitely more efficient.”  Today, for internal book transfers between branches in different countries, the bank needs to use SWIFT. This is not the case for domestic internal book transfers.  The blockchain project, which will go into a pilot phase next year after a successful proof-of-concept, “will allow those locations to exchange digital cash among themselves,” Frazier said.  As with rival megabank JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, Wells Fargo’s digital cash will be backed 1-for-1 with the analog kind. “We will hold the fiat currency, so it’s a stablecoin, and we will issue digital cash tokens. These tokens are placed into digital wallets and then those tokens are able to be exchanged,” Frazier said.  Parallel paths  Frazier said Wells Fargo has been avidly participating since 2016 in blockchain tests that she described as “external,” meaning other banks and financial institutions were involved. However, the bank has also been busy pursuing internal use cases for distributed ledger technology (DLT), she said.  “I think the surprise is, we have found a really solid internal application for DLT on our book transfers. By doing this we are streamlining the book transfer process and are reducing the use of intermediaries that can cause a delay in settlement. Therefore we are widening the operating window for clearing of FX wires cross-border,” she said.  The stablecoin project also happens to be the first project the bank has built using the paid-for version of R3’s DLT, which Wells Fargo has now licensed -- with more to follow on the platform, the bank added.  SWIFT declined to comment, but the messaging system itself is collaborating with R3 on a number of projects, such as a proof of concept to connect the former’s gpi to the latter’s Corda to enable “off-ledger” payment settlement. The results of this PoC will be revealed at Sibos 2019. Corda Settler, the Corda Network’s open-source payments engine, has also been tested with the cryptocurrency XRP.  However, Wells Fargo scotched any suggestion the bank would be connecting its digital coins to anything outside its own internal payments systems.  “R3’s Corda Enterprise was selected as the platform for our first enterprise DLT network, not CordaSettler,” said a spokesman for the bank. “Wells Fargo Digital Cash is an internal settlement service which will not be associated or connected to any other potential digital cash solutions emerging in the financial services markets today.”  Alex Lipton, a former bank executive, trader and quant, said Wells Fargo’s coin is potentially very useful for simplifying the “bank's byzantine internal processes,” but not something that will see much usage outside the bank and a handful of close partners.  “Large banks are so bad that they have to use SWIFT like everyone else, so in effect, they don't differentiate between inside and outside of banks. So, a coin can help. But it is a sign of desperation,” said Lipton, now co-founder and chief technical officer at fintech firm Sila.  Another JPM Coin?  At first blush, Well Fargo’s digital cash may appear to be another JPM Coin, the much-vaunted technology built using Quorum, the privacy-centric version of ethereum developed by JPMorgan.  Although initially intended for payments between clients, the coin will eventually be used to digitally fund enterprise blockchain projects such as on-chain debt issuances, JPMorgan executives have said.  JPM also boasts 344 banks on its Interbank Information Network (IIN), which uses Quorum to eradicate pain points in the way information circulates within foreign correspondent banking.  Frazier played down any similarities between JPM Coin and Wells Fargo Digital Cash. “I think they are very different,” she said.  Wells Fargo is not a member of IIN, but Frazier hinted at a long-term plan for interoperability.  She concluded:  “Eventually in the future, there will be interoperable networks. As these emerging technologies come out of a nascent stage all kinds of things can happen.”  Wells Fargo image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/20/wells-fargos-stablecoin-faster-cheaper-than-swift-says-exec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4feedd9216044ac61a1e86b34bccd83606fceca7-2560x1921.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430993,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMz4lh,1568977211,Bitcoin’s $780 Price Recovery Makes Friday’s Close Pivotal,"View  Bitcoin created a bullish hammer candle yesterday, making today’s UTC close pivotal. A close above $10,380 (candle’s high) will likely invite stronger buying pressure and yield a rise toward $11,000.  A high-volume move above $10,822 would confirm a triangle breakout on the daily chart and signal a resumption of the rally from $4,000.  Prices may fall back to Thursday’s low of $9,600 if the cryptocurrency fails to hold above $10,000 in the next 24 hours.      Bitcoin’s $780 recovery from an 18-day low has neutralized the bearish setup, but a strong follow-through is now needed to put the bulls back in charge.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value picked up a bid around $9,600 – the lowest level since Sept. 1 – in the Asian trading hours on Thursday and rose to a high of $10,380 on Bitstamp in the U.S. trading hours.  That quick recovery saved the day for the bulls, as the cryptocurrency was looking weak below key support at $9,855, as discussed yesterday.  Notably, the price bounce from $9,600 to $10,380 has taken the shape of a candlestick pattern named “bullish hammer”, as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  A bullish hammer comprises a long lower shadow, a small body and little or no upper shadow. It occurs when an asset erases a big early drop to end the day on a positive note at or near the day’s high.  On Thursday, BTC fell to $9,600 only to rise all the way back to $10,380 before printing a UTC close at $10,271 – up 1.18 percent on the day.  A hammer is widely considered an early warning of an impending rally. However, traders usually wait for a strong follow-through – preferably a UTC close above the hammer candle’s high – before hitting the market with fresh bids.  The focus, therefore, is on today’s UTC close. Acceptance above the hammer candle’s high of $10,380 will likely invite stronger buying pressure and yield a rise to $11,000.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,140 on Bitstamp, having clocked a high of $10,308 earlier today.  Hourly chart  BTC has created a bull flag – a continuation pattern on the hourly chart. A breakout, if confirmed, would imply a resumption of the rally from $9,600 and create room for a rally to $10,950 (target as per the measured move method).  The probability of BTC printing a convincing close well above $10,380 would rise if the flag ends with a bullish breakout.  While a close above $10,380 is expected to bode well for BTC, a full bull revival needs an upside break of a three-month contracting triangle seen in the chart below.  Contracting triangle chart  The upper and lower edges of the triangle are currently located at $10,822 and $9,450, respectively.  A close above $10,822, if confirmed, would imply a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,000 seen on April 2.  The lower edge may come into play if the cryptocurrency closes below $10,000 today, taking the shine off the bullish hammer candle.

42430984,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMz4Xh,1568971809,Venezuela's Maduro Mandates Petro Use in Funding of Housing Project,"Venezuela's president has ordered that his pet cryptocurrency, the petro, must be used in funding an ongoing social housing initiative.  According to a news announcement on the government's website Thursday, President Nicolas Maduro mandated that the oil-backed petro token must be used for constructing new homes under the Great Housing Mission Venezuela – a project set up by his predecessor Hugo Chaves in 2011.  The news was announced by Venezuela's Minister for Habitat and Housing, Ildemaro Villarroel.  Villarroel said that using the petro would allow private investors to finance the construction of social housing through the stock market. Four thousand homes are planned as part of the petro payments scheme, with 4,740 already under construction, the minister added, according to Cuba's state news agency.  Joselit Ramírez, superintendent of the cryptocurrency initiative, said that the petro is a ""brilliant idea"" from the president in the fight against economic sanctions.  The move appears to be another attempt by Maduro to shoehorn his controversial crypto into the nation's economy.  The president has previously order that the petro be made available to the public by the nation's top bank, and forced pensions to be paid out in petros, despite there being limited ways to access the value of the token.  He's also attempted to persuade other nations to accept the petro as an alternative to the U.S. dollar in the oil markets and for global trade.  With the token openly stated to be a means of circumventing international sanctions, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the petro last March – soon after the token's launch.

Korean news agency Yonhap said in a report Thursday that the initiative is being led by CJ OliveNetworks, a subsidiary of the CJ Corp parent company that operates the beauty retail and technology business of the conglomerate.  The digital copyright system will keep a history of the broadcasting of copyrighted songs and store the information on the blockchain. The goal is to allow the owners and users of the material to share the resulting ledger and arrive at an equitable payment scheme for the use of the copyrighted intellectual property.  “It is very important to have a system that guarantees fairness and transparency among copyright stakeholders,"" Kim Eung-do, a director of the DT Convergence Research Institute at CJ OliveNetworks, was quoted as saying in a report from business outlet Hankyung. “The blockchain-based copyright management system will greatly contribute to improving the copyright management process.”  The CJ Group is South Korea's 14th largest conglomerate and has 31 trillion won ($25.9 billion) in assets, according to the latest Fair Trade Commission data. Its business lines include food and beverage, logistics, beauty stores, IT, entertainment and a cinema chain.  CJ OliveNetworks operates OliveYoung, one of the country's K-beauty leaders, and has an IT division that does everything from internet of things to cloud computing to Big Data.

42382692,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9seFl,1568961051,Ripple Avoids Securities Question in Motion to Dismiss XRP Lawsuit,"Ripple has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit claiming it violated U.S. securities laws by selling XRP.  In a new filing posted early Friday, attorneys for Ripple pushed back on allegations made by XRP purchasers suing the company, its subsidiaries and executives. Notably, the motion to dismiss specifically claims that the plaintiff, Bradley Sostack, does not have standing to file a complaint, rather than address claims that XRP is a security.  In the motion to dismiss  , Ripple states that the plaintiff failed to bring a case within three years of the initial offering (which would have been 2013), meaning the statute of repose expired; that the plaintiff did not ""plausibly allege"" that he purchased XRP during the initial offering; and that the plaintiff did not ""plausibly allege"" that any of the defendants actually sold the XRP that he bought.  Notably absent from the motion to dismiss is a full-fledged argument over why XRP is not a security. Indeed, the filing only addresses the question in a footnote (footnote 19), which states that XRP is not a security ""because it is not an 'investment contract.'""  The filing goes on to say:  ""Purchasing XRP is not an 'investment' in Ripple; there is no common enterprise between Ripple and XRP purchasers; there was no promise that Ripple would help generate profits for XRP holders; and the XRP Ledger is decentralized.""  The footnote also adds that ""because XRP is a currency,"" it cannot also be a security under law. The filing states that the court itself does not need to determine ""whether XRP is a security or currency for purposes of this motion, which assumes Plaintiff's allegation that XRP is a security.""  The filing also states that ""the federal Departments of Treasury and Justice publicly concluded that XRP is a 'convertible virtual currency,'"" in its ""factual background"" section.  ""This is consistent with the CFTC’s position that virtual currency is a commodity,"" the filing states. ""Nonetheless, Plaintiff alleges that XRP is a 'security' under federal and state law, ... and that Defendants have offered and sold XRP despite its non-registration with securities authorities.""  Moving to dismiss  Ripple's actual arguments focus on when the most recent case has been filed, with the first hinging around the fact that XRP entered the market in 2013. The filing states:  ""... under Plaintiff's own allegations, Defendants offered XRP to the public throughout 2013 through 2015. Accordingly, the three-year statute of repose expired as of 2016 (three years after the sales cited in the May 2015 settlement) and in no case later than May 2018 (three years after the May 2015 settlement agreement in which 'Defendants acknowledged that they had sold XRP to the general public,' Complaint ¶ 25). The Securities Act claims in the Complaint, filed August 5, 2019, are therefore untimely and barred by the statute of repose.""  The filing adds that the plaintiff does not claim he bought XRP directly from Ripple or another defendant, but rather, ""he was part of the 'general public' who purchased XRP through transactions in a two-week period in January 2018.""  ""The necessary inference is that he bought and sold XRP through a secondary trading exchange,"" the filing says.  The response also states that plaintiff's consumer protection claims under California state law (rather than federal securities law) should be dismissed because the statutes require a securities claim.  As a result, the response says, the complaint should be dismissed with prejudice (meaning plaintiffs would not be able to re-file the suit).  ""Leave to amend should be denied because amendment would be futile.""  Year-long case  Ripple's filing comes a month and a half after the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, alleging the company, affiliated entities and individuals violated both state and federal securities laws.  The new complaint, filed by law firms Susman Godfrey and Tayler-Copeland Law, alleges that Ripple, its subsidiary XRP II, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and others violated securities law by selling XRP. In a first, the complaint borrowed from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's digital assets framework, drawing parallels between the SEC's analysis for what constitutes a security and Ripple's alleged actions.  The case itself stretches back to early 2018, when XRP purchasers first began filing lawsuits against Ripple. The complaints alleged that Ripple sold XRP, using the proceeds to fund its operations. The cases were consolidated into the current form.  While the class has not been certified yet, Thursday's filing is still the first time Ripple has had to respond to the substance of the complaints against it.  At the heart of the matter is the question of whether XRP is a security. Some of Ripple's detractors claim it is, one that is issued and managed by Ripple. The startup disagrees, saying XRP is a token created by Jed McCaleb (now at Interstellar), Arthur Britto and David Schwartz.  It remains to be seen whether the case proceeds to a jury trial, or if settlement talks occur first. However, the filing notes that there is a hearing scheduled for early next year, and the attorneys say they are willing to argue the motion then.  Legal team shake up  Friday's filing comes just days after Ripple brought Damien Marshall and Kathleen Hartnett, two lawyers with Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, on board to work on the case (a judge approved their appearance for the case on Sept. 17).  They join Skadden Arps attorneys Peter Morrison, John Neukom and Virgina Milstead, who have been listed on the docket but whose names did not appear on the filing Friday morning.  On Thursday night, former SEC Division of Enforcement director Andrew Ceresney also applied to join the case as a lawyer for Ripple. Ceresney is currently an attorney with Debevoise & Plimpton, an international law firm based in New York, and his name appeared on Friday's filing.  He previously represented Ripple against one of the previous class action lawsuits, filed by plaintiff Ryan Coffey, alongside former SEC Chair Mary Jo White.  That case was voluntarily dismissed, and White's work for Ripple appears to have ended around that time.

42382701,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9seR5,1568959212,What the Holy Land Reveals About Bitcoin,"When hundreds of entrepreneurs, investors and technologists descended on Tel Aviv Blockchain Week (TLVBW), few could have expected a better backdrop for exploring the lofty ideals and greedy impulses that drive today’s cryptocurrency industry.  Duality is something Israelis know well.  More than 430 people attended the D&DD Summit on Sept. 10, several dozen came to the Scaling Bitcoin conference on Sept. 11 and 700 attended the first Israeli Ethereal on Sept. 15, just to name a few of the week’s dozen events.  Venues were packed with crypto tourists sipping espressos and pontificating on typical blockchain fodder: token governance, “mainstream” adoption and the immaturity of those other “vaporware” shills.  But while tech-savvy Tel Aviv represented the profit-driven side of the blockchain industry, nearby Jerusalem offered TLVBW visitors the chance to commune with the timeless notions of freedom that lie at the heart of the decentralization movement.  Although cryptocurrency isn’t a panacea, it may still have unique value in this conflict-riddled land paved with ancient stones.  Startup nation  For a country of roughly 8 million people, Israel has a disproportionately large impact on the global crypto market.  International companies like Tezos, Telegram and even Facebook’s Calibra subsidiary all have teams working in Tel Aviv’s high-tech hub. Some of the industry’s biggest token sales also hailed from Israel, including Bancor, Sirin Labs and Orbs. Furthermore, Israel is home to the world’s leading researchers of zero-knowledge proofs, a privacy technology that underlies both Zcash and upcoming ethereum developments.  Youval Rouach, CEO of Israeli bitcoin exchange Bits of Gold, told CoinDesk his startup has 55,000 local users. Nir Hirshman of the Israeli Bitcoin Association (IBA) told CoinDesk there are nearly 50 blockchain startups in Israel, although few target the local market because of a conservative regulatory climate.  The industry remains largely unbanked, for example.  “No bank has agreed to open an account for us [the IBA],” IBA chairman Meni Rosenfeld said. “So we cannot even register members properly.”  Being unbanked is something many Palestinians grapple with as well, including East Jerusalemite Rami Mohammad Ali, a bitcoin miner and trader.  Ali spent his blockchain week traipsing across Tel Aviv to buy bitcoin and bring it back to his Palestinian customers. He told CoinDesk more than 50 customers buy a cumulative total of up to 20 bitcoin a month (roughly $200,000 at current prices, a fortune in poverty-stricken East Jerusalem).  “My customers always leave me with a balance of zero. No matter how much I buy, they always demand more,” he said. “I find the best price to buy in Tel Aviv and the best price to sell in Jerusalem.”  The Palestinian presence was not altogether absent from the TLVBW lineup itself. Nine Palestinians from Ramallah attended Ethereal Tel Aviv, a rare occurrence that required sponsorship from crypto startup Orbs for obtaining the necessary government permits for crossing into Israel.  One such attendee was Hiba Shabin of the Ramallah-based software company Jaffa Net, which has already worked on an ethereum pilot project for certificate sharing among educational institutions and businesses.  “I believe we should have more collaboration,” Shabin told CoinDesk, speaking of how she hopes Israeli tech companies will outsource jobs to highly educated but underemployed developers in Ramallah.  Blockchain technology can truly forge economic ties across borders. But of course, the education-focused nonprofit Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy attracted far fewer visitors this week than rooftop parties with venture capitalists.  Ethereal dreams  On the other hand, restrictive banking norms may be part of the reason decentralized finance (DeFi) apps like loans are booming.  Jaffa Net’s Shabin told CoinDesk she’s curious about DeFi because there are many unbanked Palestinians who could use such financial products.  “I need to do research and learn more about DeFi,” she said at Ethereal. “I only heard about it today.”  The Brooklyn-based venture studio ConsenSys announced at Ethereal the launch of its Codefi product suite for enterprises, especially the financial sector. Could the DeFi movement span the gap between the unbanked and the banks themselves? That appears to be the common belief.  Earlier that week, during Scaling Bitcoin, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin told CoinDesk his goal is to build a “more open, permissionless, decentralized system.”  Even if bitcoiners see a digital form of “hard money” as the primary tool for achieving this, and other crypto communities like Tezos prefer a token governance model, most groups at TLVBW shared that common goal.  “I don’t want to be a leader,” Tezos co-founder Arthur Breitman told CoinDesk, adding his aim was to create a broader movement full of independent contributors to a “decentralized platform for financial applications.”  Where I fit in  Despite my skepticism, I’m not one to judge conference attendees attracted to cryptocurrency. After all, I’m one of them. I’ve chanted the lines from “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous, repented for saving in fiat and even put a small amount of faith into this software.  It’s been more than a decade since I stumbled home through the winding Jerusalem alleyways, disillusioned by the American political system and hopeful that we could build a more fair and open society in a young country like Israel. I once drank the socialist Kibbutz-for-tourists Kool-Aid and participated in cross-cultural programs promoting “peace,” before I saw how the apparatus was monetizing sanitized idealism to protect the status quo. The revolution you’re promised is rarely the revolution you get.  Now here I am again, in the Holy Land, nursing the foolish dream of another mystical purpose. This time it’s finding the truth about “bitcoin adoption.”  The Bitcoin Core developers that gathered at Scaling Bitcoin in Tel Aviv University have collaboratively built an asset already used by thousands of people like Ali, the Palestinian bitcoin trader. Buterin funded and helped develop DeFi systems like Uniswap, which currently has $17.8 million of crypto locked within it, according to DeFi Pulse.  Yet even Buterin said in Tel Aviv he’s not sure how to measure arrival in that “open” promised land. The vast majority of current usage is basically gambling and wealth accumulation by people who already have full access to banks. Instead, Buterin described success as a feeling that his platform was used for “meaningful things,” a goal the community is creeping towards even if it has yet to secure a sustainable equilibrium.  In reality, we don’t know if cryptocurrency can provide a reliable safety net beyond the norms of financial censorship.  Holy Land hopium  Blockchain week was too intense, so I ran away to Jerusalem for a drink with a Palestinian friend I hadn’t seen in years.  We sat in a dark bar made of graffiti-covered stones, where the air is thick with hash smoke and oud music. To my surprise, this friend from my pre-bitcoin life told me he works for a crypto company in Tel Aviv and is bearish on bitcoin. From his perspective, regulations rule his financial life and that is unlikely to change.  Like many Palestinians, his family’s modest wealth is spread across jurisdictions with conflicting compliance standards. Proof of ownership isn’t a guarantee his family will be able to access their bank accounts or real estate. He’s not optimistic about his right to internet access garnering more respect from the authorities that provide such digital infrastructure. This would make bitcoin tricky, albeit not impossible, for his family to trust as a long-term store of value. Will using bitcoin require sophisticated computer skills?  Given the wide range of contexts that censorship can take, it’s impossible to say whether today’s brief glimpse of “open access” via cryptocurrency will go the way of MySpace, offering a fleeting moment of cultural significance before devolving into a punchline.  On the way back from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, surrounded by old ghosts on the road at midnight, I realized I haven’t escaped a form of Jerusalem syndrome, a psychiatric condition where tourists suffer a breakdown in the Holy Land and suddenly believe they are a supernatural being with a divine mission.  So I turned to Rosenfeld, the IBA chairman and veteran bitcoiner, to ask him if we’ve all simply caught a high-tech version of Jerusalem syndrome, evangelizing blockchain technology like zealots.  “Bitcoin sheds light on the disadvantages of the traditional financial system and offers some alternatives,” he said, adding:  “It’s not the solution for all things.”  Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin speaks at Scaling Bitcoin Tel Aviv, photo by Leigh Cuen for CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/09/20/what-the-holy-land-reveals-about-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff45aa81ee4bd1e6bd40d1b6b0b007c48180b991-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382685,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9se4R,1568946913,Byrne Sells Overstock Stake to Buy Crypto and Battle 'Deep State',"Patrick Byrne, the former CEO of Overstock who resigned abruptly in August, has dumped his 13 percent stake in the e-commerce company he founded 20 years ago to buy cryptocurrency and precious metals, he announced late yesterday.  In a blog post at his DeepCapture.com, Byrne said that, by the end of the week, he will have reinvested all of the proceeds into “investments that are counter-cyclical to the economy.”  “Gold, silver and two flavors of crypto,” he wrote.  A longtime proponent of cryptocurrency -- Overstock was one of the first companies to accept crypto payments, launched the tZERO security token trading platform and acquired the company behind Ravencoin -- Byrne was ahead of the curve, but perhaps too much so, as the external pressures against him compelled his resignation from the company last month.  Byrne's final gambit – a crypto dividend approved in July – worked to lift Overstock's share price to a 52-week high last week, but the value of the shares fell by half as his plan unraveled.  Yesterday, after the market closed, Byrne filed a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that he had sold 4.7 million Overstock shares worth $90 million. The transactions were over the previous three trading sessions, as the stock price fell from a high of $29.38 on Friday to $15.65 today.  Byrne’s blog post followed a statement from Overstock, announcing a halt to the crypto dividend policy after a New York Post report detailed the behind-the-scenes maneuvering – due to what Byrne described in his post as a leak from “the Deep State’s pets at the SEC.”  “They leaked that they were going to Bazoomba our digital dividend,” he wrote.  The November dividend was to be paid out as a digital security listed on tZERO. The dividend was actually a digital rights issue that would grant one digital voting series A-1 preferred stock, representing 10 shares of common stock, or 10 shares of voting series B preferred stock, that could only be traded through a Dinosaur Financial Group brokerage account and that only after being held for a six-month waiting period.  Overstock told the SEC in the filing that a new crypto dividend would be announced shortly that would exclude the long holding period and other restrictions to allow the digital rights to be traded freely and immediately.  The “leak” to the New York Post revealed that the crypto dividend was conceived by Byrne as a means to squeeze Overstock’s short sellers, who he knew would reject its complications and wind-up their positions.  The plan actually worked as Overstock’s share price surged. That is, until Byrne's own sell-off began this week, as the Post reported that brokers at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were rescuing Overstock's short sellers, offering them dollars at an equivalent value to the blockchain-based stock.  In the blog post, Byrne wrote that when word reached him of Wall Street banks stepping in to stymie his short of the shortsellers, he moved into action.  “Once that started getting back to me, I realized this: Whenever I have had any question about whether the SEC would or would not do something totally outrageous in order to hurt our company to benefit their clients on Wall Street, they never let me down: they always did the evil thing. So, Pettway decided it was time to eject, especially because he knows I need the ammo to go to war against the Deep State.”  Byrne said that he would buy Overstock shares again if the company were to bottom out in a coming economic crash, while his move into crypto assets would grow his assets under those conditions.  “You will have a friend who has sunk (almost) his entire fortune into investments that will soar if a crisis occurs.”  In the meantime, he said his net worth and ""ammo"" would be more secure on the blockchain, far from the reach of his enemies.  “The crypto is stored in the place where all crypto is stored: in mathematical mist, behind long keys held only in the memory of someone who is quite good at storing such things in memory (with paper backups in the hands of a priest I met 35 years ago who never sits [sic] foot in the West).”  “The other thing accomplished by the investment moves I described above is that my ammunition gets moved outside acts of retaliation from the Deep State. That is important because, in fact, I am now going to shellac them. Actually, ‘shellac’ is too weak a word for what I intend to do to the Deep State. Sit back and enjoy the show.”  The gallivanting, roguish, 6’8” executive resigned from Overstock last month after admitting to his affair with the Russian spy Maria Butina, in an attempt to avoid dragging the company further into the personal scandal.  Butina, who is now in jail for ""conspiracy to act as an agent for a foreign government,"" entered the US with a student visa to attend a dinner party in New York City hosted by Rockefeller heir George O’Neill for his Center of National Interest think tank that tries to bring the US and Russia together. In addition to the Rockefeller scion, her case ensnared the former head of the National Rifle Association and a gunrunner caught up in the 1980s Iran-Contra scandal, all three deemed her handlers here.  In a brief and bewildering letter to his shareholders  , and filed with the SEC, Byrne confirmed the affair and claimed he had several roles as a confidential informant for law enforcement.  Byrne said that Warren Buffet had advised him to come clean and leave his job to prevent Overstock from being further enmeshed in a spy-versus-spy battle that had nothing to due with the online furniture business. Or crypto currencies, for that matter, although Byrne believes his enemies were motivated to target him because of his crypto evangelism.
