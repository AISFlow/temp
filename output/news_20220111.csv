42396246,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1lsK,1641943523,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin, Altcoins Climb Following Fed Reserve Chief's Inflation Reassurances","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin led a broad crypto recovery ahead of the U.S. CPI release.  Technician’s take: Buyers started to return to the market, although the upside seemed limited to the $45,000 level.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $42,806 +2.4%  Ether (ETH): $3,240 +5.2%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,713 +0.9%  DJIA: $36,252 +0.5%  Nasdaq: $15,153 +1.4%  Gold: $1,821 +1.1%  Market moves  Bitcoin went up as high as $43,106 on Tuesday, leading a broad market recovery in crypto. The move came after the stock market in the U.S. halted its five-day rout ahead of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release on Wednesday.  At the time of publication, the most valued cryptocurrency was changing hands above $42,800, up over 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  Bloomberg reported the stock market climbed on Tuesday after Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, reassured investors the Fed will combat the current high inflation, signaling the central bank may reduce its balance sheet this year.  As CoinDesk reported, bitcoin and the broad crypto market have behaved strongly like a risk asset recently.  A key event to watch on Wednesday is the release of December’s U.S. consumer price index (CPI). Economists anticipate a 0.5% month-to-month increase in CPI to 7.1%.  In the past two months, bitcoin’s price experienced high volatility after the CPI data release. While some crypto traders and investors view bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, others consider it as a risk asset like stocks, which react to tightened monetary policy resulting from high inflation.  Most other major cryptocurrencies also rose on Tuesday. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up over 5% to above $3,200, at the time of publication. Layer 1 token NEAR remained the biggest winner. It is up nearly 13% over the past week despite the crypto sell-off.  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Rises From Oversold Levels, Faces Resistance Near $45K  Bitcoin (BTC) went trading above the $40,000 support level and was up about 3% over the past 24 hours from 9 p.m. UTC. Buyers are starting to return to the market, although the upside appeared to be limited to the $45,000 resistance level, which is also near the 200-day moving average.  On intraday charts, upside momentum is improving, which suggests buyers could remain active into the Asia trading day.  BTC is the most oversold since Dec. 10, according to the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart. Typically, oversold readings precede price recoveries, similar to what occurred in late September. This time, however, price reaction to the RSI and other indicators have been delayed.  Still, on the weekly chart, the RSI is not yet oversold, which decreases the chance of significant buying pressure.

Powell, who was nominated for a second term as Fed chairman by President Joe Biden, was asked about the timing of the report by Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) during his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Banking Committee.  Read more: LIVE BLOG: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Appears Before the Senate Banking Committee  “We didn’t get it to quite where we needed to get it,” Powell said about the report’s delays. “But it’s effectively there now, it’s within weeks [that] we will be publishing it.”  Powell’s testimony echoes similar remarks he made at a Senate hearing in November, when he promised the release of the report in “coming weeks.” Two months earlier, he said it was coming “soon.” And last July, he promised the report would be published by September.  The report is expected to focus on CBDCs, a subject the Fed is researching and a popular topic of discussion at congressional hearings where Powell is called as a witness.  At Tuesday’s hearing, Powell was asked by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the committee's ranking member, whether a CBDC couldn't coexist with “well-regulated, privately issued stablecoins,” if Congress gave the Fed the authority to pursue the digital currency.  “No, not at all,” Powell responded.  Toomey also cast doubt on the Fed’s authority to act as a retail bank for Americans.  “It seems to me that there is absolutely nothing in the history, the experience, the expertise, the capabilities of the Fed that lends the Fed to being a retail bank. Is that a fair observation?” Toomey asked.

42396240,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1lmQ,1641937453,"One Day After Launch, OpenSea Competitor LooksRare Sells Over $100M in NFTs","After months of speculation about a possible vampire attack, dominant NFT marketplace OpenSea may finally have a worthy – and more thoroughly decentralized – competitor: LooksRare.  According to a Dune Analytics dashboard, in the past 24 hours the fledgling non-fungible token marketplace has hosted $105 million in trading volume, generating 613 ETH (nearly $2 million) in platform fees to be distributed to LOOKS token stakers in the coming hours, according to pseudonymous co-founder Zodd:  OpenSea, meanwhile – the dominant force in NFTs, often commanding in excess of 90% of the sector’s total trading volume – saw $169 million in volume on Monday and is narrowly keeping pace with LooksRare on Tuesday, also with $105 million in sales.  So far, traders are betting LooksRare has at least temporary staying power. Over 75,000 Ethereum addresses have claimed a LOOKS airdrop worth an average of $3,500, and the token is on the precipice of breaking the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market cap, up 38% on the day to $3.58.  The numbers point to a searing-hot start for a day-old platform that seems to fill a clear market demand. For months, NFT traders have clamored for OpenSea to release a token and decentralize portions of its operations. The incumbent’s policies around enforcing IP as well as delisting hacked or exploited NFTs has made it a target of critics who say it’s a rent-seeking middleman in a decentralized ecosystem. The firm was recently valued at $13.3 billion.  Read more: NFT Marketplace OpenSea Valued at $13.3B in $300M Funding Round  Looking past the flashy numbers, however, there may be signs that LooksRare’s surge could soon ebb – specifically, that a large portion of its remarkable volume is attributable to traders “wash trading” in order to farm platform token rewards.  The question is: Will traders return to OpenSea if token incentives can’t keep them around?  Favorable conditions  In many ways, LooksRare had the good fortune of launching at an unusually opportune time.  OpenSea has recently been a popular punching bag for critics, both within and without the crypto community. For months ideologically motivated users have griped about 2.5% platform fees routed to OpenSea’s team rather than to users, the lack of a token and about the marketplace’s at times patchwork enforcement of intellectual property claims.  Additionally, OpenSea’s opaque policies around delisting hacked or exploit items has become a target for critics of Web 3, such as Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike, who argue that the emerging technological movement’s claims to decentralization are undermined by reliance on centralized third parties.  Read more: Is Moxie Marlinspike Right About Web 3?  These conditions prompted observers to ponder whether a competitor could take OpenSea’s crown via a “vampire attack” multiple times over the past year – a term for an effort to sap volume from an incumbent protocol via superior incentives often seen in decentralized finance (DeFi). Previous efforts, such as prolific developer Andre Cronje’s open-source Artion marketplace, have largely failed to put a dent in the multibillion-dollar NFT behemoth, however.  In addition to the narrative tailwinds supporting a push from a decentralized alternative like LooksRare, market conditions also currently favor the platform’s launch.  Amid a broader crypto market rout, NFTs are showing impressive signs of strength, mirroring a 2021 June-through-August summer dip that saw Ethereum pull back as much as 50% while NFTs reached the peak of their mania.  Indeed, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard, December was the highest sales volume month for OpenSea since August, and “floor prices,” or the lowest price at which a NFT from a collection can be bought, have rebounded for major collections like CryptoPunks, which are up nearly 20% off November lows.  Wash trading?  While conditions appear right for the platform’s launch, LooksRare’s early success isn’t entirely attributable to natural demand.  As multiple observers have pointed out, a large portion of LooksRare’s volume is likely being generated from wash trading, which refers to the practice of wallets typically controlled by the same party “selling” assets back and forth.  Read more: Andre Cronje’s New NFT Marketplace Is a Vampire Attack Suicide Pact  Currently, the protocol is rewarding buyers and sellers with 2,866,500 LOOKS tokens (over $10 million) per day based on volumes traded and will continue to do so for the next 30 days before progressively cutting emissions, according to the documentation.  Collections without royalty fees, such as Larva Labs’ Meebits, are among the most popular, with many “floor” Meebits generally worth 3.5 ETH or lower trading for as much as 30 ETH.  However, the team has warned that attempting to game the rewards in this manner could quickly turn unprofitable because the 2% platform fee incurred during wash trades may outstrip rewards earned.  “Each trade on LooksRare (except for private sales) incurs a platform fee of 2%, and typically a royalty fee of between 5%-10%. The total LOOKS rewards for trading each day are also fixed, and distributed based on traders’ contribution to total trading volume, meaning that there’s no guarantee of the amount of rewards that a wash trader could earn in a day,” reads the documentation.  As with many “liquidity mining” schemes, where platforms reward users for providing liquidity and activity, it remains to be seen whether LooksRare’s volume will remain sticky as the LOOKS rewards spigot turns to a trickle in the coming months.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/11/one-day-after-launch-opensea-competitor-looksrare-sells-over-100m-in-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4edee92402afb8a9f7a845104fde2efcd7330ebc-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396242,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1loO,1641936212,Market Wrap: Bitcoin and Equities Stabilize as Sentiment Improves,"Bitcoin rose toward $43,000 on Tuesday and is up about 3% over the past 24 hours. Several alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as MATC and FTM were up about 14% over the same period, suggesting a greater appetite for risk among investors.  It appears that bullish sentiment is starting to return to both crypto and equity markets, at least over the short term. Technical indicators suggest that BTC is at its most oversold level since December, which could encourage some traders to buy on the dip, although upside could be limited toward $45,000.  The sell-off has had a negative impact on crypto mining stocks over the past couple of months. Shares of the U.S.-listed mining companies Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Bit Digital (BTBT) have dropped more than 50% each since Nov. 10.  Still, some miners appear to be unfazed by the price dip. For example, bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms purchased 1,000 bitcoins worth $43.2 million during the first week of January.  For some traders, however, losses are starting to add up. Blockchain data shows that more traders are selling BTC at a loss, or below their cost basis. “In May 2021 (during a sharp sell-off) we’ve seen a similar type of behavior when the market kept selling at a loss for an extended period of time,” CryptoQuant wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $41,785, +2.33%  Ether (ETH): $3,239, +5.02%  S&P 500: $4,713, +0.92%  Gold: $1,822, +1.31%  10-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.74%  For now, it appears that most buyers are remaining on the sidelines, especially ahead of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report, which will be released on Wednesday.  “The market expects the CPI to rise 7.1% for the year through December and 0.4% over the month. If the figure released is larger than expected, we can expect further sell pressure for bitcoin,” Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “Due to the selling we have seen in recent weeks, the downside for BTC is limited in the short term, even with higher-than-expected inflation data on Wednesday,” Sotiriou wrote.  Rising correlation with stocks  The chart below shows bitcoin’s 90-day correlation with the S&P 500 approaching its highest level in about a year. Some analysts are concerned that macroeconomic risks facing equities could weigh on crypto prices this year.  “Cryptocurrencies are on a par with growth stocks – they are sensitive to the dynamics of interest rates,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Higher interest rates mean company earnings over the next few years are worth less today, which can result in lower valuations and stock prices.  “At the same time, we must not forget that cryptocurrencies are more mobile, that is, they sometimes lose twice or three times more than the Nasdaq. If so, then cryptocurrencies are far from the bottom, since the process of normalizing interest rates in financial markets is far from complete,” Kuptsikevich wrote.  Other analysts expect bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 to eventually decline this year.  “Bitcoin’s correlation with equities won’t hold up this year as stocks are only a few percentage points from record highs, while bitcoin is down around 40%,” Edward Moya, an analyst at Oanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “The focus over the next few months will be the Fed’s aggressive rate hiking cycle and how quickly they shrink the balance sheet, which could be much more negative for stocks than bitcoin,” Moya wrote.  Moya expects an economic recovery in countries outside the U.S. later this year could lead to a weaker dollar. In turn, a lower dollar will reduce inflationary pressures and provide support for assets deemed to be risky such as cryptocurrencies and equities.  And over the long term, economic factors will continue to affect crypto and equity prices alike, especially as more traditional investors gain exposure to both assets, he said.  “What's different between now and the much larger drawdown in 2018 is we are seeing more permanent capital that has come into the space within the last year or so. That can mean more correlation with the traditional markets,"" Paul Veradittakit, a partner at Pantera Capital, a crypto hedge fund, said during an interview on CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" show.  Altcoin roundup  Near and Cosmos outperformed: Tokens of Near (NEAR) and Cosmos (ATOM) were among the only gainers for major cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours. NEAR posted gains of 17% in the past 24 hours and ATOM added as much as 8% to over $39.33 before a brief pullback.

42396250,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1lnP,1641935113,Traders Will Be Watching if December CPI Confirms Inflation at 4-Decade High,"Bitcoin traders have been betting for years the largest cryptocurrency by market cap could serve as an effective hedge against inflation. That's why they'll be watching Wednesday as the U.S. Labor Department publishes its Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for December.  The widely followed CPI, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET (13:30 UTC), is expected to show an acceleration in inflation, already at the highest point in 39 years, from the prior month.  A faster-than-expected uptick in prices could spur the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy aggressively over the next few months. That, in turn, could put more downward pressure on risky assets from stocks to bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.  The CPI is estimated to have risen 7.1% in the 12 months through December, according to data from FactSet. On a month-to-month, seasonally adjusted basis, the headline index probably rose 0.4%.  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy movements, is forecast to rise 0.5% month over month.  The report will be of special interest for the cryptocurrency investors who look at bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. The U.S. inflation rate surged to 6.8% in November, the highest since 1982.  Bitcoin prices quadrupled in 2020 and rose about 60% last year when traders said the Fed's loose monetary policies could ultimately lead to a fast climb in consumer prices.  But as inflation ticked up, and Fed officials signaled they would move aggressively to tackle inflation, the price trend has reversed: Bitcoin is down more than 13% over the past 30 days.  Here is what some experts expect from Wednesday’s report:  Daniel Bachman, U.S. economic forecaster at Deloitte Insights, told CoinDesk: “I would expect the December CPI to remain fairly high. … But what’s more important is that these supply chain pressures are temporary and are already showing a few signs of easing. … By the middle of 2022 I expect CPI inflation to be in the 2.0% to 2.5% range.""  Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a market update: “I'm not sure the inflation data tomorrow is going to put investors' minds at ease, with CPI seen hitting a multi-decade high above 7%. A higher reading could spook investors once again just as equity markets appear to be stabilizing.”  What this could mean for bitcoin:  Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at bitbank: “According to the CME’s FedWatch, almost 70% of the market participants are expecting the March rate hike, so bitcoin may be able to defend $40K in case of another sell-off, but it certainly is not the time for optimism in the short run.”  Scott Bauer, chief executive officer at Prosper Trading Academy: “With regards to BTC, the risk-off overhang is front and center. It does appear as if institutions are ready to pounce as leverage has been getting slowly flushed out of the system, even with outflows the last few weeks of institutional funds being fairly large. The downward move in BTC over the last few weeks has happened on low volume, which could lead to the possibility of a huge short covering event.”  “The key thing in reading tomorrow’s release is to understand the underlying causes of the current inflation, rather than focusing on the actual number,” Erlam said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/11/traders-will-be-watching-if-december-cpi-confirms-inflation-at-4-decade-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62977461176f7c8fe63daf656aaa0b40b8154b4b-1998x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411557,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOsNt,1641934389,Kevin O'Leary's Crypto Investing Playbook,"Kevin O’Leary is a centimillionaire, a businessperson on reality TV and a crypto bag holder. He’s one of many, many traditional investors with public profiles to make big moves into the crypto market last year during the biggest run-up to date. He’s invested in startups, draws yields by staking his stablecoins and has allocations across 32 different cryptocurrencies, he said on CoinDesk TV Tuesday morning.  “Multiple equities, multiple tokens, multiple coins, multiple blockchains,” O’Leary told the “First Mover” hosts. “I own so many of them.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  O’Leary, 67 and born in Canada, has made a career out of investing. But it’s not just his job, it’s his persona. He’s “Mr. Wonderful”. He’s a shark who invests in cupcake companies. He’s the guy who calls it as he sees it: Investments either win or lose. It’s that “binary.”  Yet, when it comes to crypto, O’Leary is an advocate for diversification. He says his largest holding today is ETH, the native currency of the Ethereum network, and he has also bought BTC, SOL, MATIC and 28 other coins. Likewise, seeing crypto exchanges as potentially lucrative, he sees a world where both decentralized and centralized exchanges can win.  Last week, his decentralized finance play, WonderFi, bought a regulated Canadian exchange in a cash and stock deal.  “In my world, I can go all the way to 20% in crypto, and within that subset no position will be larger than 5%,” he said. “That is a very sound mandate of diversification. You will get the rise of crypto. Not all will be equal. … I'm not going to get wrecked if one 5% position goes to zero.”  Although spread wide, O’Leary says these investments are not random. Drawing a comparison to Microsoft and Google, he views cryptocurrencies as “​​productivity software.” Bitcoin is not a coin, there’s no physical counterpart, it’s code, he said. Likewise for tools like Polygon, which is trying to bolster Ethereum’s lackluster throughput. He doesn’t “play” with meme coins, favoring “real productivity.”  “I don't know which of these platforms is going to win. That's why I own them all,” he said. “I'm investing in the long-term future of a global enterprise.”  That’s a fine statement for a millionaire to make, but probably unrealistic for the many everyday people looking to bet on crypto. But it’s consistent with Mr. Wonderful’s view of the industry. Among crypto fanatics there’s a large emphasis on bitcoin being a tool of personal responsibility. Bitcoiners advocate self-reliance, self-custody and the self-management of time horizons.  But for O’Leary, crypto is better seen as a sub-sector of the largest economy. He proffered a phrase, “the 12th sector of the S&P,” referring to the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index, for his vision of mass adoption. “The real potential of crypto is not just an individual's, it’s institutional capital,” he said. “You need to attract it.”  Indeed, as O’Leary notes, “the smartest hands over the keyboard now are in crypto.” Venture and regular old capitalists have plowed “billions of dollars” into crypto the past two years.  Recently, there has been something of a populist revolt against this trend. Block CEO Jack Dorsey, Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike and countless others have spoken out against the presence of large crypto bagholders in the market who tilt the scale and potentially reintroduce centralization into supposedly decentralized tech. Although rich themselves, they represent a real view.  Read more: What Jack Dorsey’s Beef With ‘Web 3′ Is Really About | Opinion  Millennial market commentator Kyla Scanlon wrote just yesterday about this “narrative” war. Web 3 is also likely to be interpreted as “a promenade of wealth” as “an equitable, cooperative, and accessible” version of the web that the tech presents.  O’Leary, again, straddles the binary. Decentralized finance can make markets more transparent, resilient and less expensive, he said, but the benefits will probably accrue to the top. “You're going to see massive amounts of institutional capital come into this because of the economic value,” he said.  That is, if we can just get a little regulatory clarity, O’Leary said. He shared the story of what happened to his capital gains from investing in real estate after he exited the market. Instead of parking his cash at a bank where he’d lose buying power due to inflation, he wanted a stake in the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC on FTX (a crypto exchange he’s invested in and is a paid spokesperson for).  It took six months to set the arrangement up, and it’s still less than ideal. “Within my own compliance department, they do not consider stablecoins cash, they consider it equity” so he can’t hold more than 5% due to compliance concerns.  “Right now I need, I really need, the regulator to make policy on stablecoin,” he said, referring to the asset class in the singular.  This isn’t the first time O’Leary has called for regulations. Last year, he played a major role in drumming up environmental concerns against bitcoin, saying that for institutions to get involved they need an ESG-friendly option. Regulation is needed, as are eco-friendly miners to create distinct versions of clean and dirty bitcoin.  O’Leary is a skilled investor and spokesperson.

The Mnuchin files  The narrative  CoinDesk filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the U.S. Treasury Department for former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s crypto-related emails. We received 250 pages of emails that shed light on everything from the department’s response to sanctions concerns from other nations to who advocated for central bank digital currencies within the former administration. (Hint: He was related to the last president.)  Why it matters  FOIA requests are a powerful tool for helping to shed light on how policymakers are approaching questions of regulation. Today’s report by CoinDesk shows how the Treasury Department under former President Donald Trump broadly viewed crypto, with other interesting tidbits sprinkled throughout.  Breaking it down  I just want to highlight some key findings from our report. To me, the most significant finding was that Oleksandr Bornyakov, the deputy minister of digital transformation in Ukraine, reached out to the State and Treasury departments asking for help.  The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control issued sanctions on Russian individuals involved in the annexation of Crimea in 2020. A number of crypto exchanges, including Bittrex, Coinbase and Gemini, responded by pulling out of the entire country of Ukraine.  Bornyakov asked the U.S. officials to clarify the sanctions compliance requirements, noting that Ukraine itself was not under the same economic embargo as Crimea.  No one at Treasury returned his email.  That seems to be one common theme. A number of emails included in the FOIA response came from industry participants trying to provide or gain feedback about various issues, such as the FinCEN wallet proposal. Some of these emails were shunted to deputies or lower-level officials, while others did not receive a response at all.  I’d recommend reading the full article – six of us worked on this to make sure it’s as comprehensive as possible. We also made the full set of responsive documents available here. (CoinDesk redacted only some personal information like email addresses.)  We have a number of other outstanding public information requests. One of these is a Freedom of Information Law request to the New York Attorney General’s Office for documents about Tether’s reserves, provided to the investigative entity as part of its inquiry into the stablecoin issuer. Tether has petitioned a New York court to block the release of these documents. Last week, CoinDesk joined the legal case as an intervenor. You can read CoinDesk’s filings here.  Tether, for its part, believes the release of these documents will put it at a competitive disadvantage, and said in a public statement that the FOIL request is tied to CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group, also being an investor in Circle, which issues the USDC stablecoin.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Rostin Behnam was sworn in as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week, after nearly a year in the acting chairman role. The Senate confirmed Behnam in December. The regulator last year said he believes the CFTC could play a bigger role in overseeing the crypto spot markets, citing trading volume for bitcoin and ether on U.S. exchanges.  Elsewhere:  The Inside Story of How India’s Crypto Exchanges Were ‘Inspected’ by Tax Agencies: Amitoj Singh spoke to government officials and industry sources about India’s investigation into whether crypto exchanges were paying their taxes properly, and into the just over $11 million in back taxes the government collected late last year.  A16z Publishes Web 3 Policy Proposal for World Leaders: Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) published a policy proposal for countries trying to build Web 3 frameworks. This comes in response to questions from world leaders, said a16z global head of policy Tomicah Tilleman, though he declined to name any specific ones.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Bloomberg) PayPal is looking into whether it should launch its own stablecoin, Bloomberg reports, citing PayPal Senior VP Jose Fernandez da Ponte. PayPal hasn’t committed to launching a stablecoin, though.  (TechDirt) A federal court has ordered Twitter to identify the user behind an anonymous Twitter account. The account “tweeted out various things mocking and shaming various extremely wealthy people,” TechDirt reports. The case itself appears related to a somewhat questionable copyright dispute.

42411588,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOtLP,1641933648,DeSo Wants Your Seed Phrase. Let Them Come and Take It,"Late on Sunday, Jan. 9, DeSo founder Nader Al-Naji announced that his “decentralized social media” service would update its login flow, which had been widely criticized. But experts almost uniformly argued that the update would make DeSo’s user security vastly worse – and even undermine security across the entirety of the emerging “Web 3″ landscape.  DeSo (which formerly operated as BitClout) is in principle an exemplar of what Web 3 could become. The system is built around token economics intended to help content creators get paid for their work, and users manage their DeSo assets using digital wallets analogous to MetaMask or Samourai. Other “creator token” systems, particularly Roll and Rally, have pursued related models.  But critics previously noted that DeSo was cuing users to engage in a very odd and dangerous behavior: inputting their wallet’s “seed phrase” through a web interface to log in to their DeSo web accounts. A seed phrase, sometimes referred to as a “recovery phrase,” gives complete access to a wallet’s contents to anyone who knows it, and is impossible to neatly replace or reset once it’s compromised.  Because they’re so sensitive, the widely accepted best practice for handling seed phrases is to literally never input them into any internet-connected interface, with a website being perhaps the single worst possible choice. Individual responsibility for wallet management is key to the Web 3 concept, and teaching users good security will be fundamental to the overall initiative’s success.  Read more: Nader Al-Naji (Formerly Known as ‘Diamondhands’) Unveils Long-Term Plan for BitClout Blockchain  But instead of addressing this fundamental problem with using a seed phrase as a web login, DeSo appears to have doubled down: The new feature would encourage users to hand over their seed phrase to Google Drive, instead.  'This can't be real'  This supposed fix was met with incandescent scorn from high-profile crypto executives, engineers and investors – scorn leavened with sardonic disbelief that, yes, a purported Web 3 operation with $200 million in investment from Andreessen Horowitz and other blue-chip Web 3 advocates actually did that.  Major figures including Sino Global Capital CEO Matthew Graham seemed to agree: using the cloud to store seed phrases controlling potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of crypto assets is, on its face, about as stupid as it gets.       Perhaps the most energetic rant in response to DeSo’s new “feature” came from Taylor Monahan, cybersecurity expert and CEO of wallet developer MyCrypto.  What’s a seed phrase?  Why exactly is it so unspeakably bad to ask users to input the seed phrase from a crypto wallet into a web extension? For software wallets like Exodus or Electrum, a seed phrase is fairly analogous to the “private key” that grants direct control of a single on-chain Bitcoin account. It is generated by an automatic system, and unlike, say, a Google password, even the wallet’s developer can’t see the phrase – or reset or recover it if it’s lost.  And once someone has a wallet’s seed phrase, they can simply steal its contents – which Al-Naji on Sunday admitted was exactly what happened to a staggering 10% of early DeSo users.  As a matter of cybersecurity, then, a seed phrase is almost as sensitive as biometric data. Biometrics form the security backbone of another profoundly misguided pseudo-crypto project, Sam Altman’s WorldCoin, which faced withering criticism for its model from experts including Edward Snowden. As Snowden pointed out, biometric data is dangerous because it’s impossible to replace once it has been compromised. A crypto seed phrase can in some sense be replaced once it has been leaked, but it’s an onerous process involving setting up entirely fresh wallets – and by the time you get that done, your compromised wallet might already have been emptied.  Read more: Nader Al-Naji - Web 3 Social Media Needs Dedicated Blockchains  In the narrowest sense, this means DeSo’s seed-phrase login is an immense and constant risk for users of the system itself. In particular, phishing attacks that closely mimic official login pages to capture crypto credentials have become extremely widespread. These have led to major compromises of users on platforms like OpenSea and Coinbase. But self-hosted wallets are much harder to undermine, when used correctly. Al-Naji, critics argue, is going an extra mile to make his own users’ wallets vulnerable. (Questions to the DeSo team about the specific role of seed phrases on the DeSo platform were directed back to Al-Naji’s Sunday thread.)  Al-Naji’s narcissistic framing of the issue undoubtedly riled people up even further. His announcement tweets set up a completely false choice between “yelling at users to do better” or offering a fundamentally inferior security flow. But the initial problem was entirely DeSo’s design, not user laziness. The new “solution” seems to have been chosen for appearances rather than effectiveness: Al-Naji and his team don’t want to bother users with downloading a secure software wallet, but they also can’t admit error by reversing their own earlier bad design decision. Instead, we got a classic double-down.  UX is a security issue  As much as DeSo itself is dancing with the devil here, the much larger issue for critics seems to be that their seed-phrase login flow will train users in poor security practices. That could lead to even more misunderstanding and tragedy across the entire nascent Web 3 ecosystem.  “DeSo infuriates me because they acknowledge the responsibility of the wallet while simultaneously willfully disregarding every basic best practice in the book,” Monahan told me when I reached out for more insight. “It’s not just that they store secrets in an insecure way in the browser or that they are training users that it’s okay to enter secrets onto any ol’ website, it’s the lengths they go to defend their malicious actions.  “This begs the question: if serving users is not a priority, what is DeSo’s actual motivation within the Web 3 ecosystem?”  That’s a particularly biting critique because DeSo is so entwined with the very entities focused on taking “Web 3″ mainstream (or at least making money in the effort). In its early incarnation, when it operated and sold tokens as BitClout, DeSo raised funds from at least 19 sources, including Blockchain.com Capital, Arrington XRP Capital, Winklevoss Capital, and, most notably of all, Andreessen Horowitz. Andreessen Horowitz has taken point on advocating for Web 3, including during Jack Dorsey’s recent anti-Web 3 blowup.  Of course, these funds don’t directly control the choices of founders or companies they invest in. But this isn’t the first time DeSo has threatened to become an embarrassment for its backers.  A 'dark pattern'  The Google Drive debacle comes after other moves by DeSo that have been widely viewed with skepticism or suspicion. Close to the top of the list is the questionable design of DeSo’s initial fundraising, conducted as BitClout. The early sale of CLOUT tokens used what’s known as a “bonding curve” that, according to critics, amounted to an unusually generous giveaway to private presale investors (even by crypto standards).  BitClout also triggered rage for what some saw as cavalier disregard for individual property rights and privacy. To build profiles on the first version of the product, BitClout scraped Twitter for users’ profile pics and other assets. Then it encouraged users to pay for the privilege of taking control of BitClout accounts created, without their permission, using their own intellectual property.  Some users thought they were being impersonated by the scraped profiles. Former Google marketing exec Adam Singer described the practice as “user hostile dark pattern BS.”  As part of the rebrand to DeSo, the CLOUT token has since been swapped for deso. BitClout itself is now billed as a single app built on top of the DeSo blockchain. But there is significant reason to believe this was a rebrand of convenience, given the broad backlash against BitClout over these and other issues. Also notable is that, as described by Protos Media, the rebrand was in some cases misreported as DeSo raising new funding, when it carried forward the same $200 million raised under the BitClout name.  In a positive development, Al-Naji does seem to have been somewhat humbled by the backlash to his Sunday announcement. He has since taken to Twitter to, with something that almost seems like sincerity, ask for better options for “a full self-custody login that is totally private (no PII), low-friction, mobile-friendly, and doesn’t require an extension”.  Personally, I find the insistence on avoiding an extension or another clearly firewalled security layer to be misguided. Al-Naji rightly points out that downloading and installing an extension is a barrier for some users – but so is downloading a streaming app to your Roku, and Netflix seems to be doing fine. Some compromises may be necessary to add new users, but key management is an inherent feature of Web 3, not an irksome bug. At this stage in the game, it’s the responsibility of startups to train future Web 3 users to do things the right way.  Choosing instead to give users a way to lazily circumvent the basic architecture of Web 3 might benefit the growth of individual operations like DeSo in the short run. But by teaching the wrong lessons, such practices are increasing user risk and, in turn, weakening the foundations for every other project in the ecosystem. That helps explain exactly why so many people are hopping mad: DeSo’s security misstep, ironically, amounts to a kind of theft from the larger Web 3 effort.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42393991,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQdZZ,1641932320,Welcome to the Crypto Version of ‘Blade Runner’,"Big chunky pixels. Lots of pixels. That’s what you see when you enter most of the early crypto metaverses, such as Decentraland and The Sandbox. The avatars are simple. The graphics are crude. The ambitions are grand and perhaps the future is bright, but the actual aesthetics, to put it charitably, are still in the “early days.”  And then there’s Neon District.  The Neon District is part crypto metaverse, part RPG (role-playing video game). It just looks different. The visuals are stunning and hauntingly bleak – a cyberpunk dystopia full of thieves, hackers, guilds and assassins. It’s dark. It’s even beautiful. “What if we made a cyberpunk Final Fantasy 7?” was the original idea from Marguerite deCourcelle, aka “Coin Artist,” the CEO and co-founder of Blockade Games, the company building Neon District that recently raised $5 million. (Investors include Animoca Brands and Dapper Labs’ Roham Gharegozlou.)  “The current version of the game is very rudimentary,” says Ben Heidorn, Blockade’s chief technology officer and co-founder. But even with the raw prototype, according to Heidorn, an average of 33,000 gamers play it each day. Perhaps they’re playing because it truly looks and feels like a game, a game with a real story, a game with emotion. A game that just … looks undeniably cool.  For that, we can thank deCourcelle. A former director of an art gallery, deCourcelle was one of the first – possibly the very first – artists to create cryptographic art puzzles, starting with “Dark Wallet” in 2014, a digital painting that hid a key to 3.4 bitcoin. Around then, she read “Snow Crash” and “Ready Player One.”  “It clicked that bitcoin had real-world value, but could be used anywhere across the internet,” says deCourcelle, who started to envision a crypto-infused metaverse.  DeCourcelle kept experimenting. Her crypto puzzles appeared in one of the early influential books on blockchain, Andreas Antonopoulos’ “Mastering Bitcoin.” In 2015, she unveiled a series of art puzzles called “The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto,” which included one painting that contained the key to 4.87 bitcoin, at the time worth a total of $1,200. (She often gave away her own bitcoin.)  Crypto-geeks raced to solve the puzzle. But no one could solve the puzzle for a week. Then a month. Then a year. “The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto” became something of a legend itself and went unsolved for nearly three years. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin soared. The prize swelled to $100,000. deCourcelle began to think of the puzzle as a “sword in the stone.” Would anyone be worthy?  In January 2018, finally, an anonymous programmer cracked the code and claimed the prize. Suddenly, deCourcelle found herself in the limelight, as mainstream outlets like Vice and BBC covered the story. That flurry of press would be life-changing. The publicity soon caught the eye of “Pine,” the anonymous benefactor who created the “Pineapple Fund” that donated $50 million to philanthropic causes.  By the time Pine reached out to deCourcelle, he had already given away most of the $50 million. “But for his last giveaway, he wanted to give it to the community,” says deCourcelle. Specifically, Pine wanted deCourcelle to create a series of challenges and puzzles that would dole out more bitcoin. So he funded the “Pineapple Arcade,” which led to eight crypto-arcade games like a crypto Pac-Man (“CoiinMan”) and a crypto Space Invaders (“DAO Invaders”). “We did it all in a month and a half, and it was insane,” deCourcelle says.  Blockade Games was born. The early team included Heidorn and Diego Rodriguez (now the lead artist), a longtime crypto-artist who worked at Bitcoin Magazine in 2012. “I was doing Bitcoin art without knowing it was Bitcoin art,” says Rodriguez, who briefly crossed paths with a young writer for Bitcoin Magazine named Vitalik Buterin, a computer programmer who’s one of the founders of the Ethereum network.  So in early 2018, the core team of deCourcelle, Heidorn and Rodriguez began hatching the ideas for Neon District. The premise: It’s “300 to 400” years in the future. Climate change has ravaged the planet. Some cities have shielded themselves from the damage, such as “Unity,” an oasis for the well-heeled and privileged. You are not in Unity. All of the game play of Neon District occurs outside the protected area, where you trawl through the Mad Max-inspired wastelands.  The mechanics of the game are familiar to anyone who loves RPGs. First, you pick a character class, such as Demons (combat specialists), Ghosts (assassins) or Jacks (hackers). Then you build a squad. Over time you earn the right (or can purchase) new skills and weapons and “cards,” which are used in battle. You can spend money to build your squad and upgrade your characters, but you don’t need to.  This was important to deCourcelle. “Neon District is the only free-to-play blockchain game,” she says, clarifying that while some games give you a freebie starter kit, to truly compete you need to spend. “Neon District is truly free. You can start with nothing. You can play the entire game, and win, without spending money.”  Your objective? In a mode called “Neon Pizza,” you choose one of two roles: You either go on missions to deliver pizza or ambush the people delivering pizza. This opening mode is “extremely simple,” Heidorn acknowledges. Soon that will change. Heidorn suggests a hypothetical: Let’s say that your mission is to steal money from a bank. Once you complete the steps to get inside the vault, which involves deactivating a robot guard, you learn that the money you’re stealing was going to be given to charity. “You have to make a moral choice,” Heidorn says. These choices would then change the future game play.  In theory, your chain of moral choices – which could alter the non-fungible tokens of your characters – will have repercussions throughout the life of the game. If you double-cross a hacker, that could complicate a mission in the future. These are the kind of gripping choices, stories and narrative arcs that kept me playing RPGs like Dragon Age, Mass Effect and Knights of the Old Republic for a profoundly embarrassing number of hours.  Then you add NFTs. Then you add a community. deCourcelle envisions a “creator economy” of gamers who customize their characters and build assets, form alliances and ultimately change the world and the story of Neon District itself. They’re even starting to think about how to render the game in 3D.  The game isn’t there … yet. But it shows fascinating potential, and it suggests that there are many paths to the future of the metaverse. The future might be an open blank canvas like Decentraland, it might be a centralized monster like Meta, or it might be a game like Neon District with a hyper-specific tone and personality. (Or maybe it’s all of the above.)  And as for deCourcelle’s goals? Her New Year's resolutions are simple. 1) Wake up at 6:30 a.m., 2) no drinking “except if offered at dinner,” 3) headed home by midnight each night and 4) “Create a billion-dollar company.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MANA,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/11/welcome-to-the-crypto-version-of-blade-runner,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce97c506fede7bf578be725b97adcd521efa08f1-400x266.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This behavior is similar to what was seen during the May-June 2021 mini-bear period. Bitcoin Investors Have Continued To Dump At A Loss For A Month Now As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC SOPR shows that holders are currently selling at a loss. The &apos;Spent Output Profit Ratio&apos; (or SOPR in short) is an indicator that tells us whether coins moved on a given day were sold at a profit or a loss. The metric measures so by looking at each coin on the chain and checking what the price the coin was last moved at. After that, the indicator calculates the ratio between this price and the current price. When the value of the indicator is above one, it means that holders are currently selling, on an average, at a profit. On the other hand, when the SOPR has values less than one, it implies investors are moving their Bitcoin at a loss overall. Finally, there is the case when the value of the indicator is exactly equal to one. During such a period, the market is breaking even on BTC sales.

42411563,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOsRC,1641925491,Metaverse Scarcity Isn’t Real,"There’s an old saying, “Buy land, they’re not making any more of it.” When it comes to the metaverse, that isn’t true.  Artificial scarcity isn’t real. This may seem like a blindingly obvious and rather tedious observation, but it has important implications for how you think about the future of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), cryptocurrencies and other digital assets like virtual land.  Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  In the real world, scarce assets like real estate have increasing values driven by opportunities and constraints. Real estate becomes more valuable when it has proximity to infrastructure, services and other people. Cities and industrial centers “create” expensive real estate because of the efficiency and power of proximity, and investors balance out the higher cost of land by increasing density and building tall buildings. There are limits, however, as tall buildings are costly and too many of them cause traffic and congestion causing cities to limit the number that are built.  In the world of blockchain and digital ecosystems, some of these systems have scarcity driven by genuine constraints. Gas prices in Ethereum, for example, have been driven upward by the network’s limited transaction processing capacity. As layer 2 networks and roll-ups come to dominate Ethereum, there’s a good chance that gas prices (and the price of ether) could decline significantly as those constraints diminish.  What problem, however, does artificial scarcity, such as limiting the supply of virtual land, solve? Are we limiting virtual congestion? Do imaginary schools have too many students? Nothing of the sort, and because the scarcity involved here is arbitrary and artificial, I would argue that the value created is not the same. Buyers and investors cannot assume that virtual land prices will behave in the same way as real land prices do.  I’m not suggesting that artificial scarcity has no value. Exclusivity often creates some sense of value. Sometimes it’s a genuinely useful kind of value that comes from having a community of like-minded individuals who can work well together. Barriers to entry exclude amateurs and those who aren’t willing to contribute.  Second Life is a case in point. This virtual ecosystem has been around for more than a decade, and though the press hype has long since passed, the company has a dedicated fan and user base that has been buying and selling land and managing virtual social and business experiences consistently for the last decade. Second Life is very small compared to the big gaming ecosystems, but it is a reminder of the enduring strength of online communities.  Two types of scarcity  What implications do these examples have for the booming NFT and virtual land ecosystems? First, scarcity must solve an actual problem and not simply exist for its own sake. Second, when the item in question isn’t genuinely scarce, its value proposition is a proxy for solving another problem: one of creating a community of like-minded members and providing some barrier to entry that signals commitment.  There are big differences between these two types of scarcity. A world-renowned soccer player can only wear one jersey while scoring a match-winning goal in a World Cup game. Those match-worn jerseys have genuine scarcity. For purely virtual items, the team can create an unlimited number of “limited edition” NFTs to celebrate different aspects of the match and sell them to fans. While a truly disciplined club could limit output, the temptation to fully monetize the fan base will never go away.  This reasoning has consequences for the kinds of scarcity-driven ecosystems that are most likely to succeed: very large numbers of small communities with modest asset prices, not small numbers of big communities with high prices.  It also means that the prices of artificially scarce assets are likely to behave in a way that is different from genuinely scarce assets. For truly scarce assets, prices are likely to be set by a market mechanism driven by the value of access. For artificially scarce assets, however, prices may be limited because there is an infinite supply of “scarce” assets available.  Let’s take a simple case example: imagine a world with about one million passionate gardeners. A virtual land system or NFT membership tokens that only support 100,000 members is likely to leave a lot of people on the outside. There is easily enough demand to send membership token prices quite high, but there are also enough people who care about gardening to support many more such communities, and since there are no real constraints on setting these up, it’s likely that we will, sooner or later, end up with many different gardening communities.  Everyone who cares enough to make even a modest investment is likely to find a place in one of these communities. And while some communities might end up being more exclusive than others, the range of choices and the simplicity of creating new communities will also function as a limiter on the upward price of most membership tokens. In a truly free market, if supply is infinite, the market clearing price is always zero.  It’s not quite that simple, however, because there are no genuine constraints on supply in the virtual universe. There will always be a blend of downward pressure on prices due to unlimited supply with upward pressure on prices due to the Veblen-good nature of access-limited memberships. (Veblen goods are those for which demand increases as the price rises.)  NFTs don’t change much  This brings me to a final problem: the end state of many different online communities built around NFTs or virtual land systems doesn’t appear to be very different from the way the internet functions now. We have millions of websites and online communities. Many of them use membership fees or other tools like participation metrics to sort and filter genuine contributors from lurkers and freeloaders. Do NFTs solve this problem better than any of these other methods? I’m not convinced they do.  Blockchains solve some very specific problems very well, such as handling transactions without a centralized intermediary and allocating and tracking scarce resources in a very efficient and transparent manner. Community membership, however, is about so much more than a transaction, and it is not, in most cases, a genuinely finite resource. And while there’s no reason to believe blockchain-based systems won’t work, they do not appear to be the best way found so far. And so, at least for myself, when it comes to land, I’ll be taking mine in real life, thank you very much.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining production of 124 in December increases 10% from November, generating monthly operating revenue of $6.2M. This puts IREN at the bottom of the overall crypto mining market share. Still, IREN&apos;s revenue growth soars 483% on a Y/Y basis.

42393993,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQdu5,1641919858,The 10 Tribes of Crypto,"Many people think crypto is full of flinty libertarians and Shiba-chasing degens. But anyone who’s hung around crypto for a while knows that the community is pretty diverse – both politically and economically. There are builders, gig workers, leftists, meme-lords, grannies and everything in between. In this post, we’ll finally put some numbers on that diversity.  Joshua Tan, Lucia Korpas, and Ann Brody are researchers at Metagov, a governance research collective.  In what follows, we present initial takeaways from the Cryptopolitical Typology Quiz, an 18-question online survey we launched at LisCon 2021 that studies the political-economic inclinations of the crypto community. The survey features 10 factions and four classes (full descriptions here) as well as a set of Cryptopolitics non-fungible tokens.  Note: This post presents preliminary data from the Cryptopolitical Typology Quiz. If you haven’t done so already, we highly recommend taking the quiz, and if you enjoy it, sharing it on Twitter. If you’d prefer to skip the takeaways and see the data for yourself, you can see a live summary of the results from the survey in this Typeform report. The final results from the survey will be published later in 2022.  Introducing the factions  The first thing you might notice about the quiz are the factions.  The top line of factions (crypto-leftist, DAOist, true neutral, crypto-libertarian, crypto-ancap) captures the spectrum of political beliefs in crypto; these factions are calculated from a set of questions based on Pew Research Center’s long-running Political Typology Quiz.  The bottom line (earner, cryptopunk, NPC, techtrepreneur, degen) represents the primary mode of economic engagement with crypto.  Finally, there are four “classes” (Szabian, Gavinist, Zamfirist and Walchian) not shown that capture people’s beliefs about governance and government regulation. (That is, after Nick Szabo, Gavin Wood, Vlad Zamfir and Angela Walch.)  We crowdsourced these initial factions from a wide range of people (a few that didn’t make the cut: crypto-ancoms, cypherpunks, crypto-feudalists). You can find full descriptions of the factions here. Based on their responses to the survey, each respondent was assigned a political faction, an economic faction and a governance class.  Takeaway 1: Crypto is full of libertarians, but very few are “conservative”  Crypto is commonly associated with right-libertarian politics, and the majority of survey respondents have indeed been libertarian or the more radical anarcho-capitalist in their political faction. However, it is also important to remember that there is incredible political diversity within crypto communities: Some developers are pro-capitalist libertarians, while others are anti-capitalist anarchists and socialist.  Despite the preponderance of crypto-libertarians and crypto-ancaps, only 5.9% of respondents identified as conservative or right wing, while 51.6% identified as liberal or left wing, and 42.6% identified as neither. One explanation for this is that many libertarian respondents may associate the word “conservative” with social conservatism, whereas crypto-libertarianism emphasizes a form of economic libertarianism. In future versions of the survey, we would like to compare responses across geographic regions, since the meanings of “conservative” and “liberal” vary significantly by region (e.g. Europe vs. United States).  Takeaway 2: On-chain governance is more popular than off-chain governance, but not by much  Governance is a contentious issue both within and between blockchains, and especially where it involves existing regulatory or legal authorities. Respondents’ opinions are especially split on whether they favor on-chain over off-chain governance: While over half of respondents were on the Gavinist or Szabian “on-chain” side of the scale, nearly 40% fell on the other side. The more extreme positions (Szabians, eschewing off-chain politics altogether and Walchians, firm on the need for government regulation) account for nearly a third of respondents.  One surprising result: In question 16, only a very tiny percentage of people in crypto today (3.2%) seem to agree with Satoshi Nakomoto’s original vision of a protocol largely governed by a set of core developers and technical staff (which is still, in many ways, an accurate description of how changes and improvements are rolled out on both Bitcoin and Ethereum). That’s less than the percentage of people (3.4%) who think that a traditional government should govern the blockchain!  Takeaway 3: Builders are way over-represented  On the economic side, the label of techtrepeneur – someone interested in building or contributing to economic applications of crypto – describes over two-thirds of respondents. While it is great to see so many builders in crypto, we believe this indicates that the survey has not (yet!) reached a representative sample of the overall crypto community.  After all, a vanishing 2% of respondents were degens – YOLO profit-maximalists who just want crypto to go high. Even when we dig into the questions that detect for degeneracy, we see only 7.2% responding with “My goal in crypto is to make as much money as possible” (Q4), 3.5% responding with “In order to grow, the crypto ecosystem should: Provide financial instruments for maximum wealth creation” (Q9) and 8.5% responding with “I’m here for: the airdrops” (Q17). To count as a degen, you had to choose at least two out of the three answers above.  Where are you, you lovable degens?  Takeaway 4: There are no categories in crypto … yet  We built the initial set of factions by hand, but we were curious whether other factions and features might arise naturally from the data. So we hit the data using a bunch of clustering methods (e.g. affinity propagation, agglomerative clustering) and feature selection methods (e.g. PCA, feature agglomeration). It turns out that if you ask n people in crypto about their opinions on crypto, you’ll get (nearly) n unique responses… at least when n = 500. While that doesn’t preclude clusters of opinion from forming, it may factor into why the clustering results are currently inconclusive. You can check our work here.  Honestly, this result was surprising to us – is there really no consolidation of political opinions in crypto? For now, we’re hoping that more data will help us identify distinct schools of thought in the community. (So if you haven’t already, please take the quiz or share it with your community!) We’re also curious if other data scientists can draw different conclusions from the data, perhaps by combining it with other data sets. If you think of something, reach out!  Takeaway 5: Most people believe crypto is a political philosophy and other tidbits  Below are some additional observations from the survey. Check out the live summary on Typeform to see if these observations hold true as more people complete the survey.  What does crypto mean to you? A small majority (56.6%) of respondents consider crypto to be mainly a political philosophy/lifestyle, rather than mainly an economic technology (Q3). This surprised us, especially when compared with the proportion of builders (versus users, artists, memers, etc.) represented in the survey!  Bitcoin versus Ethereum: respondents were given the opportunity to affiliate with a number of layer 1 protocols. We compared the responses for the two largest groupings, Ethereum and Bitcoin, and found that (1) they agree on most things, (2) the question they most disagreed on was on gender: Fewer Bitcoiners than Ethereans believe that crypto has a gender problem (Q15). Bitcoiners were also somewhat more likely to be skeptical of regulation (Q7) and, correspondingly, less likely to be interested in cooperating with regulatory efforts or concerned with legal compliance (Q14).  Is crypto-economics fair? Respondents are polarized on the question of whether crypto teams make a fair and reasonable amount of profit or too much profit (Q11), and similarly, whether the economic system in crypto is generally fair to most of its participants or unfairly favors powerful interests (Q12).  How might crypto evolve? The majority sentiment is that to grow, crypto should build useful technology that solves real problems for a set of users (Q9).  Accessing the data  The anonymized responses to the Cryptopolitical Typology Quiz are hosted inside Govbase, an open data warehouse for online governance. If you’d like to explore the data, feel free to start with this Jupyter notebook.  What’s next?  We need more degens! In short:  We’re looking for more data, especially from the Bitcoin community  We’re looking for partners: Do you have a group of people that would benefit from taking the survey together? We would love to support comparisons like Solana vs Gitcoin, Uniswap vs. SushiSwap, etc.  We initially built this quiz in order to educate the crypto community and to help it understand itself. We also think that this data will have an impact on regulatory discussions, and we would love to work with organizations already in this space to tailor future versions of the survey for that purpose.  Speaking of future versions, we’d love to run a second iteration of the survey in 2022 with a more rigorous sampling strategy and a bank of demographic questions. That would give us a much better sense of who is involved in crypto, as well as historical data on crypto’s political economy. Sampling this way can get expensive, though, so we’d love to partner with other projects in this space (shill, shill). Not only would you be supporting a public good in the ecosystem, the survey could also double as community research for your project (e.g. comparing the cultures of Solana vs. Ethereum, or of Uniswap vs. SushiSwap).

42396239,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1lkS,1641916859,EPNS Goes Live in Bid to Bring Notifications to Web 3,"A new project is hoping to address a key aspect of user experience that Web 3 currently lacks – the ability for protocols, contracts and users to directly communicate.  On Tuesday, Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) announced the launch of what founder Harsh Rajat calls the “Web 3 communication primitive” with a bevy of decentralized finance (DeFi) mainstays involved.  Version 1 of EPNS, which is now live, is launching with MakerDAO, Aave, Uniswap and dYdX, among others. CoinDesk will also be an early user, with a dedicated channel for distributing crypto news directly to users who opt into the service through their wallet addresses.  In Rajat’s telling, much of the contemporary online experience centers on push notifications – news alerts, sales notifications, ads and work interfaces like Slack.  DeFi protocols, non-fungible token (NFT) platforms and other Web 3 infrastructure providers largely lack the capacity to send these kinds of messages, however, leading to an informational gulf.  “These things are practically absent for user experience because there’s no communication layer to power it,” Rajat told CoinDesk in an interview. “For example, if you’re liquidated on a lending platform you as a wallet address will not know about it, if your governance proposal passed you won’t know about it, if you’re into NFTs you have no way to reach out to someone who bought your NFTs to let them know a new collection is out.”  Read more: How to Set Up a MetaMask Wallet  The project attempts to solve this problem by enabling protocols to create “channels” – distribution networks that allow dapps to manually send messages or automatically send alerts based on on-chain activity such as DeFi liquidations – and users to subscribe for alerts as well. These messages will be sent directly to Ethereum addresses.  The messages are largely gasless, meaning there is no transaction fee, as the notifications are sent with the EIP-712 standard, a method for off-chain data message signing. The team has had early discussions with MetaMask with the goal of allowing popular wallets to easily integrate the EPNS communication layer.  The EPNS governance token, PUSH, is up 11% on the day to $2.30.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | MKR | UNI,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/11/epns-goes-live-in-bid-to-bring-notifications-to-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fbf5047c9735273596b31edda6cec6f8b8bbf53-5092x3337.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411852,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgb26,1641916788,How to Set Up a MetaMask Wallet,"Whether you’re looking to create your first non-fungible token (NFT), lend assets on a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol or simply buy and transfer Ethereum-based tokens, you’ll first need to download compatible crypto-wallet software. This will allow you to store any assets you create or buy, as well as connect to any platform built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.  While there are a number of different wallet services available, MetaMask is by far the most popular with over 21 million monthly active users – up by 38x since 2020. To put it simply, MetaMask is a free hot wallet service available as a smartphone app or web browser extension. This means you can download it directly onto your phone or the Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave or Edge browser similar to an ad blocker extension. The “hot” part simply means it’s permanently connected to the internet so that you can easily move your crypto assets around at any time.  One of the key reasons MetaMask is so popular among new and existing crypto users is its interoperability with virtually all Ethereum-based platforms. MetaMask allows users to connect to more than 3,700 different decentralized applications and Web 3 services.  So the question is, how do set up your own MetaMask crypto wallet?  Getting started  Installation  The first thing you’ll need to do is download the MetaMask wallet software onto your chosen device by visiting the official website here. You will be presented with the following options:  Browser: Compatible with Google Chrome, Firefox, Brave or Edge website browser.  Android: Compatible with any smartphone that operates using Android’s operating system.  iOS: Compatible with any iPhone.  Once you’ve selected the appropriate option, click the “Install MetaMask for …” button.  Navigate to the extension icon in the top right corner of your web browser and find the MetaMask option, once you’ve successfully downloaded the software. Click the “Get Started” button and you’ll be taken to the next page and presented with two options (see below.)  Import wallet: This is for users who already have an existing MetaMask wallet on a different device and would like to import it over to a new one.  Create a wallet: This is for users who want to set up a brand new MetaMask wallet.  Select the “Create a Wallet” option, agree to a short disclaimer that appears and create a password when prompted. As with any password, it’s vitally important you physically write several copies of the password down on different pieces of paper. You should never create a digital copy of any password you create; this includes actions like taking a screenshot of it, sending it to yourself in an email or saving it as a note on your computer. Anything digital that’s stored on your computer is accessible to hackers – don’t make life easy for them.  You will need to enter your password each time you wish to access your MetaMask wallet.  Secret recovery phrase  A screen will then appear that outlines what a secret recovery phrase is, how you should copy it down (again, on paper not in digital form) and information on why you should never share your secret recovery phrase with anyone.  In short, your secret recovery phrase comprises 12 random words. It’s there as a backup in case you lose the phone or laptop where your MetaMask wallet is downloaded and need to import it to a new device.  You will need to carefully copy down each word in the order they are presented on the screen. The order of the words is crucial as you won’t be able to import your account to a new device if the words are in the wrong order – even if you entered all the right 12 words.  MetaMask will then prompt you to type in the 12-word sequence before you can move on to the final steps.  An overview of the MetaMask wallet  Once you’ve completed the above steps, you’ll be able to access your new MetaMask wallet. There are two main components you’ll need to familiarize yourself with so that you can begin using the software:  Identifying your public address: This is the address you can freely share with people or platforms like exchanges in order to receive cryptocurrency into your wallet. Think of it as your home address that you share with people to receive inbound mail. It’s always advisable, however, to check to make sure any inbound tokens are compatible with MetaMask first before receiving them, otherwise, they might be lost forever.  How to fund/buy and send: These are the core functions of MetaMask.  You can locate your unique MetaMask public address by clicking the “Account 1″ button (black arrow). To save you manually typing it when you need to use it, you can click the layered square icon beneath it to automatically copy it.  Finally, in order to begin interacting with any Ethereum platform, you’ll first need to fund your MetaMask wallet with an amount of ether – the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum. All actions on the blockchain cost a fee, whether that’s moving tokens from A to B or creating an NFT collection. This fee, known as a “gas” fee, is denominated in ether.  Read More: What Are Ethereum Gas Fees?  How much you choose to fund your wallet depends on how much you intend to interact with various platforms. For moderate use, $100 worth of ether is usually a good starting point to cover any initial fees.  Clicking the “buy” button (red arrow) will bring you to a window where you can purchase ether using Wyre or CoinSwitch. These options will allow you to purchase ether using a debit card or by exchanging it for other crypto tokens you hold.  Once you’ve purchased an amount of ether, you can now send crypto assets from your MetaMask to other wallets by inputting the recipient’s public address in the box provided and specifying the amount, including the gas fee. You can also visit the “Swap” feature – which allows you to trade ether for a wide range of other Ethereum-based tokens in-app – or begin using external services like NFT marketplaces or DeFi platforms.  With most platforms, you’ll see a “connect” button in the top right corner of the screen. After clicking it, you’ll have the option to connect your MetaMask wallet. You may need to sign a transaction in order to complete the connection process. This doesn’t cost you anything, it simply proves you have control over the wallet.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/558c23c0defc8f0e8ca2f5d64804629552fde4f1-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The investors are seeking the arrest of the brothers, Ameer and Raees Cajee, after being offered some of the lost investment by Pennython Project Management, a mystery investor in Dubai, according to Bloomberg.  The Hawks, the arm of the South African police that tackles organized crime, corruption and other serious crime, is investigating in four provinces and cities including Johannesburg and Durban.  The Cajees disappeared in April after telling investors the platform had been hacked, with bitcoin worth around $3.6 billion allegedly going missing. In June, the brothers’ attorney at the time, John Oosthuizen, said they denied the allegations of wrongdoing, and that the money was missing because of a hack. Just two days later, Oosthuizen said his firm’s relationship with the brothers had been terminated.  The Africrypt incident was one of two major scams that have taken place in South Africa in the last 18 months. The other involved Mirror Trading International, which defrauded investors of $589 million in August 2020.  As a result, South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority decided to prepare a regulatory framework on how crypto trading should be conducted. The framework is set to be unveiled early this year.

42396244,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1lqM,1641913804,Axie Infinity’s Gaming Sidechain Is Bigger Than Many Major Layer 1s by Volume: Nansen,"A farming simulator clogged a popular blockchain for days on end last week. Now a new research report from blockchain analytics firm Nansen sheds light on a possible solution.  At its peak in November, Ronin, a layer 2 product from Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis devoted solely to the game, processed 560% more total transactions than the Ethereum blockchain, the report found. And while that figure has since retreated, the sidechain is still processing more than up-and-coming networks such as Avalanche and Fantom.  Nansen data journalist Martin Lee said the report offers a glimpse into a particular multi-chain future, one where many layer 1 blockchains focus on specific use cases out of necessity.  “A lot of blockchains, whether they like it or not, will specialize. Even though creators might not plan for it, developers will force them to go a separate way, purely because of the trade-offs different chains have – developers will be attractive to developers for specific reasons,” he said.  Axie’s reach  Axie Infinity – the crown jewel of crypto’s still-nascent “play-to-earn” sector – has 2.8 million daily active users, and as a result, Ronin is processing 40% more transactions than Avalanche, one of the most popular layer 1s by transaction volume.  Lee noted that this figure was achieved in spite of typhoon season disrupting player activities in the Philippines, home to nearly half of Axie’s users.  The vast majority of the transactions are worth less than $1,000, and fees are free on the chain for up to 100 transactions.  “What stood out to me was the sheer number of transactions on the chain relative to other layer 1 solutions like Avalanche or Fantom,” Lee said. “That alone is a signal for other, similar layer 2s to be created. If one single game demands so much out of the underlying blockchain, what happens when a chain is home to multiple games?”  Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain recently got a taste of what game-related congestions can look like. Transaction costs, which can often be fractions of a cent, ran as high as $0.50, and users griped about failed transactions for days – all because a simple farming simulator game clogged the chain with bot activity.

42396241,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1llR,1641913249,LIVE BLOG: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Appears Before the Senate Banking Committee,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has run the U.S. central bank for the last four years, but his most significant work may have come in the past two years during the COVID-19 pandemic. President Joe Biden recently nominated Powell to a second term helming the Fed. The Senate Banking Committee will question the bank regulator on Tuesday. They will likely focus on current economic issues like inflation and unemployment, but questions about stablecoin regulation, central bank digital currencies and others may come up.     12:25: p.m. (LL) Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) asked Powell about central bank digital currencies (CBDC).  “Some have advocated, as you know, that a central bank digital dollar be used and developed in such a fashion that individual Americans have retail accounts with the Fed and the Fed becomes the retail banker for America. It seems to me that there is absolutely nothing in the history, the experience, the expertise, the capabilities of the Fed, that lend the Fed to being a retail bank. Is that Is that a fair observation?” Toomey asked.  Powell: “I would say it is, yes.”  “If Congress were to authorize the Fed to pursue a central bank digital dollar, is there anything about that that ought to preclude well-regulated, privately-issued stablecoins from coexisting with a central bank digital dollar?  Powell: “No, not at all.”  12:21 p.m. (LL) Sen. David Daines (R-Montana) reiterated Sen. Mike Crapo’s (R-Idaho) question on CBDCs. “Senator Crapo mentioned this earlier. So I will just add briefly his remarks on the Fed’s report on the costs and benefits of a central bank digital currency. It’s a topic that we want to start discussing here, so be helpful to have Federal Reserve’s insights, and I very much appreciate that you are working to get this around in the next few weeks.”  12:15 p.m. (LL) Sen. Ossoff brought up the Clarida insider trading scandal again and asked Powell what the Fed’s plan was to comply with requests for records and information, as well as how the Fed would work with Congress to advance legislation to prevent future insider trading.  “Upon the emergence of these facts we began to devise a brand new system of governing investment by principals and senior staff associated with the FOMC. That is, that process is very far along. It’s nearing completion. We’ve already announced the the contours of it, and it effectively ends any ability to actively trade on the part of any senior Fed official, either FOMC member or senior staff. You can’t purchase any equities,” Powell said.  12:09 p.m. (LL) Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) congratulated Powell on his renomination and asked if he is “prepared if necessary to act with agility, flexibility and speed” in regards to inflation.  Powell responded “Yes.”  12:07 p.m. (LL) Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) re-asked how Fed balances its dual mandate of inflation control and employment, and Powell stated: “There’s no basis to prefer one of the two goals over the other.”  Cramer also told Powell he was concerned about “mission creep” at the Fed when it comes to climate issues.  Powell agreed. “We’ve got to stick to our knitting if we want to remain independent ... the broader answer to climate change has to come from legislators and in the private sector.”  11:53 a.m. (LL) Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) opened her time by asking Powell to “please throw me a lifeline here and help me support your nomination.”  “As you know Chairman Powell, I’m terribly concerned about the manner in which Wyoming’s Special Purpose Depository Institutions are being treated by the Federal Reserve, as we’ve discussed,” Lummis said.  Powell told Lummis that he believes there are “good arguments for viewing SPDs as depository institutions for this purpose” and that the Fed would be considering the issue, but that the consideration would take time.  “I think you do understand that we, you know, we started granting these. There’ll be a couple hundred of them pretty quickly, and we have to think about the broader safety and soundness implications. And you know, it’s just hugely presidential, that’s really why we take our time with it,” Powell told Lummis.  11:42 a.m. (LL) Powell was asked if the Fed had considered actively selling securities rather than letting them gradually run off the balance sheet. Powell said the Fed has not made any decisions.  11:42 a.m. (CL) Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) asked Powell whether he’s ever embellished his resume or publication history.  Powell said “I don’t think so.”  11:38 a.m. (LL) Hearing proceedings have been slow. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) complained about corporate profits, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) complained about government spending.  11:05 a.m. (CL) Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mt.) asked Powell to provide an overview of the labor market pre- and post-pandemic. Powell said that pre-pandemic the labor market was “great.”  ”So then the pandemic comes in, it updates everything. And so the question really is, what are things going to how’s it going to be different? And we’re only beginning to see that because we’re not out of the pandemic.”  10:53 a.m. (ND) Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) asks the question that’s been on all of our minds: Where’s the Fed’s digital currency report?  Powell says that “the report really is ready to go and I would expect we will drop it, I hate to say it again, in the coming weeks, but it really is in a situation where it’s ready to go ... it was hard to, we didn’t get it quite to where we needed to get it but it’s effectively there now and I will tell you it’s, we’re, you know, it’s within weeks we will be publishing it. And by the way, it’s more going to be an exercise in asking questions and seeking input from the public rather than taking a lot of positions on various issues, although we do take some positions.”  10:42 a.m. (LL) “Price stability is half our mandate,” Powell says. “There’s no basis in the law for preferring maximum employment and price stability, or vice versa. They’re equal. However, at different times, One of them is farther away from its goal, and that’s the one we need to focus on a little bit more. Sometimes that’s maximum employment. Sometimes it’s inflation. I’d say now it’s inflation.”  10:40 a.m. (CL) Powell blames overbuying of durable goods for supply chain issues: ”This really is a problem both have very strong elevated demand, particularly in a part of the economy, the goods sector, the durable goods sector, things like washing machines and cars and all the things that people bought during the support of the pandemic, when they couldn’t spend money on travel and services. That’s where there’s spending is running at a level 20% about where it was before the pandemic and it’s just kind of overwhelmed the supply chains, most of which are global,” Powell says.  10:39 a.m. (LL) It’s a long road to normal: “If you look back through history there are times when when wages have moved up in a way that has fostered persistent inflation and that hurts everyone. It particularly hurts people on fixed incomes. So we don’t see that right now. But we do see these are the biggest wage increases in decades. And so we’re watching carefully and you know, to the extent we are looking at this year, what we see is an economy that where the labor market is recovering incredibly rapidly, really beginning around the end of the middle of last year that the unemployment rates have been dropping it more than three tenths of a percent per month, since since last June,” Powell says.  10:38 a.m. (CL) Powell says inflation remains well above the Fed’s target, which “is telling us that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we’ve had in place.”  10:36 a.m. (CL) Powell saying low interest rates aren’t going anywhere is an interesting tidbit – the actual quote is “We have been and probably remain in an era of very low interest rates,” which was particularly interesting.  10:32 a.m. (LL) Powell said the Fed might raise interest rates depending on inflation in response to a question from Toomey: “If we see inflation persisting at high levels longer than expected, then then we will you know, then we’ll, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, we will we will use our tools to get inflation back.”  10:27 a.m. (LL) “What we saw at the end of last very long, longest in our history expansion was that as the labor market tightened, the benefits began to go more broadly to those at the lower end of the income spectrum and to groups that have been more marginalized from an economic standpoint. And that’s that was seen, I think, very broadly as a highly desirable set of outcomes. So our tools do not generally have direct distributional effects, but I do think that we see now, the great benefits that strong labor market can bring to right across the whole population and for the whole economy,” Powell said.  10:25 a.m. (LL) Powell, in his opening remarks, highlighted the economy’s current strength: “We know that high inflation exacts a toll particularly for those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, transportation. We are strongly committed to achieving our statutory goals of maximum employment and price. We will use our tools to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from the entrenched. We can begin to see that the post pandemic economy is likely to be different in some respects. on the pursuit of our goals, we’ll need to take those differences into account.”  10:20 a.m. (LL) Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the ranking Republican member on the committee, opened his remarks noting the bipartisan support for Powell and the work he did in stabilizing the financial system during the pandemic. He also said the Fed is fighting the “last war” and expressed concerns about the current level of inflation.  “The Fed does not have a mandate to advance politically charged causes that are irrelevant to its mandate, like global warming or advancing so called racial justice,” Toomey said.  10:10 a.m. (ND) Sen.

And there actually was a pretty significant crypto mention right up top: A warning that cryptos and stablecoins might be a risk to the U.S. economy.  “The Fed needs to take seriously the systemic risks that threaten our economic progress, like cryptocurrencies and stablecoins and most importantly, climate change,” Brown said, later adding that crypto bubbles are like risky Wall Street schemes.  10:00 a.m. (ND) This hearing is about to kick off.

The move brings Citadel Securities closer to crypto, as Paradigm focuses on investing in crypto and Web 3-related firms. Pardigm was co-founded by Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase, and Matt Huang, who previously led crypto investments at Sequoia.  “We look forward to partnering with the Citadel Securities team as they extend their technology and expertise to even more markets and asset classes, including crypto,” Huang said in a statement.  Citadel Securities, a sister company to the hedge fund behemoth Citadel founded by billionaire Ken Griffin, was founded in 2002 and now handles about 27% of the shares that are traded in the U.S. stock market each day, according to its website. Griffin is chairman of Citadel Securities.  A large part of that volume comes from processing trades for online brokerages such as Robinhood, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported news of the investment.  Citadel Securities has thus far avoided trading cryptocurrencies because of what Griffin has called regulatory uncertainties around them, according to a recent Reuters report.  The investment values Citadel Securities at roughly $22 billion. Following the funding round, Sequoia partner Alfred Lin will join the Citadel Securities board of directors.  Griffin was the winning bidder in a recent Sotheby’s auction for a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution, beating out the ConstitutionDAO group.

The miner’s computing power on the bitcoin network reached 748 petahash per second (PH/s) in December, compared with 657 PH/s in November. The Australian firm attributed the increase to the installation of 1,666 rigs of the Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro that replaced older machines at its Canal Flats, British Columbia, site.  Iris Energy mined 124 bitcoins in December compared to 113 bitcoins in November.  During the same period, operating revenue in U.S. dollars fell 6.4% to $6.2 million as revenue per bitcoin mined plunged to 14.8% and cost of electricity per bitcoin mined increased by 4.6%. The company attributed the revenue drop to losses in the price of bitcoin and increased difficulty in mining.  Iris Energy saw a 10% drop in revenue in November.  As of writing, shares of Iris Energy were up 0.81% in pre-market trading.  Two new sites in British Columbia will bring in a combined 3.9 exahash per second (EH/s) when operational, Iris Energy said. One site in Mackenzie will deliver 1.5 EH/s in 2022, with the first 0.3 EH/s expected in the second quarter of 2022. Another site in Prince George will deliver 1.4 EH/s in the third quarter of 2022, expanding to 2.4 EH/s sometime in 2023, according to the statement.  In addition to these two mines, Iris Energy is developing sites that will bring in 10.6 EH/s when completed, it said. The miner is expecting 138,574 Antminers to ship by the third quarter of 2023, the filing said.  The company claims its crypto mining operations are “100% renewable since inception” because they use 98% renewable energy and the rest is made up for by the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates.

42375534,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8hV9,1641909600,"Users of Coinbase, PayPal, FTX.US and More Will Be Able to File Crypto Taxes for Free Through TaxBit Network","Utah-based tax software firm TaxBit has launched the TaxBit Network – a supported network of 20 top crypto companies, including Coinbase, Gemini and SuperRare, that will allow clients of supported institutions to access 2021 crypto tax forms at no charge.  Austin Woodward, co-founder and CEO of TaxBit, told CoinDesk he hopes to make the software more accessible – both in terms of cost and ease of filing – and thereby democratize and demystify the crypto tax process.  Crypto taxes have historically been cumbersome, confusing and often expensive, with annual filing costs running into the thousands of dollars for many crypto holders, Woodward said. For crypto tax do-it-yourselfers, consumer tax aggregators charge by transaction volume, making high-frequency trading particularly expensive come tax season.  The TaxBit Network includes participants from crypto companies BlockFi, OKCoin, Paxos, Coinbase, Strike, Coinlist, CEX.io, Blockchain.com, Gemini, Uphold, FTX.US, Binance.US and Celsius Network as well as more traditional fintech firms such as SoFi, PayPal, and decentralized finance (DeFi) startups like SuperRare and Uniswap, among others.  Woodward told CoinDesk that TaxBit Network’s tax forms will be free to all users, regardless of transaction volume.  “So, no longer if you have a bot trading in the background, do you need to worry about racking up a big tax bill when it comes to preparing your taxes,” Woodward said. “We’ve removed the concept of transaction limits, which no one in the industry has ever done.”  Woodward also hopes that by making crypto taxes easier, it will help to close the much-discussed “tax gap” that the Internal Revenue Service has partially attributed to undisclosed cryptocurrency capital gains.  “Our belief is that it’s not because the crypto community is purposely trying to evade taxes,” Woodward said of the tax gap. “It’s been way too costly and too complicated to figure out.”  Woodward told CoinDesk the response from the crypto industry has been positive, and he expects more companies to join the TaxBit Network before the end of tax season in April.  “The crypto companies want to be in good graces with regulators. They want to help their users report their taxes,” Woodward said. “This isn’t something that has been due to a lack of desire, right? It’s a technological hurdle, and it’s a cost hurdle.”  Participating crypto CEOs seem to agree with Woodward’s assessment.  “Compliance is a key pillar at Gemini and proactively providing our investors with access to tax reporting tools helps our clients stay on top of their cryptocurrency tax obligations while regulation continues to evolve,” Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss wrote in a press release.  Users will be able to access the tax forms starting Tuesday, either through the TaxBit Network’s website or, in most cases, via the participating institution’s app.  CORRECTION (Jan. 11, 17:08 UTC): Removes PayPal subsidiary Venmo from list of network members.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/coinbase-paypal-ftxus-and-more-join-taxbits-free-filing-network-for-crypto-taxes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b77b798795b5fcaf7183711ff5db8962480a4f18-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375525,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8hIZ,1641909600,Decentral Park Capital Launches $75M DeFi Fund,"Decentral Park Capital, an early-stage investment firm with $140 million in assets under management, now has a $75 million fund to invest in decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives.  The firm has $74 million in the bank with about $1 million left to raise for the oversubscribed fund, Decentral Park Capital founder John Quinn told CoinDesk in an interview. Returning investors from the previous $17 million Fund I contributed about two-thirds of the new round. Quinn said the returning investors were mostly family offices (privately held companies that handle investment management and wealth management for wealthy families) while the new investors were mostly institutional.  Quinn said Fund II has already deployed about $45 million of its total and that its investments are “multi-chain focused.” Decentral Park Capital was an early investor in crypto infrastructure company Pocket Network and was involved with the company for over two years. Last week, Pocket announced a $10 million funding round for its native POKT token.  Decentral Park’s areas of interest include decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, derivatives, structured products, oracles, staking and middleware infrastructure.  DeFi fund  Founded in 2017, Decentral Park Capital had a broader blockchain focus for its Fund I, which was deployed across 20 projects, including DeFi lender Aave and asset insurance protocol Nexus Mutual. Based on the success of those early bets, investors asked Decentral for a second fund with a focus on DeFi, Quinn said.  “I think the major distinguishing factor [of the firm] is that we’re more and more founder-focused,” he added.  Quinn called himself a “recovering investment banker” with prior stints at Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, though he also founded decentralized cloud storage company Tardigrade.io. The Decentral Park Capital team is full of entrepreneurs that have built businesses and learned from their mistakes, which provides “scar tissue” that allows the team to relate to founders, said Quinn.  “You know that movie where you don’t want to go into the shed because bad things happen? I can say, ‘I’ve been in that shed. I know what happens in that setting,’” said Quinn.  Crypto-related investment funds hit new highs last year as cryptocurrency prices rallied, but Decentral Park Capital’s latest fund announcement comes during a pullback in prices.

The Luxor “ASIC Trading Desk” will purchase and sell specialized application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining computers on behalf of the Luxor team, miners and investors.  “After moving tens of thousands of machines and serving miners across a few continents, we established a streamlined process for procuring equipment,” said Lauren Lin, Luxor operations manager, in a statement on Tuesday. The product will serve both institutional and retail customers.  The prices of the mining computers on primary and secondary markets are volatile and differ based on macroeconomic conditions, regions and market cycles, the company said. “The Luxor ASIC Trading Desk will trade in these markets, taking principal positions in ASICs to help miners gain access to rigs at fair market prices,” the company added.  Luxor said that the new business line is the first to start a trading desk solely dedicated to these high-performance mining computers. “Our goal is to simplify the procurement process so our miners can spend more time building hashrate and less time worrying about how to find it,” Luxor Vice President of Business Development Alex Brammer said  On Dec. 8, digital asset mining and staking firm Foundry Digital said it launched FoundryX, a new marketplace for buying and selling bitcoin mining machines.  In November, Compass Mining, a bitcoin mining service provider, also said that it launched a resale market for retail miners to sell mining hardware.

The solution works like Google sign-in, without the snooping and with much more flexibility, Unstoppable Domains CEO Matthew Gould said in an interview.  “We think NFT domains are a really great place for building digital identity,” he said, adding that his firm has been exploring ways to use the technology since early 2018, when it was normally referred to as the ERC-721 standard.  “If you want to share some private information about yourself, like your email address, or maybe your credit score, or some KYC [know-your-customer] data, by tying a single sign-on protocol back to your NFT domain, you can now permission applications to look that stuff up about you,” said Gould.  Read more: Sign-In With Ethereum Is Coming  There’s been quite a lot of work done on decentralized identity, with applications like Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gaining attention in recent months. It’s more secure and more user friendly to sign in with an NFT rather than an address, according to Gould.  “If you sign in with an NFT, you also have the ability to store it with a custody provider, for instance, and still use it as an identity, but without having to worry about losing the keys,” he said.  It’s also a good way to address the user experience pain points associated with Web 3, said Gould, and drive adoption amid the general NFT buzz.  Crypto domains  So far, Unstoppable Domains has some 2 million registered domains ending in .crypto, .nft, .wallet and more, and over 50 companies are now integrating Login with Unstoppable, which launched in beta in October 2021.  As well as NFTs as (now ubiquitous) collectibles, Gould likes exploring what he calls “utility NFTs.”  “I’m a big fan of NFTs that you can use to make your life easier, not just for art,” Gould said. “As well as domains, you also see NFTs used in DeFi [decentralized finance] to mark your position. So, marking certain events or proving your membership and inside specific communities is very interesting and there’s a lot more exploration.”",POSITIVE,ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY | ENS,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/11/unstoppable-domains-launches-nft-based-sign-on-for-ethereum-and-polygon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cafc4f934b432e3a92e241ef7a0640b08093d3f3-3024x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393999,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQe4L,1641907405,The Mnuchin Files: New Documents Shed Light on Trump-Era Crypto Policy,"The idea of a digital U.S. dollar had an early behind-the-scenes advocate inside the Trump administration in the president’s son-in-law, newly unearthed documents show.  On May 28, 2019, Jared Kushner, special adviser to the president and Ivanka Trump’s husband, emailed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The message included a link to a blog post by Sam Altman, former head of Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley startup incubator.  The title of the post: “U.S. Digital Currency.”  “Steven – Would you be open to me bringing a small group of people to have a brainstorm about this topic?” Kushner wrote.  “My sense is it could make sense,” Kushner continued, “and also be something that could ultimately change the way we pay out entitlements as well saving us a ton in waste fraud and also in transaction costs…”  Kushner took on many duties during his time at the White House. He had a major role in foreign policy spanning from Mexico to Iraq, as well as assignments to oversee criminal justice reform and an overhaul of the government itself. Some critics saw that broad workload as untenable, but Politico has credited Kushner with real progress on stabilizing the Middle East.  But Kushner’s interest in digital currencies, national or otherwise, was previously unreported (except the time someone tried to extort bitcoin from him). It’s one of several insights gleaned from a 250-page trove of Mnuchin’s crypto-related correspondence during his four years at Treasury.  Obtained by CoinDesk through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the documents also shed light on the challenges presented to the crypto industry by international sanctions and the controversy over Mnuchin’s eleventh-hour proposal on user-controlled wallets. They also contain some unintended comedy as crypto VIPs met with D.C. power players.  Kushner seems to have been meaningfully ahead of the curve in contemplating a digital dollar. Discussion of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) didn’t pick up broadly until late 2019, after the announcement of Facebook’s Libra project was met with ferocious backlash and China got serious about its digital yuan.  The U.S. Federal Reserve, for its part, has been studying the issue of CBDCs, but it has yet to publish any of the long-promised reports detailing the central bank’s position on technological and policy considerations for a digital dollar. Much of the push for a U.S. CBDC has come from the private sector.  It’s also interesting to look back at Altman’s thinking, including his proposal that a U.S. digital currency “would be evenly distributed to U.S. citizens and taxpayers – something like everyone with a social security number gets two coins.”  That jibes with Altman’s current plan for WorldCoin, a token intended to be distributed globally as a form of universal basic income.  It is unclear whether the meeting Kushner proposed to Mnuchin happened. Through an intermediary, Mnuchin declined to comment for this story. Kushner did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Altman.  A plea from Ukraine  In the FOIA request, submitted last March, CoinDesk asked the Treasury for any emails from Mnuchin’s time in office (February 2017 to January 2021) that included the word “cryptocurrency” or several synonyms (“virtual currency,” “digital asset,” etc.) or mentioned prominent companies in the industry like Coinbase or Ripple.  Nine months later, a Treasury FOIA officer sent CoinDesk 100 pages in full and 133 pages in part. The officer completely withheld 13 pages, citing the federal disclosure law’s exemption for trade secrets and personal privacy.  Even so, the documents offer a new window into how a key corner of the U.S. government approached global crypto policy under Trump.  It was an administration often criticized for neglecting America’s partners abroad. Sometimes that tendency carried over to crypto.  On Oct. 7, 2020, Oleksandr Bornyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of digital transformation, sent an email to Mnuchin asking for assistance with an unusual problem: U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Bittrex and Gemini had pulled out from Ukraine.  “We have a deep concern related to termination of services provision by crypto exchanges registered in your jurisdiction,” read the email, addressed to Mnuchin and Mike Pompeo, then Secretary of State.  One of the exchanges Bornyakov mentioned in his correspondence was Bermuda-registered Bittrex. In a 2020 blog post, Bittrex vaguely blamed the “current regulatory environment” for its decision to discontinue service to Ukraine and a handful of other countries and declined to elaborate when contacted by CoinDesk the following year.  Bornyakov reached out to Bittrex, which told him it had concerns about potential users from the Crimean Peninsula, he told CoinDesk last May. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, but most countries still don’t recognize the peninsula as part of Russia. The U.S. and European Union imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and companies that were related to the annexation or benefited from it. The EU also restricted imports and investments in the economy of Crimea by European companies.  Bittrex told the Ukrainian government it couldn’t identify Crimea residents specifically, which meant the company was at risk of violating sanctions on the peninsula if it continued to serve Ukraine.  But it wasn’t Ukraine that was under sanctions, Bornyakov emphasized in his letter.  “Please rest assured that we do respect all the laws and regulations, adopted in the USA,” Bornyakov wrote. He insisted that Ukraine’s 44 million citizens shouldn’t become collateral damage in a sanctions war targeted at Crimea, population 2 million.  “This is why there is a strong need of issuing the respective clarification” to U.S. crypto exchanges that would “eliminate any misunderstandings” and bring service back online, Bornyakov wrote. He asked for an update on “next steps.”  Bornyakov never heard back from the Treasury about his request, he told CoinDesk recently.  Asked for Mnuchin, got Muzinich  The trove of documents also shows the lengths the blockchain industry went to discourage Mnuchin from pursuing the Trump administration’s widely panned, last-minute proposal on user-hosted cryptocurrency wallets. These are wallets where the funds are controlled by the individual, not a company subject to regulation – more like a leather wallet full of cash than a bank account.  Mnuchin had warned during Congressional testimony in February 2020 that “significant new requirements” for cryptocurrency would be coming “very quickly.” But he gave no details then, and the proposal did not come until the waning days of the administration.  The lobbying efforts began at least a month before the proposal finally dropped. On Nov. 17, 2020, Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, emailed the Treasury Department asking to meet with Mnuchin about self-hosted wallets. Her organization had just released a 50-page policy report on the topic, she noted.  “We had heard for [a] few months prior that Treasury had concerns over self-hosted wallets,” Smith told CoinDesk recently. “At the time, we had hoped to use the report as a way to educate policymakers in the new year, but the timeline accelerated when we learned that Treasury was pursuing a midnight rulemaking.”  A week later, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that the Treasury intended to impose onerous requirements for self-hosted wallets.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the Treasury that combats money laundering and terrorism financing, formally proposed the rule and solicited public comment on Dec. 18, 2020, a week before Christmas. The rule would have required crypto exchanges to collect counterparty information, including names and addresses, from anyone hoping to transfer or receive cryptocurrencies to or from self-hosted wallets. FinCEN said it was concerned that the lack of information about users of such wallets created a blind spot in the government’s efforts to combat terrorism financing.  “Mnuchin was heavy on national security,” said a former Treasury staffer. “That was his big focus.”  “Mnuchin was heavy on national security,” said a former Treasury staffer. “That was his big focus.”  The proposal, which insiders say was likely instigated by Mnuchin rather than FinCEN itself, was met with widespread opposition from the industry. Participants worried it would be impossible to comply when the counterparty is an automated smart contract with no name or physical address, and others were concerned about burdensome compliance requirements.  After FinCEN issued the proposal, Smith re-upped her request, offering in a follow-up email to bring some of the association’s member entities on a call with Mnuchin.  An undisclosed Treasury official forwarded the request to Justin Muzinich, then the Deputy Treasury Secretary and two other undisclosed officials, writing, “Didn’t Justin [Muzinich] speak to them? Do you know why this might be coming back up to stm [Secretary Treasury Mnuchin?]”  One of those other officials responded, cryptically, “DELIBERATIVE” in an email that was otherwise redacted.  Mnuchin does appear later on the thread, authorizing Muzinich to take the call.  That call “lasted about five minutes,” Smith later told CoinDesk. “I recall that he called my mobile directly so I wasn’t able to loop in any of our association members. I was able to walk through some high-level talking points, but I remember feeling that this was just a check-the-box type call.”  ‘De facto ban’  The trade group didn’t give up. Paul Clement, an attorney with the law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP, wrote another letter to Mnuchin on the Blockchain Association’s behalf at the end of December 2020, explaining his concerns with the process of creating the proposed rule.  He echoed broader industry concerns about the 15-day public comment period (this was later extended several times) FinCEN provided for input. It is customary for U.S. regulatory agencies to give the public at least 30 and usually closer to 90 days to comment on proposed rule changes.  “The notion that stakeholders could meaningfully engage with a rule that touches on more than 24 separate subjects in such a highly truncated period would be doubtful even in the ordinary course,” the letter says.  “Thus, what purports to be just a reporting requirement may well operate as a de facto ban,” Clement wrote.  He warned that the rule might not stand up to a court challenge, providing examples of case law that suggested the proposal was being rushed unnecessarily.  Read more:Self-Hosted Bitcoin Wallets Become Front Line in Fight Over Crypto Regulations  Nor was the Blockchain Association the only group trying to address the wallet rule concerns.  The rule appears again in a Dec. 22, 2020 email sent to Mnuchin, Keith Abouchar, who appears to be a staffer for Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and the Biden transition team. While the “from” field is redacted, this email contains a public letter originally published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).  The proposed rule appeared rushed, could prevent broader adoption of crypto and wouldn’t allow for cash-like transactions due to the privacy implications, the email said. An EFF employee said no one from the foundation sent the email, but anyone could have copied and emailed the public letter.  A Jan. 21, 2021 email from an undisclosed sender also “urged” Mnuchin to remove the counterparty information requirement from the unhosted wallet rule, saying it could result in “a more burdensome standard” on cryptocurrency transactions than exists for cash and checks.  In the end, the rule was quietly shelved under the Biden administration. FinCEN extended the comment period several times before announcing it would review the rule months later. The rule hasn’t come up again.  No +1s allowed  Much of the crypto-related traffic in Mnuchin’s inbox is more human-sized, sometimes to an amusing degree.  For example, sorting out security clearance for an eagerly awaited Treasury-hosted crypto summit of March 2, 2020, appears to have been tricky.  Increasingly frantic email exchanges highlight the complexity that went into this unprecedented gathering of high-ranking government officials from the Treasury, FinCEN, the FBI and other agencies, who met face-to-face with a gaggle of crypto bigwigs from firms like Coinbase, Xapo, Square and Fidelity.  At the time, the Treasury announced that the meeting happened but didn’t provide any details about who was involved.  The Treasury’s searching and unpredictable know-your-crypto-industry-guest protocol apparently caused the most wrinkles to the entourage of then-Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, who went in his capacity as CEO of Square (now known as Block).  For instance, Mike Brock, head of strategic development at Square, was knocked back, despite brandishing the requisite driving license. Sounding like a character from a spy movie, one of Dorsey’s handlers messaged through that Brock’s attempt to clear security had been denied. “I told him to hold tight,” Square executive assistant Caitlin Friel Rabil said. “He’s outside the building waiting by the Secret Service booth. Is there any way you can let me know when he should try again?”  “We have learned that Coinbase, Xapo and Chainalysis all have been allowed to bring +1s and we would like to ask the same for Jack. Can you please let me know if Jack can bring a member of his staff with him on Monday?”  When it came to Dorsey himself, a couple of special requests were relayed over by his team. First, some additional guests were asked for, because word had got out that other delegates had been granted that courtesy.  “We have learned that Coinbase, Xapo and Chainalysis all have been allowed to bring +1s and we would like to ask the same for Jack. Can you please let me know if Jack can bring a member of his staff with him on Monday?” Rabil wrote on Feb. 28, the Friday before the meeting.  Dorsey’s handlers also asked if he could be driven up to a side door in order to hide his identity. (Kind of understandable; Dorsey is definitely more recognizable than your average businessman.)  “I noted on the invite that you suggest Jack go in through the North gate. Is there any way he can get closer via car just so he’s less visible, given the sensitivity of the meeting?” his assistant said.  The reply from Treasury was polite but firm: “As of right now no +1s will be allowed to join the meeting, it will be the invited principals only. I’m afraid he will have to be dropped off at the corner of 15th & New York Ave. and proceed on foot to the north entrance. There is no parking at the building.”  The only crypto VIP invited to the March 2 summit who did not attend was billionaire PayPal co-founder, venture capital investor and Trump supporter Peter Thiel, according to preparatory emails among Treasury officials.  CoinDesk reached out to Thiel and Dorsey but didn’t receive a response from either by press time.  What might have been  The March 2020 crypto summit was meant to kick off a series of working groups involving government and industry. The incipient crypto engagement program, however, was stopped in its tracks by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a source who worked at the Treasury at that time.  “We brought in a lot of industry leaders and we wanted a strong and friendly line of communication. Of course this all got put on the back burner because of Covid,” the Trump administration source told CoinDesk.  “I would say that now you just don’t see that level of engagement” under Biden, the former Treasury official said. “It’s almost zero from what I’ve seen. Instead, I think there’s a high level of antagonism right now.”  Indeed, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has continued, if not heightened, his predecessor’s antagonism toward the crypto industry. The regulator has continued serving enforcement actions and issuing subpoenas to individuals in the business. The SEC even subpoenaed a stablecoin founder right before he went onstage during a conference in New York late last year.  Industry participants are further concerned that the Treasury Department under Mnuchin’s successor Janet Yellen might bring the hammer down on crypto this year, when it explains how it will enforce a controversial tax provision in last year’s infrastructure bill that seeks to collect taxes from crypto brokers.  “I don’t think [Mnuchin] ever did anything that was especially good or especially bad for crypto, until that moment when he did something terrible.”  On the other hand, other parts of the Biden administration have been building bridges. Biden’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Rostin Benham, for example, put Jason Somensatto, formerly of decentralized exchange developer 0x Labs, in charge of the agency’s financial technology division, LabCFTC. Also, Yellen’s Treasury has focused its fight against ransomware on sanctioning exchanges, and that specificity has come as a relief to many crypto lobbyists.  Moreover, Mnuchin was far from solicitous toward the industry near the end of his tenure, when he tried to rush through the proposed rule requiring crypto businesses to verify the identity of counterparties with self-hosted wallets.  “I don’t think he ever did anything that was especially good or especially bad for crypto, until that moment when he did something terrible,” said Jerry Brito, executive director of Washington-based think tank Coin Center.  “We can never replay the videotape and see how it would have turned out if we hadn’t had a pandemic,” said Brito, one of the attendees at the March 2, 2020 meeting.  “One story is, you would have had a series of more roundtables with industry that would have resulted in great regulation,” he said. “Another possibility is that we would have had the unhosted wallet rule soon after. Hopefully, if you had had many more meetings, [Mnuchin] would have realized over the course of those meetings that was not a smart thing to do.”  It’s who you know  The trove of emails also underscores why, despite crypto’s disruptive promise, companies in the field have been hiring veterans of the legacy financial industry.  Coinbase Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas “has a personal friendship with Secretary Mnuchin”, according to an email to the Treasury department from Kara Calvert, then a partner at the exchange’s D.C. lobbyist Franklin Square Group and now in-house. (Haas was previously CFO at OneWest, the bank Mnuchin ran.)  For that reason, Haas got added to a Treasury conference call with Brian Armstrong in May 2020 at Coinbase’s request, the email said.  Finally, and fittingly for the blockchain industry, the very first email in the 250-page pdf Treasury provided to CoinDesk is an investment pitch addressed to Mnuchin.  “Would you be interested in investing in our early stage round for accredited investors?” Dave Cohen, CEO of Taekion, wrote to the Treasury Secretary on Jan. 10, 2019. “If so, we can send detailed company info.”  Cohen described his company as “the first AI and blockchain based platform that will disrupt the global cybersecurity industry.”  It’s unclear if Mnuchin responded to Cohen, who didn’t reply to CoinDesk’s request for comment.

Prices are down 6% from last week’s highs of $17.67, having breached the resistance level around $17. A support level exists at the $13 mark, and if NEAR drops through that, the token could slump to as low as $10.  The protocol gained favor among investors as a layer 1 play and was the third-largest crypto ecosystem by developer activity, a report from crypto venture firm Electric Capital said last week.  ATOM added as much as 8% to over $39.33 in the past 24 hours before a brief sell-off saw it lose 35 cents at the time of writing. Prices were as low as $32 on Monday evening. The tokens are trading around a resistance-turned-support level of $37 at the time of writing, with a prominent buying zone until the $30 level if historic price action is considered.  Crypto developers say newer blockchains create avenues for the development of new protocols, which contribute to their appeal among investors. “If Cosmos becomes EVM compatible it’s great news for the DeFi space because companies will be able to extend the reach of their dapps [decentralized applications] to a new network and develop new ones on top of it too,” Asaf Naim, co-founder of crypto management app Kirobo, said in a Telegram message with CoinDesk.  EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine, the part of Ethereum that executes the blockchain’s rules and makes sure a submitted transaction or smart contract follows them.  Layer 1 blockchains such as Avalanche, Terra and Solana surged to highs in 2021 – posting yearly returns of as high as 3,800% to token investors – as users moved away from Ethereum to cheaper and faster blockchains.  Capital has since rotated to previously lesser-known blockchains, such as Fantom, Harmony, Near and Cosmos. Fantom emerged as one of the top performers in the last week of December, posting returns of as high as 77% in a little over 14 days.  But some, like Naim, say Ethereum remains the top dog: “It’s great to see Ethereum competitors doing well because it widens the ecosystem, but I’d also say that the fact that we measure their characteristics in terms of Ethereum shows the extent to which Ethereum is still the gold standard in the industry,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/11/near-cosmos-defy-altcoin-plunge-with-price-surge,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The team that runs FTX includes many of the most prominent cryptocurrency traders in the last few years.

FTX claims it stands apart due to features such as clawback protection as well as centralized collateral pools and a universal settlement using stablecoins.

The company announced on Tuesday that Olga Goncharova, until recently the head of the Bank of Russia’s Department of Collecting and Processing of Reports, joined Binance as its first director of government relations in the country. She had been leading her department at the Bank of Russia since 2014.  At Binance, she will build relationships with federal government bodies in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States as well as supervise the company’s interactions with trade associations in the region, according to the press release.  In Ukraine, Binance is hiring Kyrylo Khomiakov, who led the government’s Agency for Infrastructure Projects until June 2021, as director. He previously worked at banks including Intesa Sanpaolo, BNP Paribas and Mellon Ukraine, as well as the U.S. fintech company Fiserv, according to his LinkedIn profile.  In July last year, Ukraine passed a law allowing its central bank, the National Bank of Ukraine, to issue a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. The country’s parliament recently passed a bill regulating cryptocurrency-related activities and businesses in Ukraine, however, President Volodymyr Zelensky refused to sign it into the law, demanding amendments.  Besides Goncharova in Russia, Binance hired Vladimir Smerkis, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur and consultant, as a director. Smerkis founded crypto startup Tokenbox and was formerly a deputy vice president at Russia’s internet services giant, Mail.ru Group. He was also one of the smaller investors in Telegram’s 2018 failed token sale.

Smerkis told CoinDesk that companies he previously founded and consulted has been actively participating in Binance’s hackathons and competitions. Now he will be working on “making Binance’s presence in Russia stronger and help legitimization and mass adoption of blockchain in the country,” as well as attracting local developers to Binance’s own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain, and other initiatives.  Smerkis added that the company is talking to Russian regulators to clarify the country’s stance toward crypto.

42375532,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8hRN,1641897257,Bitcoin’s Near 40% Slide Weighs on Crypto Stocks While Coinbase Outperforms,"Bitcoin (BTC) has taken a beating over the past two months, bringing pain for digital assets and blockchain-related stocks, most of which have taken an even bigger hit. Shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) have been an outlier, losing less than bitcoin.  CoinDesk data shows bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has lost over 39% of its value since hitting record highs near $69,000 on Nov. 10 owing to a broad-based move to less-risky assets triggered by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance. Coinbase stock has dropped 36%.  Shares of the U.S.-listed mining companies Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Bit Digital (BTBT) have dropped more than 50% each since Nov. 10, according to data from charting platform TradingView.  Argo Blockchain (ARBK), the only crypto miner listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), has declined by 45%, while Canadian crypto miners Hive Blockchain (HIVE) and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) have slipped 52% and 59%, respectively. Toronto-listed crypto exchange Voyager Digital (VYGVF) is down 50% alongside a 45% slide in shares in MicroStrategy (MSTR), a business-intelligence software company that holds 122,478 BTC, worth nearly $6 billion, on its balance sheet.  The decline in the value of the so-called crypto stocks is perhaps reflective of institutions losing interest in the sector amid rising prospects of faster Fed rate hikes. It also shows that investing in bitcoin remains a safer way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. Still, while bitcoin may be viewed as digital gold by some in the crypto community, it is also an emerging technology. That makes both bitcoin and crypto stocks sensitive to monetary policy tightening.  “Some institutions use crypto equities as a proxy for crypto itself,” Mike Alfred, a value investor and CEO at BrightScope and Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “It’s easier for hedge funds to buy COIN than it is for them to hold BTC directly for various reasons.”  One possible explanation for COIN’s relative strength could be that the exchange’s revenue is tied to bitcoin’s price volatility rather than its price trajectory. The high price turbulence seen in recent weeks usually means more transactions and increased revenue.  The investor community is now beginning to look at COIN as a value stock instead of a growth stock. Value stocks are companies considered to be trading below what they are worth. Growth stocks are the ones with the potential to outperform the overall market over a given period and are more vulnerable to interest-rate hikes.  “COIN is the only crypto stock in my personal top 10 equity holdings. I like it because they have the best brand amongst the highly regulated players,” Alfred said. “It also trades at a reasonable multiple compared to traditional exchanges. I actually view it as a value stock at these levels.”  Bank of America recently upgraded Coinbase to buy from neutral while keeping the price target unchanged at $340, citing increasing signs of revenue diversification beyond retail crypto trading as the catalyst for the change in rating.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/11/bitcoins-near-40-slide-weighs-on-crypto-stocks-while-coinbase-outperforms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/025b373b21c52a810bd8eff60f00905c7eaef57a-1806x1184.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The latest tech claims to be a recursive SNARK that&apos;s compatible with Ethereum blockchain and 100x faster than existing alternatives. Plonky2 is an essential step towards Ethereum scaling. While ZK L2s have the best use case, the current solutions depend on cryptographic primitives that are inefficient and limit scalability. Ultimately, L2 competes on throughput and cost, Plonky2 gives the Polygon ecosystem to build better scalable L2s. One of the biggest strengths of ZK-Proofs is recursion which is critical for blockchain scalability. This means one SNARK can verify the other SNARKs making the network performance faster, less resource-intensive, and more decentralized. To support recursion and low verification cost on Ethereum, Plonky2 combines PLONK and FRI and the best of STARKs. SNARK is a type of cryptographic proof that proves the veracity of data without revealing the contents of that data. Commenting on the development, the Polygon team wrote in a blog post: &apos;Plonky2 is a recursive SNARK that is 100x faster than existing alternatives and natively compatible with Ethereum.

Both firms said they welcome a close collaboration with financial regulators and that the focus for an initial rollout is Europe.  ‘Merchant Yield’  The way things work today, payment processors still offer slow settlement times and charge merchants anywhere between 3% and 11% of each transaction, said Elrond Network CEO Beniamin Mincu.  “A superlative version of payments that’s flawless, instant and inexpensive anywhere in the world is already a great step forward,” said Mincu in an interview. “But what if, instead of charging a merchant X% per month to process transactions, they can receive this yield, to compensate for what they are spending on fees and maybe have a 5% yield in addition?”  Read more: Elrond Leapfrogs Into DeFi’s Top 10 as Users Chase Ridiculously Large Incentive Program  Under the hood, the Merchant Yield application, which will enter beta testing in the first half of this year, will comprise various tiers of risk vs. return, ranging from staking on the Elrond proof-of-stake blockchain to participating in DeFi protocols.  Educating merchants with a clear and simple explanation of the new yield product will be key, said Mincu, who did not name any particular DeFi platforms at this time.  Sanja Kon, CEO of Utrust, which is regulated in Estonia and currently processes payments in BTC, ETH, DASH and USDT, as well as its own UTK token and now Elrond eGold (EGLD), says merchants are much more amenable to settling in cryptocurrency these days. As far as earning yield on their crypto, Kon believes merchants want to invest in the blockchain universe.  “It’s a way for merchants to have their stake in this space and a more diversified treasury,” said Kon in an interview. “We really want to change how people pay and get paid. Traditional payments are incentivized more in the way of large marketplaces and large merchants, instead of giving everyone the opportunity to do business. And that’s what we want to do.”",POSITIVE,BTC | DASH | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | DASH | ETH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/elrond-foundation-acquires-crypto-payments-firm-utrust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8858ff2d668989eb29a10dcb5f906a2db85327e-1280x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375543,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8hch,1641890485,"Olympus Tanks 30% Led by Liquidations on Fuse, Souring Market Sentiment","Tokens of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Olympus (OHM) dropped as much as 32% in the past 24 hours as crypto traders moved away from experimental DeFi projects amid an overall negative sentiment in the crypto market.  OHM fell from Monday’s peak of $264 to $161 during the early Asian hours on Tuesday, reaching lows previously seen in May 2021. The move was part of a larger downtrend since October 2021 highs of $1,360, when the protocol reached a market capitalization of $4 billion. As of Tuesday, OHM prices are down 87% from all-time highs.  Olympus, like other DeFi projects, relies on smart contracts instead of intermediaries to provide financial services to users. Its goal is to create a stablecoin backed by crypto instead of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which users can, in turn, stake for currently offered annualized returns of 7,800%.  Users are incentivized to deposit or sell their OHM collaterals in return for discounted OHM sold by bonds issued by Olympus. This is said to create “protocol-owned liquidity,” as the user-issued liquidity provider (LP) tokens are tied back to the bonds issued by Olympus, creating a continuous loop of supply and demand.  Fuse liquidations contribute to OHM fall  Analysts said a popular pool to leverage returns on OHM tokens saw overnight liquidations which contributed to the price drop.  “People who employed the leveraged OHM strat (9,9) by borrowing from Fuse got liquidated,” explained Ashwath Balakrishnan, vice president of research at Delphi Digital, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.  Fuse is an interest rates product by Rari Capital, a DeFi protocol that provides yield-earning services to users. Fuse lets users create their customized pool consisting of various interest-earning tokens, allowing other users to stake their own tokens on such pools and earn yields.  The rather risky Pool #18 on Fuse is focused on Olympus, locking up over $101 million across OHM and eight other cryptocurrencies. The pool takes OHM staking a step ahead for users: unlike staking OHM on Olympus, staking OHM on Fuse allows users to borrow cryptocurrencies against their OHM holdings while continuing to earn interest on the staked OHM. This allows users to access liquidity without having to sell their OHM rewards and missing out on potential gains.  However, such borrowing features come with their drawbacks. Holdings are automatically liquidated when prices of underlying tokens fall below a certain level, as the Fuse protocol needs to maintain the collateral’s monetary position.  Sell-offs in the open market lead to falling prices, which in turn lead to further sell-offs by token holders who may want to take profits on their positions. This creates a cascading event that contributes to drastic price drops, one that OHM saw in the past 24 hours.

42375533,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8hSd,1641861655,Government Report Suggests Tightening Regulations on Crypto ATMs,"The use of crypto payments to facilitate illegal human and drug trafficking is rising, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) is blaming crypto kiosks.  In a new study released Monday, the GAO – a government agency that provides auditing and investigative services for Congress – highlighted that the kiosks, also called crypto ATMs, were partly responsible for this surge because the machines are less regulated than crypto exchanges and transactions are more difficult to trace.  “As [crypto] market usage expands, FBI officials said they expect to see an increase in the use of virtual currency kiosks for illicit purposes, including for human and drug trafficking,” the report said.  The agency suggested the Internal Revenue Service and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), both units of the U.S. Treasury Dept., should work together and take a firmer hand in regulating the kiosks.  The report examined the use of cryptocurrencies in global trafficking operations and how U.S. agencies, including the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the IRS are countering the rise in crypto-facilitated crime.  The GAO also considered the challenges agencies face in fighting crypto crime, finding that a pervasive lack of information, especially about crypto kiosks, was interfering with law enforcement’s ability to identify and stop criminals.  The GAO’s findings that crypto-enabled crime is rising are at odds with a new report from crypto research firm Chainalysis, which found that although crypto crime is increasing by volume, it reached an all-time low as a percentage of all blockchain transactions in 2021. In other words, as cryptocurrencies has become more mainstream, crypto crime will continue to rise, but the growth in above-board crypto transactions is outpacing illicit activity.  Read more: Crypto Crime Hit an All-Time High of $14B in 2021 as Prices Climbed: Chainalysis  Human trafficking  The GAO report found that crypto can be used as a payment method for human trafficking – the umbrella term for both labor trafficking and sex trafficking – but is more common in payments to sex traffickers.  Citing research from Polaris, a U.S.-based non-profit that seeks to end human trafficking, the GAO’s report said that of 40 major online “commercial sex markets” which “may be used to facilitate sex trafficking,” over half (23 out of 40) accepted cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.  The increasing adoption of crypto payments for online sex marketplaces can, according to the GAO, be attributed to the difficulties of accepting credit and debit card payments – something that was seen last year when sex-focused content subscription service OnlyFans decided to ban porn after facing pressure from banks. The decision was ultimately reversed after OnlyFans received public backlash from fans.  Read more:OnlyFans Shows How the Banking System is Politicized  Drug trafficking  The GAO’s report said that after the demise of the online dark web marketplace Silk Road in 2013, the overall dark web marketplace for illegal drugs has become more stable and harder for law enforcement to detect due to the proliferation of smaller marketplaces.  “When law enforcement shuts down one marketplace, criminals can easily move operations to other established marketplaces,” the GAO report reads.  This doesn’t mean the government is unable to seize crypto used in drug trafficking. In 2021 alone, the IRS seized $3.5 billion in crypto – $1 billion of which was tied to Silk Road.  During its investigation, the GAO found that, of all ICE investigations that involved crypto, 36% related to drug trafficking. For the IRS, a quarter of its crypto investigations were drug related. And for the USPS, a whopping 85% of the agency’s crypto seizures involved drug trafficking.  Money laundering  According to the GAO report, drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) are “increasingly using virtual currency because of its perceived anonymity and as a more efficient method to move money across international borders.”  Though the report highlights that the most common methods of money laundering – bulk cash smuggling and trade-based money laundering – haven’t changed, crypto is becoming a more common way to move money across borders without attracting the attention of law enforcement.  The GAO attributed the increasing popularity of crypto-enabled money laundering to the less-regulated kiosks, which offer more anonymity-enhancing features.  “Money couriers deposit large volumes of cash from illegal drug proceeds into a kiosk to convert the value to virtual currency,” the report said. “Once the illicit proceeds are in this form, the funds can easily be transferred to another virtual currency user’s wallet, reducing the risk associated with transporting bulk currency.”  Cracking down on kiosks  The GAO’s specific issue with crypto kiosks is that, though kiosk operators must register with FinCEN, they do not have to regularly update any law enforcement agency about the location of their kiosks. That “limits federal agencies’ ability to identify kiosks in areas that have been designated as high risk for financial crimes.”  By tightening regulation of these crypto kiosks, the GAO believes that law enforcement will be able to obtain improved information and be better able to identify “potentially illicit transactions.”  The GAO provided two recommendations to the IRS and FinCEN on how to improve the regulation of crypto kiosks.  The report suggested that the director of FinCEN and the commissioner of the IRS simultaneously review the money services business (MSB) registration requirements for crypto kiosks and other exchanges, and consider new requirements for kiosk operators to regularly update law enforcement on the physical addresses of their kiosks.  According to the GAO, the IRS and FinCEN concurred with the recommendations.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/11/government-report-suggests-tightening-regulations-on-crypto-atms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0174e2f0fb05c644e425124df8ea51a0b1293ca6-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

TZERO allegedly failed to properly disclose key information, including that it was sharing order information with a broker-dealer affiliate and Blue Ocean Technologies, a trading partner in Singapore it later acquired, in accordance with federal regulations, according to the SEC’s order. The company apparently also did not file an amendment to its Form ATS with the SEC for more than two years after it began sharing this information, despite the fact that it was required.  TZERO is an alternative trading system (ATS), a trading platform regulated differently from national stock exchanges. The company, which is affiliated with Overstock, also offers trading and settlement services for security tokens, or securities recorded on a blockchain.  In the settlement, tZERO is barred from further regulatory violations along with receiving its relatively light fine.  “Whether and how an ATS displays orders and trading interest is fundamental to any ATS’s operations, because order display provides buyers and sellers with the expectation of liquidity in the ATS and the potential execution of a participant’s orders,” the SEC order said.  TZERO proposed the settlement, which the SEC accepted, according to the order. Under the terms of the settlement, tZERO is neither admitting nor denying the SEC’s findings.
