At HBUS, the U.S. affiliate of the Singapore-based Huobi exchange, both deposits and withdrawals of USDT ""have increased by over 10x over the last two days,"" a company spokesperson told CoinDesk.  And the investors making deposits appear to be set on swapping it for TrueUSD (TUSD), which TrustToken launched earlier this year. While HBUS is a small exchange, ranking only 129th by adjusted total volume according to CoinMarketCap, it appears to be one of the very few in the world where investors can trade TUSD for bitcoin (Bittrex being another rare example).  ""With the recent news around [tether], we've had a lot of activity in the past 24 hours,"" the spokesperson said, explaining:  ""For deposits, users are transferring their USDT into HBUS from other exchanges to take advantage of our USDT/TUSD trading pair. There has been over a 30 [percent] increase in trading on the TUSD/USDT pair over the last two days.""  While USDT maintained its peg through the first few weeks of October, it fell to an all-time low of roughly $0.87 on Monday, taking nearly a day to recover. At press time the token was still trading at only $0.97, while alternate stablecoins maintained a premium of more than $1.  The Gemini dollar (GUSD) in particular saw its price spike over Monday and Tuesday, reaching an all-time high of $1.19. By press time, this token had also recovered its peg, trading at $1.01 at press time.  The phenomenon is also observable at HBUS, where it cost 0.95 USDT to buy one TUSD on Wednesday afternoon.

42402019,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Dtf,1539799222,Gemini Stablecoin Volume Doubles on Top 10 Exchange Amid Tether Turmoil,"When the Tether (USDT) stablecoin's $1 peg broke down on Monday, traders looking for another dollar equivalent they could easily move between cryptocurrency exchanges had few other places to turn.  One of those places was Bibox, the ninth-largest exchange by 24-hour adjusted volume, according to CoinMarketCap, which accounts for basically all trading – 96 percent at the time of writing – in the Gemini Dollar (GUSD), a dollar-pegged alternative to tether. (Gemini, the exchange founded by the Winkelvoss twins, does not currently offer trading pairs using its stablecoin.)  According to internal data Bibox shared with CoinDesk, trading volume for GUSD pairs on the exchange roughly doubled in the wake of the tether turmoil.  Bibox's trading volume in USDT pairs, meanwhile, fell by around 70 percent. ""Traders have less incentive to trade USDT as a method to hedge risk,"" the exchange's co-founder, Aries Wang, told CoinDesk.  Even following this shift, however, GUSD volumes pale in comparison to those for the older and better-established tether. Bibox only announced GUSD trading in late September, making it, Wang said, the first exchange to list it.  ""I think USDT still has a dominant trading volume among all other stablecoins,"" Wang said, noting that USDT volume on the exchange fell from a high of $50 million, while GUSD volume rose to a high of $2 million.  Indeed, GUSD launched only a month ago, so the surge in volume is from a small base. According to CoinMarketCap, six exchanges currently offer live trading in GUSD, of which just three – Bibox, OKEx and HitBTC – have 24-hour trading volumes above $100,000. And OKEx has only offered trading in GUSD since Tuesday.  Still, as CoinDesk previously reported, demand for non-tether stablecoins has caused their dollar pegs to break as well, driving GUSD's exchange rate as high as $1.09.  Alternatives on the rise  And judging by a recent spate of listing announcements, USDT's dominant position appears to be in play.  Within hours of Tether's peg breaking, exchanges rushed to offer trading in Tether alternatives such as GUSD, Circle's USD Coin (USDC), Paxos Standard (PAX), and TrustToken's TrueUSD (TUSD).  The rush began with OKEx and FCoin, which announced that they would each list TUSD, USDC, GUS and PAX.  Huobi soon followed, saying it would list the same four stablecoins. BitForex said it would list GUSD; ZB.com announced that it would list PAX; and Bit-Z said it would list all four: USDT, GUSD, USDC and PAX. BCEX announced GUSD and PAX trading pairs. An outside spokesperson for CoinBene told CoinDesk the exchange would soon announce listings of GUSD and PAX.  Bibox, which had beaten the rush, reminded customers that USDT was not their only option.  ""What to do now if you are holding #USDT?"" the exchange tweeted, throwing in a ""face screaming in fear"" emoji for good measure. ""How about converting it to other #stablecoins such as #GUSD?""  Another early adopter of non-Tether stablecoins, DigiFinex, has gone further than the others, announcing in mid-September that it would not only list TUSD, but phase out trading in USDT.  ""We have set a goal of getting rid of Tether within this year,"" DigiFinex co-founder Kiana Shek told CoinDesk. The exchange has since announced the additions of PAX and USDC, she added.

The company announced the latest equity financing on Wednesday, which is backed by Danhua Venture Capital, the NEO Foundation and Wu Capital, a China-based family office and limited partner in funds created by investment firms like Sequoia China.  Launched in November 2017, Cobo was founded by Mao Shixing, a.k.a Discus Fish in the Chinese crypto community, and a former Google and Facebook engineer named Jiang Changhao, whose previous crypto wallet startup Bihang was acquired by OKCoin in 2013.  Mao is also an early-stage bitcoin investor who dropped out of college at the age of 23 to found F2Pool in 2013, one of the earliest mining pools in China that now owns about 7 percent of the global bitcoin hash rate.  Cobo, which now has about 60 people on staff, said the wallet service has been able to amass around 500,000 users – 80 percent of whom come from China – since the app went live early this year, thanks to its offering of a staking pool feature.  In addition to cryptocurrencies based on the proof-of-work mechanism, the wallet also allows users to store proof-of-stake crypto assets and consolidate them as a pooled force to continue proof-of-stake mining and distribute block rewards to users on a proportional basis.  With the new capital, Cobo is eyeing an expansion of its services to other developing economies as the market in China has entered a ""plateau,"" co-founder and CEO Mao told CoinDesk in an interview.  ""We are now looking to recruit more engineers as we target to expand to Southeast Asian markets like Vietnam and Indonesia, as well as African countries,"" he said.  In addition, Liu Lixin, head of hardware at Cobo, said the company is launching Cobo Vault, a wallet product that the company touts to be ""military grade.""  Liu added that Cobo Vault features a self-destruction mechanism, which – upon detection of any physical force of removing the chip that stores private keys – will eliminate all the inside data. After that, users can only regain access to their crypto assets via mnemonic phrases – a set of words that can be translated into private keys.  Liu said the company has started the pre-order of the hardware with shipments scheduled around early December.  The new funding comes after Cobo raised a total of $7 million in a seed round in October and also a pre-A round in December last year, the company said.

While the firm has already invested in know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) measures, and hired compliance professionals, he said:  ""Criminals are always looking to loopholes in the system, so we are continuously on the lookout for new technologies and methods to combat money laundering and malicious actors.""  Chainalysis' system works by using a combination of pattern recognition, proprietary algorithms and different open-source resources to process cryptocurrency services. If suspicious activity is detected during a transaction, the software will generate an alert.  The tool can also help cryptocurrency companies to ease the process of opening bank accounts, due to its compliance with relevant KYC and AML laws, according to the release.  Chainalysis co-founder and COO Jonathan Levin told CoinDesk that cryptocurrency market participants ""must develop greater trust in the data and technology underlying our ecosystem"" in order for the overall space to advance.  ""By working with industry leaders like Binance, we're able to mold the foundation for credible and robust markets in all jurisdictions,"" he said.

42401996,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Dxb,1539781255,Wallet Provider Blockchain Is Backing Crypto Giveaways In a Big Way,"""Airdrops are good for crypto users.""  Those are the unequivocal words of cryptocurrency wallet and data provider Blockchain in a new white paper that sets out why it believes token giveaways can be beneficial for both individuals and the crypto ecosystem, while announcing a new program aimed to assist approved projects with token distributions ""as a force for good.""  Addressing the issues that newcomers face when obtaining cryptos for the first time, the paper says that making purchases through an exchange or an initial coin offering (ICO) requires, for one, actually having the financial wherewithal to do so. Further, a buyer may be faced with regulatory issues that vary across different regions, as well as risks that come with depositing funds in online platforms.  Mining crypto, too, poses difﬁculties for newcomers, requiring technical know-how and often costly equipment.  ""Airdrops, on the other hand, provide a free and transparent way for anyone with an internet connection and a computing device to obtain cryptoassets at no cost,"" according to the white paper.  It goes on to argue that airdrops can easily reach millions of individuals around the world, can help with financial empowerment, and can boost the wider crypto industry via increased adoption.  Backing up that belief, the company is today announcing its Blockchain Airdrops program – a way of helping crypto projects reach Blockchain's millions of wallet holders (its website now boasts 29 million downloads), and providing a more secure way for users to receive cryptocurrencies.  Marco Santori, president and chief legal officer at Blockchain, told CoinDesk via email:  ""We think airdrops have the power to decentralize networks without the investment risks inherent in ICOs and the complexity inherent in mining. Using Blockchain Airdrops, crypto creators can supercharge network effects and crypto users can try out new tokens for free. It's a win-win for the ecosystem""  Using the initiative, token projects ""should aim for broad distribution to as many individual users as possible within a properly targeted community,"" the paper says. ""Failure to ensure broad distribution would defeat the purpose of the airdrop.""  However, it adds, airdrops can also be targeted at ""network influencers and connectors, individuals or institutions"" in order to help bring about wider crypto adoption and use.  In order to be considered for the program, the paper states that tokens must be distributed at no cost and must have a function. An airdrop should also be conducted in a ""transparent and deterministic manner,"" and be free from ""alteration or manipulation.""  Other factors, too, are taken into account, such as a project's technical team, its community and network activity, and regulatory compliance.  ""Historically, airdrops have met with mixed success. We took the most effective airdrop elements we've seen, eliminated the ineffective ones, and added some novel thinking of our own. That's how we developed our Guiding Principles,"" said Santori, adding that the company is now ""actively considering"" token projects that reflect its guiding principles.

Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the partnership will allow AWS users to develop and launch smart contracts ""quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively"" using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), according to a press release issued by the Qtum team.  Simon Wang, head of territory business development at AWS China, confirmed the partnership, telling CoinDesk in an email: ""Qtum are now an AWS technology partner and one of the partner network members.""  Based in Singapore, Qtum, which raised $1 million last January from investors including Anthony Di Iorio, OKCoin CEO Star Xu, BitFund founder Xiaolai Li and Fenbushi partner Bo Shen, launched its public blockchain a year ago.

42402009,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3E8Q,1539774034,3 Hurdles Could Complicate Bitcoin's Price Recovery,"Forcing a bitcoin (BTC) price breakout is looking anything but easy for the bulls, with the path to $7,400 being littered with resistance levels.  Stepping back, the leading cryptocurrency jumped above $6,800 on Monday, neutralizing the bearish view put forward by a downside break of a trendline support last Friday.  The sharp recovery from lows below $6,200 also adds credence to the argument that BTC has likely charted a long-term bottom around the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA). Moreover, the repeated defense of the area around $6,000 indicates sellers exhaustion. Hence, the stage looks set for a strong move to the upside.  However, securing a bearish-to-bullish trend change above $7,402 (Sept. 4 high) is going to be a tough task as BTC could encounter stiff resistance at following technical levels:  Trendline falling from July highs  BTC clocked a high of $6,810 on Monday, but closed (as per UTC) at $6,440, keeping intact the resistance of the trendline drawn between the July 25 and Sept. 5 highs.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading around the trendline resistance of $6,430 on Coinbase. A high-volume close above that level would open the doors to the next resistance level lined up above $6,800.  Horizontal line from Sept. 22 high of $6,823  BTC's failure to hold above $6,823 on Monday has established that level as a key near-term resistance. In any case, it is a key horizontal hurdle, as seen in the chart above.  It is worth noting that horizontal resistance or support levels (major high or low) carry more importance in technical analysis than trendlines, whose connecting points may differ from person to person.  Trendline from March highs  The trendline connecting March highs and July highs is currently located at $7,020 and could cap upside.  The longer the duration of the trendline, the more validity is attached to the support or resistance level it represents.  Hence, the prospects of a bull breakout above $7,400 would rise sharply if BTC manages to clear this eight-month-long falling trendline on the back of strong volumes.  View  BTC seems to have carved out a bottom around the 21-day EMA, although a bullish breakout is $1,000 away.  A break above the trendline sloping downwards from March highs could be considered an early sign of impending bullish reversal above $7,402 (Sept. 4 high).  On the downside, the 21-month EMA of $6,123 is the level to beat for the bears.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42402001,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Dya,1539771721,Rwanda Starts Tracking Conflict Metal Tantalum With Blockchain,"Rwanda has turned to blockchain to track the supply chain of tantalum, a metal used in consumer electronics, in a bid to address concerns over conflict minerals in global markets.  Rwandan cabinet minister Francis Gatare, who is also CEO of the country's Mining, Petroleum and Gas Board, announced the blockchain initiative at a meeting of the Rwandan Mining Association on Oct. 16., saying the ""new and innovative mineral traceability solution"" has already been implemented ""by at least one exporter from Rwanda.""  Rwanda is one of the the world's primary exporters of tantalum concentrates, producing around a half of the global supply in 2014, according to science journal Nature. However, minerals markets are increasingly wary over its reputation as a conflict mineral amid international agreements designed to counter the illicit side of the trade.  To assist with the technical side of the initiative, the government has teamed up with London-based startup Circulor, which offers a supply chain tracking solution, built on Hyperledger Fabric. The product is, in part, aimed to promote ethical sourcing of mining products.    The blockchain platform will be used to track tantalum mined in Rwanda across the whole supply chain.      Mining firm PRG Resources, which supplies consumer tech giant Apple with tantalum, took part in a pilot of the project and is now using it in production, according to the release.    Douglas Johnson-Poensgen, CEO of Circulor said:  ""Circulor will not only assist miners in Rwanda to adhere to strict guidelines laid out in international agreements to remove conflict minerals from the supply chain but will also record all the production stages before a smartphone or computer reaches the consumer.""  Using blockchain and smart contracts technology to trace provenance is fast gaining traction in the mining industry. In May of this year, De Beers carried out a blockchain trial tracking diamonds from mine to retail.  And, in August, China's ZhongAn Technology launched a gem-tracking blockchain application aimed at achieving a higher level of traceability in the luxury industry.

42402003,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3E2W,1539766850,CFTC Official Warns Smart Contract Designers Over Predictive Code,"Smart contract coders could be held liable if they knowingly use blockchain technology to create functions that are deemed as predictive ""event contracts,"" according to a U.S. regulator.  Speaking at an event in Dubai on Tuesday, Brian Quintenz, a commissioner at the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), explained his views on how old laws can be applied to new technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts.  In his remarks, Quintenz noted that smart contracts can be ""easily customized and are almost limitless in their applicability"" to the extent they can even be used to replicate traditional financial instruments.  Some blockchain protocols, he pointed out, allow ""individuals to create their own smart contracts predicting future events more broadly.""  ""Essentially, these contracts would allow individuals to bet on the outcome of future events, like sporting events or elections, using digital currency. If your prediction is right, the contract automatically pays you the winnings,"" he said.  Quintenz noted these activities could fall under the category of what the CFTC calls a ""prediction market,"" where individuals use ""event contracts,"" binary options, or other derivative contracts to bet on the occurrence or outcome of future events.  ""In the past, the CFTC has generally prohibited prediction markets as contrary to the public interest,"" he said. ""For example, event contracts based upon war, terrorism, assassination, or other similar incidents may be contrary to the public interest – in which case, the CFTC can prohibit an exchange from offering the contract.""  As CoinDesk reported in July, the Augur blockchain network saw the arrival of assassination markets on its platform within weeks of going live, allowing users to gamble on the fates of prominent public figures.  Quintenz continued to say that the CFTC will use its traditional methods to determine the nature of such transactions, i.e. whether they are a swap, future or option.  ""Therefore, the particular fact pattern described above – event contracts, executed in a potentially for-profit manner, between retail customers, on any conceivable event, for any sum of money – raises multiple CFTC regulatory concerns,"" he said, warning:  ""If the contract is a product within the CFTC's jurisdiction, then regardless of whether it is executed via a written ISDA [International Swaps and Derivatives Association] confirmation or software code, it is subject to CFTC regulation.""  Quintenz went on to add that in hypothetical events of such violations, he believes that smart contract coders who build such functionality on top of a blockchain network could potentially be held responsible and be prosecuted.  ""I think the appropriate question is whether these code developers could reasonably foresee, at the time they created the code, that it would likely be used by U.S. persons in a manner violative of CFTC regulations,"" he said.  Hypothetically, he said, the code would have to be ""specifically designed to enable the precise type of activity regulated by the CFTC, and no effort was made to preclude its availability to U.S. persons.""  As such, Quintenz encouraged smart contract coders to engage with CFTC staff to see if they can offer such products while staying complaint with CFTC regulations.  ""I would much rather pursue engagement than enforcement – but in the absence of engagement, enforcement is our only option,"" he concluded.

42402004,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3E3V,1539763167,Monero to Become First Billion-Dollar Crypto to Implement 'Bulletproofs' Tech,"A highly anticipated technology designed to make blockchain privacy features more scalable will be tested in the wild soon.  Named ""bulletproofs,"" the tech, which was invented by cryptographers Benedict Bunz and Jonathan Bootle, promises to dramatically decrease the weight of confidential transactions, and on Thursday, Oct. 18, privacy-oriented cryptocurrency monero will put that to the test.  The first major cryptocurrency to deploy the technology, monero has been focused on how to implement bulletproofs for the past year – in an effort to cut the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent.  As well as dealing with the scaling setbacks inherent to most blockchains, monero comes with additional privacy layers, which are heavy to compute and unruly to store. The scalability of confidential transactions have been a significant hurdle for the $1 billion blockchain, with users long suffering high transaction fees as well as an ever-increasing cost of storage for running a full node.  Speaking to this, pseudonymous monero cryptographer Sarang Noether, who assisted with the bulletproof integration, told CoinDesk:  ""Blockchain bloat was definitely an issue for monero.""  Bulletproofs will replace the current zero-knowledge range proofs that its confidential transactions rely on.  As such, the cryptocurrency will activate the technology during its next system-wide upgrade, or hard fork. A kind of upgrade that requires all nodes to adopt a new software, hard forks are sometimes colored as a risky process, however, this upgrade is part of monero's bi-annual cycle to introduce new features.  ""We're excited about it,"" Sarang continued. ""Part of the reason we do the upgrades is so we can be safely on the cutting edge, and I think this is a really, really good move forward.""  The black box  It's worth noting that bulletproofs don't actually contribute to privacy itself. Rather, they simply ensure that the information stored within a confidential transaction doesn't contain any false information.  ""They're not about anonymity; they are about assuring that the other stuff we do for anonymity works correctly,"" Sarang told CoinDesk.  Monero relies on three different mechanisms in combination with each other –stealth addresses, ring signatures and ring confidential transactions – in order to achieve anonymity. Bulletproofs target the latter, ring confidential transactions, or RingCT, which is how monero obscures the quantities that are being sent in a transaction.  Because RingCT's use ring signatures, a cryptographic operation that obscures data by mixing it up with different outputs, monero needs a way to ensure that transactions balance correctly – that is, to make it impossible for money to be printed in the process.  Up until now, monero has relied a kind of zero-knowledge range proofs to fulfill this task, named a bitwise Borromean range proof.  Trouble is, these range proofs are ""a very slow and large operation,"" Sarang said, to the point that ""the vast bulk of our transactions, size wise, on the blockchain are these existing range proofs.""  Instead, bulletproofs work by aggregating information into new data structures that scale logarithmically, rather than linearly – meaning that the scaling gets even more notable for large transactions that contain multiple outputs.  Speaking to this, Sarang said:  ""It does the same thing, this nice, black box, zero-knowledge proof idea, but is much, much, much smaller and much, much, much faster to do.""  Better equipped  Thursday's upgrade will be introducing other changes to monero's codebase as well.  Targeting the ring signatures that monero relies on to conceal sender identities, the upgrade will increase the mandatory ring size, which is heralded as a way to increase monero's anonymity set and make it less vulnerable to linking attacks.  The upgrade also implements a second tweak to monero's mining algorithm – intended to dissuade the emergence of ASICs, a highly optimized mining hardware, from being used on the network. As detailed by CoinDesk, this is following an upgrade in March that disabled a line of ASIC hardware that had been developed for the cryptocurrency – a move that has since become regarded as the genesis of crypto's ""war on miners.""  Still, of all the upgrades, bulletproofs has been the most hotly anticipated, in part due to the simplicity of adding the tech to monero's overarching privacy system.  ""It's not often you can basically take a cryptographic instruction, yank it out and put a new one in, but this was one case where we could do that,"" Sarang told CoinDesk.  With the focus on bulletproofs then, the code also tweaks monero's underlying fee structure so that it ""more accurately reflects the fact that bulletproofs scales so well,"" Sarang continued.  As mentioned, the upgrade will begin on October 18 but will happen in two parts. On the 18th, bulletproofs will be enabled on monero, and by Friday, the tech will be made compulsory. Users who update their software shouldn't notice this at all, Sarang said.  Mitigation horizon  Going forward, monero researchers, are looking for more experimental ways to scale monero – which might one day include moving away from ring signatures altogether.  Alongside another cryptographer named ""Surae Noether,"" Sarang works under the Monero Research Lab, a section of monero development dedicated to analyzing academic innovations in cryptography and deciding whether they can be applied to monero.  ""We're taking all this new stuff and saying what if anything can be feasible in the future for our community,"" Sarang said, adding:  ""We're always looking at new ways to move away from ring signatures in order to get better anonymity sets, or at the very least ring signatures that scale better.""  And on top of that, Sarang said, cross chain atomic swaps, payment channels and networks, as well as ""fundamentals like refund transactions"" are being examined as part of the lab's work.  Still, the developer was quick to draw attention to what he calls the ""mitigation horizon"" – of the difficulty of implementing cutting-edge ideas that could have effects on the cryptocurrency's community, assets and other features.  ""You have the new technology that you're interested in investigating, but what happens at that transition point where you have to bring everyone over with you?"" Sarang asked.  According to the developer, bulletproofs was unique in this capacity.  He told CoinDesk, ""Bulletproofs was this cool example of something that was a nice self-contained entity that we were able to deploy in a way that is working great.""

42429839,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM1adh,1539748858,How Savvy Crypto Traders Gamed Coinbase's Latest Listing for a 35% Payday,"If there's money to be made in the crypto markets, you can bet traders will be the first on the scene.  Such was the case at least last week, when Coinbase Pro, the cryptocurrency trading platform operated by San Francisco startup Coinbase, announced it would list the cryptocurrency 0x (ZRX), a move that put the ""Coinbase effect"" on display when ZRX surged nearly 40 percent on the news.  That perhaps isn't so much of a surprise. Coinbase is the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange by volume, and recently valued at $8 billion because of its millions of users, a common byproduct of new listings is a double-digit price surge.  Still, it wasn't just Coinbase that got a tip off about the listing prior.  Data shows prices for ZRX began to surge on other exchanges a few minutes before Coinbase made its official public announcement at 17:00 UTC. But while there were whispers online about the possibility of insider trading, a charge the exchange has denied in the past, there's another explanation that is perhaps more plausible.  Savvy traders may have been simply making use of well-timed trading bots, computer programs that automatically scout technical price charts and exchange APIs to identify actionable and profitable developments. The bots can then either immediately act on their findings by placing a trade, or send a signal to their users in the form of a message via social media.  It's often free to receive the signals, but bots capable of placing trades generally come at a cost.  Altcoinnotify  , for example, is a bot used only for signals only, and is free on Twitter. On the other hand, more expansive and customizable bots like Cryptohopper, which are capable of placing instantaneous trades based on multiple signals, can cost $20 to $99 per month.  If traders would like more control over a bot, they can even program their own. Estimates suggest experienced programmers can put together the code in just a few days, though it remains a matter of expertise to search for the right buy and sell signals.  In the case of this particular listing, API bots like Lightingsignal appear to have been designed well enough to read Coinbase Pro's API and notice that it had added a new cryptocurrency to it's server. As can be seen in the image below, the bot sent out a signal via Twitter at 16:56 UTC, four minutes before the public announcement.  Cryptocurrency trader Johnny Moe explained how such a signal can give a significant advantage, putting them a leg up above traders seeking to place their own bets on exchanges.  Moe told CoinDesk:  ""By the time a manual trader would see the API addition, and navigate the exchange UI, login with 2FA, navigate to the trading page for the coin in question, fill an order entry, etc., the price is already moving up from trading bots having made their purchases.""  No small boost  Yet, in the world of crypto trading bots, it's unlikely Lightningsignals was the only computer program to convey a timely signal, particularly because even a small informational advantage can yield big results in the crypto markets.  Should a trader have acted on the notification from Lightningsignals, it would have allowed them enough time to purchase ZRX at a near 15 percent better price than the casual investor.  The price was able to record a 13 percent increase in that four-minute span and ultimately reach a 24-hour peak of $0.91 at 17:09 UTC.  If a trader was utilizing Lightningsignals or a similar API bot, he or she would have been able to capture as much as 35 percent profit whereas the public would have had to settle for a more modest 18 percent grain, bringing in nearly half the profit.  A well-kept secret?  Still, it's not exactly clear how widespread the use of bots is, or how many traders may have acted on such signals at the time of the 0x listing. (Coinbase did not respond to requests for comments about the activity).  Further, while successfully running a bot can greatly increase a traders' competitive edge, the process is easier said than done. A cryptocurrency trader known by his handle ""Cryptohustle"" explained he uses the tools for ""market intel,"" but that he still prefers other trading options.  ""These bots are just additional intel for me, I haven't built any strategies around them,"" he said.  Other traders argue that something bots can't do better than humans, at least for now, is fundamental analysis.  ""I don't use bots because it is not necessary for me to find what I want. I look for projects that have a clear roadmap, achievable goals, leadership, and a ""what tech/industry am I displacing,"" a pseudonymous trader going by the handle 'TruthraiderHQ' said.  That said, most traders accept that the bots are part of the market, and that, for the continued future, traders will continue to build strategies, some including the bots such as those that tracked the Coinbase announcement.  ""There is no 'insider' info occurring here,"" Moe said, concluding:  ""There is just technical wherewithal to access it. Or really, since there are publicly available feeds that share this information, just the social wherewithal to use it.""

Matthew Iles, Civil's CEO, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday that the startup closed sales of its proprietary CVL token on Oct. 15, falling short of the goal to achieve funding of at least $8 million.  Having received a $5 million investment from ethereum startup Consensys last year, Civil started the initial coin offering on Sept. 18 to raise somewhere between $8 million to $24 million for its bid to launch a blockchain journalism platform.  Now that it's failed to cross that threshold, Civil said participants will be able to request an immediate refund, or ""they will be automatically refunded by Oct. 29.""  As CoinDesk reported early this month, there had been warning signs. By Oct. 10, Civil hadn't managed to bring in even $1.34 million toward the $8 million threshold, just five days prior to the deadline.  As a result, the Wednesday announcement that the firm will issue refunds is not entirely surprising. As Iles said in a blog post on Oct. 10, ""the numbers will show clearly enough that we are not where we wanted to be at this point in the sale when we started out.""  Recently, a Wall Street Journal article said Civil had been pitching its blockchain-powered platform to several major media outlets including the New York Times, The Washington Post and Dow Jones, without success. Forbes, however, did recently announced a partnership with Civil to publish its content on a blockchain.  Despite the setback, Civil plans to keep on with the token-based fundraising method so it can officially launch the platform, and is looking to start another sale ""in weeks, not months,"" according to Iles.  ""We're also working on a new token sale process, very different from the last one and, we hope, much easier,"" he wrote.
