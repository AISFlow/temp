The region – known for its cheap hydropower – has been an attractive destination for cryptocurrency miners looking to expand their businesses. Yet on Friday, Canadian newspaper Les Affaires reported that operators tied to utility firm Hydro-Quebec are turning down new clients, in part due to the demands placed on the hydroelectric dam by existing operations.  Quebec’s Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Moreau, said cryptocurrency mines require a lot of energy, but only generate a small number of jobs when compared to other factories, such as those which refine aluminum.  Further, he added, there is a possibility that the region would be unable to meet the energy demands crypto miners create, saying:  ""The objective of government is to insure to all Quebecois that during winter, Hydro-Quebec doesn’t say, 'well, excuse me, I cannot provide [energy] because we're in the middle of mining cryptocurrency.'""  Indeed, a Hydro-Quebec document seemed to agree, pointing out that it would not be possible to supply sufficient power for every project that had applied to set up facilities, according to Les Affaires.  The plant had received applications for ""projects representing many thousands of megawatts"" in the last few months, according to the news service.  Officials are now working on new guidelines for cryptocurrency mining facilities. Once these guidelines are complete, authorities will begin considering applications again.

As the text of the bill explains:  ""As introduced, recognizes the legal authority to use blockchain technology and smart contracts in conducting electronic transactions; protects ownership rights of certain information secured by blockchain technology.""  The law also recognizes smart contracts as having legal power, stating that ""no contract relating to a transaction shall be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because that contract contains a smart contract term.""  The law is similar to efforts in Florida and Nebraska to store legal information on a blockchain. However, the Florida bill ""died on calendar,"" filings show, while the Nebraska bill has not yet been voted on by the full Assembly.

In a release published Friday, the IRS noted that cryptocurrency transactions are taxable like other forms of property, echoing a release issued in 2014 outlining how cryptocurrencies would be taxed.  At the time  , the IRS said profits and losses on digital currency would be treated as capital gains when the currency is being used as a capital asset. Similarly, wages paid to employees in crypto are taxable, while crypto payments made to independent contractors and service providers are reported through Form 1099.  In Friday's release, the IRS expanded on its position, stating that payments made in cryptocurrencies must be reported to the agency.  ""A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property,"" the agency said.  Notably, the release once again explains that the IRS classifies cryptocurrencies as property. It continued:  “Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions can be audited for those transactions and, when appropriate, can be liable for penalties and interest.”  These penalties can include criminal prosecution “in more extreme situations,” according to the warning. Tax evasion is listed as one possible criminal charge, and if convicted, a user could be jailed for up to five years and face a $250,000 fine.  Similarly, any users who file a false tax return could serve up to three years in jail and pay an identical $250,000 fine.

The GAO's finding, in a report published March 22, is part of a broader analysis of fintech that examines the benefits, risks and regulations associated with the sector. The office, often referred to as a ""congressional watchdog,” also offers recommendations in the report to improve regulation of the space.  DLT firms, among others, told the office that the lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. ""can result in some firms delaying the launch of innovative products and services – or not launching them in the United States"" at all because they're worried about ""regulatory interpretation.""  The 132-page report goes on to say:  ""The complex U.S. financial regulatory structure can complicate fintech firms' ability to identify the laws with which they must comply and clarify the regulatory status of their activities.""  The GAO also identifies ""fragmented state licensing and reporting requirements"" as often being ""prohibitively expensive"" for DLT firms.  In the discussion of cryptocurrencies, the report identifies as risks the irreversibility of transactions, potential theft, and fraudulent token sales.  As for DLT, the report states that the technology could cut costs for consumers by reducing the operational expenses associated with payments and shrinking settlement times for currency, derivatives and securities transactions. It goes on to list cybersecurity and a potential 51 percent attack as concerns.  This is not the first time the GAO has studied fintech in general or blockchain and crypto specifically.  In April 2017, the office released areport that explored blockchain technology and outlined contemporaneous industry developments. At the time, it indicated it was unsure if new regulations were needed for blockchain technology and DLT.  Likewise, the GAO published a report in January of 2017 that suggested the IRS should take action to inform taxpayers of potential liability from investing their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in blockchain-based assets.

In public remarks Friday, the deputy director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Artyom Kozhin, called Time Magazine’s report linking Russian officials and businessmen to the petro “fake news,” Tass reports.  Adding that the report “is a blatant lie,” the official continued:  “In no way, have the Russian financial authorities ever participated in this project. During the course of the meeting held on February 21, 2018 in Moscow, Venezuela’s Minister of Economy and Finance Mr. [Simon] Zerpa indeed handed over a booklet on the cryptocurrency to the Russian Finance Minister exclusively for the purpose of informing Russian partners about this project.”  The Time report noted connections between certain Russian businessmen and Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, further claiming that Russian president Vladimir Putin signed off on the petro, possibly to assist the evasion of U.S.-led sanctions.  The news came on the heels of U.S. president Donald Trump signing new sanctions into place, prohibiting Americans from buying or transacting with the petro, as previously reported.  Tass also reported that Maduro has claimed a number of trading pairs for the petro, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, euros and the yuan.

Elsewhere in the report, the finance department estimates that 6.3 percent of venture capital invested in the country from 2012 to 2016 went to Ireland-based blockchain businesses – a figure it says dwarfs the capital invested in such projects across the United Kingdom and Switzerland.  From supply chain experiments by the Irish Dairy Board to cryptocurrency startups, this growing sector has captured regulators’ attention.  The report's authors urge lawmakers to provide clarity to consumers about what protections are available when transacting with virtual currencies, give entrepreneurs a clear regulatory framework, and “equip Ireland with a differentiating competitive advantage in securing foreign direct investment” in blockchain projects.  They go on to warn over criminal activity and volatility, but take an optimistic view, saying:  “Although criminality associated with virtual currencies represents a risk to governments, there is evidence to suggest that the majority of virtual currencies are purchased by investors and legitimate owners.”  The paper also suggests that blockchain technology could help boost efficiency and reliability across the financial sector, including securities settlements.

Citing New Jersey’s cease-and-desist order against the startup, the Tennessee report states that Bitcoiin was offering securities in the state, but had not registered with the TDCI Securities Division. Similarly, no groups affiliated with the project had registered with the department.  Bitcoiin  , a “second-generation bitcoin” project based on the ethereum blockchain, aims to help investors raise funds through a staking and depository process, but perhaps its most notable trait is the affiliate reward program for those who refer others to the project.  New Jersey also noted that Bitcoiin did not disclose payment information about its developers, leadership, employees or its brand ambassador, Seagal. The order, which was filed earlier this month, was an effort to protect cryptocurrency investors in the state from what could be a fraudulent securities sale, as previously reported.  New Jersey’s attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, said at the time that “while celebrity endorsements can add to the excitement and hype of cryptocurrency-related investments, they do not guarantee that an investment is sound or even legal.”  The TDCI warning included a reminder that Tennessee residents should be “cautious when investing in cryptocurrencies,” given that they “are not backed by tangible assets,” and are similarly not insured or regulated.  TDCI assistant commissioner Frank Borger-Gilligan said investing in such projects can be risky.  “Rushing into an investment that you don’t fully understand can be bad for your bottom line.

42401363,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbQg8,1521811805,ICON to EOS: 3 Cryptos Are Leading the Market Recovery,"The cryptocurrency markets regained some poise in the week ending March 23, with several individual tokens making more notable gains.  Overall, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies clocked a weekly high of $356 billion on March 21, and was last seen at $345 billion – up 29 percent from the low of $275 billion see on March 18.  The recovery could be attributed to bitcoin's (BTC) 24 percent rise to $9,160 from the weekly low of $7,335, as well as more positive general news flow. As of writing, BTC is trading at $8,547, meaning the cryptocurrency has appreciated by a meager 2.5 percent on a weekly basis.  Once again, small-cap names like ICON's ICX token, EOS, and Qtum were the strongest gainers in the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  Top Gainers  ICON  Weekly performance: 64.44 percent  All-time high: $12.04  Closing price on Mar. 16: $2.25  Current market price: $3.7  Rank as per market capitalization: 19  ICON's ICX token, February's best-performing cryptocurrency, rose to $4.02 on Binance on Thursday – its highest level since Feb. 26. ICX ran into bids after Bithumb, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, announced it would list ICX on March 21. Upbit, Korea's largest exchange, also listed the token on March 22.  Trading volume rose above $0.2 billion on March 21 for the first time since Jan. 30. That day was also the highest single-day trading volume since Jan. 9, according to CoinMarketCap. The high volume rally indicates the ICX token will likely extend gains in coming weeks.  EOS  Weekly performance: 34.38 percent  All-time high: $18.71  Closing price on Mar. 16: $5.09  Current market price: $6.84  Rank as per market capitalization: 6  EOS witnessed a bullish doji reversal this week and clocked a weekly high of $7.28, as per Bitfinex data. Apart from the broad-based crypto market recovery, the rumors of exchange listings and joint venture news seem to have helped the cryptocurrency post good gains week-on-week.  That said, EOS is still struggling to beat the falling channel resistance, having created a doji candle yesterday that indicates indecision in the marketplace. So, EOS might be in for a pullback before the falling channel resistance is breached in a convincing manner.  Qtum  Weekly performance: 22.83 percent  All-time high: $106.88  Closing price on Mar. 16: $14.98  Current market price: $18.4  Rank as per market capitalization: 18  Qtum (QTM) jumped to a one-week high of $21.84 on March 21, according to Bitfinex data. The cryptocurrency notably spiked 60 percent on March 19 after Binance added the Qtum-Binance Coin (QTUM/BNB) and Qtum-Tether (QTUM/USDT) trading pairs.  However, the initial buzz created by the new pairs seems to have faded, as QTM has traded in a sideways manner for the last 36 hours. Further, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) remains below 50.00 (bearish territory) despite the sharp week-on-week gains. The outlook would turn bearish if prices drop below $16.23 (Feb. low, as per Bitfinex).  Top losers  NEM  Weekly performance: -15.89 percent  All-time high: $2.09  Closing price on Mar. 16: $0.338381  Current market price: $0.284618  Rank as per market capitalization: 13  NEM's XEM token was one of the top performing cryptocurrencies of the week ending March 16. However, the follow-through this week has been anything but encouraging. The ""death cross"" (bearish 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average) crossover confirmed on March 17 (as per Poloniex data) seems to have weighed over the token.  Cryptocurrency exchange Binance added XEM-Binance Coin (XEM/BNB), XEM-Bitcoin (XEM/BTC) and XEM-Ether (XEM/ETH) trading pairs earlier this week, but the news failed to put a floor under XEM prices.  Also, beginning March 18, the NEM.io Foundation disabled the tracking mosaic intended to monitor movements of XEM stolen in the Coincheck hack, although it is unclear whether the news had anything to do with the price drop.  VeChain  Weekly performance: -14.87 percent  All-time high: $9.45  Closing price on Mar. 16: $3.9  Current market price: $3.32  Rank as per market capitalization: 17  VeChain's VET token was the last week's top performing cryptocurrency. However, prices fell to $2.89 on March 19 on Binance – the lowest level since Feb. 6.  The investor community had anticipated a price drop, courtesy of a reduction in liquidity due to an X Node lock-up. Further, investors see little incentive to buy the token in the short run, unless there is big positive news before the mainnet launch in June. Consequently, VET may remain under pressure in the days ahead.  Nano  Weekly performance: -12.70 percent  All-time high: $34.43  Closing price on Mar. 16: $8.82  Current market price: $7.7  Rank as per market capitalization: 22  Nano (NANO) fell to $5.97 on March 18 – the lowest level since Dec. 25. Although Koinex, one of India's top cryptocurrency exchanges, listed NANO yesterday, still prices closed (as per UTC) down 4 percent. Furthermore, the team behind Nano shared its roadmap and vision for the future this week, but there was no noticeable impact on prices.

42401352,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbQWI,1521806447,Enterprises Building Blockchain Confront Early Tech Limitations,"Blockchain is here to stay, but so too are centralized authorities.  That realization was the general takeaway at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation's annual fintech symposium in New York City on Thursday where executives behind some of the most mature blockchain platforms currently in the works took the stage to discuss the benefits and limitations of the nascent technology.  While in some cases, enterprises, including the DTCC, which conducts $1.5 quadrillion dollars in securities transactions per year, have found that blockchains are more powerful than first expected, it's clear that there are still significant hurdles to overcome.  ""We’ve learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t,"" said Michael Bodson, the CEO of the DTCC, adding:  ""We’ve wrestled with the technology’s limitations, but we’re also uncovering new possibilities to help lead the digital transformation of the post-trade environment.""  During Bodson's opening remarks, he set the groundwork for the rest of the day's talks by recounting some of the lessons learned by the DTCC's ongoing implementation of blockchain in its $11 trillion Trade Information Warehouse (TIW).  Designed to reduce the time it takes to clear over-the-counter derivatives, unexpected obstacles in the process have resulted in a delay of a commercial launch from this quarter to next year. Given the TIW's relatively low volume compared to the rest of the DTCC business, he doesn't expect any broader rollout of the technology any time soon.  ""At the DTCC, we seamlessly process 60 million trades each day, and during peak times like we saw last month, we handled as many as 90 million transactions,"" he said. ""It would be impossible to do this today using a distributed ledger.""  He continued, citing a Deloitte report that showed out 26,000 blockchain projects that were started since 2016, as evidence of the narrowing scope of blockchain's potential utility. Of those blockchain projects he said only eight percent are currently still active.  ""As the industry has come to the realization that blockchain’s potential isn’t limitless, companies are focusing their resources on initiatives that can deliver real client value,"" he said.  The limits of open source  In a panel following Bodson's opening remarks, DTCC chief technology architect Rob Palatnick further elaborated on the limits of blockchain, namely those arising from the technology's open-source roots.  Even as he acknowledged that ""pretty much everyone in this room is looking to the open-source community for validation,"" he cautioned that the old idealism that public, open-source blockchains can solve everything is starting to fade.  ""The DTCC has been approached with some in the industry who say we're involved in open source, which is good, but you need to think about a hardened proprietary set of ledgers for the things you do,"" he said.  As such, businesses like the DTCC are exploring permissioned distributed ledgers that are connected via more open blockchains, what Palatnick called a ""network of networks."" Several speakers at the event described the idea in various ways, including Accenture managing director Wynn Davies, who called it a ""multi-stranded"" blockchain.  At the core of this concept is the idea that public blockchains will never fully be able to give enterprise counterparties the trust they need to run their regulated businesses.  ""We need to have neutral parties who are acting in everyone's best interest,"" Davies said, citing the DTCC and the Monetary Authority of Singapore as leaders in this push.  The trick, according to Davies, is going to be reimagining the incentive models so major players like the DTCC are willing to give up the ""short-term gains"" that result from holding onto innovative technologies, in order to let the benefits of blockchain accrue to the broader economy.  Expanding on that concept, Palatnick described a blockchain ecosystem where the DTCC and other infrastructure providers might manage ""governance nodes,"" where they provide some services to their customers but also allow them to connect directly, in a peer-to-peer way, for other services.  Intentional guardrails  As part of the DTCC's work to explore this network of blockchain networks, Palatnick revealed new details about a program with Blythe Masters' Digital Asset (DA), in which the DTCC is an investor.  Contrary to the DTCC's work on its TIW, which started by identifying a problem that could be solved with the abilities of current blockchain technology, its interest in DA's work is aimed at learning a language – Digital Asset Modelling Language (DAML) – which could let them create any number of solutions in the future.  Masters, who spoke during the event as well, detailed how public blockchain's structure – at least ethereum and certain others – has a disadvantage to global financial institutions, and as such, spurred the creation of the DAML language.  In December 2017, DA was selected by Australia's ASX to re-platform its entire CHESS clearing and settlement system with blockchain technology. In looking into a solution there, Masters explained how the flexibility of so-called ""Turing complete"" languages that some public blockchains use resulted in uncertainty about the order in which transactions would be cleared.  Not only was DAML built with this in mind, but the language was also designed with what Masters called ""guardrails to reduce the likelihood of errors in programming that lead to the sort of events that you saw happening in the DAO exploit"" in which millions of dollars were funnelled into one person's account because of faulty code.  Masters said:  ""It is an inherent feature of the language that it is not possible to put an entity in a contract into a position where they are obliged to act or to elect something without their specifically having the ability to acknowledge, confirm, and concur with that.""  Regulations still uncertain  Another limitation most every speaker discussed was regulatory uncertainty.  Indeed, the industry has been reeling from rumors that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sent out dozens of subpoenas and requests for information to all kinds of stakeholders surrounding the fundraising mechanism, initial coin offerings (ICOs).  While the head of the SEC's trading and markets division Brett Redfearn did not confirm or deny any such subpoenas during his fireside chat at the event, he expressed frustration with companies that came to the regulator claiming they wanted to be compliant, but who hadn't even gone through the process of registering their companies.  While he seemed open to potential improvements from the space, he emphasized how industry participants could actually learn a lot about protecting their users and implementing certain generally-accepted principles of fair markets, such as searching for spoofing efforts that falsely inflate transaction volumes, by reaching out to the SEC.  In spite of this, though, Todd McDonald, co-founder of enterprise blockchain consortium R3, said that unless those responsible for creating an innovative environment took a more progressive stance, U.S. companies would get left behind.  ""I live in New York and I love America, but we have to get our act together,"" he said.  Though, McDonald continued on a more positive note, saying that standardizing the way crypto assets are created and regulated across jurisdictions could help push the hybrid blockchain systems that many enterprises are looking to develop.  Speaking to what he called ""net new"" assets which could be created if all the industry's hurdles are overcome, McDonald said:  ""All sort of new models and new business opportunities are going to come from this kind of ecosystem. The important part is to make sure we get the foundational pieces in place and make sure the risk-governance model is part of that initial foundation.""

According to Nikkei Asian Review, the Japanese internet firm will take a 40 percent stake in BitARG Exchange Tokyo next month, with a plan to build a new exchange using BitARG technology in approximately a year's time.  BitARG is already licensed by Japanese financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the report says, and is expected to receive further investments from Yahoo Japan early in 2019.  Yahoo Japan will purchase the shares in BitARG through its subsidiary YJFX, a forex transaction platform. The 40 percent stake will cost the firm around 2 billion yen ($19 million), says Nikkei.  After the purchase, a team from YJFX is expected to kick off development of the new exchange, as well as designing systems for corporate governance, customer management and security.  The news comes as the importance of registration with the FSA to conduct exchange operations in Japan is highlighted by issues facing the major Binance exchange.  As reported this morning, the Hong-Kong-based exchange has just received a warning from the financial watchdog over its lack of registration in the country.  Zhao Changpeng, Binance's CEO, has confirmed receipt of the warning letter and said the firm is in dialogue with the agency.  Since the $533 million hack of Japanese exchange Coincheck in January, the FSA has been mandating security overhauls and cracking down on domestic crypto trading platforms that are yet to be registered.

42401361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbQf9,1521801637,$8K? Bitcoin Under Pressure After Rejection at Key Hurdle,"Bitcoin's (BTC) retreat from the 200-day moving average gathered pace in the last 24 hours, suggesting scope for a drop to $8,000.  The cryptocurrency created a small doji candle at the moving average resistance on Wednesday, signaling indecision among the bulls, Bitfinex data shows. Prices then fell below the key support of $8,752 at 09:00 UTC yesterday, opening the doors for a deeper pullback.  Accordingly, BTC hit a low of $8,333 on Bitfinex earlier today and was last seen at $8,465.  Meanwhile, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), which represents the average of BTC prices on the world's leading exchanges, is seen at $8,471 – down 2.77 percent from the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $8,713.  Daily chart  The above chart shows (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Despite the bullish 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA crossover, the cryptocurrency failed to cut through the 200-day MA resistance on Wednesday.  A bearish doji reversal (candlestick pattern) indicating the corrective rally from the March 18 low of $7,240 ended at the 200-day MA resistance, also on Wednesday.  The retreat from $9,177 (Wednesday's high) to $8,333 (session low) has also established another lower high on the price chart (marked by circles).  The relative strength index (RSI) has rolled over into the bearish territory (below 50.00), raising the odds of a further drop in prices.  Clearly, the daily chart favors a drop to $8,000. On the other hand, the scenario is looking somewhat more positive on the short duration charts below.  1-hour chart  BTC has built a base along the 200-hour MA, while a bullish RSI divergence is also seen. Hence, prices may revisit $8,752 (former support turned resistance).  Many in the investor community do not expect BTC to rise above $8,700 and predict a retest of $8,000, comments on social media indicate.  However, an upside break of the descending expanding channel could yield a retest of 200-day MA located at $9,223.  View  The daily chart favors the bears. On the downside, a move below the hourly 200-MA support of $8,355 could yield a downside break of the descending expanding channel, opening the doors for a retest of $7,240 (March 18 low) over the weekend.  However, a minor rally to $8,752 cannot be ruled out, courtesy of the bullish RSI divergence seen on the hourly chart.  Intraday bullish scenario: Acceptance above $8,752 would shift the odds in favor of a rally to $9,223 (200-day MA).  Note that, despite the pullback from the 200-day moving average, the 5-day MA and 10-day MA bull crossover is intact (5-day MA holds above the 10-day MA). Hence, a move above the daily high of $8,721 would bring potential for a rise to $9,200–$9,223.

According to an official announcement on Friday, the ministry's Information and Software bureau has outlined seven major areas of focus in its 2018 agenda, four of which will cover standardization initiatives that relate to the blockchain space.  Top of list, based on the announcement, is the formation of a dedicated committee that will seek to develop and roll out a standardized framework for blockchain use in the country.  While the new follows a previous report that the bureau already formally announced the formation of the committee, it hints that the agency is making a stronger drive at a high level to ensure the country stays ahead in blockchain development, which was widely praised at the country's annual political event in early March.  The new agenda also speaks to recent efforts taken by the ministry in a reported Australian tour with major Chinese internet giants in bid to learn from Australia's experience in leading blockchain standardization works.  As reported previously, Standards Australia was chosen in 2016 to spearhead a technical committee developing blockchain tech standards under the oversight of the International Organization of Standardization.  Other areas of focus in the latest agenda will aim at widening collaboration with global standardization organizations, as well as developing more specific frameworks for blockchain technology such as distributed ledger infrastructure and smart contracts.  In a separate note, also published Friday, the bureau said it hosted a seminar on Thursday with major organizations and companies from the industrial sector to discuss blockchain use cases and challenges in the area.

42401358,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbQdB,1521795651,"Blockchain Remittances Face Efficiency Hurdle, Says Taiwan Central Bank","Blockchain systems for interbank clearance and remittance may not be as efficient as centralized systems just yet, according to a report released by the Central Bank of Taiwan.  Announced by the bank's new governor Yang Chin-long at a press event Thursday, the report outlined various explorations currently being conducted by the island's central banking authority into financial technology, including a proof-of-concept utilizing distributed ledger in interbank remittance.  Collaborating on the effort are members of academia and the Taiwan Clearing House (TWNCH), an authority that handles financial product settlements among financial institutions, under supervision of the central bank.  However, the initial results suggest that the distributed system, so far, is not as efficient as the existing centralized Automated Clearing House (ACH) system, developed by the TWNCH.  While two different tests using the blockchain PoC were able to process 4 and 26 transactions per second, respectively, such speeds are significantly less than the 2,700 transactions per second managed by the ACH system.  Furthermore, the reliability of the blockchain platform could also be an obstacle, the report said:  ""In addition, the testing result shows there are problems of confidential information leak and malfunctions in individual nodes.""  The central bank said, though, that blockchain technology is still at an early stage and is developing rapidly, and it doubled down on its commitment to widen efforts to conduct more testing with the clearing house and financial institutions. Yang previously promised to boost blockchain adoption in Taiwan during his tenure in his February inauguration speech.  In other news, the Yang remarked Thursday, according to a local report, that bitcoin may be the ""biggest bubble in history.""

42401343,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcbQOQ,1521792959,Warning: Blockchain Could Rot Your Brain,"Alice Ko is a Canadian CPA, a finance professional turned business consultant, and the founder of a marketing agency, Pivot Six. She holds a small cryptocurrency collection. Follow Alice: @thisisaliceko      Advancements in technology may be transformational. However we cannot forget that they also create adjunct problems.  For instance, social media addiction is a serious issue, the Internet spawned the need for instant gratification, and artificial intelligence has many of us worried about technological unemployment.  Unfortunately, blockchain is no exception. And yet, everybody wants a piece of the pie, and people are already pouring their life savings into cryptocurrency investments. Should we take a step back and reconsider?  Productivity paradox  Proponents everywhere tout that blockchain will make the world more productive. I’ve even made the argument that blockchain will force auditors and accountants out of glorified administrative work so they can produce more value for society.  Whether it’s in banking, logistics, or advertising, on the surface, it may seem logical that any technological change will create “productivity gains.” But before we convince ourselves that blockchain will be a time saver, consider the Solow Paradox.  Also known as the Productivity Paradox, this is the observation that “... as more investment is made in information technology, worker productivity may go down instead of up.”  I’ve witnessed the Solow Paradox in action while working in different offices alongside C-Suite executives and other consultants. I’ve seen working professionals barely able to work an Excel spreadsheet, let alone utilize the countless Excel formulas that could have made their work output more productive and efficient.  While some will argue that the technical incompetencies I describe above are the result of poor training and weak hiring practices. Shouldn’t the concern of the Solow Paradox be seriously considered if blockchain technologies are destined to have a stake in all industries?  It’s certainly possible that the misunderstanding of technology may very well add hours to our workdays, rather than subtract them.  So before we get excited and confident about so-called productivity gains, due care and strategic planning should be top of mind to ensure that workers and organizations are adequately prepared for the next shift in the technological revolution.  If new technologies are thrown at workers without adequate understanding of and training on the tools at hand, this may cause further declines in productivity, elevated stress levels in the workplace (and stress leads to health problems), and ultimately risk creating even more work.  The slump in smarts  Blockchain allows for the validation of transactions through an automatically verified, tamper-resistant system. This causes many to dream of the days where middlemen (and their fees) will be gone, and when tasks like verification and audit will be obsolete. All data recorded in a blockchain will be trustworthy since transactions cannot be altered.  Sounds utopian – and yet, reliance on technology has been shown to negatively impact human performance. The Google Effect (not committing facts to memory because we know everything is on Google) is alive and rampant. In fact, recent studies show that 90% of people suffer from this digital amnesia.  So as we move toward trusting everything recorded in a blockchain, let’s consider what might happen to society’s ability to be healthily skeptical and to critically think for ourselves outside of a blockchain.  For instance, I still know many finance professionals who are quick to pull out the calculator function on their phones rather than crunching the numbers in their heads. Is it really because it’s more convenient, or have they simply lost the ability to do the math?  While some studies show that society is at risk of become less intelligent with its increasing reliance on technology, these studies should simply be a red flag. Maintenance of brain health and increasing use of brain power is necessary as our species collectively continue to solve problems around the world.  Scientific American puts it perfectly: “As we are freed from the necessity of remembering facts, we may be able as individuals to use our newly available mental resources for ambitious undertakings.”  So how do we guarantee this is the direction we are heading in with blockchain? Instead of relying on blockchain technology as the “be all end all,” we could consider blockchain as a type of backup validation tool to leverage our current systems rather than a complete replacement.  To ensure our critical thinking skills remain top-notch, let’s also retain the skill set to perform transactions ourselves despite technologies that can automate tasks for us (like calculators). Technology should support us, not replace us.  Shift in skill sets  I started my career in auditing so I tend to have a pretty skeptical mindset. Whenever I read a metric or statistic, I’m quick to validate the source. Transactions within a blockchain network inherently create trust, but I think the automated “trustworthiness” of these transactions will negatively impact social skills and human behavior.  How? We were taught to be skeptical about certain things growing up (e.g. always count your change), and depending on where you lived, you were probably taught early to trust certain organizations like the bank and the government. Now as adults, we inherently trust that our technology is reliable (when was the last time your phone alarm let you down?).  My concern is the impact of a future blockchain-driven trust economy on social cues. Will people still trust transactions outside of a blockchain network? Will blockchain become the primary validation method of all data? Will society become more or less trusting in general? Will a transaction or agreement made outside of a blockchain be legitimate?  If we do eventually rely on blockchain to validate and manage tasks and transactions, I foresee the decline of underrated skill sets and important social behaviors. With the loss of middlemen (think brokers, agencies, auditors), our mediary, negotiation, and project management skills might also deteriorate. With this in mind, now is a crucial time to start planning for this and figure out ways to mitigate it.  After all, we know from experience that new technologies dissolve existing problems, but will also create new ones in passing. Let’s prepare accordingly this time.

Coinbase may be on the verge of its biggest acquisition yet.  According to sources close to the situation, the San Francisco startup, which has raised more than $225 million in venture funding, is in talks to purchase Earn.com, which rebranded late last year from 21.co with the launch of its eponymous paid messaging platform.  Sources with knowledge of the talks gave different estimates of the price. One of those sources claimed Earn could be selling for $30 million. But another, who is directly involved in the discussions, said the total value of cash, cryptocurrency, stock and earn-out being discussed would exceed the more than $120 million Earn has raised over multiple funding rounds since its founding in 2013.  Still, Earn.com is said to be in talks with multiple parties about a potential acquisition, with one source indicating that the suitors were all ""household names"" in the industry.  While no deal has yet been struck, the news follows the March announcement that Coinbase had hired Emilie Choi, the former head of mergers and acquisition at LinkedIn, as its vice president of corporate and business development.  Earn.com CEO Balaji Srinivasan would potentially join Coinbase under the terms of the deal.  Coinbase did not respond to requests for comment at press time.

In a statement published by the Financial Services Agency on Friday, the agency confirmed Thursday's news that suggested Binance was about to be warned by the financial watchdog given its lack of registration with the regulator.  Yet the statement does not entail whether the regulator is weighing criminal charges, as indicated in the previous report from Nikkei. The exchange told Bloomberg earlier this year that it was working with Japanese regulators to secure a license.  Responding to the FSA statement, Zhao Changpeng, Binance's CEO, confirmed receipt of the warning letter and stated the firm's legal team is in dialogue with the agency.  Founded in summer 2017 and based in Hong Kong, Binance has emerged as one of world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trade volume in the past six months. According to data from Alexa, the firm currently sees roughly 9 percent of its traffic visit from Japan.  The FSA has warned other overseas firms about offering services to Japanese citizens in the past.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the agency issued multiple warnings last month to a Macau-based cryptocurrency firm that provided bitcoin purchases and initial coin offering services to Japanese investors. The firm pulled out of the country following the warnings.

The ""Methods and Systems for Digital Trust Architecture"" patent application was published on March 22, having been initially filed last September. According to the application, ""it is apparent that the tools that provide trust to the users are lacking in their ability to adequately provide a desired level of security,"" citing concerns like transaction tampering and insecure messaging, among others.  ""There are many excellent reasons for online interactions to continue as they have been. However, in a multi-party, open source environment, there is also a need for a secure, trusted, and enforceable online environment, to enable greater trust and therefore expansion of offerings online,"" the application goes on to note.  The system outlined in the Postal Service's application includes several elements, including one dedicated to email and another that provisions public and private keys for the user. It notably also calls for a blockchain component that ""may be configured to receive records from the user and add the records to a blockchain.""  According to the application, some of these parts could work in tandem, including the bridging of the blockchain and email segments.  ""In some aspects, the user email component is further configured to receive input indicating whether information indicating the transmission of the encrypted email body data is to be stored in a blockchain and store the information in a blockchain in response to the input,"" the application explains.  The Postal Service's application also highlights the use of a ""special digital token,"" though it's not clear whether this refers to any kind of scarce form of data that would exist on the aforementioned blockchain. Per the text, ""the token is used to create a record for the user for inclusion in a blockchain.""  ""The block chaining of a special digital token provides evidence that a specific transaction occurred, and specifically who was involved,"" it later explains.  The filing is a notable one, given that in 2016, a report from the Postal Service suggested that the mail carrier could move to create its own cryptocurrency as well as use the tech for supply chain applications, among other areas.
