42402346,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43Z9,1545076812,Coinbase Adds Crypto-to-Crypto Trading for Retail Customers,"Coinbase users can begin trading cryptocurrencies directly with other cryptocurrencies, the exchange startup said Monday.  The company is adding support for crypto-to-crypto trading for its retail customers, adding a feature that has long been available to professional cryptocurrency trading services, said product manager Anna Marie Clifton. Users on Coinbase.com, as well as the Android and iOS apps, will be able to begin trading bitcoin pairs in the coming days through the new feature, called Coinbase Convert.  She told CoinDesk that while trading pairs are ""a pretty common paradigm in the crypto trading space,"" they are not currently being served well to the broader retail audience.  ""The functionality is giving customers the ability to directly convert between one cryptocurrency and another, which is pretty advanced,"" she said.  The trading pairs were developed based on user feedback, Clifton said.  Unlike professional trading services, which use such pairs to take advantage of price fluctuations, retail users are likely to use these pairs for more utilitarian purposes.  As one example, she said, some customers have purchased bitcoin but now want to interact with decentralized applications (dapps), and therefore need to convert their holdings.  ""I think one of the things that was most surprising was seeing a lot of customers frustrated because they wanted to use the product immediately [but] it required two trading fees,"" she said.  Initially, Coinbase Convert will support bitcoin trading pairs, with customers able to convert to bitcoin cash, ethereum, ethereum classic, litecoin and 0x. More pairs may be added in future based on customer feedback.  The exchange has been rolling out the functionality over the past week, with small groups seeing the new pairs last week. The feature will be ""gradually"" rolled out to each of the different countries Coinbase offers native payment access in.  ""We'll continue iterating on the product and expanding the functionality,"" Clifton said. ""An increasingly large number of customers will have this functionality available.""

The engagement could lead to the tokenization of up to $200 million worth of this rare metal, which is used to make electric vehicle batteries, in 2019 alone, Overstock said Monday.  However, it has also delayed the closing of Hong Kong-based GSR's separate, previously announced agreement to invest up to $404 million in Overstock and tZERO.  That transaction was set to close on December 15, but the day before, ""GSR contacted us and asked for an extension to allow a key partner in the cobalt initiative from outside of China to participate in the deal,"" Overstock CEO Patrick M. Byrne wrote in a letter to shareholders Monday.  Byrne was contrite about the delay, telling investors:  ""Even though the partner in question is well known to us and will be a valuable part of our ecosystem, it was both frustrating to us, as it likely is to you, that the delay came at the eleventh hour.""  Nevertheless, he was bullish about the opportunity to tokenize the trading of cobalt, calling it ""one of the most exciting initiatives on the blockchain today.""  Ecosystem in Asia  According to tZERO and GSR, the token will be compliant with regulatory requirements and will simplify identifying, purchasing and tracking the supply of cobalt. tZERO will provide its expertise to ""build an ecosystem in Asia for tokenized commodity purchase contracts,"" Overstock said in a separate press release.  “Smart contract automation of these transactions will significantly reduce overall costs while effectively improving transparency in rare earth metals purchases throughout the supply chain process” Byrne said in the release.  In the long term, Overstock and GSR said their collaboration could lead to the development of a security token trading platform like tZERO in Hong Kong. “GSR and our partner will be doing more than just cobalt tokenization, and we see further growth in our partnership with tZERO including consummating an investment directly by next quarter,” GSR Capital’s chairman and founder, Sonny Wu, said in the press release.  Cobalt trade has been a controversial subject over the last few years, as while the mineral powers innovative industries like electric car production, more than a half of its world supply comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, infamous for using child labor in cobalt mines. China has been remarkably active buying cobalt producers and took a lot of blame for funding unsafe ways of production.  Blockchain has been seen by some as a possible cure for this: in April, British consultancy RCS Global launched a blockchain-based pilot to detect possible illegal activities at the mines and register it on the blockchain.  Overstock is planning to sell its flagship e-commerce business by February to raise cash for Medici Ventures, the umbrella for tZERO and the company's other blockchain investments. tZERO is expected to launch early next year, with its own token as a primary trading asset.

Blockchain technology firm Blockstream announced Monday that it has expanded its satellite service to the Asia-Pacific region. It's also added support for lightning network transactions, allowing users to pay for its service using the ""layer 2"" scaling solution.  The company first launched Blockstream Satellite in August 2017, which lets bitcoin users transfer bitcoin through leased satellites. Initially, users in Africa, Europe and the Americas were able to utilize the system. At the time, CEO Adam Back said the service was aimed at individuals with limited internet access or who otherwise face issues accessing bitcoin.  In the months since launch, response to the service has been positive, he told CoinDesk Monday.  ""There are third-party developers that have taken an interest to build local infrastructure using the satellite service, for example connecting it with mesh networks to make bitcoin more accessible in emerging markets,"" Back said, regarding applications using the service.  The addition of an API integrating the lightning network apparently came after users expressed interest in sending bitcoin-related data.

To that end, Iran should coordinate with other nations on emerging technologies including blockchain, he said.  The official also played down supposed concerns governments have about blockchain technology, saying that it offers more benefits than disadvantages and adding that that his department intends to use blockchain in different areas in the future.  Daliri notably also announced back in July that the government is carrying out the groundwork for the issuance of a national digital currency in Iran. The cryptocurrency would back and tokenize Iran’s national fiat currency, the rial, in order to facilitate domestic and cross-border transactions to counter U.S. sanctions, it was reported at the time.  As sanctions have hit, major exchanges such as Binance have moved to force Iranian users off their platforms to comply with the U.S. authorities. Last month, the U.S. Department of the Treasury for the first time added cryptocurrency addresses to its individual sanctions list, blacklisting two Iran residents. The Treasury said at the time that it was ""targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims.""  The country is, however, proving to be a draw for international crypto mining firms that have been struggling to turn a profit amid this year's bear market. Iran, with its extremely low-cost electricity (that can go as low as $0.006 per kilowatt-hour) offers miners of a way to keep on operating while many others have closed down in recent months.

May, cypherpunk legend and author of the “Crypto Anarchist Manifesto,” has passed away at the age 67.  His passing was announced Saturday by Lucky Green, also a self-described cypherpunk, on Facebook, saying that his ""dear friend"" May had passed away earlier this week at his home in Corralitos, California.  “Death appears to be from natural causes pending autopsy. I.e. Tim did not die in a hail of bullets as so many who didn’t know Tim all that well and largely from his public writings had predicted,” Green wrote.  May is known for co-founding the “Cypherpunks"" mailing list – ""perhaps the single most effective pro-cryptography grassroots organization in history, together with Eric Hughes and John Gilmore in 1992,” as Green put it.  After retiring from tech giant Intel in 1986, May became influenced by early work on cryptocurrency by cryptographer David Chaum, and went on to write the “Crypto Anarchist Manifesto” in 1988, stating that “Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner.”  Displaying great prescience on how cryptography would ultimately come to the forefront of technology and society, he went on:  “Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering”  Most recently, in October, May penned a piece for CoinDesk, sharing his thoughts on the bitcoin white paper and the developing cryptocurrency space, saying ""Satoshi [bitcoin's pseudonymous inventor] did a brilliant thing, but the story is far from over.""  He further warned:  ""I can’t speak for what Satoshi intended, but I sure don’t think it involved bitcoin exchanges that have draconian rules about KYC, AML, passports, freezes on accounts and laws about reporting 'suspicious activity' to the local secret police. There’s a real possibility that all the noise about 'governance,' 'regulation' and 'blockchain' will effectively create a surveillance state, a dossier society.""

42402362,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43ot,1545048033,When the Tide Goes Out: Big Questions for Crypto in 2019,"Gary Gensler is a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Barack Obama, a Senior advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative and Senior Lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he currently teaches several classes on blockchain technology and crypto finance.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2018 Year in Review.  After this year’s wild market ride and so many failed projects, what might Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovative “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" mean for money and finance in 2019 and beyond?  Satoshi’s innovation – the use of append-only timestamped logs, secured by cryptography, amongst multiple parties, forming consensus on a shared ledger – needs to be taken seriously. The resulting blockchains of data can form widely verifiable peer-to-peer databases.  For any chance of a lasting role in the long evolution of money, though, blockchain applications and crypto assets have to deliver real economic results for users. And while bringing the crypto finance markets within public policy norms is critical, the greatest challenge remains the seriousness of commercial use cases.  A bunch of hype masquerading as fact won’t do it.  What We've Learned  Blockchain technology and crypto tokens provide an alternative means to move value on the Internet without relying upon a central intermediary. They promise the potential to lower verification and networking costs, ranging from censorship, privacy, reconciliation and settlement costs to the costs of jump starting and maintaining a network.  These features tie blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies directly to the essential plumbing of the financial sector, which at its core has the role of efficiently moving, allocating and pricing money and risk within an economy. It could lower costs, risks and economic rents in the financial system, which represents 7.5 percent of U.S. GDP.  To do so, though, blockchain technology must address its many technical and commercial challenges – scalability, efficiency, privacy, security, interoperability and governance. Industry reforms and regulations also must bring order to the markets surrounding this technology, especially for crypto exchanges and initial coin offerings.  In the meantime, the financial sector is mainly exploring private blockchain applications – without native tokens – built on software such as Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda or Quorum.  Any use case’s value proposition needs to be rigorously compared with simply using a traditional data base. In particular, any token offering must address how it will sustainably lower verification or networking costs – how such crypto asset benefits users more than simply using broadly accepted fiat currencies. While money is but a social construct, its history tells us that there are overwhelming network benefits when a currency is widely used and accepted for all three roles of money – as a unit of account, medium of exchange and store of value.  In essence, how might any blockchain technology project or any initial coin offering’s (‘ICO’) proposed token be more than simply a means to raise cheap money from the public? In 2019 and beyond, venture capitalists, large incumbents and crypto investors will likely be more discerning and rigorous in their investments and projects.  Public Policy Frameworks  The crypto finance markets can only gain public confidence and reach their potential by coming within long-established public policy frameworkshttps://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/07.18.18_gensler_testimony_.pdf. As with any other technology, we must guard against illicit activities, such as tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing and avoiding sanctions.  We must promote fair and open competition while ensuring for financial stability. We must protect investors and consumers.  While criminals have often exploited the existing financial system for money laundering, cryptocurrencies have given bad actors new ways to conduct old crimes. Dark markets conduct sales of illegal drugs and other contraband using cryptocurrencies. State actors, such as Venezuela, Russia, and Iran have used crypto finance to undermine U.S. policies. Additionally, cryptocurrencies add new challenges to global tax compliance.  What investor protection does exist in crypto markets seems little more than an effort to stay ahead of law enforcement’s and regulators’ attention.  Crypto Exchanges  Most crypto exchanges are unregistered. Manipulative behavior goes unchecked and billions of dollars in customers’ tokens have been stolen. Compared to traditional financial exchanges, they lack intermediation through regulated broker-dealers. Further, according to CryptoCompare's October Exchange Review, only 47 percent of exchanges impose strict know-your-customer (‘KYC’) requirements.  Safeguards to date – treating crypto exchanges and digital wallet providers through money transmission laws in the same manner as Western Union or MoneyGram – are unsatisfactory.  Crypto exchanges are trading venues and need be treated as such, with mandated investor protections in place. Front running and other manipulative behavior needs to be banned. Exchanges need to fully comply with anti-money laundering laws and seriously fix or consider spinning off their custodial functions.  In 2019 and beyond, we will see multiple exchanges register in the U.S. – those trading ICO tokens will register as broker-dealers under Regulation ATS and Intercontinental Exchange’s new Bakkt exchange will register and operate under the Commodities Exchange Act.  We’re also likely to see declining operating margins and consolidation in the more than 200 crypto exchanges.  Initial Coin Offerings  Of the thousands of ICOs to date, many have failed, and investors have lost billions. A recent EY studyhttps://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/global/news/2018/10/ey-ico-research-web-oct-17-2018.pdf reported that through the third quarter of 2018, 86 percent of the top ICOs of 2017 were trading below their listing price and only 13 percent actually have a working product.  Filecoin, for instance, raised over $250 million in October 2017 but is not due to go live until mid-2019. Academic and market studies also have found the ICO market rife with scams and frauds.  Debates have raged around the globe about how cryptocurrencies, and particularly ICOs, fit within existing securities, commodities and derivatives laws. Many contend that so-called ‘utility tokens’ sold for future consumption are not investment contracts – but this is a false distinction.  By their very design, ICOs mix economic attributes of both consumption and investment. ICO tokens’ realities – their risks, expectation of profits, reliance on the efforts of others, manner of marketing, exchange trading, limited supply, and capital formation -- are attributes of investment offerings.  In the U.S., nearly all ICOs would meet the Supreme Court’s ‘Howey Test’ defining an investment contract under securities laws. As poet James Whitcomb Riley wrote over 100 years ago: “When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.”  In 2019, we’re likely to continue seeing high ICO failure rates while funding totals decline. Regulators and the courts will bring added clarity to the market through increased numbers of enforcement cases and related private litigation.  Central Banks  Central banks are studying blockchain technology and crypto markets with one eye on financial stability and another eye on what it means for the fiat currencies they issue and oversee.  Canada’s project Jasper and Singapore’s project Ubin are exploring use of permissioned blockchain applications to update payment systems.  While the policy challenges are significant, some Central Banks also are considering giving the public access to central bank payment systems and digital reserves through so-called ‘central bank digital currency’ (CBDC). Two countries’ review – one strong and one in distress - are noteworthy. In Sweden, use of paper-based Krona has declined and the Riksbank, the world’s oldest central bank, is pursuing an e-Krona project to provide electronic central bank money directly to the public.  Venezuela, facing hyperinflation, economic instability, and sanctions is promoting public use of a purportedly oil-backed token, Petro, though there are reports that seriously question the token’s legitimacy.  2019 and Beyond  So, while Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin has survived a decade of trials, the question still remains, 'What does it mean for 2019 and beyond?' Central intermediaries remain a real part of our economies. The financial sector is exploring permissioned private blockchain applications rather than cryptocurrencies.  Will commercial economy-wide use cases be found where the benefits of lower verification and networking costs are truly greater than the expenses, challenges and complexity of blockchain technology? Will smaller concepts flourish and provide a bridge for further development and acceptance?  I remain optimistic, particularly with regard to permissioned private blockchain applications.  What about open blockchain projects and crypto tokens? Will users find real economic value in the native crypto tokens associated with such projects? With the break in the crypto markets, we just might start to find out.

42402363,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43ps,1545045609,A Year Ago Today Bitcoin’s Price Hit a Record $20k,"Bitcoin (BTC) is still struggling to find the bottom of a bear market on the anniversary of its $20,000 all-time record price high.  At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $3,230 on Bitstamp – down 83.5 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached on Dec. 17, 2017.  BTC is also down 76 percent on a year-to-date basis (from its opening price of $13,880 on Jan. 1) and is on track to end its three-year winning streak.  The picture, however, was remarkably different in the fourth quarter of the last year. The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid on Nov. 1, 2017, on speculation that the imminent listing of bitcoin futures products on major US exchanges would open the floodgates for institutional money. Back then, BTC was trading above $6,000.  Notably, the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO) established a self-feeding cycle of more investors joining the party, leading to an even bigger rise in price. By Dec. 17, BTC was trading at $20,000 and was seen rising to dizzy heights this year.  Such was the frenzy that Ari Paul, current CIO of Blocktower Capital, purchased 12-month call options with a strike price of $50,000 for $1 million. Call options give holders the right to buy the underlying cryptocurrency at an agreed price on or before a particular date.  Paul was essentially betting that BTC would rise to $50,000 by Dec. 28, 2018. The bubble, however, burst in the first quarter of this year and prices have been generally falling ever since. As a result, that now-worthless call option is set to expire next Friday.  A tough year  BTC's slide from $20,000 to $3,200 could be categorized in the following phases:  Sell the fact: BTC closed last year at $13,880 – down 44 percent from the $20,000 high seen on Dec. 17 – possibly due to profit taking on long positions initiated in the run-up to the futures listings. Most experts called it a “sell the fact” scenario and dismissed it as nothing more than a healthy correction.  Bubble shrinks: The effects of regulatory clampdowns in China and South Korea weighed heavily over bitcoin’s price early in Q1. Both nations were the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies before the restrictions. Prices subsequently fell to $6,000 on Feb. 6 and closed near $7,000 on Mar. 31.  Bear breather: BTC spent a better part of the second quarter and the entire third quarter defending the psychological level of $6,000. Notably, the key support level held ground in the third quarter, despite the decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) to reject BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As a result, experts, including the likes of billionaire investor Novogratz, were convinced that BTC had bottomed out around $6,000.  Losses resume: BTC’s inability to produce a notable price bounce despite the repeated defense of $6,000 proved costly. Prices nosedived below the critical 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) support on Nov. 14, signaling a resumption of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000.  What lies ahead?  BTC hit a 15-month low of $3,122 over the weekend and is showing little signs of life below the 21-month EMA. The short-duration, technical charts, however, are signaling scope for a minor price bounce.  Monthly chart  The above chart shows BTC’s journey from the record highs a year ago to recent 15-month lows near $3,100. The outlook as per the monthly chart would turn bullish, if and when BTC crosses the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month EMA, currently at $5,719.  Daily chart and BTC/USD Longs on Bitfinex  BTC's daily chart shows a ""sideways"" breach of the falling wedge resistance, meaning the breakout is not convincing. As a result, a more credible evidence of a bullish reversal is needed, possibly in the form a high-volume break above $3,633 (high of the 3-day inverted hammer candle).  That could yield a stronger corrective rally to levels above $4,000.  BTC/USD long positions on Bitfinex rose to 35,773 BTC earlier today – a level last seen on July 23. More importantly, the longs have risen by 33 percent in the last six days. That could be an indication that bargain hunters are paying heed to extreme oversold conditions reported by the 14-week relative strength index (RSI).  BTC, therefore, could witness a corrective bounce ahead of the year's end.  View  A drop to the psychological level of $3,000 remains on cards as long as BTC is trading below the crucial resistance at $3,633.  A break above $3,633 would validate the falling wedge breakout seen in the daily chart and allow a rally to $4,000. A violation there would expose next resistance lined up at $4,410 (Nov. 29 high).

42402351,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43g2,1545040849,This Brazilian Bank Is Using Ethereum to Issue a Stablecoin,"A state-owned bank in Brazil is about to issue a crypto token designed to maintain parity with the national currency.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the Brazilian National Social Development Bank will launch a pilot in January 2019 for the BNDES token, which runs on the ethereum blockchain and is backed 1-for-1 by Brazilian real. The bank has been experimenting with the stablecoin throughout 2018 and will now use it for tax-deductible contributions to cultural institutions.  ConsenSys, the ethereum design studio, will be among the companies consulting the bank during this process. Although the Brooklyn, N..Y.-based conglomerate of startups wouldn’t comment on this Brazilian project beyond confirming its involvement, it falls squarely in line with priorities listed in an internal statement issued by its founder Joe Lubin earlier this month, stating the company will renew its focus on being a blockchain advisory specializing in architecture and token design.  For the pilot, the bank will issue several hundred dollars worth of BNDES to the National Film Agency, a film distribution company called Ancine for short, to create and promote scripts and movie productions in Brazil.  Since the bank has a history of corruption scandals involving misallocated funds and alleged bribes, the pilot creators hope public BNDES blockchain data will help bolster trust in state-owned banks.  The trial will use the National Registry of Taxpayers’ (Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jurídica, or CNPJ) electronic identification certificates, which are already widely used by Brazilian companies as official registration documents  “We can enforce rules using smart contracts. The company that receives the money can only spend it with companies that are working within the [film] sector,” Vanessa Almeida, a BNDES systems development manager, told CoinDesk.  Regarding the CPNJ identifiers, she added:  “We have a kind of ID in Brazil that has a certificate to send a token to the company, the company has to sign with this certificate...we will know in advance to which address you can send the tokens.”  This project was developed, with help from Ethereum Foundation developer Alex Van De Sande, to allow filmmakers associated the nonprofit Ancine to collect and share their financial records in real-time. Recipients will only be able to redeem the stablecoin through the bank for local currency.  All that transaction data may be leveraged to develop and inform future use cases as well. ""This information can help guide public policies,” said Almeida. “They will have a better map of this sector of the economy.”  Beyond trading  Stepping back, cryptocurrency traders have been the leading stablecoins users so far, storing value in their exchange accounts that can be instantly swapped for other cryptocurrencies without dealing with banks.  Exchange companies like Paxos, Gemini, and Coinbase, all added fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies in 2018. In contrast, this Brazilian pilot shows a use case for fiat-pegged crypto beyond speculative markets.  Rosine Kadamani, founder of the the educational Blockchain Academy in Brazil, told CoinDesk this pilot could have ripple effects across the country.  That’s because the government-run development bank manages funding for projects ranging from educational initiatives to building infrastructure like roads and dams.  “Because unfortunately, Brazil is very well-known for corruption, there’s a lot of questioning about the use of public funds,” Kadamani said. “They start with a stablecoin that is basically an accounting control, because everything goes back to the bank. But in the future, if it works well, there are other implications.”  Indeed, Gladstone Moises Arantes, Jr., technical lead of the BNDES blockchain initiative, told CoinDesk the bank will reevaluate the results of this pilot and consider expanding it to other organizations that receive public funding.  He told CoinDesk:  “The concept we have could be used for other institutions in Brazil or the government as a whole.”  BNDES token initiative team image courtesy of the Brazilian National Social Development Bank",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/12/17/this-brazilian-bank-is-using-ethereum-to-issue-a-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45ab73f8c76b00001660af0dc118843a2fa0d7d2-1280x854.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402355,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43i0,1545037271,Switzerland to Regulate Blockchain Within Existing Financial Laws,"The government of Switzerland wants to accommodate the blockchain sector within its existing financial laws.  The country’s Federal Council issued a report on Friday, providing a legal framework for distributed ledger technology (DLT), or blockchain,, stating that Switzerland's existing rules are well suited to dealing with such new technologies, but there is still a need for some amendments.  Firstly, the council has proposed an amendment to the country’s securities law to increase the legal certainty of crypto tokens. “Since an entry in a decentralised register accessible to interested parties can create publicity similar to the ownership of a security, it seems justified to attach similar legal effects to this entry,” the highest executive authority of the Swiss Confederation explained.  The council also wants to segregate crypto assets from the insolvent debtors’ total estate in bankruptcy proceedings. However, because under the country’s existing Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA) it is not clear whether these assets can be segregated, the council said there is a “great need for legal certainty” for the parties involved and thus a corresponding change is proposed in the DEBA act.  Further, the government body has proposed the creation of a new ""authorization category” for infrastructure providers in the blockchain sector, and will make amendments to its Financial Market Infrastructure Act accordingly. Currently, the council has not yet proposed any specific changes, as the central definitions of the terms ""securities"" and ""derivatives"" in financial market regulations are also relevant for blockchain-based business models, it said.  Regarding the country’s Anti-Money Laundering Act, the council said the legislation is currently adequate enough to also cover activities related to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs). “The general principles of the Anti-Money Laundering Act also apply to crypto-based assets.” it said, adding that there is no need for a “fundamental revision” at present.  The Swiss government has been working on blockchain regulations since 2016, when the country’s Federal Department of Finance outlined its plans to regulate fintech. Later in early 2017, the council itself was seeking consultations on regulatory changes for the domestic financial industry to account for fintech including blockchain.  Most recently, Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) introduced a new fintech license with “relaxed” requirements that is applicable to blockchain and cryptocurrency-based firms.

42402352,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd43h1,1545023430,"Hong Kong Exchange 'Hesitant' to Approve Bitmain IPO, Says Source","The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) is reluctant to approve the initial public offering (IPO) applications of Chinese bitcoin mining equipment manufacturers, according to a person involved in the talks.  Following the 2017 cryptocurrency market boom, mining giants Canaan Creative, Ebang and Bitmain applied in May, June and September of this year, respectively, to sell shares on the HKEX. Bitmain’s bid, in particular, was seen as a watershed moment, as it marked the first time a major crypto startup sought to go public.  But the 2018 bear market has underscored the sharp ups and downs of the crypto space, making the exchange nervous about listing such companies, the source told CoinDesk. Canaan Creative’s application has already lapsed, and the other two face a high bar in convincing HKEX.  ""The exchange is very hesitant to actually approve these bitcoin mining companies because the industry is so volatile. There’s a real risk that they could just not exist anymore in a year or two,"" said the person, who requested anonymity because the information is private, adding:  ""The HKEX doesn’t want to be the first exchange in the world to approve this and have one die on them.""  An HKEX spokesperson said the exchange does not comment on individual companies or individual listing applications. Bitmain declined to comment, citing its pre-IPO quiet period, while Canaan Creative and Ebang did not respond to CoinDesk’s inquiries by press time.  Stepping back, the IPO process in Hong Kong starts with a company filing a draft prospectus with the HKEX. Then the exchange will begin back-and-forth talks and questions with the applicant.  If the application is approved by both the HKEX and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) – Hong Kong’s financial regulator – the case will proceed to a listing hearing, during which the offering size and share price are decided and then made public.  However, if an applicant does not make it to a listing hearing after six months from filing, the application will lapse, meaning the case is no longer active, though the applicant could choose to later reactivate the case if it still wishes to pursue the fundraising.  Canaan’s application lapsed in November after the firm failed to make it to the listing hearing six months from its May filing. Ebang, which submitted on June 24, is only two weeks away from the six-month window ending. Bitmain, the best known of the bunch, is almost halfway through the six-month period.  ""Right now, I don’t think that any of them could make it to the listing hearing,"" said the source, noting that both HKEX and the SFC must sign off. ""If either one doesn’t approve it, you can’t make it to the listing hearing.""  High hurdles  Lawyers familiar with the HKEX’s IPO process called its hesitance to list mining firms understandable.  Apart from basic listing requirements such as financial track records, the HKEX also focuses on ""suitability and sustainability of the business and how risky the business is for retail investors,"" said Ivy Wong, a partner at the law firm of Baker McKenzie in Hong Kong.  ""I have seen cases where the applicants could satisfy the basic listing requirements for the three years’ track record, but did not manage to convince the HKEx that its business is sustainable, and the HKEX was reluctant to grant a listing approval,"" she said.  Frank Bi, a partner at international law firm Ashurst in Hong Kong who regularly works with public companies, echoed that point.  ""HKEX will be particularly cautious and concerned over the regulatory uncertainty arising from bitcoin mining makers' IPOs in Hong Kong,"" he said. ""Coupled with the potential market speculation which has been reflected over the price of bitcoin recently, it is even more difficult to present a sustainable business model of this industry.""  Neither Ebang nor Bitmain has disclosed its financial data for the third quarter of this year when the cryptocurrency market started to take a notable dip.  ""If there’s a significant drop of their revenue, profits or loss, they have to disclose that. It’s something that worries the exchange,"" the source familiar with the talks said.  The source went on to explain the exchange is actually taking the advantage of the fact the crypto market is down right now because while it doesn’t want to approve the applications, it doesn’t have the grounds to reject them outright.  ""What they are doing is they are just dragging the case right now,"" the source said, adding:  ""If the market continues going up, the exchange may be pressured to approve the cases because how well the entire industry is doing. But because the market is down, these companies really have to justify [how] this industry is sustainable.""  Bi said two common reasons for IPO delays in Hong Kong are a failure on the applicant’s part to provide due diligence and disclosure to HKEX’s satisfaction and market conditions where a realistic valuation is different from what existing investors want for their exit.  ""HKEX has always been known to be cautious about scrutinizing applicants’ businesses and their sustainability,"" Bi said.  More than mining?  One approach bitcoin miner makers have tried to justify their business models to HKEX is to brand themselves as having diverse lines of business, such as research and development in artificial intelligence, telecommunication and blockchain, according to the draft filings.  For instance, Bitmain claimed to be a ""strong contender in the AI chip industry"" in its draft prospectus, potentially joining the ranks of technology giants like NVIDIA and Google.  ""Riding on our success and expertise in ASIC chip design and powerful research and development capabilities, we have extended our focus to the revolutionary field of AI and have achieved promising results,"" the firm stated in the filing.  Bitmain said it launched its pilot AI chip BM1680 in the second quarter of 2017, which ""functions as a tensor computing acceleration processor for deep learning, applicable to training and inference on artificial neural networks.""  But such arguments are not going over well at HKEX, according to the source involved in the talks.  ""Actually what they are is they are just manufacturers who focus primarily on bitcoin mining machines. If this whole mining thing tanks, these companies will probably tank as well,"" the source said.  Bi agreed, telling CoinDesk while these companies have made statements about expanding their business models beyond crypto mining, ""it is likely that crypto mining-related activities and crypto holdings still comprise a majority part of their revenue.""  Another factor that can could make hurt these companies chances of approval is their vast holdings of cryptocurrencies whose value has steeply fallen in the past six months.  ""Combined with a limited track record of business operations and the substantial recent decline in crypto values, likely means that regulators will be especially closely scrutinizing their businesses,"" Bi added.  Bitmain, for example, disclosed that as of June 30 this year, it had US$886.9 million in crypto assets, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin and dash, among others.  Although it didn’t disclose a coin-by-coin breakdown, data from CoinDesk's Crypto-Economics Explorer shows all of the mentioned cryptocurrencies have seen a major decline by at least 50 percent. Among them, bitcoin cash has seen the most significant drop after the recent hard fork war, in which Bitmain has played a vocal part in leading the Bitcoin Cash ABC camp.  ""It [the crypto holding] certainly doesn’t help with the case, because you are just adding more risks. Now it’s not just your revenue that’s at risk, but also your balance sheet,"" the source said.  Status symbol  To be sure, going public is not necessarily a life-or-death matter for the Chinese mining companies.  ""These companies – Ebang, Bitmain and Canaan – want the regulatory approval and status of being a listed company. But as far as the genuine funding needs, they actually have quite a lot of money because they have made a lot in the past year,"" said the source familiar with the discussions.  Indeed, the 2017 boom helped the miner makers in China to generate exponential revenue and profit growth.  Bitmain, Cannan and Ebang made $1.2 billion, $56 million, and $60 million, in profits last year, respectively. Further, the significant growth also led to a whopping increase in the firms’ compensation for their key executives.  According to the filings, Bitmain’s founders Ketuan Zhan and Jihan Wu, for instance, received $22.7 million and $20.4 million as discretionary bonuses for 2017, respectively, while their annual salaries were both $27,000.  Wong said companies’ reasons for seeking IPOs may vary – some do it for profile and presence in the market while others do it for fundraising and realizing gains.  ""My guess is that their [miner makers’] reasons are likely mixed, coupled with a desire to set market precedent and be the first mover in the market,"" she said.  More broadly, Wong said it may be too early to tell the success or failure of any of these crypto companies as the market is still relatively young and we have yet to see how they emerge and develop.  She concluded:  ""It is, in any event, an exciting thing to see that it is able to provide investors with more investment options and satisfy the different risk appetites in the market.""
