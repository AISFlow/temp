42400370,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQaW,1504820712,US Federal Reserve Hints at DLT Integration in New Report,"The US Federal Reserve indicated on Tuesday that it is open to using distributed ledger technology (DLT) and cryptocurrencies for financial transactions in place of the decades-old wire transfers and other tools currently used.  A response to a January 2015 call for public input on how national banks can become more efficient with a 21st century infrastructure, the document outlines how the U.S. central bank is specifically looking for a secure, fast, and efficient system that can more easily work with the different banks and financial organizations which do business with the government both domestically and internationally.  While the report primarily focused on what tools could be used to update the US payment system, it made two mentions of DLT, stating it would also be reviewed for use by the government.  According to the report:  ""[T]he Federal Reserve will consider other enhancements to its existing services and will continue to monitor, study and solicit input from stakeholders to understand the implications of new payment technologies and models, including distributed ledger technologies and digital currencies, that can facilitate a safe and efficient US payment system.""  This is not the first time the Federal Reserve has discussed DLT or cryptocurrency. In December 2016, the central bank published a document explaining the potential use of blockchain systems for both banks and consumers.  While last year'spublication listed the potential benefits of DLT, it also acknowledged potential issues, including its relatively recent invention and possible security problems.  The December report  notes that current laws and regulations do not clearly define ownership rights over digital tokens which represent physical assets or purely digital assets.  Before approving distributed ledger technologies or other upgraded payment systems for use, the organization wants to check how much these systems would cost and how well they would work. This work includes analyzing the security, cost, efficiency, and viability of the various options discussed in the report. There is no firm timeline listed for the next stage of the work.  The September report concludes:  ""[S]ubstantial work lies ahead to implement and adopt safe, ubiquitous real-time retail payments and to foster a safe, resilient and efficient US payment system.""

The news means that Unocoin's exchange services are now directly available within the Blockchain wallet, allowing users to more easily buy and sell bitcoin.  Citing the recent growth of digital assets in the Asian country, Blockchain indicated in a blog post that the move was part of a commitment to making digital currency ""simple and more accessible throughout India.""  According the Indian Economic Times, Blockchain co-founder Nicolas Cary said that 2,500 Indians are investing in bitcoins daily, figures that his firm's partnership with Unocoin could help support.  Cary stated:  ""India is our 35th market and after demonetisation, there has been an unprecedented surge in people using bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.""  Notably, India has not seen an easy regulatory path in recent years, with raids by authorities on exchanges and warnings from the country's central bank that caused some services to cease operating for a time.

42400375,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQeS,1504813508,$257 Million: Filecoin Breaks All-Time Record for ICO Funding,"Blockchain data storage network Filecoin has officially completed its initial coin offering (ICO), raising more than $257 million over a month of activity.  Filecoin's ICO, which began on August 10, quickly garnered millions in investment via CoinList, a joint project between Filecoin developer Protocol Labs and startup investment platform AngelList. That launch day was notable both for the large influx of purchases of Simple Agreements for Future Tokens, or SAFTs (effectively claims on tokens once the Filecoin network goes live), as well as the technology issues that quickly sprouted as accredited investors swamped the CoinList website.  Today, the ICO ended with approximately $205.8 million raised, a figure that adds to the $52 million collected in a presale that included Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, among others.  Combined, that total represents the largest completed ICO figure to date, surpassing the $232 million raised by Tezos earlier this summer in a sale that catered to retail investors as well.  The dizzying first day eventually gave way to slowing investment activity, though purchases over the several-week period ultimately pushed Filecoin's take above $200 million. Social media posts suggests that the past three days saw that figure rise by roughly $3 million.  Filecoin aims to provide a decentralized network for digital storage through which users can effectively rent out their spare capacity. In return, those users receive filecoins as payment.  The completed raise puts September on the path of being one of the busiest months for ICOs, according to data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker. To date, July 2017 saw the most sales volume, recording more than $500 million.  The second quarter of this year as a whole saw a record-breaking level of activity, with approximately $797 million raised through the funding model during that period, according to the latest State of Blockchain report.

42400372,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQcU,1504807247,US Lawmakers Seek Tax Exemption for Bitcoin Transactions Below $600,"Two members of the US House of Representatives have filed a bill seeking to create a tax exemption for purchases made with cryptocurrencies.  Back in 2014, the Internal Revenue Service declared that it would consider bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) as a kind of property for tax purposes. Any profits made when selling or exchanging a cryptocurrency triggers a capital gains requirement. Yet due to the wording of the IRS decision, that covers any transaction involving bitcoin, including an oft-mentioned purchase of a cup of coffee – essentially meaning that if you bought some bitcoin at $1, and spent it on a $2 cup of coffee, you would owe tax on the difference.  Reps. Jared Polis and David Schweikert, who co-lead the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, are hoping to alleviate some of the issues resulting from that ruling with the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act.  Unveiled today  , the measure, if passed, would create a de minimis exemption for cryptocurrency payments below $600 after December 31 of this year. Put more simply, transactions involving a cryptocurrency below that threshold wouldn't trigger a capital gains liability.  As the text of the bill states:  ""Gross income shall not include gain from the sale or exchange of virtual currency for 5 other than cash or cash equivalents….[if the amount of gain excluded from gross income under subsection (a) with respect to a sale or exchange shall not exceed $600.""  In an interview with CoinDesk, Jerry Brito, executive director of the DC-based nonprofit Coin Center – which helped advocate for and organize the bill – compared the move to one taken previously by Congress to create an exemption for purchases made using foreign currency.  ""What we have done with this bill is do something very similar, to create a de minimis exemption for small purchases.""  As for the prospects of the bill in a Congress beset by Republican infighting and looming fights over the federal government's funding and ability to borrow, Brito struck a cautiously optimistic tone, pointing to the ongoing effort to reform the US tax system as aligning with the goals of the new bill.  ""This should be unobjectionable to members of the Congress,"" he said.

42400376,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQfR,1504803606,Cambridge Blockchain Joins Government-Backed DLT Group in Luxembourg,"Digital identity startup Cambridge Blockchain is opening a new office in Paris.  The Massachusetts-based firm is setting up shop at at a startup campus founded by Partech Ventures, which invested in Cambridge Blockchain's $2 million funding round earlier this year.  That the startup would move to establish a more solid presence in Europe is perhaps unsurprising. Cambridge Blockchain has looked to the financial sector as the primary market for its digital identity solutions, with a particular focus on Europe.  In May, Cambridge Blockchain announced that it was working with LuxTrust, a major digital identity firm backed by the government of Luxembourg, on a new blockchain-powered platform. That relationship with Luxembourg is deepening, as Cambridge Blockchain today said that it was joining the Infrachain initiative, a nonprofit group formed earlier this year by a number of companies with the backing of the country's government.  Other members include LuxTrust and professional services firms KPMG and Deloitte, among others. With Cambridge Blockchain's inclusion, that effort has now expanded beyond Luxembourg.  ""Thanks to the support of Partech Ventures and Infrachain, we are positioned to tackle the banking industry’s greatest threat: the cost of regulatory compliance,"" Matthew Commons, Cambridge Blockchain's CEO, said in a statement.

42400377,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQhP,1504799146,No Man's Land? Ether Prices Approach $350 But Struggle to Build Momentum,"The ether-US dollar exchange rate (ETH/USD) witnessed a corrective rally to $330 levels today, with prices clocking an intraday high of $345.  As discussed yesterday  , the move comes at a time when the market continues to seek direction following China’s decision to ban initial coin offerings (ICO), a use case credited as helping the price of the asset climb over 3,000 percent this year.  Since the vast majority of ICOs are launching tokens issued on top of the ethereum blockchain, this was widely read as a bearish signal, though it remains to be seen how bearish it will ultimately be. So far, it seems, traders are seeing it as a short-time buying opportunity.  At press time, ethereum traded at $330 levels. Week-on-week, the digital currency is down 13.65%. But, on a monthly basis, ether is still up 33%.  So is the corrective rally poised to continue?  1-hour chart  The chart above shows a downside breakdown of the rising wedge pattern, which is a bearish pattern that begins wide at the bottom and contracts as prices move higher and the trading range narrows.  It is usually used as a continuation pattern, i.e. the downside break as seen on the chart above signals the continuation of the sell-off. In ETH’s case, the downside break signals continuation of the sell-off from $400.  However, price found support at $326 and rebounded to $335 levels.  Scenario Analysis  As of now, we are in a no man's land. From the current price, following scenarios could unfold:  Bearish scenario: A break below $322 would add credence to the rising wedge breakdown and could trigger a sell-off to $293-$290 levels.  Bullish scenario: Breach of resistance at $341 could see ether re-test resistance at $364 [Aug 21 high].

42400373,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQZX,1504795542,Ethereum Startup ConsenSys Launches $50 Million Blockchain Fund,"Ethereum startup and incubator ConsenSys has announced a $50 million venture fund for startups working with blockchain technology.  Named ConsenSys Ventures, the new fund is being led by investment specialist Kavita Gupta. Explaining the fund to Axios, Gupta stated that initial coin offerings (ICOs), the blockchain funding method that has swept the investment landscape this year, still have a lot to learn from traditional venture capital.  According to CoinDesk data, by June 2017, ICOs had surpassed early-stage VC funding.  Yet, despite the impressive figures, Gupta stated:  ""There is still value to due diligence and even if two PhD kids have sold tokens based on a brilliant white paper, they still have to figure out how to deliver a company. That's not necessarily something they have experience doing.""  Gupta, who won the UN Social Finance Innovator Award of the year 2015, is particularly interested in blockchain projects with social and environmental inclinations.  The investment expert told Impact Alpha that he believes blockchain is the solution to nearly all of the sustainable development goals adopted by the UN.

42400381,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQiO,1504790436,Bitcoin Breakout? Price Action Analysis Hints at Possible Pullback,"The bitcoin price [BTC to US dollar exchange rate] fell to a two-week low of $3,900 on Tuesday, a market movement that represented the biggest decline for the asset since July.  Triggered by the sudden news from China that the country’s financial regulators would ban initial coin offerings, the decline has also called into question just how big the appetite is for a higher bitcoin price given its 700% year-over-year gains.  However, traders appear to be bullish on the idea it can rise back above $5,000, the all-time high it set last Friday. In fact, traders who missed the rally appear to be utilizing the dip to board the bitcoin freight train – over the last 48 hours, the digital currency has recovered more than 50% of the losses it suffered during the four day period from September 2–5.  At press time, the BTC traded at $4,620, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Week-on-week, bitcoin is down 2.69%. On a monthly basis, the cryptocurrency is up 34.8%.  Still, while the sharp rally from the weekly low of $3,900 has triggered speculation bitcoin is aiming for the fresh record highs, technical studies say the recovery lacks substance.  Money Flow Index [MFI] does not support further gains  The Money Flow Index (MFI) is an oscillator that uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure. (MFI indicates rising or falling prices always through its own rise or fall.) If the MFI rises above the centre line [50], this is regarded as a buy signal.  Similarly, an intersection going down is regarded as a sell signal.  Daily chart  4-Hour chart  The MFI is close to overbought levels. Typically, an MFI above 80 is considered overbought and MFI below 20 is considered oversold. These levels are often used to identify unsustainable price extremes.  Overbought levels alone are not enough to turn bearish. However, in BTC’s case, the overbought MFI on the 4-hour chart could be read as a signal that the recovery from the low of $3,900 has ended. This is because, the daily MFI is bearish as discussed above.  Furthermore, the decline from the record high of $5,000 was triggered by a bearish price-RSI divergence. A bearish price RSI divergence is formed when prices form higher highs while the oscillator – in this case an RSI – forms significantly lower highs.)  As such, bitcoin’s outlook remains bearish unless we break above $5,000 as such a move would signal the bearish price RSI divergence is no longer valid.  View  Daily chart  Bullish factors  The rising trend line is intact and is likely to offer support at $4,265  Bearish factors  As discussed above, the MFI is not in favor of further gains in bitcoin  Bearish price-RSI divergence  Potential head and shoulders pattern  BTC is more likely to break below $4,265, in which case a lower highs pattern would be confirmed. An uptrend, which is a series of higher highs and higher lows, reverses into a downtrend by changing into a series of lower highs and lower lows.  Lower lows would be confirmed if prices break below the recent low of $4,900.  Also note that a lower highs would increase the odds of the prices forming a head and shoulders [H&S] bearish reversal pattern. The Head and shoulders is a reversal pattern that, when formed, signals the security [in this case bitcoin] is likely to move against the previous trend.  The H&S neckline [line drawn from the left shoulder bottom and right shoulder bottom] support is seen at $3980 levels. A break below the neckline level confirms bullish-to-bearish trend reversal.  Bullish scenario  A break above $4,640 could result in a rally towards $5000, although caution is advised as only a move above $5,000 would make the bearish price-RSI divergence invalid and shall revive the rally set in motion from the July low of $1,826.

42400369,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQYY,1504785629,Reg D on the Rise? Investor-Grade ICO Products Are Coming – and Soon,"Innovators in the initial coin offering (ICO) sector appear to be stepping up efforts to target an increasingly interested institutional market.  While professional investors and money managers have historically struggled to gain exposure to the Wild West of token sales and ICOs, work is now underway to create new offerings geared toward not only this audience, but the evolving regulations that both buyers and sellers must abide by.  In short, a strategy pioneered with the launch of the first token designed specifically as a security, VC firm Blockchain Capital's pioneering BCAP token, is showing signs of further adoption.  Using the same investment bank, California-based Argon Group, Protos Cryptocurrency Asset Management announced a plan last week to launch an ICO via a Regulation D placement that would see it collecting funds for a cryptocurrency hedge fund.  And industry analysts see a simple reason why – the increasing specter of regulatory action runs the risk of muting the outsized returns that have heightened the market's exposure.  Brad Chun, CEO of blockchain startup Mooti Digital Identity, sees this as a smart and necessary way to appeal to investors, given regulatory risk. Not only has the SEC indicated that issuers could face liability for disseminating tokens deemed securities, but regulators in China have gone so far as to demand that businesses selling them halt forthwith and refund customers.  Chun told CoinDesk:  ""There are zero technical or operational advantages. The only advantage is possible compliance with jurisdictions and laws which might deem various activities illegal if these steps aren't taken.""  The end result according to Petar Zivkovski, an executive at trading platform Whale Club, is that a regulated strategy, while onerous, better protects investors and innovators.  ""[It] protects their team legally, and they appease the minds of their potential customers by certifying that they are not fraudulent,"" he said.  And the growing use of private placements like the Reg D structure is something investors should note. Namely, it means that the next generation of tokens could be securities in the view of U.S. regulators.  Token for tokens  And striking this balance between returns and regulation is key to the Protos offering, according to both its founders and the advisors managing the offering.  Protos will be used to invest exclusively in other cryptocurrencies and tokens. Further, the fund's investments will broadly fall into three buckets: active investment, arbitrage and ICO investment.  According to Protos, their active investment strategy involves making what are essentially momentum bets on market price movements. The arbitrage strategy will revolve around purchasing and selling tokens on different exchanges as close together as possible, in order to benefit from price discrepancies across exchanges.  Since liquidity is an issue in token markets, Protos plans to focus on trading the largest tokens, especially where the market capitalization is above $1 billion.  Philipp Kallerhoff, who will run trading operations at the Protos venture explained it will also build a database, where they can analyze various token metrics, with the goal of building fundamental measures for data-driven trading strategies.  Such tools, he reasons, will become more valuable as the market calms down and large returns in more developed assets become less likely.  Pros and cons  There are, of course, trade offs when issuing private placements.  CoinDesk also spoke with Emma Channing, who serves as General Counsel and interim CEO of Argon Group, the investment bank that managed the issuance for Protos. As Channing points out, issuing a Regulation D private placement requires that the purchasers must be accredited investors, which, in the U.S., means that they must have a minimum net worth of $1,000,000, or have earned $200,000 a year for the last two years.  Restricting the list of potential investors in a token offering to those who meet the accredited investor requirements restricts the number of people who can purchase the token. Such restrictions may influence how the token offering is received by buyers, especially considering the open-source roots of the cryptocurrency world.  While Chun said there are benefits from regulation when the guidelines help ensure honest business practices, he generally draws a hard line against the trend towards securitization.  As such, his statements set up what could be an interesting trend ahead – that new tokens turn off the retail investors that have helped build up the nascent market.  Chun concluded:  ""I'm against regulations in general because they add additional burden to be borne by both the investor and the company. In most cases, it restricts investors from specific jurisdictions or ones below a specific income or accreditation level.

The All-Russia People's Front, known as ONF and formed in 2011, recently organized a conference focused on the environment. It was there, according to the organization's press service, that the plan for a cryptocurrency to be used to fund environmental causes was advanced.  Dmitry Mironov, one of the leaders of the ONF, said:  ""We want the units of the cryptocurrency to be received by investors and enterprises that promote the development of environmental technologies.

Whether the proposal actually advances in the government remains to be seen, however.

42400367,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJQXZ,1504774803,Israel's Largest Bank Begins Blockchain Trial With Microsoft,"Israel's largest bank is working with software giant Microsoft to develop a blockchain-based platform for creating digital bank guarantees.  According to the Times of Israel, Bank Hapoalim – the country's largest by assets – will look to digitize the largely paper-based process. Reportedly involved in discussions around the launch is the Bank of Israel (the nation's central bank).  Arik Pinto, Hapoalim's CEO, said in a statement:  ""The new process will enable Bank Hapoalim customers to receive security documents in a digital, automated and secure manner, without physically coming to the branch and in a very short process. The use of blockchain technology will significantly improve the customer experience and the level of trust in the banking system.""  The project is being built on top of Microsoft Azure, the tech giant's cloud computing service that has served as the hub for its work with blockchain.  ""This is the first collaboration of its kind in Israel in the banking sector that will enable a digital revolution, access to advanced services and the combination of technology and business needs,"" Shelly Landsmann, chief executive for Microsoft Israel, said of the initiative.  Other banks have explored moving bank guarantees – which are essentially promises to cover the principal on a loan in the event of a default by the borrower – to blockchain-based systems, including Australia's Westpac.

42379878,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KxLJ,1504771202,Seeing Ghosts: Vitalik Is Finally Formalizing Ethereum's Casper Upgrade,"Casper is starting to look less like a ghost.  While that might sound too good to be true for the long-waiting ethereum faithful, CoinDesk has confirmed that the network's creator, Vitalik Buterin, is now in the process of crafting three white papers explaining Casper, the protocol's much-anticipated version of proof-of-stake consensus.  As such, the papers could come to mark a major milestone for ethereum in that, while Casper has long been proposed as a better and greener way to keep the global network in agreement about the blockchain's transaction history, the industry has been waiting for details to be put on paper.  Rather, the idea has been trapped in the brains of a few ethereum developers, with breakthroughs and development scattered across online chat groups and blog posts over the last several years.  As proof-of-stake is pitched as such a crucial piece of ethereum, users have had to trust these developers do indeed have a good plan.  As such, Buterin's formal white papers will now subject ethereum developers to peer-review, which could mark a big step forward for the project which is currently getting ready to upgrade to Metropolis before changing the system over to proof-of-stake.  ""In short, the Casper designs are getting better each iteration,"" ethereum developer Virgil Griffith, a well-known hacker and ethereum developer who is currently reviewing Buterin's white papers, told CoinDesk.  The papers have been hiding in documents in the ethereum research GitHub for the last couple of weeks, with Buterin and Griffith making updates every now and then.  However, it's worth noting the early-stage nature of the work. The documents, which have question marks and some ""coming soon!"" bubbles scattered throughout, won't be ready for at least a month, Griffith said, adding:  ""I'm working on them as I type this.""  Slow and steady  The first paper, ""Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget"" – a play on the 1990s film ""Casper the Friendly Ghost"" – explains how the consensus system works at a high level.  Notably, the paper reiterates a recent change in direction for ethereum. Rather than switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake right away, the plan is start off slow by first weaving the two together.  The paper explains:  ""The proposal mechanism will initially be the existing ethereum proof-of-work chain, making the first version of Casper a hybrid PoW/PoS algorithm that relies on proof of work for liveness but not safety, but in future versions the proposal mechanism can be substituted with something else.""  Expanding further, proof-of-work will be used to validate most ethereum blocks, but proof-of-stake will be used as a ""checkpoint"" for every 100th block, providing more ""finality"" to the system, or a guarantee that transactions cannot be spent more than once.  The paper goes on to cover possible attacks, such as ""long-range attacks,"" that validators could try to use and how Casper aims to overcome them.  Devil in the details  The other two papers go into the minutiae of the system.  Titled ""Incentives in Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget,"" the second paper explores the incentives that go into making the system work and ensuring it doesn't get messed up.  For Casper, there are two types of things that can go wrong: ""Safety faults"" occur when the rules are broken, for instance when two validators come up with incompatible states. ""Liveness faults"" occur when the system stops, or fails to push transactions through.  Because users have to deposit some of their money to participate as validators, the paper outlines that if validators try to go against the rules, the system will steal their deposit.  The third paperhttps://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/papers/censorship_rejection/censorship_rejection.pdf, ""Automated Censorship Attack Rejection,"" focuses on 51-percent attacks – those in which a miner or mining pool accumulates a majority of the network computing power, and can then twist the rules of the system to their advantage to, say, double spend or block transactions.  Developers have thought a lot about this problem, since if it were to occur, it could reduce confidence in the blockchain as a single source of legitimate transactions.  In the paper, Buterin argues Casper mitigates this problem, since the protocol punishes attackers by taking away their deposits if they do something wrong.  Another approach  It's worth noting, though, that Buterin's approach to proof-of-stake as outlined in these white papers, isn't the only approach.  The Ethereum Foundation's Vlad Zamfir, who leads the actual development of Casper, said he plans to release more details about his version of Casper before Devcon, ethereum's big developer conference in the fall.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Vitalik is more driven to implement something soon, whereas I'm more driven to search for theoretically optimal solutions even if it means some delays.""  And again, because Buterin's version is just now getting squared away on paper, it could be assumed that during the peer-review process, things will need to be further fleshed out.  Yet, developers have already started implementing the first step of Buterin's Casper approach, which is slated to go live sometime after ethereum's next big upgrade, Metropolis launches this fall.  And with that, it's unclear whether the theory behind Casper will be fully ironed out before people see the ghost in real-life.
