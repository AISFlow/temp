42420607,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLQz,1683158008,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Recovers From Fed Dip,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bank failures are playing a larger role in dictating the price of bitcoin rather than interest rates.

Bitcoin (BTC) is slowly recovering after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points (bps). Initially, bitcoin was down 1% after the rate hike, but it has since recovered by 1.3% to $29,115. Ether (ETH), for its part, is up 1.6% to $1,908.  Banrion Capital Chief Strategist Victoria Bills, pointed to the ongoing banking crisis in the U.S. as another driver of crypto prices that counterbalances the Federal Reserve’s ongoing interest rate hikes.  “As panic and market reactivity increase, perceptions of failure within the banking sector could lead to the ongoing turmoil in regional banks,"" Bills said on CoinDesk TV.  In April, JPMorgan said in a report that the current banking crisis is a “vindication for the crypto ecosystem.”  “The U.S. banking crisis and the intense shift in U.S. bank deposits to U.S. money market funds are viewed by crypto supporters as a vindication of the crypto ecosystem,” the report noted. The analysts said the crisis “exposed the weaknesses of the traditional financial system given bank’s maturity mismatch is susceptible to bank runs.”  No doubt all eyes will be on Friday’s U.S. employment data to see how it impacts the price of crypto. But there might be another bank failure before then, which could drive up crypto’s price.

Data from CryptoSlam shows that over the past week the number of sales on Solana is down 52.7%, while the number of transactions is down 16%.  Meanwhile, Ethereum’s metrics are up across the board.  But Solana’s buyers and sellers metrics are both in the green as Madlads and other NFTs change hands. The number of buyers are up 40% over the last week while sellers are up by 31%.  Data from Nansen shows that the volume from MadLads has been declining slowly but steadily over the last month.  Nansen’s data shows that while the Madlads mint has had more market interest than any other collection over the last month (the only other NFT collection to surpass it in Solana’s history is Okay Bears), that interest is fading.  But this fading interest isn’t anything out of the ordinary. A similar story can be found elsewhere.  Yet, there might be one good piece of news for Solana investors and stakeholders. Despite the wind coming out of the sails of Solana NFT collections, the price of SOL hasn’t moved that much. It’s only down 2% over the last month and is currently trading at over $22, according to market data.

12331465,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4599604-zcash-the-bottom-is-in?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1683154392,Zcash: The Bottom Is In,"Summary The Zcash network has underperformed other privacy-focused crypto coins since last summer. A spam attack that exploited a flaw in the network's fee mechanism tripled the size of the blockchain, making it annoying to run a full node. Despite the attack, the chain was never shut down or stopped, no funds were ever hacked, and hash rate has remained near highs despite the drop in coin price. It's been well over a year since I've covered Zcash ( ZEC-USD ) for the Seeking Alpha public site. To call the performance since that article ""disastrous"" would probably be an understatement. It was published approximately two months before the Terra Luna ( LUNC-USD ) collapse and is now down 76% since that call. Data by YCharts It's been a bad call and I have to wear that. Perhaps more discouraging though is the underperformance vs notable privacy-centric cryptocurrency peers like Monero ( XMR-USD ) and Dash ( DASH-USD ); while those coins are certainly down as well since March 2022, it's to a far lesser degree. I'm not going to compare ZEC to either of those other coins. I think each have their own merit. I can definitely recommend this very good deep dive on XMR and I recently covered DASH for BlockChain Reaction subscribers as well. But for the benefit of this article, I'd like to explore what I believe caused the underperformance in ZEC and why I think that catalyst is behind us. The Block Spam Problem To get a better sense of the historical correlation of these coins, I think the 3 year normalized price performance shows us how the privacy coins moved in lockstep for much of 2020, 2021, and 2022. Data by YCharts ZEC and XMR specifically held a very tight correlation up until last summer. In July there was a clear divergence between the return of ZEC and the return of XMR. In my view, the most logical explanation for that divergence was a block spam attack that started in June 2022. You can see the impact that spam attack had pretty clearly through the median block size trend: Median Block Size (Blockchair) Before the spam attack started, the median block size was generally very low. Sometimes between 2-5 kb. At the height of the attack, the median block size would often reach 1,500 to 1,800 kb. While it didn't directly damage the security of the network per se, the spam attack made running a full node very annoying because of the data download required to keep up with the blockchain size. Over the course of the spam attack, the block size of the chain actually tripled: Zcash Blockchain Size (Blockchair) The obvious question is how did this happen? Up until very recently, the Zcash fee mechanism had a pretty silly flaw that didn't protect the block space through a proportional fee structure. What often happens with blockchain participants is single transactions can be built to have multiple output receivers at the same time. Constructing a transaction this way requires more block space because it uses more data. For an easy way to think about this, it's a bit like buying produce by weight. If Zcash were a grocery store, it was charging a flat rate for a bag of grapes no matter how much the bag weighed. Since the Zcash network didn't account for block size through a proportional fee structure that charged more fees for more data, it allowed a spammer to maximize the outputs on unused Zcash block space at very little cost. This spam attack lasted for roughly 10 months and I believe it is the core reason behind ZEC's underperformance. Last month, the Zcash development community finally fixed the issue. Network Metrics Despite the sentiment damage from the block space spam problem, the network health of Zcash hasn't faltered from where I sit. Even in the face of lower coin prices for a year straight, the mining hashrate has remained stable despite the putrid return from mining the coin: ZEC Hash Rate (Messari) The main selling point of Zcash is that it offers fully private transactions on a peer to peer basis. This is something that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and just about every other notable coin in the crypto market simply don't have. We could debate technology against something like Monero's ring signatures but both coins are currently offering private transactions for crypto users. This is a good thing. The way Zcash does this is through pooling shielded assets together. ZEC Shielded Pool (Blockchair) The shielded pool has increased 20% in just a few weeks from 1.09 million ZEC in early April to 1.31 million ZEC at the end of the month. To me, this is an indication that the proportional fee mechanism news has been well received and ZEC holders are ready to continue using shielded funds. Valuation I've shared the NVT ratio in previous Seeking Alpha articles numerous times. For me, this is a solid valuation metric for more payment-focused crypto coins like BTC, ZEC, DASH, Litecoin ( LTC-USD ), Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ). This ratio takes into consideration the market cap of the coin and the USD-denominated value that is transacted using the coin. The lower the NVT number, the cheaper the coin is as it's potentially an indication that the price of the coin isn't properly reflecting the value that is being transacted through the blockchain: 90 Day NVT (CoinMetrics) From this standpoint, ZEC is the cheapest payment coin of the legacy proof of work payment coins and by a wide margin: 90 Day NVT 11/9/22 5/2/23 Dogecoin 121 149 Dash 116 122 Bitcoin Cash 79 117 Zcash 75 41 Bitcoin 43 148 Litecoin 35 75 Source: CoinMetrics At a 90 day adjusted NVT ratio of 41, ZEC is the only coin in the table above that is actually cheaper than it was during the crypto crash that immediately followed the FTX collapse. Everything else has gone much higher. And now the main catalyst that hurt ZEC compared to the rest of the market is over. Risks Privacy coins and crypto protocols that help protect privacy are not something that US regulators are generally excited about. We saw the sanctioning of Tornado Cash by the US Treasury department back in August. If there is a move from governments to transition to something like a CBDC, it's unlikely to be a welcoming environment for privacy coins. There is a very legitimate possibility privacy coins could be criminalized. However, there is also a possibility cash could be criminalized. There is no such thing as freedom from risk. Summary I'm clearly a proponent of privacy and I believe that it's an idea that is painfully underappreciated by crypto market participants. I certainly am not opposed to owning Monero if that is your preference though I don't personally have a meaningful amount. Despite the price carnage last year, my views on Zcash are unchanged. I'm still personally long ZEC and I hold all of that exposure in self-custody wallet addresses on-chain. I think it could actually be argued that the spam attack has somewhat vindicated the community in twisted sort of way. The chain was never shut down. Nobody was hacked. Despite the annoyance that came with downloading so much junk data, the community was unwavering from what I witnessed online. According to data from LunarCrush, Zcash social mentions were up 39% in April. The spam attack vector has been fixed, shielded ZEC is at an all-time high, and the coin is significantly cheaper than payment-focused crypto peers. If you've been on the sidelines waiting, I think it's time.",NEUTRAL,BCH | XMR | ZEC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | XMR | ZEC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4599604-zcash-the-bottom-is-in?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12331465.jpeg

While the SEC had initially included the definition in its 2022 proposal to overhaul mandatory disclosures for hedge funds, the securities regulator yanked it in the final rule approved by the commissioners. The agency included a footnote to explain itself:  “The commission and staff are continuing to consider this term and are not adopting ‘digital assets’ as part of this rule at this time,” the note declared.  The agency is certainly continuing to consider crypto matters, which have taken an outsized role in both its enforcement actions and its ongoing rule proposals, despite its decision to walk this one back. Last month, the regulator did virtually the opposite by reopening a previously proposed rule redefining the term “exchange” and explicitly adding decentralized finance (DeFi) to it.  That revision – which drew sharp criticism from the industry and from two of the five SEC commissioners – is one of several more recent policy moves meant to clearly ensnare crypto into existing rules. The SEC also made another proposal in February that could bar investment advisers from keeping assets at crypto firms.  The original proposed definition for a digital asset in this week’s hedge fund rule hadn’t been extensive or controversial, describing such a thing as “using distributed ledger or blockchain technology” and including “so-called ‘virtual currencies,’ ‘coins’ and ‘tokens.’”  The agency continues without digital assets holding a formal place in its lexicon, though it’s a constant topic in the speeches of Chair Gary Gensler and other SEC officials.  “The SEC is a regulator that requires transparency from its registrants, but it is continuing to withhold regulatory clarity by not defining digital assets,” said Anne-Marie Kelley, a partner at Mercury Strategies who was a longtime SEC official. She suggested the commission may have deleted the definition because “any recognition of digital assets uniqueness as a novel product weakens their litigation stance that digital assets are securities and subject to the SEC securities laws.”  Americans for Financial Reform, a consumer advocacy group that’s usually critical of the crypto sector, had applauded the SEC for setting aside a separate category in the proposed rule for hedge funds disclosing their digital assets.  “Although digital assets are frequently marketed as an alternative to the traditional finance system, hedge funds, private equity firms, and banks have been getting more involved in investing and lending those assets,” the AFR Education Fund wrote in a 2022 comment letter.  But the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association – an industry lobbying group – complained the definition's wording “captures non-security digital asset classes, including commodities, bitcoin and non-fungible tokens, but it is unclear whether the intent of the definition was to capture any and all digital assets as opposed to all securities.” So Sifma had asked that the definition be more specific.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/03/us-sec-changes-its-mind-on-officially-labeling-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb7d25aec1fc05e6c51482121b05aa41f78f7aab-5714x3214.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These countries account for over 50% of all meme coin fans this year, indicating a strong interest in these assets. But the appeal of meme coins continues beyond there. The report also highlights the popularity of these coins in other regions, including Southeast Asia’s Philippines and Malaysia, Nigeria and Morocco in Africa, Oceania’s Australia and New Zealand, and Canada. This diverse mix of countries suggests that meme coins have a global appeal. Related Reading: More Dip To Come: Bitcoin Liquidity On The Move Ahead Of Major Event From the US to India, The Global Phenomenon Of Meme Coins Takes Hold The top 10 countries leading the meme coin craze in 2023 make up the majority of interest in these assets, representing 82.9% of all fans. This indicates that even though meme coins may have started as a niche trend, they have quickly gained a following worldwide. According to the report, the United States is at the forefront of the meme coin craze in 2023, accounting for a whopping 23.6% of the global interest in these speculative assets. With over 2 million views on the top meme coin pages, it is clear that Americans are embracing this new type of cryptocurrency. The report shows that the most popular meme coin in the US this year is Shiba Inu, which generated 60.7% of all US interest in meme coins. This is not surprising given the coin’s recent surge in popularity due to celebrity endorsements and high-profile listings on major cryptocurrency exchanges. Following closely behind Shiba Inu is Pepe, a trending crypto that recently drove 11.8% of meme coin interest in the US. Other popular meme coins in the country include Bonk and Volt Inu, which generated 5.7% and 4.9% of US interest, respectively. Moreover, India will be the second-largest driver of the meme coin hype in 2023, accounting for 20.3% of all interest across the countries. Shiba Inu is the most popular coin in India, generating 55.8% of the country’s interest in these speculative assets. Baby Doge Coin also received a relatively high share of interest, with 29.9% of India’s meme coin interest. Floki is the most popular meme coin in the Philippines, generating 26.7% of the country’s interest in these assets. Shiba Inu and Bonk also received similar interest levels at 18.3% and 17.8%, respectively. Baby Doge Coin and Pepe were close behind, with 12.7% and 10.2% share of Philippines meme coin interest, respectively. Shiba Inu Reigns Supreme According to the report, Shiba Inu is the most popular meme coin among investors in 2023, driving 46.7% of interest among the top meme coins. Baby DogeCoin is the second most popular, generating 12.3% of investor interest. This is followed by more recent coins, Pepe (9.4%), Floki (8.6%), and Bonk (8.2%). Furthermore, Pepe captured the most interest in Canada, accounting for 26.9% of all interest in the country. Interestingly, while Dogecoin pioneered the meme coin space, it generated only 61.1% of interest in Morocco and received only minor interest in the other countries surveyed. Overall, the report by CoinGecko shows that meme coins continue to gain popularity and are a force to be reckoned with in the cryptocurrency market. As new coins emerge and gain traction, it will be interesting to see how this market evolves and whether meme coins will continue to be a dominant trend in the cryptocurrency world.

42420606,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLPx,1683150074,"Bitcoin, Ether Decouple From Stocks: What's Next for Crypto After Fed Rate Hike?","A 14-month monetary tightening cycle that included 10 consecutive interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve has taken the federal funds rate to 5.25%, a level considered its probable stopping point.  While some market observers expect interest rates to increase another 25-50 basis points in future, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) “participants’ assessment of appropriate monetary policy” (aka the “Dot-Plot”), implies that 5.25% is appropriate.  The question for crypto markets is, “What’s next”?  Investors are ultimately concerned with the future value of the assets they own, more so than what affected that value in the past. Here are a few points worth considering.  First, volumes for BTC and ETH have been declining and trail their 20-day moving averages. The reduced activity implies that investors are staying on the sideline to a certain extent. As such, singular economic data points are having a muted impact on digital assets. Reduced activity also implies that BTC and ETH may trade within a range, absent asset specific catalyst. This scenario won’t provide a lot of immediate alpha, but also not a lot of downside misery.  Second, bitcoin and ether have largely decoupled from traditional assets. While bitcoin started 2023 with a daily correlation coefficient near 0.90 with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), those have all since declined to close to zero.  The lack of correlation between BTC and traditional assets implies that investors are viewing the impact of monetary policy differently for digital assets than for stocks, at least for the moment. BTC’s correlation with copper, the U.S. dollar and gold has declined as well.  It’s not abundantly evident what would cause such widespread decoupling, or how long it will remain. The re-emergence of BTC as an alternative to fiat currency debasement and ETH’s continued contracting supply are factors that may explain their separation from traditional assets.  Third, perpetual funding rates for BTC and ETH remain positive, an indication of bullishness. With the exception of sharp decline on the day of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, funding rates have been positive for the better part of 2023 for both cryptocurrencies.  Finally, “whales” are accumulating both bitcoin and ether. Their paths are different, but the supply held by addresses with more than 100,000 BTC and 100,000 ETH are moving higher. An interpretation of this trend is that entities with the most capital to deploy in crypto are allocating to both assets.  The trajectory for ETH appears to be a measured one, with a decline that began in September seemingly bottoming out on April 20. Bitcoin whales’ movements have been more dramatic, with sharp moves higher followed by declines.  All told, digital assets appear to have branched out on their own. While today’s economic news will have some impact on prices, the extent to which it does will likely differ from traditional financial assets.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/03/bitcoin-ether-decouple-from-stocks-whats-next-for-crypto-after-fed-rate-hike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b09283036e280f2bc41868412c584e1a1a00f40-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chastain was forced to resign from his role in September 2021 after allegations of insider trading spread across social media. Chastain was accused of abusing his position – which included selecting NFTs to feature on OpenSea’s homepage – to illegally profit.  Chastain made more than $50,000 from June 2021 to September 2021 by buying NFTs he knew would be featured on the company’s website on the cheap, and then selling them at inflated prices after the increased attention caused prices to jump, prosecutors alleged. Chastain attempted to conceal his purchases by using anonymous wallets and OpenSea accounts.  ""Nathanial Chastain exploited his advanced knowledge of which NFTs would be featured on OpenSea's website to make profitable trades for himself,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. ""Although this case involved novel trades in crypto assets, there was nothing particularly innovative about his conduct – it was fraud.""  Prosecutors in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York (SDNY) filed the wire fraud and money laundering charges against Chastain in June 2022. According to SDNY, the case against Chastain was the first insider trading case involving digital assets.  After attempting and failing to get the case dismissed on procedural grounds, Chastain went to trial in Manhattan on April 24.

12329297,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529762,1683147653,"Bitcoin Market in Disarray, But Optimism Prevails With Two Narratives","The price of Bitcoin has seen a small uptick during today’s trading session, but the cryptocurrency has been unable to break the sideways trend. Today, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a 25 basis points (bps) rate hike, but uncertainty in the financial world remains king. Related Reading: More Dip To Come: Bitcoin Liquidity On The Move Ahead Of Major Event As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $28,600 with sideways movement across the board. Other major cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market capitalization have experienced similar price action except for XRP and Cardano (ADA), which record small losses in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin Stun By Economic Uncertainty, But Bulls Could Take The Upper Hand According to a report from the trading desk QCP Capital, Bitcoin, and the crypto market have been in an 8 week long confusion phase. As a result, the nascent industry experienced a decline in its Implied Volatility (IV), leading to the current sideways price action. Volatility, as measured by the VIX Index, is crashing to levels last seen during the 2022 bearish phase. This dynamic might trigger an aggressive move in the coming weeks, but the direction of such price action is unclear. However, two key events could support Bitcoin in reclaiming higher levels. Both scenarios will operate on the macroeconomic board, which keeps exercising a strong influence over BTC and other financial assets. First, QCP Capital argues that in the next two months, the U.S. banking crisis will still be relevant, along with the debt ceiling in the country. These narratives create the perception that the fiat system is weak, which could lead to further bank runs. BTC Bull Run Imminent? Thus, the Fed must continue bailing out banking institutions and injecting liquidity into the financial markets. The debt ceiling presents a similar issue; the federal government might be forced to intervene because the U.S. is unlikely to default on its debt. As a result, more and more liquidity could enter financial markets allowing Bitcoin to breathe and resume its bullish momentum. According to QCP Capital, this phenomenon is already happening. Due to the banking crisis in the U.S., the Fed has been forced to intervene, increasing the side of its balance sheet by almost $500 billion over the past two weeks, as seen in the chart below. The Fed last injected this much liquidity during the COVID-19 crisis. At that time, the price of Bitcoin recorded a massive profit and entered price discovery for at least 12 months. The trading firm stated the following about BTC’s potential to see similar profits: The analog compares BTC price action now (red line) vs. BTC during the 2020 cycle (yellow line) by lining up the March 2020 and March 2022 lows. It shows that while we are likely in for a period of consolidation here, the underlying trend ahead is still strongly to the upside.

42420595,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLEb,1683147561,DeFi Protocol Curve Finance Deploys Native Stablecoin on Ethereum Mainnet,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance deployed its highly anticipated native stablecoin called crvUSD on the Ethereum mainnet Wednesday afternoon.  Blockchain data on Etherscan shows that the contract has minted a total of $20 million in crvUSD tokens in five transactions within five minutes. After the first tokens were minted, a crypto wallet labeled as Curve.Fi Team by blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence created a $1 million crvUSD loan using $1.8 million of frxETH, a type of ether (ETH) derivative token issued by DeFi protocol Frax Finance.  Curve confirmed the deployment on Twitter later in the afternoon.  The protocol’s governance token CRV has jumped up to 97 cents on the news, and is up 7% for the day, according to CoinDesk data.  The deployment marks a major milestone for rolling out Curve’s long-awaited stablecoin to the public. Curve, one of the largest decentralized marketplaces focusing on stablecoins, with some $5 billion of assets on the protocol, announced last year it started developing its own dollar-pegged stablecoin.  Curve’s stablecoin will face heavy competition as a slew of rival DeFi protocols issue are, or in the process of, developing their own native stablecoins to attract users and increase activity at a time when crypto trading and lending is flagging.  Aave, another giant DeFi protocol with some $7 billion of assets locked, deployed on testnet its native stablecoin GHO this February. Lending protocol MakerDAO issues the largest decentralized stablecoin, DAI, which has a $5 billion market capitalization.  The crvUSD stablecoin won’t be accessible to the public until later as it is not yet integrated into Curve’s user interface. An admin in the protocol’s official Telegram channel said the stablecoin’s public release is “waiting on front end,” which will come “soon.”  How Curve’s crvUSD work  Curve’s crvUSD is an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by crypto assets, according to the product’s whitepaper released by Curve in November. The token’s price is pegged to $1.  Curve will control the supply of crvUSD with a mint-and-burn mechanism similar to MakerDAO’s DAI or Aave’s forthcoming GHO. Investors can create crvUSD by a collateralized debt position (CDP), depositing digital assets in Curve’s smart contract as collateral. When the borrower closes its debt position to reclaim the collateral, Curve destroys (burns) crvUSD.  What differentiates crvUSD from competitors is its novel, lending-liquidating algorithm, called LLAMA, that constantly rebalances users’ collateral as crypto prices fluctuate, according to the whitepaper.  For example, when the price of the crypto asset posted as collateral falls below the liquidation level, the protocol will gradually convert the assets into crvUSD, and later will convert back to the collateral asset (de-liquidate) as the price recovers.  The mechanism offers a smoother, continuous liquidation process as opposed to a single, drastic event that sometimes causes turmoil and huge losses on lending protocols when cryptocurrency prices crash.  Additionally, the collateral is stored in an automated market maker (AMM) pool providing liquidity for people to trade against, instead of sitting in a vault or lending pool. “This makes the overall efficiency of the system high,” Dustin Teander, an analyst at crypto research firm Messari, said in a note.

The consensus EPS estimate is -$0.86 and the consensus revenue estimate is $653.3M (-43.7% Y/Y). Over the last 1 year, COIN has beaten EPS and revenue estimates 25% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 1 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 13 upward revisions and 4 downward. Regulators have been stepping up oversight of crypto firms, including Coinbase ( COIN ) which received a Wells notice from the SEC. Oppenheimer believes an SEC enforcement action can put ~35% of COIN's revenue at risk . CEO Brian Armstrong hinted at a possible relocation outside the U.S. if regulatory clarity does not improve. Coinbase ( COIN ) continues to expand internationally and just launched a crypto derivatives exchange in Bermuda. However, Coinbase's ( COIN ) trading volumes remain a cause for concern. Bank of America noted that transaction volumes roughly stalled from Q4 .

42420605,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLOv,1683146285,Bitcoin Falls Slightly After Fed Rate Hike,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped slightly to below $28,500 after the U.S. Federal Reserve did what was widely expected and raised interest rates by 25 basis points (bps). The increase sends the federal funds rate to a target range of between 5% and 5.25%.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $28,350, down about a percentage point over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  The Fed's decision on Wednesday marked the 10th rate hike in 14 months. In its statement accompanying the rate hike, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said that “tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation,” and that it would keep close attention to inflation risks.  In a press conference following the rate announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that although prices had “moderated somewhat since the middle of last year … ​​inflation pressures continue to run high and that the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go.”  Powell also said a decision on the rate hike pause “was not made today,” although he noted the current statement did not signal additional rate hikes as had previous statements. “The assessment of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by meeting,"" he said, noting uncertainties in credit conditions.  “It's possible we'll have what I hope will be a mild recession,” Powell added.  The CME FedWatch Tool showed that currently over 93% of traders see the central bank pausing its diet of rate hikes at the June policy meeting.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently rose roughly 0.3% to hover at around $1,878. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the overall crypto market performance, was down 1% for the day.  In an email to CoinDesk, Michael Safai, managing partner of crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital, said the latest Fed decision would likely lead to “mixed outcomes” for crypto traders. “While the language on future rate hikes was softened, the Fed left the door open by saying that future decisions will be macro data dependent. Inflation data is improving but it still isn’t rosy enough to excite crypto traders,” Safai said in an emailed comment.  “Crypto is quiet right now, which means that there isn’t enough exit velocity for the top 10 coins to break out of the macro correlation,” he added. ​​”Bitcoin and [ether] are more likely to be range-bound until we see some clue as to where inflation is going. The markets could be in for a bit of a slow summer if the economic recovery follows a measured pace.”  Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata, pointed out in an email prior to the Fed’s decision that there will be two consumer price index (CPI) inflation readings before the Fed's next meeting in mid-June, meaning the possibility of a hike remains on the table.  Magadini said BTC has been driven by macro events this year, with Wednesday’s rate hike priced in already.  Equity markets closed lower on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 edging down 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.  In bond markets, the note on the two-year Treasury yield recently dropped 12 basis points to sit at 3.86%, while the note on the 10-year Treasury yield fell 7 basis points to 3.35%.  Crypto investors have been struggling to understand the potential impact of recent bank failures and crypto regulatory feuding on markets.  “Bitcoin still remains anchored, unlikely to rally above the $30,000 level until the U.S. gets some regulatory clarity,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign-exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note.  Meanwhile, crypto data firm Kaiko’s chart showed that BTC and ETH’s 2% market depth, a metric for assessing liquidity conditions, has approached near one-year lows.  Dessislava Ianeva, research analyst at Kaiko, noted to CoinDesk that despite bitcoin’s more than 70% price gains this year, trade volume on centralized exchanges is lower than last year for the same period. She suggested that the low volume stemmed partly from “greater macro and regulatory uncertainty.”  “Market makers are still cautious about adding liquidity and have likely revised their risk management strategies,"" Ianeva said. She added that the liquidity gap that emerged after the collapse of exchange FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Research in November is “proving persistent.”  “Liquidity will, hopefully, return in time and critical mass will build in newer areas of the digital asset space. But until that happens – or a major headline reinforces or challenges crypto’s appeal – bitcoin will keep tracking the broader markets,” Dexterity Capital’s Safai said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/03/bitcoin-falls-slightly-after-fed-rate-hike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15eda0c4fd5e55b22dd8825ce9d01f811a64b659-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The paper valuation for the tokens is now worth $1 billion. The sale of the warrants and preferred stock is significant for FTX, providing additional funding to support its operations and expansion. FTX has been gaining traction in the cryptocurrency market, and the additional funding will undoubtedly help the company continue to grow and innovate. However, It is worth noting that the value of the tokens and preferred stock can only be realized if FTX relaunches.

Additionally, Cottonwood Grove Limited acquired a warrant to purchase 173,333,333 SUI Tokens, and FTX Trading Ltd. acquired a warrant to purchase 346,666,667 SUI Tokens. These warrants are only exercisable upon achieving certain milestones and events concerning the implementation of SUI protocols and trading SUI tokens on the FTX.com platform. On August 31, 2022, FTX Ventures Ltd. acquired an additional 7,000 shares of Preferred Stock in the Purchaser-Subject Company and a warrant to purchase 4,114,898 SUI Tokens. All of the SUI Token Warrants are only exercisable after the SUI Tokens are minted, generated, or created, if ever. The Preferred Stock and the SUI Token Warrants held by the sellers are referred to collectively as the “Interests.” FTX has now filed a court document outlining the sale of these Interests for cash consideration. The document states that the Interests are easily separated from the Debtors’ core operations. The sale of the Interests will not affect the Debtors’ ability to operate any of their businesses. In addition, any income that the Preferred Stock might generate in the form of dividends or distributions is uncertain and would only be received at the discretion of the Purchaser-Subject Company’s board of directors. What You Need To Know About SUI SUI Tokens are a digital asset created by Sui Foundation, a blockchain-based platform that aims to provide secure, transparent, and decentralized data management and storage solutions. The SUI Tokens are designed to be used within the Sui ecosystem, allowing users to access various services and applications. Furthermore, the SUI Tokens are based on the Ethereum blockchain and are ERC-20 compliant, meaning they can be easily integrated with other Ethereum-based applications. The tokens can be used to pay for services within the Sui ecosystem, such as data storage and data management, and can also be traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges. As reported by NewsBTC, the highly anticipated launch of SUI, a blockchain-based platform for secure and decentralized data management, is finally here. Dubbed the next “Ethereum killer,” SUI is expected to shake up the cryptocurrency market with its unique technical approach.

42420602,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLMr,1683142424,"RFK Jr. Raises Crypto Taxes, Regulation as Issues in Opening Days of 2024 Presidential Race","Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the latest presidential candidate and a member of one of the most famous U.S. political families, raised a number of crypto issues in his newly announced campaign to challenge President Joe Biden.  Kennedy – a Democrat, environmental lawyer, son of former U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew to President John F. Kennedy and former Sen. Ted Kennedy – has raised several points about the digital assets industry in the early days of the 2024 presidential contest.  On Twitter Wednesday, the candidate lambasted the Biden Administration’s proposal for an excise tax that would ultimately charge crypto mining operations 30% of their energy costs – an effort that cited environmental harms caused by the sector without any demonstrated benefit.  “It is a mistake for the U.S. government to hobble the industry and drive innovation elsewhere,” wrote Kennedy. “Biden’s proposed 30% tax on cryptocurrency mining is a bad idea.”  Some early polling has suggested Kennedy – whose father ran for president in 1968 but was assassinated – is reaching into the double digits as a Democratic primary challenger for Biden. Known as a vocal critic of vaccinations, Kennedy has also been noted for his crypto enthusiasm in the past. Those views have quickly re-emerged from the candidate, who was announced Tuesday as a speaker at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami Beach, Florida, later this month.  Earlier this week, he also argued that U.S. financial regulators are waging “an extra-legal war on crypto” that has damaged the banking system. In a statement last month, he weighed in on the debate over central bank digital currencies (CBDC), saying such government-backed tokens are “the ultimate mechanisms for social surveillance and control.”  That staunch anti-CBDC view echoes that of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely expected to run as a Republican candidate in 2024.  In these first days of the 2024 campaign, the earliest candidates – frequently filing in the hopes of dominating political discussions before the leading candidates officially enter the ring – often fizzle out. It’s uncertain whether Kennedy’s name recognition will establish his place among leading Democrats, although one recent candidate with no political background did very well when he ran for president: Donald Trump.

42420588,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqL9R,1683142362,Coinbase Losses Expected to Narrow; Analysts Seek Details About International Exchange,"Traders of U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) will likely get some relief when the company reports first-quarter earnings for 2023 on Thursday.  Coinbase is expected to show a slight increase of roughly 8% in revenue compared to the previous quarter, according to forecasts from FactSet. In January, the exchange reported revenue of $605 million in Q4 of 2022; projections for this quarter are for $655 million.  The earnings report will also likely show a quarterly loss of $1.45 per share. Trading volume for the period ending March 31 is estimated to be $148 million, up from $146 in Q4, FactSet projects.  “We estimate Q1 saw volume remain nearly flat quarter over quarter, which would be the first quarter since the crypto boom unwound that Coinbase's quarterly volume did not decline,” Needham senior analyst John Todaro wrote in a report. “ This gives us optimism that retail volume could have bottomed.”  Needham lowered its 2023 year-end revenue estimate slightly to $3.44 billion from $3.66 billion, citing “a slower recovery than initially projected” and disappointment in volume that “has not risen proportionately to crypto prices,” the report said.  Cryptocurrencies across the board have benefited from a new wave of risk-off sentiment since the recent banking crisis, with mistrust in traditional finance sparking the renewed interest in digital assets. Bitcoin (BTC) broke above $30,000 on April 10 for the first time since June 10, 2022. It was recently trading at $28,600, up 74% year to date.  Investors have been particularly interested in Coinbase’s recent unveiling of its derivatives exchange in Bermuda, which is part of the company’s expansion outside the U.S., because it could have a positive impact on revenues coming from fees. The initiative comes as regulators crack down on crypto companies in the country.

They added: “Our checks indicate that crypto activity outside the U.S. tends to skew more heavily towards retail users, which would be supportive of the aggregate fee rate earned on these contracts.”  Coinbase’s international exchange will allow traders to bet on the price of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) via perpetual futures contracts with up to five times leverage, a popular form of derivatives trading that is illegal in the U.S. because of its high risks.  “Perpetual futures trading accounts for around 75% of global trading volume,” Owen Lau, senior analyst at Oppenheimer, told CoinDesk TV. “If they can expand that and take some market share, it will be incremental.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/03/coinbase-losses-expected-to-narrow-analysts-seek-details-about-international-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eea95d2033abf79ee83c52fa1b406df5ca97dfd-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Just moments before the monetary-policy decision, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) changed hands modestly lower at $28.58K, losing steam from the rally in the previous session. The coin then slightly extended its downward spiral to $28.39K, down 1.1% , as of 3:25 p.m. ET. The broader stock market, meantime, swung between gains and losses as the U.S. central bank softened its forward guidance , signaling a possible pause in its rate increases after ratcheting up rates by 500 basis points in 15 months. Even so, persistently high core inflation and a still-tight labor market (demand exceeding supply) could mean further hikes are on the horizon, as the Fed seeks to lower inflation to its 2% target. A minority share of traders expected the Fed to pause rates in May given the recent stresses in the banking system, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized in his post-monetary decision presser that ""conditions have broadly improved"" in the banking sector since the turmoil emerged in March. He also said the Fed won't have to raise rates as high as it might have without the increased credit tightening from the banking stresses. ""We on the committee have a view that inflation is going to come down not so quickly... If that's right, it's not appropriate to cut rates,"" Powell noted.

42420598,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLGf,1683141558,"Aragon Bans at Least 6 DAO Members During Treasury Discussion, Alleging ‘Coordinated’ Assault","Decentralized governance project Aragon banished at least half a dozen community members from its town square this week as a discussion of the project’s finances turned sour and tipped into conspiracy.  “Coordinated” actors flooded Aragon’s Discord server with “probing questions” and “inappropriate language” on Tuesday, Aragon’s head of communications, Jessica Smith, told CoinDesk in an email. The influx of chatter and new members came during a pivotal but long-delayed effort to move Aragon’s sizable treasury under community control.  “We have reason to believe these actors are coordinated and connected to past governance interventions in other DAOs,” Smith said, without elaborating on either claim. “Therefore, we decided to act swiftly but temporarily to keep our community safe.”  Aragon’s response was to exile a raft of community members that had questioned its leadership, processes and status as a bona fide decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). CoinDesk spoke to seven community members caught up in the ban, most of whom said they were investors in ANT (and therefore DAO members), months-long members of the Discord or both.  By smashing the banhammer button on its own voters, Aragon highlighted the uneasy tension between the “power to the people” illusion of a DAO and the reality that a few stakeholders often wield outsize influence. Aragon’s Discord moderators have the power to set (or rejigger) the conversation by banning dissenters and deleting their opinions, actions anathema to the idea of “censorship-resistant” cryptocurrency.  Aragon’s DAO building DAOs  Aragon builds software to support DAOs, crypto clubs where token owners have a say in business decisions. Aragon’s own community of ANT holders voted nearly a year ago to have more direct influence over how the project spends its treasury, which holds cryptocurrencies worth more than $70 million.  The transfer has been anything but smooth. After months of delays and slow-walking, Aragon’s power brokers on Tuesday finally started moving money into a new structure under DAO control. Around the same time its moderators began banning seemingly anyone who questioned the project and its leadership.  In an email Smith asserted the banned members had a history of “similar incidents” in other DAOs. She declined to provide further information on why Aragon believed the alleged behavior was being conducted by “coordinated” actors, but she said the intel came from a “trusted source.”  The ROOK Connection  One common thread: Every banned member that CoinDesk spoke to is also a member of ROOK, which last month dissolved its DAO after activist investors called for the project to return capital to its token holders. This happened through a series of votes pertaining to its on-chain treasury.  Smith said membership in ROOK DAO “was not the basis for the decision.”  A Rook and Aragon DAO member who goes by the screen name CollinM11 said in a Twitter message that the mass ban started after a prominent member of the Rook community tipped Aragon’s Discord into a discussion of risk-free value, or RFV, better known in traditional finance (TradFi) circles as “book value.”  “Basically, it is used in [decentralized finance, or DeFi] when a token has a larger treasury than market cap,” said the activist investor with the screen name Wismerhill, who championed Rook DAO’s collapse. “Aka team is either destroying value/or siphoning DAO controlled resources to the end of time.”  Wismerhill said there are “zero similitudes between” Rook, a project whose product development has been stagnant for months, and Aragon, which is actively building and also has mechanisms to return value to its token holders. “Aragon is only interesting because they could do buybacks” of ANT tokens, he said.  Wismerhill said he “got immediately banned while typing” after logging into the Discord Tuesday to catch up on the drama.  Even so, not all of the exiles are as notorious as Wismerhill. Others are only occasional posters who said they were asking well-intentioned if pointed questions about Aragon’s timeline. After all, the treasury transfers were first authorized nearly a year ago.  Smith said the bans are temporary but did not give a timeline on reinstatement.

42420597,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLIj,1683140432,Crypto Philanthropy 101: What Donors and Organizations Need to Know,"Nonprofits are continually tasked with finding new ways to make philanthropy cool – if, at times, a little kitschy. From mail-in sweepstakes to 24-hour walkathons, grabbing and sustaining the attention of donors is a heavy lift.  Cryptocurrency donations offer a novel approach to philanthropy. According to some leaders in the Web3 space, nonprofits won’t have to work very hard to convince crypto investors to donate; they are already eager.  “Donating crypto is a win/win,” said Alicia Maule, digital engagement director at The Innocence Project and co-founder and CEO of Givepact, a crypto fundraising platform for nonprofits. “People who have accumulated crypto want to give to their favorite organizations. They don't have the cash to give, but they have crypto.”  We saw this in March 2022, when just months after the peak of the 2021 bull run, thousands of people sent close to $7 million in crypto to Ukraine to bolster the country’s resistance against Russian invasion. Additionally, according to The Giving Block, a crypto donations company, at least 1,000 organizations last year donated $125 million worth of cryptocurrencies using the company’s platform. The Giving Block now expects crypto donations to surpass $10 billion over the next 10 years.  It’s therefore smart for individual investors, fund managers and nonprofit organizations to learn how to donate and/or receive crypto as a charitable gift.  Before you donate: Consider taxes  Perhaps the most obvious consideration regarding crypto donations is taxes. Similar to cash, donations made via cryptocurrencies are tax-deductible. In addition, donating a portion of digital assets as charitable gifts can help profitable crypto investors avoid the capital gains taxes they would otherwise incur if they were to convert the crypto to U.S. dollars (USD) and donate the equivalent amount in cash.  Robbie Heeger, president and CEO of the crypto philanthropy institution Endaoment, says the tax benefits associated with crypto donations, along with newly minted wealth generated by crypto in recent years, are creating a “rising tide” in a sector that normally attracts older donors. He encourages the “new, young crop of people who feel like they've been carried by the rising tide [of crypto]” to give back, but also to remember to pay attention to the tax benefits, which may not be as ingrained as with older donors.  As for organizations, U.S.-based nonprofits that qualify for tax-exempt status with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can generally expect to avoid paying capital gains taxes if the crypto’s value increases between the time the gift was received and when it was sold or converted back into USD.  Ways to donate crypto  Philanthropic DAOs  DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, are innovative models for pooling and distributing cryptocurrency using blockchain technology, both as a financial infrastructure and governance instrument. DAOs are both transparent and community-run, creating the conditions for what Endaoment Chief Operating Officer Zach Bronstein once called “the highest form of organizational decentralization of which we can currently conceive.”  DAOs are comparable (though not perfectly) to a donor-advised fund or a community foundation in the fiat world, with some distinctions. Individuals can join a DAO through a variety of methods, as every DAO has unique membership requirements. Some require donation minimums, while others are token-gated, meaning members become active by purchasing a non-fungible token (NFT), the proceeds of which go toward the DAO treasury. In nearly every case, DAO membership requires active participation in community channels (such as Discord), regular meeting attendance and voting.  With no executive authority or centralized board, DAOs are generally managed through a multisignature crypto wallet that tracks fiscal activity on the blockchain. In addition, most transactions, including any donations made by the DAO, happen via smart contract – a type of computer code that executes when certain terms and conditions are met. This level of transparency and automation facilitates what’s known among Web3 advocates as a “trustless” environment. DAO members vote on the terms of the smart contracts, influencing how donations get used, and because the data is stored on chain, members and donors alike can verify that the DAO is living up to its mission and guidelines.  CowgirlDAO, the philanthropic arm of the art activism community, Computer Cowgirls, is one example of a charitable DAO. Founder and artist Molly Dickson donated the smart contract and artwork from her second NFT collection to Endaoment, which provides a platform for collecting crypto and sending it to qualifying organizations. Endaoment receives all proceeds from Dickson’s NFT sales, but it is the CowgirlDAO community who votes on which charities will receive funds, with a focus on organizations that provide abortion access to individuals.  Gitcoin, one of the most beloved crypto-for-public-good communities in the space, has been operating since 2017 and has reportedly distributed over $50 million to projects focused on decentralized finance (DeFi), climate solutions, open-source technology and more. With over 21,000 members in its Discord, the community operates like a DAO and has 190 devoted delegates overseeing and stewarding funds. Notably, Gitcoin uses a published formula known as Quadratic Funding, which it explains in detail on its website, to determine grantees democratically. Anyone can donate to Gitcoin through the website.  Crypto donation platforms  For individual donors and nonprofit organizations not interested in forming or contributing to a DAO, there are a few straightforward options that let people donate crypto directly.  The Giving Block  Who it’s for:  Qualifying nonprofits that want to receive crypto  Individuals who want to donate crypto to qualifying nonprofits  Cryptos accepted: Over 200 including BTC and ETH  Credit card donations accepted? Yes  How it works: For individual donors, giving through The Giving Block is as simple as heading to its website, clicking “Donate Crypto” and searching a database of thousands of nonprofits to find the one you’d like to support.  To receive crypto, nonprofits must sign up with Gemini, a U.S.-based centralized crypto exchange co-founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Because Gemini operates within the U.S., participating organizations must comply with its know-your-business (KYB) and onboarding processes, which takes a couple of days and some paperwork. Once set up, organizations can receive crypto directly through The Giving Block’s website. Gifts will show up in their new Gemini accounts and will automatically be converted to USD.  In some instances, which co-founder Pat Duffy calls “fringe cases,” donors can send less straightforward types of crypto donations, such as NFTs, through The Giving Block’s partnership with Renaissance Charitable, a conduit 501(c)(3) that facilitates non-cash donations for nonprofit organizations. Inquire directly if you have any questions regarding this.  A word from the co-founder: More millennials and young people need to think like “50-plus-year-old white guys,” said Duffy — and by that he means we all should take advantage of the tax benefits of donating assets to philanthropic organizations instead of cash. As most high-net-worth people know, donating assets helps one avoid capital gains taxes, thereby freeing up more money to save, donate or spend in ways we feel good about.  “If you have $1 million dollars sitting in a bank account, and $1 million in crypto, and you're thinking about giving to a charity, you could give your Bitcoin or Ethereum over the dollars,” he explained.  Endaoment  Who’s it for:  Qualifying nonprofits that want to receive crypto  Charitable DAOs, individuals or organizations that want to start a crypto community fund  Individuals who want to donate crypto to qualifying nonprofits  Cryptos accepted: ETH and over 1,000 other cryptocurrencies  Credit card donations accepted? No  How it works: Endaoment is a nonprofit community foundation and public charity built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows anyone to donate their digital assets to any qualified 501(c)(3) U.S. nonprofit organization.  The Endaoment team considers itself something of a Community Fund for DeFi projects. Individuals can create a Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) on the Ethereum Mainnet via the Endaoment app, donate directly to any qualifying organization or simply join the Endaoment Discord to ask questions and get involved.  A word from the CEO: While crypto runs on the gospel of trustlessness, Endaoment’s decision to operate as a community foundation introduces some oversight into the otherwise trustless protocol, Heeger explained.  “The interesting thing about the nonprofit space is that there are components of the interaction that you want to be completely trustless and fully anonymous. And then, there are components where you want some level of trust,” He said.  According to Heeger, the actual paying out of any crypto that moves through Endaoment’s platform is subject to the board of director’s approval.  “You want to know the organization that you're interacting with is reputable, that they do what they say they do in their filings with the government and that they are not presently funding acts of violence, misinformation campaigns, hate speech or hate activity,” he said. “We take that really, really seriously.”  Givepact  Who’s it for:  Individuals who want to donate crypto to qualifying nonprofits – and build a reputation that flaunts their donor history  Cryptos accepted: BTC, ETH and certain ERC-20 tokens  Credit card donations accepted? Yes  How it works: While other crypto donation platforms sprung up quickly to capture activity from 2021’s bull run, Givepact is launching in 2023 to give crypto donors a “deeper and richer experience than what people are used to,” explained Steven Aguiar, Givepact co-founder and chief operating officer.  After all, Web3 communities value gamification, community and ongoing social engagement. In a future where consumers’ identities and social reputations are linked to their crypto wallets, Maule and Aguiar expect donors will appreciate crypto-native rewards structures and collectibles that signal their values and passions.  Similar to proof-of-attendance-protocols (POAP), or digital collectibles redeemed by attendees for participating in a special event, Givepact is considering new ways to let donors see and display their philanthropic history on-chain in order to make giving “addictive.”  A word from the cofounders: “We know that people are going to give because they care and for tax reasons,” said Maule. “But we also know that we have this very energized NFT audience that may now consider philanthropy part of their identity. They're doing it already but to now have a platform rewarding them, we think that's going to put good impact at the center of community and culture.”  Pitfalls to avoid  Practically speaking, the most immediate pitfall for nonprofits that want to receive crypto is market volatility. Every organization that plans to accept crypto donations should decide whether they plan to hold onto their crypto, transfer it to stablecoins or sell it immediately for local fiat currency. While holding crypto might result in a return, it could also bring losses.  For donors, obvious pitfalls may include theft, scams or sending money to a bad actor. Some worry that normalizing the use of crypto for charitable donations or mutual aid creates opportunities for scammers, who could create fake charities and request donations in the form of crypto.  “We've seen situations in the wake of crises where people spin up [crypto] wallet addresses or ‘DAOs’ to support humanitarian causes. Those wallet addresses get shared on Twitter and Discord, but no one really ultimately knows where the money is going,” said Aguiar.  Risks of getting scammed are particularly high when individuals send money directly from one self-custody crypto wallet to another without first vetting the recipient. Last year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a consumer alert cautioning people against this tactic, stating that dishonest people were capitalizing on crypto donations to Ukraine and tricking people into sending money to their personal wallet addresses. Keep in mind, self-custody crypto wallets do not have a customer service department. You can’t get a refund if you send your money to a bad wallet.  Last week, the U.K. Charity Commission published new guidance for nonprofit organizations planning to accept crypto donations, with a particular focus on tax compliance and precautions against money laundering.  As with all crypto decisions, beware the hype and do your research before donating to anonymous wallets. Look for clearly defined guidelines, professional websites and, when possible, the Etherscan name or address to verify the activity of the organization you are donating to matches what it claims publicly. If using one of the platforms listed above, read the FAQs thoroughly, and don’t be afraid to contact team members directly with any outstanding questions.  Finally, when the IRS comes calling, be prepared with a clear log of your transactions, noting any capital gains or losses during each taxable event.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/crypto-philanthropy-101-what-donors-and-organizations-need-to-know,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0151d7b45e3bd2a694ee1cc23d782f8d953642f2-5919x3331.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin 1-Year Inactive Supply Has Continued To Go Up Recently According to a post from the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the 1-year inactive supply hit a high back in March of this year. The “1-year inactive supply” is an indicator that measures the total percentage of the Bitcoin supply that hasn’t moved on the blockchain since at least one year ago. This supply belongs to one of the two major cohorts in the BTC market: the “long-term holders” (LTHs). This group includes all investors who bought their coins more than six months ago, so the 1-year inactive supply metric doesn’t measure their entire supply, only a segment of it (although a rather large one). The LTHs hold a special place in the Bitcoin economy as they comprise the most resolute investors in the market. The selling and buying behavior of this cohort can, therefore, have long-term implications for the sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Inflows Of $505M Into Binance, Sign Of Selling? Here is a chart that shows how the 1-year inactive BTC supply has changed over the lifetime of the cryptocurrency and how it has seemingly taken its place in the different price cycles: Looks like the value of the metric has been on the rise in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin 1-year inactive supply has historically trended up during the bear markets. This means these investors generally participate in accumulation in the leadup to and during the bear markets. The LTHs then continue to hold onto their filled-up bags and expand as they transition toward a bullish period. These investors show this behavior throughout the bull market buildup phase; when the rally starts reaching its last stages, these holders start selling to take their profits. This pattern has repeated throughout the different cycles, showing that the LTHs’ behavior hasn’t changed too much. However, one thing that differs between the cycles is that their supply has been going up overall. This would partly be attributed to all the Bitcoin that has been getting lost due to wallet keys becoming inaccessible. Related Reading: $24,400 May Be Next Major Level Of Support For Bitcoin, Here’s Why The percentage of the circulating supply held by this Bitcoin investor segment hit an all-time high just back in March of this year, reaching a value north of 67%. These investors have shed some coins since then, but the difference in their supplies between then and now is negligible (13.1 million BTC vs. 13 million BTC). The April 2019 rally, which resembles the current one, also saw the LTHs holding tight until midway through the rally, when they started selling, and the cryptocurrency reached the top just a while later. Suppose the Bitcoin price and the 1-year inactive supply will follow the same pattern in this current rally as during all these past bullish periods. In that case, it seems likely that the top hasn’t been hit since the LTHs haven’t started participating in any significant distribution yet.

42420600,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLJl,1683139345,"In the 'Stablecoin Olympics,' No Winner Will Take All","April was full of stablecoin politics, perpetuating the idea of a global race to tokenize cash. In my opinion, this is not a single race – it’s a competition across several disciplines. We should cheer for the right to compete freely rather than for one winner.  Mid-April, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee proposed a bill to regulate fiat-backed payment stablecoins while restricting any other backing mechanisms, and instructing the Fed to study the digital dollar. Fast forward to last week, when Republican presidential candidates rallied against the idea of a digital dollar, calling it a China-inspired surveillance tool.  Dea Markova is a managing director and head of digital assets at Forefront Advisers.  In Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) is losing political support for the digital euro. Yet, the ECB declared last Monday that its investigation phase is progressing at pace towards an October deadline. Being ahead of the U.S. and U.K. has forced Europe to face some of the really tough CBDC questions: Can you roll out a public tokenized instrument at a large scale? What is a feasible commercial model? What are the use cases? How is privacy safeguarded?  Although privacy gets tossed around like a political hot potato, the other three questions are, in my opinion, much harder to answer. For the avoidance of doubt, with just a few months left on the ECB timeline, they have not been answered convincingly.  Also in April, Société Genéralé launched a euro stablecoin on Ethereum, available to know-your-customered (KYC) institutional clients and giving them direct access to their locked collateral. EUR CoinVertable will be credit-rated. A day later, the crypto developer community criticized SocGen for embedding functions that allow it to empty their clients' wallets, and which require a centralized validation of each transaction – you know, like a bank does.  Read more: Dea Markova – Is Europe’s MiCA a Template for Global Crypto Regulation?  Meanwhile, banks around the globe are looking for models to tokenize their deposits in a way that somehow gels with KYC requirements and makes sense for deposit guarantees. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggested in early April that the best way to do so was in two steps.  Step one: Give up on the idea of stablecoins as bearer instruments. The logic that “he who holds it, owns it” cannot work with KYC rules, it said.  Step two: Tokenize deposits and replicate the commercial bank settlement system via a wholesale CBDC. That way you avoid the issue of converting, say, ING coin to HSBC coin, said the BIS.  The Bank of England thinks tokenized deposits are “regulatorily simpler” (aka a good thing) and that a bank had better issue stablecoins from a separate entity. Pay attention to the latter.  These recent developments are great examples of the strengths and weaknesses of the various types of tokenized money we have emerging. We have four credible options on the table – fiat-backed, nonbank-issued stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, fiat-backed bank-issued stablecoins such as EUR CoinVertable, CBDCs and tokenized deposits.  They are all competing for market share, and the race will only intensify as the contenders gain maturity. Politicians are often tempted to talk of a winner-takes-it-all scenario. For the ECB, that winner is the digital euro.  I would argue this is not a race. We are watching the ""Stablecoin Olympics,"" with contenders competing across different disciplines. Not one is equipped to win them all at the same time.  The disciplines are five: trust, credit risk, interoperability, cyber risk and profitability.  Trust is the Olympic event that CBDCs can win most convincingly. While concerns with privacy and surveillance come up loudly, the vast majority of the market would agree that the central bank is the institution in a country which they trust the most. The nations where this faith is thin are exceptions. That is why banks in Europe are so worried that if they could, depositors would rather keep their savings with the ECB. The ECB, in particular, is also spending a good amount of effort on privacy protections.  Credit risk is a closely linked discipline. Stablecoins carry the risk of wherever their reserve funds are held. Commercial banks carry their own risk. CBDCs carry the risk of the sovereign. I would watch this space for credit scoring as a way to predict who gets the medals.  The interoperability race, for now, goes to private stablecoins. They are the most liquid instrument on the market. Circle, issuer of USDC, just launched a cross-chain protocol, too. Most institutional projects utilize permissioned ledgers, which by definition limit access and interoperability. As the BIS research flags, there are also significant design complexities to interoperability between tokenized deposits.  The cyberattack event is too close to call. The choice of a ledger, whether open or proprietary, proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, makes all the difference. Many in the community would contest that the Bitcoin blockchain is the safest one out there if safety is the ultimate goal. In European Union regulation, both stablecoin issuers and banks will be subject to a cyber law called DORA. Hence, the operational resilience safeguards applicable to their choice of technology will be the same.  Last but not least is profitability. A sustainable form of future money has to be profitable for its issuers – unless it is a subsidized public utility. In a high interest rate environment, this is less of an issue. Stablecoin reserves are, or will be when regulated, predominantly in government bonds. In a low-interest environment, however, it is currently much easier to see how tokenized deposits can make money on the banks’ fractional reserves model.  The Stablecoin Olympics will progress driven by regulatory choices and organizational behaviors. Some structures are set to innovate faster, others to risk manage better. Politics and perceptions matter for partnerships and financial stability. As consumers, our best outcome is to arrive at a marketplace of tokenized cash, where we get to pick our champion based on our use case.",NEUTRAL,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,Dea Markova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/03/in-the-stablecoin-olympics-no-winner-will-take-all,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43f2a074277ebb222ea13dd67958eccacf7cc915-4071x2446.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420620,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLS1,1683138187,Crypto’s Macro Drivers – It’s Not Just About Bitcoin,"This week, to no one’s great surprise, we saw another 25 basis point (bp) hike in the federal funds rate. The raise itself is not that significant – background noise, if you will. We’re all used to this by now. What is noteworthy about this one is that there is a strong likelihood it will be the last. This is a very big deal for the whole crypto market, not just for bitcoin (BTC).  Below, I dive into why I think this week’s will be the last U.S. interest rate hike, why this is good news for bitcoin and why the tailwind extends to other crypto assets as well.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Last week, preliminary U.S. GDP came in at 1.1% quarter-on-quarter growth, much lower than the expected 2.0%, and lower still than the fourth quarter’s downward revision of 2.6%. The bulk of the disappointment was due to weak inventory build, with defense and consumer spending accounting for most of what little growth there was. Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending jumped 3.7% in Q1, much higher than the previous quarter’s 1.0% increase. Bear in mind that this increase is after one of the steepest rate hike campaigns ever.  This is, unfortunately, reflected in inflation data. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation index of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) ex-food and energy (known as core PCE) for Q1 increased by 4.9%, more than the consensus estimate of 4.7% and than Q4’s 4.4%. The more granular core PCE reading for March, released on Friday, did not show a startling increase, but nor did it decline, coming in at a steady 0.3%, or 4.6% on a year-on-year basis. Again, frustrating resilience after almost five percentage points of interest rate hikes in 12 months.  So, because higher interest rates do not seem to be working, does that mean the Fed will need to raise them even more? Not necessarily. As the Fed has often reminded us, the data moves with long and variable lags, with no guidance as to what “long” means. There are signs that the acceleration in core prices seen in Q1 is trailing off. In addition to the March figure, we have the Cleveland Fed’s Inflation Nowcast, which models April core PCE steady at just over 4.6%. This could encourage the Fed to choose to wait and see if more impact starts to show up, which it is likely to do.  For now, this likelihood is not obvious. On Friday, we saw the employment cost index for Q1 come in at a slight increase of 1.2% quarter on quarter. This is the Fed’s preferred employment cost gauge because it takes benefits as well as wages into account and is therefore not distorted by employment shifts among occupations or industries. The uptick was only 0.1 percentage points, but that it was there at all is concerning, and the year-on-year increase was 4.8%, well above the target inflation rate of 2%.  But there are signs the employment market is cooling. Thursday’s U.S. continuing jobless claims held on to the increase seen at the beginning of April, with the most recent four readings up more than 6% from the preceding four. The wave of layoffs depressing our headlines suggests this figure is likely to keep heading up.  Furthermore, one thing that jumps out when looking at charts of the unemployment rate over time is that when it starts to move up, it does so suddenly and quickly. The tightening credit outlook will further constrain economic growth as companies struggle to refinance, leading to even more layoffs, and the impact on demand will exacerbate the painful momentum.  Aware of these trends, I believe it is likely that the Fed will pause rate hikes at the June Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and then hold steady for some time as higher rates start to do their damage. We shouldn’t forget that reported economic data is backward-looking. The U.S. Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index dropped by 1.2% in March, more than double February’s decline. This downward trend should continue as the consequences of tighter bank credit roll through the economy, punctuated by damage done to balance sheets from falling collateral values. Dark clouds are gathering.  What this means for bitcoin  If the Fed does pause in June, this would be good for bitcoin, as it implies an easing of financial conditions.  While the rates themselves may not change, expectations of cuts on the rapidly approaching horizon should be enough to move the liquidity needle – with the exception of the 1960s, an extended pause after a series of hikes has always been followed by cuts. What’s more, financial conditions are not just defined by the rate of fed funds: they are also influenced by bank profits and policies, the oil price, the level of the dollar, fiscal policy and the credit outlook around the world, among other factors.  Indeed, while the Chicago Fed national financial conditions index – which looks at U.S. capital markets as well as shadow banking – shows a tighter environment than a couple of years ago, it is heading down, which means more market liquidity.  This matters for bitcoin because it is one of the most sensitive assets to changes in overall liquidity. You no doubt often hear that “risk assets” benefit from looser monetary conditions. Well, bitcoin is the ultimate “risk asset” in that respect:  It is long duration, which means that its implied value is entirely derived from its eventual price (i.e., no dividends or coupon payments).  It has no earnings or credit rating vulnerability.  It is untethered to the real economy except through the impact of liquidity flows.  We can expect BTC to continue to act as a liquidity barometer, as it did in January and again in March, once the Fed’s interest rate policy settles down into wait-and-see mode. And liquidity is likely to head up once peak rates are in and as the looming recession becomes increasingly obvious.  What this means for other crypto assets  While bitcoin is the most “macro” of all crypto assets, the macro environment also influences other crypto assets, in different ways.  Bitcoin is still the anchor asset for the crypto market, with an increasing dominance (percentage of total market cap) and a high correlation with other tokens. In other words, what happens to bitcoin affects sentiment throughout the market cap table.  It does so through increased attention to the entire ecosystem, which encourages new businesses as well as their funding. A rising BTC price justifies investment in market infrastructure and crypto asset services, which in turn supports access to and liquidity of other assets. Where BTC goes, the market tends to follow.  What’s more, once funds are comfortable with an allocation to BTC, many will look for even higher return opportunities, which means heading out on the risk curve. This tends to be encouraged by easing financial conditions, with potential gains more than compensating the cost of leverage.  There’s also the special case of ether (ETH), which is more directly impacted by macro yields. Currently, staking on the Ethereum network earns approximately 5% in rewards, not taking into account any price appreciation. This is less attractive to macro investors when U.S. government bonds offer similar yields with no risk but, as these come down, the equation changes. What’s more, ETH’s relatively stable yield comes with the potential of upside. Now that staking is flexible after the recent Shapella upgrade, macro investors are more likely to consider ETH in relation to other steady-income opportunities, especially if it is seen as a window into greater ecosystem participation.  An inflection point  While the macro economic outlook and probable path of monetary policy is at one of its most uncertain moments in recent history, a step back to look at the entire investment landscape can reveal pockets of opportunity as well as highlight narratives that did not exist the last time the global economy found itself in a similar position. For the first time, we have assets that do not depend on considerations from the traditional economy for their operation, and that embody a range of emerging use cases that in turn lend resilience to investment theses.  All economic cycles have certain patterns that tend to repeat – that’s one of the reasons they’re called “cycles.” Crypto markets have cycles, too, only these in the past have been driven mainly by crypto-specific factors. Not any more – now the crypto market has multiple drivers, making the narratives more complex while opening up the market to new investing cohorts.  This should not only continue to close the gap between the crypto and macro landscapes; it should also shine even more attention on crypto assets’ unique characteristics.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/03/cryptos-macro-drivers-its-not-just-about-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc679f93ea69ae10f351f3c2bd7ce6f3eb8b3cf2-4128x2752.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420589,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLAT,1683136916,"Federal Reserve Raises Fed Funds Rate by 25 Basis Points, Signals Possible Pause","The U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) continued its year-plus string of rate hikes on Wednesday, lifting the fed funds rate by 25 basis points to a targeted range of 5%-5.25%.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) held steady in the immediate aftermath of the news, trading at about $28,600.  The Fed's move was widely expected, but investors and traders were awaiting the accompanying policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference (beginning at 2:30 p.m. ET) for clues about whether the central bank was mulling a pause after an historic run of rate hikes that's taken the fed funds rate from 0% in early 2022 to today's 5%-5.25%.  The policy statement was notable for leaving out prior language that suggested continuing rate hikes were a certainty. The statement did take note of ""tighter credit conditions"" as weighing on the economy going forward, and said the FOMC will ""take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.""  While inflation has fallen from nearly a double-digit pace one year ago to the current level of about 5%, it remains well above the Fed's 2% target, suggesting further tightening of monetary policy is necessary.  The Fed, however, is fighting a two-front war, with its rate hikes possibly having helped expose balance sheet issues at a number of U.S. banks. This past weekend came the latest in a series of lender failures, with the nation's 12th-largest bank by assets, First Republic (FRC), requiring a joint rescue by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and JPMorgan (JPM).  A decision to pause rate hikes was not made today, said Powell at his press conference following the FOMC meeting. We are prepared to more to contain inflation, he added.

However, contrary to expectations, SUI has recorded a significant plunge in price as the trading went live on multiple exchanges. Over the past 4 hours since its launch, the token has declined by more than 30%. This price action disappointed traders who expected the token to only record a continuous upward trend following its launch, as often happens during these events. Trading Goes Live On Exchanges The token is now live on major exchanges in the crypto market, such as Binance, KuCoin, ByBit, and so on. The token can now be bought and sold against other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, including Bitcoin, USDT, TUSD, EUR, BNB, and TRY. Related Reading: New “Ethereum Killer” SUI Launches Today, What You Need To Know According to a Binance blog post about the SUI listing, traders will not pay maker fees on SUI/USDT until further announcements. Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu reported that the official team behind the SUI coin has demanded that exchanges should not launch SUI-based perpetual futures contracts. However, exchanges, including, Bybit, OKX, and KuCoin, launched several SUI trading pairs. SUI Plunges Over 30% Interestingly, the token has declined by over 30% following its trading launch on various crypto exchanges after its initial surge of over 1,000% at launch. The newborn asset currently trades for $1.53 at the time of writing down by 35%. SUI currently has a 24-low of $1.33 and a 24-high of $3.34, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Regardless of the market decline, the asset’s trading volume is still up and at a value of nearly $1 million, according to CoinMarketCap. SUI is a blockchain project that aims to create a decentralized platform for secure and efficient data storage and management. It was launched in 2020 by a team of blockchain experts who sought to address the limitations of traditional data storage systems, such as high costs, centralization, and vulnerability to cyber threats. The blockchain is based on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which allows users to stake their tokens to participate in the network’s validation process and earn rewards for their contributions. Though several factors could be tied to the plummet in SUI following its launch on exchanges. However, a few reasons could be the supply and demand dynamics and traders’ and investors’ disappointment. Related Reading: SuiPad – MystenLabs Official Launchpad Partner, secured $1.155 million in funding When a new crypto launches on an exchange, there may be an influx of sell orders as early investors and traders try to take profits.

And if the buying pressure is not strong enough to absorb these sell orders, the price is bound to drop. In addition, some traders and investors may have speculated on the token’s price before its launch on exchanges. This may have led to inflated and expanded expectations. When the price of SUI failed to meet those expectations, some may have sold off their holdings, contributing to the downward pressure on the price.

12325072,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529752,1683133213,More Dip To Come: Bitcoin Liquidity On The Move Ahead Of Major Event,"As the Federal Reserve (Fed) prepares to announce its decision on interest rates, Material Indicators, a research and analysis firm in the cryptocurrency market, is keeping a close eye on the Bitcoin (BTC) liquidity movements. FireCharts, a popular charting platform, has tracked liquidity movements on the BTC/USDT Binance order book. Their observations have led them to believe that the recent dip in Bitcoin’s price may extend. Liquidity refers to the amount of Bitcoin available for trading at a given price level. When there is a large amount of liquidity at a particular price level, traders can easily buy or sell Bitcoin at that price without significantly affecting the market. However, low liquidity at a certain price level can lead to volatility spikes as traders scramble to buy or sell the asset. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Price Shows Vigor, Are Bulls Up To Something? Will Bitcoin Face Another Dip Material Indicator’s FireCharts analysis shows that liquidity in the Bitcoin order book has been moving ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision, indicating that traders are preparing for potential volatility in the market. This could lead to further price drops if liquidity to the upside declines. Added to the above, according to Kaiko, a leading cryptocurrency market data provider, liquidity in Bitcoin and Ethereum continues to deteriorate, with market depth for both cryptocurrencies approaching one-year lows, which could have significant implications for bulls, as low liquidity can lead to increased volatility and price instability. As of writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at $28,300, representing a 1.4% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite the recent news of more bank failures, which briefly pushed the price above $29,000, Bitcoin has remained within its established trading range of $27,800 to $28,600. The attempt to exceed the $29,000 mark was unsuccessful, and the price has since retraced to its current level. The market remains in flux as investors monitor the ongoing price movements, waiting for a clear direction to emerge after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. But will this lead to more retracement, or will the market react positively to the news? BTC Braces For Potential Impact Of Federal Reserve’s Rate Hike The Federal Reserve’s latest measures on employment and wages suggest that more rate hikes may be on the horizon. This comes after the key labor costs metric for the first quarter came in higher than expected. One of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauges, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index, remains persistently high. Furthermore, according to the latest report by Bitfinex, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, the labor costs metric for the first quarter came in hotter than expected, indicating that wages are rising faster than anticipated. This could lead to higher inflation, as companies may pass higher labor costs to consumers through higher prices. This suggests that the Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates to manage inflation and maintain price stability. The Fed has already signaled that it may raise rates in May, and these latest measures on employment and wages reinforce that decision. The implications of a rate hike are significant for the financial markets, including the cryptocurrency market. A rate hike could increase volatility and uncertainty as investors adjust their expectations for future economic growth and earnings. However, it could also lead to a stronger dollar and increased demand for safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin.

42420594,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqLFd,1683131183,I Owe Brian Armstrong an Apology,"It’s time for a stunning confession: I am a Coinbase customer, and have been, off and on, for many years. For crypto veterans, this may come as a shock: I have an S-tier public track record as a Coinbase critic.  Most notably, I was instrumental in triggering a boycott against the exchange in early 2019 under the hashtag #deletecoinbase. The hashtag emerged largely in response to a piece I wrote for the late, lamented Breaker Magazine about Coinbase hiring several former leaders of a black hat organization known as Hacking Team. Ultimately, in response to public pressure, Coinbase fired its questionable new hires, and execs admitted to a failure of due diligence.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Tuesday, Coinbase announced the opening of its offshore cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. Normally I’d be poised to excoriate that move, too, because it may make the Coinbase U.S. product less trustworthy.  But this isn’t something Coinbase is doing particularly of its own free will. Instead, the move is seemingly in reaction to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler’s ongoing crypto crackdown. That shambolic campaign, from where I’m standing, is frantically trying to close the gates on fundamentally good actors such as Coinbase, well after Gensler and Co. let the likes of Celsius Network and FTX ransack the whole ranch.  I’m suddenly being reminded, not of Coinbase’s missteps, but of the good times. The boring times. The times when Coinbase did absolutely nothing.  The times when, for instance, CEO Brian Armstrong didn’t secretly send my money to an affiliated hedge fund. Or the time he didn’t gamble my funds away on his own exchange, then go to India and die in possession of the only keys to what was left over. Or the time he didn’t lie about Coinbase’s finances. Or the time his entire system didn’t collapse and he didn’t flee to Serbia.  In short, whatever the missteps as Coinbase found its way, Brian Armstrong never stole from me. That should be a very low bar, but apparently not. I was busy demanding Coinbase become an exemplary company when it seems I should have settled for being able to trust it with a tiny sliver of my assets.  Hopefully I've made clear that I'm not here to praise Coinbase as a pack of angels. On the question of theft, they're only virtuous by comparison. In March of 2021, the CFTC slapped Coinbase with a $6.5 million penalty for flaws in its BTC price data and wash trading activities attributed to an employee. That could have meant customers paying more for certain assets. But at least it apparently didn't last long? So, again, we thank Brian for small mercies.  Now, though, Coinbase looks a little bit more like its less-trustworthy competition. So far, its offshore leverage trading offering seems nominal at best – Coinbase International Exchange doesn’t even have an app or website, operating strictly through an API. That could be the foundation for a more robust product, or it might just be the bare minimum required to make a theatrical political statement. While I doubt Gary Gensler cares much, threatening to take its toys and go overseas is one way Coinbase can rally support for a pushback against the crypto crackdown.  It’s unclear whether Coinbase’s international ambitions extend beyond that rhetorical threat. As a customer, I hope not. There’s little real chance it will shut down U.S. services, but simply adding a less-regulated and more-volatile international product will in and of itself harm the trustworthiness that makes Coinbase’s higher fees worth paying for users like me.  That’s because there is, inevitably, shared risk between the U.S. Coinbase product and the new international offering. Those new risks for Coinbase U.S. users include both financial stability and, ironically, regulatory oversight. In a worst-case scenario, an international entity could become financially entangled with the U.S. entity in ways that make the whole more fragile.  See also: Coinbase Grew Quickly by Working With U.S. Regulators. Will It Expand Even More by Disregarding the SEC? | Opinion  More concretely, launching an international exchange could be painting a bigger target on Coinbase’s back for the hostile SEC. We’ve already seen the SEC cite the use of international exchanges by U.S. customers via VPNs and false identities in a variety of enforcement actions. That’s difficult for an international exchange to entirely prevent though, again, I would bet on Coinbase being exceedingly careful here.  Still, the shadow of uncertainty looms larger. That’s not because Coinbase has chosen to betray my trust. It’s because Gary Gensler thinks he’s protecting me, when in fact he’s doing the exact opposite.

Polygon bulls have picked up steam and momentum in the new month after bears held the prices down since mid-February. Despite Polygon’s countless innovative partnerships and bullish news events, its native token remained bearish for most of the 2023 first quarter. And BTC’s impressive price movements in April were still not enough to awaken Polygon bulls, as bears remained adamant and unmoved. However, Polygon (MATIC) bulls remain resilient in their new show of strength in May. MATIC Price Gets Relief From Bulls Polygon (MATIC) bulls have shown resilience and pushed back prices after a major retracement that shook most cryptocurrencies due to a change in market sentiments of investors on the first day of May. The cryptocurrency markets, which experienced a major rally in BTC price and some altcoins in April, were met with bearish sentiments as the “Sell in May” narrative trooped in. Related Reading: This Meme Coin Created By GPT-4 Is Now Worth $40 Million, Here’s Why Polygon (MATIC), which closed April bearish at $0.97, was seen to decline further as it traded at a price low of $0.94 on the first day. However, yesterday’s trading session witnessed Polygon (MATIC) recovering as bulls stepped in and pushed back prices. According to Coinmarketcap data, Polygon (MATIC) is seen to continue from its previous day’s price recovery in today’s trading session. When writing, Polygon bulls are up 3% at a trading price of $0.98. The trading volume of the layer 2 blockchain token has also seen a near 14% increase in the last 24 hours, which may indicate buying activity from Polygon investors. MATIC’s price is currently seen to trade below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average, with bulls moving to test that area acting as immediate resistance. A break above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently trending at $1.052, may see Polygon bulls pushing the price to the next available resistance.

Kathy Hochul signed a law banning certain types of cryptocurrency mining in the Empire State. New York is the first state in the country to ban the activity. It also follows federal regulators’ broader crackdown on the digital assets industry in the wake of centralized cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s multi-billion dollar collapse.  At the federal level, the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken action against prominent industry players including centralized crypto exchanges Bittrex, Kraken and Gemini, crypto lender Genesis (which is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group) and individual actors such as Tron founder Justin Sun in recent months, deepening an existing digital asset market downturn.  Regulators’ actions have sparked outrage among crypto advocates, fueling cries for regulators to clarify existing regulatory guidelines to allow crypto companies to register with the federal agency and stem the damage from a recent swath of high-profile crackdowns.

42393591,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1Aq5,1683128100,"Crypto Innovation and Regulation Should Be Partners, Not Adversaries","“There’s no reason why innovation and regulation have to be mutually exclusive.”  Out of the myriad thought-provoking statements made at this year’s Consensus 2023 conference, this is the one that stands out the most to me. Uttered by Chris Zuehlke, the global head of crypto market maker Cumberland DRW, the comment brings together two important aspects of the economy.  The first (innovation) represents that which has yet to be discovered, the potential for efficiencies, revenue, growth, etc. The second (regulation) can help innovation flourish in a legal and orderly way – or regulation can hinder innovation completely.  Their coexistence is necessary, but when their relationship is contentious, it’s highly problematic for all. Recent developments have me worried. Let me explain.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Blockchain developers design, build and maintain applications within crypto ecosystems. They, as developers, make a conscious effort to allocate their time, intellect, talent and resources to build things that they feel have utility.  Developers flocking to or retreating from a particular ecosystem arguably serves as an indication of the protocol’s efficacy. Developer activity can also serve as an early indication of which crypto-focused projects are poised for growth and are generating value for users.  An analogy from the physical world is apt: Often, the most vibrant cities are the ones with the most construction. The same philosophy holds true in blockchain development. If developers are building there, a protocol may be worth exploring.  Recently, I came across a report that showed two developments, one of which was encouraging, the other not so much.  First, blockchain development is expanding. The report showed there are approximately 21,700 monthly active developers across the various crypto ecosystems. The top five by rank are:  Ethereum: 1,975  Polkadot: 675  Cosmos: 530  Solana: 344  Bitcoin: 328  The overall number has grown 43% in the past two years and 110% over the last three – though it is down 17% since November, when the FTX exchange’s collapse caused so much industry turmoil.  The long-term increase even as we navigate a crypto winter is testament to the fact that crypto represents an expansion in technology and innovation. Cryptocurrencies are not simply coins and tokens that exist only for the purpose of speculation. They also represent technologies where potentially valuable applications are being developed.  More developers have been attempting to build things of value on various ecosystems, which should benefit the general public. This is positive.  The second development has me concerned, however. While the overall number of developers has gone up, their ranks are dwindling in the U.S. The proportion of developers based in the U.S. has dropped to 29% from 40% in 2017.  The U.S. is now tied with Europe, which is also at 29% after remaining relatively stable in recent years. But Asia and Africa are rising fast, so it’s reasonable to think the U.S. will be knocked from the top position.  What explains the American decline? The recent tone between the crypto space and U.S. policymakers has become unnecessarily strident. And, as such, individuals within crypto have concerns about a lack of clarity and whether actions they take in the name of innovation will run afoul of yet-to-be revealed or implemented regulations.  The lowest hanging (but still viable) fruit to grab in this regard is Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler’s comments on cryptocurrencies and what appears to be (at least on the surface) a hostile attitude towards the sector.  Much of it has been attributed to perceived contradictions between what Gensler is saying now as head of the SEC, and what he has said in the past, with statements made in 2018 that appear to completely contradict what he is currently stating.  Here’s the thing: Positions evolve. It's possible for someone to change their mind on an issue. But if done without clarity, it's easy for a situation to evolve where people simply don’t believe what you’re saying, or believe the motivation for change was driven by external factors.  This is not simply limited to developers. Crypto firms have begun to consider overseas operations, with Coinbase reportedly considering moving a segment of its operations outside of the U.S. The primary motivation of a move is apparently the diversification of regulatory risk.  With Europe recently approving its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, it seems more likely U.S. individuals and firms will seek out countries with greater regulatory clarity.  What we need is, believe it or not, for everyone to move toward sensible regulation and not regurgitation of party-centric talking points, on both sides of the political spectrum.  An example of a path forward is illustrated in a recent draft of a U.S. stablecoin bill, which is reportedly receiving bipartisan support. Elements of the bill include ensuring the maintenance of adequate liquid reserves, a moratorium on algorithmic stablecoins and licensing rules for stablecoin issuers.  But the most important part is that the two major political parties are apparently working together.  If they can’t do that more often, crypto innovation will absolutely move elsewhere.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here’s some news worth reading:  THE OPTIMISM: I was a newbie at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference held last week, and I was blown away by how big and impressive the event was. The high level of optimism was a surprise given just how bad the regulatory outlook is. I know that’s partly self-selection bias at work: People who pay a lot of money to attend such an event tend to be bullish. Still, the juxtaposition of big questions about crypto’s future and optimistic outlooks was striking to me.  MILLIONAIRE FROGS: There’s another way to say people are optimistic about crypto: The market cap of the PEPE meme coin has surged to half a billion dollars following a 2,100% surge since its April debut. BitMEX is offering derivatives contracts tied to PEPE with enormous leverage. Caveat emptor abounds here, of course. With no apparent there there, just degens and day traders moving the price up and down, this sure seems like the kind of speculative fervor that usually ends in tears – though dogecoin (DOGE), probably the most famous meme coin, is still around after so many years, so who knows.  CRYPTO LEGISLATION: One of the more ear-catching announcements at Consensus was U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry saying a key congressional committee will have a proposal for crypto legislation in the near future. It’s hard to be – sorry to overuse the word – optimistic about this, though. We’ve been down this road before, hoping the U.S. will bring some legislative clarity to the industry with not much to show for it. In the runup to the 2024 presidential election it’s hard to imagine much bipartisan work getting done.  KILLER APP: Traditional financial (TradFi) firms have talked about and experimented with blockchains and crypto for many years, but the hoped-for intersection of those two distinct realms really hasn’t happened. In the view of JPMorgan, though, the movement toward tokenizing real-world assets is a “killer app” for TradFi, and the bank is pressing forward into that realm, “largely undeterred by the crypto bear market and regulatory uncertainty,” CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports.

42393606,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1C51,1683127800,A Closer Look at Market Cap-Weighted Crypto Portfolios,"Digital asset investment management stands to benefit greatly from the techniques and lessons learned in traditional finance. From portfolio construction methodologies to regulatory frameworks, leveraging best practices from decades of research in traditional asset management will help accelerate crypto’s broader adoption.  In certain ways unlike traditional asset classes, however, blockchain assets may warrant a closer look beyond familiar concepts. That includes using market capitalization as a weighting methodology for passive portfolios.  Portfolios across both traditional and digital asset classes often use market cap to determine how much to invest in each underlying asset. Doing so provides investors straightforward passive exposure to the overall market. For digital assets, though, complementing market cap with some measurement of a blockchain’s usage may enhance portfolio construction.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  One way to do that is with total value locked (TVL), which represents the value of assets deposited on a blockchain. A higher TVL suggests greater economic activity and potentially better prospects of future activity or a larger active user base. (A lower TVL implies the opposite.)  By taking the ratio of market cap-to-TVL (MC-TVL), we may glean a more fundamental sense of an asset’s utility beyond the superficial view from market cap, similar to how equity investors use ratios like price-to-book (P/B) to discern a stock’s value. A higher MC-TVL suggests an asset’s capitalization may be bloated, with a valuation that disproportionately exceeds its usage. Conversely, a lower MC-TVL may imply an undervalued blockchain, where markets haven’t yet priced in its activity.  We ran a simulation on a top-10 index weighted by market cap versus one weighted by MC-TVL. The results are below:  The MC-TVL approach produced better full-period returns in this hypothetical scenario, driven by outsized positive performance in 2021. Over the period, daily returns between the two had a 0.85 correlation, suggesting that while the weighting methodologies are similar (by design), meaningful differentiation still exists between them. Over the long run, integrating blockchain usage into passive products may improve overall market exposure and help investors better align themselves with crypto fundamentals.  Conclusion  This experiment, while a highly simplified and mostly illustrative simulation, is intended to encourage more nuanced analyses of crypto-specific properties and how they can be integrated into portfolio construction. Despite limited backtest duration, over the long run lower MC-TVL may prove a useful indication of assets with greater network usage versus higher MC-TVL assets, whose size alone may not completely reflect their value within the digital asset universe.  As crypto’s track record unfurls in real time and new, richer on-chain data emerges, investors should monitor how fundamentals-based adjustments to portfolio construction could assist digital asset investment management.  Description of simulation: Data is for the period Jan. 1, 2021-March 31, 2023. These indexes represent hypothetical backtests rebalanced monthly and do not consider transaction costs or whether assets are feasibly investable. The indexes exclude stablecoins, wrapped/pegged tokens, centralized exchange tokens and any assets that have not received a price in the last 365 days. Indexes only include proof-of-stake assets for which TVL data is readily available. “Market cap” refers to the circulating market cap of an asset. TVL includes all forms of how assets are used, or “locked” on a chain, including staked deposits, unstaked assets held in wallets, assets sitting in DeFi protocols, dapps, or smart contracts and so on. This article only summarily describes TVL, but there are ways it can be further quantified and more richly defined.

Uniswap’s version (v)2 and v3 liquidity pools for PEPE-WETH have been the most active liquidity pool contracts by number of transactions in the past seven days, with more than 82,750 and 72,950 transactions, respectively, according to Nansen data.  These two liquidity pools have garnered a combined total of nearly $900,000 in accrued fees in the same time period. The only two liquidity pools that had more accrued fees were the USDC-WETH and WETH-WETH liquidity pools, highlighting the recent obsession of pepe tokens.  Despite a recent increase in liquidity pool activity, traders were stung at the weekend by an absence of liquidity that resulted in significant slippage for those attempting to convert large amounts of PEPE for other currencies such as ether (ETH).  PEPE, which has been listed on several centralized exchanges such as OKX, MEXC and Huobi, has also seen its trading volume surpass those of the dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB), the largest meme coins in the crypto ecosystem.

The amendment would allow crypto companies that are already registered with the country’s financial watchdog under its anti-money laundering regime to be able to approve their own ads, something they would otherwise not be able to do. This exemption will only apply until new crypto laws come into force, and can still face opposition until it officially comes into force.  The House of Lords, Parliament's second chamber, agreed to move the amendment forward in a committee meeting on Tuesday before it was voted on by the primary chamber, the House of Commons, on Wednesday.  The rule will allow the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to regulate crypto companies under the existing promotions law, and should help safeguard consumers from misleading crypto promotions, the Treasury, the government's finance arm, tweeted in March.  The amendment should come into effect around four months from now, to allow time for crypto companies to adjust, the Treasury has said.  The Financial Services and Markets Bill going through Parliament seeks to regulate crypto as financial instruments, and will give regulators more power over the sector, including for regulating promotions.

42393607,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1Bzt,1683124918,CoinDesk Validator ‘Zelda’ Successfully Exits Ethereum as Withdrawal Queue Shrinks to 9 Days,"As part of CoinDesk’s former Valid Points Newsletter, CoinDesk set up its own Ethereum validator, “Zelda,” in 2020 to have a front-row seat into the blockchain’s shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The goal was to learn about the historic engineering feat and to report from the front lines.  But with Ethereum’s full transition to PoS complete and with the Shapella upgrade enabling staked ether (ETH) withdrawals, Zelda’s time has come to an end.  According to blockchain explorer beaconcha.in, Zelda exited the Beacon Chain on April 24 at 12:16 p.m. ET, and our staked ETH became withdrawable on April 25 at 3:34 p.m. ET. The timeline of Zelda’s exit is similar to what had been reported at the time: The day after Shapella went live, the exit queue for validators looking to leave the chain was at about two weeks.  CoinDesk Director of Engineering C. Spencer Beggs put in the request to remove our validator from the chain on April 13, the morning after Shapella had been triggered. Thus, from the time our request went in, to the time that CoinDesk’s staked ETH became withdrawable, it took about 12 days.  The reason it takes so long for validators to exit the chain is because that’s part of the project’s design. Staking is an important part of maintaining the security of the Ethereum blockchain, and if too many validators left the chain at once the security of ensuring that transactions and blocks are added to the network could not be guaranteed. So the number of validators who can exit at any given time is subject to a hard limit. When withdrawal requests pile up, the exit queue backs up.  Currently, the withdrawal queue sits at about nine days, indicating that the requests for validators to be removed from the blockchain has calmed down. At its peak, the withdrawal queue was at 17 days.  Zelda managed to earn 3.682 ETH worth about $6,860 in staking rewards, which CoinDesk will donate to charity.

12322413,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529633,1683124228,"$24,400 May Be Next Major Level Of Support For Bitcoin, Here’s Why","Historical data of an on-chain indicator may suggest that the $24,400 level could be a major level of support for Bitcoin right now. Bitcoin STH MVRV Would Hit 1.0 If Price Declines To $24,400 According to this week’s edition of the Glassnode report, the 1.0 level of the Bitcoin STH MVRV has been a point of support for the market during uptrends in the past. The “STH” here refers to the “short-term holder group,” which is a Bitcoin cohort that includes all investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. The “market value to realized value” (MVRV) is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and its realized cap. The “realized cap” here is a BTC capitalization model that aims to find the “real” value of the asset by assuming that the value of each coin in circulation is not the current price, but the price at which it was last moved on the blockchain. Since the realized cap accounts for the price at which the investors bought (which is the price at which their coins last moved), its comparison with the market cap (that is, the current price) can tell us about the degree of profitability or loss among the overall market. When the MVRV is greater than 1, it means the average investor is holding an unrealized profit with their BTC right now. On the other hand, values below this threshold imply the market as a whole is holding some amount of unrealized loss currently. Now, the “STH MVRV,” the actual indicator of interest in the current discussion, naturally measures the value of the ratio specifically for the coins owned by the Bitcoin short-term holders. The below chart shows the trend in the 7-day average value of this metric over the last few years: The 7-day average value of the metric seems to have been above the 1.0 level in recent months | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 18, 2023 In the graph, Glassnode has marked the lines of the 7-day average Bitcoin STH MVRV that have been relevant to the price of the cryptocurrency during the last few years. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Inflows Of $505M Into Binance, Sign Of Selling? It looks like short-term corrections for the asset have generally become more probable when this indicator has crossed a value of 1.2. At this level, the STHs hold unrealized profits of 20%. The recent drawdown in the cryptocurrency’s price from the $30,000 mark also took place when the metric was above this level. To be more specific, the indicator had a value of 1.33 when the asset was rejected, implying that the STHs had 33% profits. The reason that high MVRV values of this cohort have usually made a decline more probable for the price is that the higher the amount of profits that the STHs hold, the more likely they become to sell and harvest their gains. From the chart, it’s visible that the on-chain analytics firm has also marked the relevance of the 1.0 level (that is, the threshold line between profit and loss) to the cryptocurrency. Interestingly, this level has generally provided support to the price during periods of uptrend. The likely explanation behind this trend is that the 1.0 level serves as the cost basis of the majority of the STHs in the market, so when the price hits this mark, these investors look at this point as a profitable zone to accumulate more of the asset. Obviously, this behavior is only seen during rallies, as holders would only find it worthful to buy more if they think the price has the potential to grow. Related Reading: Check Out This Shocking Pepe Coin Versus Bitcoin Comparison As the market is right now, the price would need to decline to $24,400 in order to hit this 1.0 level. This implies that if Bitcoin observes a deep decline in the near future, $24,400 could be the level that can provide support to it, considering the pattern that has held during the last few years.

The most recent one that is catching investors’ attention is a meme coin that was created using the famous ChatGPT-4 artificial intelligence (AI). As the coin continues to rally, let’s take a look at its inception and how it has been able to grow this much. The Genesis Of Turbo Toad Token About two weeks ago, a Twitter user that goes by Rhett Mankind posted that they had given GPT-4 a $69 budget with the instruction to create a meme token that become the most successful new meme token. What followed was an interesting thread sharing the process and creation of the token. Related Reading: Is Meme Coin Season Back? Here’s What The Numbers Say After going through different suggested names, Rhett finally settled on the name Turbo Toad Token (TTT) following a Twitter poll where the name emerged as the most popular. GPT-4 further provided the prompts to create AI images for the meme coin, as well as develop the tokenomics for it. I gave GPT-4 a budget of $69 and asked it to make the next great meme coin. I will follow all instructions it gives me and document the process here. Follow and participate 👇 pic.twitter.com/bBxkxkg7eS — Rhett Mankind (@rhett) April 23, 2023 The coin was initially launched by Rhett but failed on the first try. However, the second iteration proved to be successful after a crowdfunding round carried out on Twitter. The website created was very basic but investors quickly latched on to the coin, pulling in around 50 holders with a 69 billion total supply on the first day. This is where it gets interesting. AI-Generated Meme Coin Grows To $40 Million The last iteration of the meme coin was launched on Sunday, April 29, and in the next three days, the coin exploded. First, TURBO launched at a price of around $0.00001773, data from Dextools shows, and it has already grown over 10x since then. Its holder base rose from 50 wallets on launch day to 4,474 at the time of writing, with over 14,600 transfers already carried out on the contract so far. Related Reading: Ripple’s Q1 Report Shows That Investors Are Still Bullish On XRP, Here’s Why Interestingly, this meme coin has surged faster than some of its counterparts, now sitting at a $40 million market cap after touching a new all-time high of $0.00056 in the early hours of Wednesday. Likewise, its 24-hour trading volume on decentralized exchanges reached over $14 million, making it one of the most traded meme coins on the Ethereum network during this time period. The project continues to rely on GPT-4 for improvement updates with the most recent recommendation being that more liquidity be added to the token. As a result, the liquidity for the token has grown to $1.4 million as the community clamored to add more liquidity. As for the token, there is no telling where it goes from here due to the volatile nature of meme coins. However, the support from its community has already seen the meme coin more than double its value in a single day.

42393595,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1BAb,1683123631,"Can CBDCs, Tokenized Deposits,  Stablecoins and DeFi Coexist?","Decentralized finance (DeFi) is booming, and the FTX exchange collapse has thrown a spotlight on the urgent need for safer, more efficient systems in the crypto market. So how can governments, financial institutions and DeFi-native groups meet this challenge?  The answer lies in exploring viable alternatives including central bank digital currencies (CBDC), tokenized deposits and fiat-backed stablecoins. Each instrument comes with its pros and cons, but can they coexist within the evolving DeFi space? Trust and ease of redemption for payment transactions will be the key.  Yiannis Giokas is the senior director for product innovation at Moody’s Analytics.  CBDCs are digital versions of a country's legal tender, issued and regulated by the central bank. They offer efficiency of payment and direct translation of monetary policy, but also raise privacy concerns, technological challenges and could disrupt traditional banks.  Tokenized deposits are digital representations of deposits held at a financial institution, converted into easily transferable and accessible blockchain tokens. They promise improved liquidity, efficient cross-border transactions and fractional ownership. However, tokenized deposits also carry risks associated with the issuing institution, are subject to regulatory scrutiny and may not be accessible to all.  Fiat-backed stablecoins are digital assets collateralized by a mix of cash and securities in a specific currency – most commonly the U.S. dollar, offering stability and minimal price fluctuations. They can play a crucial role in crypto trading and DeFi applications but contain risks related to centralization, transparency and regulatory uncertainty leading to mixed appetites for the assets globally.  All three instruments can harness blockchain technology, paving the way for faster and more efficient transactions. They share the potential to increase accessibility and financial inclusion, particularly for underbanked or unbanked populations. Each instrument is designed to provide stability, whether backed by a central bank (CBDC), deposit protections (tokenized deposits) or underlying fiat currency reserves (stablecoins).  The key risks and caveats revolve around issuance and regulation, accessibility and restrictions, and specific risk factors. CBDCs and tokenized deposits are subject to government regulations and deposit protection rules, respectively, while fiat-backed stablecoins rely on the transparency and management of the underlying collateral.  Moreover, CBDCs and tokenized deposits may face limitations, whereas stablecoins are generally more accessible.  So, can CBDCs, tokenized deposits and stablecoins coexist within the DeFi landscape? Governments, financial institutions and stablecoin issuers are each focused on developing their own instruments and must adapt their strategies to successfully coexist.  Governments won't easily give up monetary control but a CBDC won’t be a reality in the U.S. anytime soon and there is still a long way to go in launching one in Europe despite the political will to do so. Similarly, financial institutions will strive to maintain customer relationships by promoting tokenized deposits over stablecoin alternatives but have not yet started to roll these out commercially.  Stablecoins need experienced custodians to manage reserves effectively and must resolve transparency issues and navigate an evolving regulatory landscape. At the same time, many consumers may push back against increased government oversight of their financial activities to favor stablecoins over institutional alternatives.  In summary, the market environment continues to be fluid, and there is no clear winner on either side. Ultimately, the coexistence of CBDCs, tokenized deposits and stablecoins hinges on striking the right balance to meet customers' needs and ensuring trust in their redemption as payment transactions. This coexistence should be driven by application, with central banks continuing to dictate monetary policies and issue money while relying on private regulated entities, such as banks, for distribution to the public.  See also: In Defense of a Digital Dollar | Opinion  As financial institutions and nonfinancial institutions have historically driven innovation in B2B and B2C [business-to-business and business-to-consumer] payments, they are well-positioned to prevail in the digital world, creating a harmonious ecosystem where CBDCs, tokenized deposits and stablecoins can all thrive.  The evolving DeFi landscape offers an opportunity for increased efficiency and safety. Understanding the nuances of these instruments will be crucial in determining their future roles in the global economy. Trust in their redemption as a form of payment transaction will be the cornerstone of their coexistence and success within the DeFi ecosystem.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Yiannis Giokas ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/05/03/can-cbdcs-tokenized-deposits-stablecoins-and-defi-coexist,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e140eba85e1266a050930a7ef5582d2306bc854-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12321433,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529682,1683121204,XRP Loses Previous Gains; Bulls Seek To Shift Momentum,"Following a sharp increase in value, XRP overcame several major obstacles, improving its outlook. But when the price reached the significant resistance level of $0.5387 on April 19, it lost momentum and fell. XRP has seen a dramatic decline in value, giving up its prior gains. Many investors are now unsure when the momentum will change and the possible causes of the decline in value. Will XRP Recover From The Dip? XRP is one of the most closely monitored digital assets due to Ripple’s ongoing case with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The token has seen substantial volatility and swings in the cryptocurrency market since the year began. Recently, the token has experienced a decline in its value, erasing its previous gains and leaving investors uncertain about the future of the asset. The current XRP price outlook is bearish, with a Fear & Greed Index score of 29. Related Reading: Top 5 Cryptos To Watch This Week Amid US Banking Crisis This level indicates that the bearish trend will continue as the price is at the zone where investors and traders are afraid to enter the market. The investor’s sentiment and market structure has led to increased selling momentum and downtrend movement. The current price of XRP is $0.4557 today, depicting a 24-hour decline of 0.89%. Its market cap of $23 billion shows a decline of 0.88%, while its 24-hour trading volume of $890 million depicts a 1.28% decline. What’s Ahead For The Token? At the time of writing, XRP’s price is heading toward the critical support level at $0.4405 due to the strong bearish momentum. If XRP bulls reduce their buying momentum, the price could soon lose the immediate support at $0.4405, opening the drains for further declines. Conversely, if sidelined investors jump in at current levels, XRP’s price could reclaim its bullish trend. An increase in buying pressure from the current $0.4602 could see the token break past the immediate psychological resistance of around $0.4869. It may also confront the next resistance at $0.5387 if the bulls build strong pressure. But a decisive flip of this resistance into support would invalidate the bearish thesis. XRP’s price turned down from the 50-Day simple moving average (SMA), indicating sellers continue to defend the level aggressively. The bears will try to sink the price to the important support zone of $0.4405. If it trades below the 200-Day SMA, this would indicate a long-term bearish momentum. However, buyers are expected to defend the zone because the XRP/USD pair could sink more if they fail to hold their position. The relative strength index (RSI) is trying to form a bearish divergence, indicating that the bears may be holding their grip. The RSI reading of 38 shows that XRP is close to the oversold region. The MACD line is below the signal line, indicating a potential sell opportunity. The histogram is also below the zero line and increasing in size; this indicates possible bearish momentum.

42393603,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1BaF,1683119138,Sui Mainnet Goes Live as Crypto Project Takes on Aptos and DeFi Giants,"Sui, the buzzy layer 1 blockchain boasting a $2 billion valuation, launched its mainnet on Wednesday as it jockeyed to edge out rival Aptos and other decentralized finance (DeFi) heavyweights.  The token trades at $1.33 at press time, a significant rise from the pre-sale price of 3 cents and the public sale price of 10 cents. The market capitalization currently stands at $687 million, according to CoinGecko.  The blockchain, founded by ex-Meta Platforms (META) employees, has more than 200 projects in its directory and another 100-odd projects vying to build on its network.  Sui developers promised fast transaction speeds, which gradually increased as the network gained its footing on launchday. Speeds averaged around four transactions per second (4tps) minutes after the launch on Wednesday, data from Sui’s blockchain explorer shows. But, those speeds increased throughout the day, hovering around 18tps six hours after the launch. Aptos, by comparison, is pushing out at speeds of 9tps.  Sui faced several stumbling blocks on the decentralization front, however.  The network has more than 2,100 nodes operating across 43 countries. But those nodes are primarily concentrated in Germany and the U.S., with a smattering of nodes running across Asia and eastern Europe. It’s worth noting that the network is still in its infancy, and that over time the distribution of validators will likely become more distributed.  The distribution of token holders also remains unclear at press time.  Mysten Labs, the blockchain’s core contributor, topped up its coffers with $300 million through a series of raises last year to support construction of the network’s central infrastructure and fast-track the Sui ecosystem’s adoption.  Its success in securing VC funding pre-launch has invited comparisons to Aptos, another relatively young blockchain with a large VC backing.

In April, Sui disappointed some of its community members by announcing it would forgo an airdrop. Instead, SUI, the platform's native token for governance and gas, became available to community members for 3 cents per token in an early sale on three exchanges — OKX, KuCoin and ByBit. There was a later token sale for 10 cents per token capped at 10,000 tokens per person.  Meanwhile, Binance added support for SUI to BNB and TUSD holders through its bootstrapping portal, Launchpad, earlier this week. Users in the U.S. were not eligible for the early sale program.

It was also one of my Top Token Ideas for BlockChain Reaction subscribers back in August 2022. The recent surge in token price has been driven by a tokenomic update, a surge in wallet addresses, network growth, and good old-fashioned hype. Back in August, I shared Render Token ( RNDR-USD ) as one of my "" Top Token Ideas "" with BlockChain Reaction subscribers. At the time, RNDR was 53 cents per coin. Since then, quite a bit has happened involving RNDR and it's now one of the best performing assets in crypto year to date; up over 400% and dwarfing the returns of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and the overwhelming majority of broader crypto assets: YTD Return (Seeking Alpha) The core thesis behind that call was Ethereum's merge from PoW to PoS and the negative impact it would have on ETH miners by eliminating the return on GPU machines from Ethereum's block reward. The thinking at the time was GPU machines could instead be used for some of the HPC services that Web3 and metaverse projects would need to truly be decentralized: While I think most of these rigs are going to ultimately have to shift to non-crypto related businesses, there is an interesting case to be made for displaced Ethereum miners to attempt to continue contributing to crypto/Web 3 initiatives. One possible winner from the availability of GPU machines is the Render Network. How The Render Network Works The Render network aims to be a decentralized system of computers that provide mercenary-like high-performance computing services for entities that need rendering power that can't be handled primarily by local systems. People who have idle GPUs that they'd like to monetize can submit for cloud computing jobs through protocols like Render Network. Another example of a protocol that benefits from distributed compute services would be Livepeer (LPT-USD). But while Livepeer's offering seems to be more suited for typical video streaming, 3D rendering for things like video games, movies, and virtual reality need far more robust computing systems than simple video transcoding. Render Network is a potential player in that market and is an important part of what cloud computing developer OTOY is trying to build. From Render's 2017 white paper : When founder and CEO Jules Urbach started OTOY eight years ago, the only way to perform a complex render job for massive projects such as Avatar or Transformers was at an expensive visual effects studio. Rendering took massive amounts of time, money, and storage space, none of which the average game developer, student, or designer could have access to. Through its product offerings, OTOY is trying to boost the rendering capability of individual creators without the need for expensive rendering hardware. This is something that could be very appealing to filmmakers and graphic artists. In my opinion, the OTOY board is impressive and includes film industry heavyweights Ari Emanuel and J.J. Abrams. Also on the board are 3D NFT artist Beeple and Brave ( BAT-USD ) founder Brendan Eich. RNDR Tokenomics and Distribution From a functionality standpoint, RNDR is both a governance token and a utility token that is used within the Render system for payments between GPU job posters and GPU job accepters. Proof of Render (Render White Paper) The protocol utilizes the blockchain to calculate the cost of the GPU job based on the intensity of the proposal and locks RNDR in escrow until the GPU job is finished. This is referred to as a ""proof of render system."" Max Token Supply: 537 million Circulating Supply: 364 million (68%) Token Price: $2.12 Market capitalization: $772 million Fully diluted cap: $1.1 billion Market Cap Rank: 59 According to CoinMarketCap, there is a max token supply of 537 coins, of which 68% are circulating. While there could be a certain element of inflationary pressure on the surface, the community passed RNP-001 in January. That vote approved a ""burn-and-mint equilibrium,"" or BME model, that will potentially result in deflationary pressure down the line. What is Driving RNDR's Price Action? RNDR is likely benefitting from a handful of factors that are all happening in tandem. First, RNDR transactions have drastically risen over the last several months: RNDR Transactions (IntoTheBlock) The number of daily transactions averaged 805 in April, that's up 21% from March and over 400% year over year. This surge in both transactions and price has led to a 40% year to date increase in non-zero wallet addresses from 21k to over 28k according to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock: RNDR Addresses (IntoTheBlock) While I believe most of that action is more hype-driven than anything else, there is genuine usage growth within the Render Network ecosystem. According to the RNDR Team Medium blog, the total frames rendered through the platform grew 58% in 2022 from 5.9 million to 9.4 million. Sequentially, frame growth continued in Q1 2023 and RNDR tokens used in the protocol grew modestly over Q4 thanks to a big uptick in usage during March: RNDR Used (Render Foundation) But beyond these small usage improvements, sentiment online has been noticeably different this year with daily Twitter mentions going from nearly nothing in 2022 to several hundred per day in late January. RNDR Twitter Sentiment (IntoTheBlock) Some days RNDR is generating thousands of mentions on social media. In addition to my original thinking that RNDR was a solid bet on distributed Web3 technology, RNDR has also found a bit of a narrative wave as an artificial intelligence coin. You can't miss the AI hype on Twitter these days with new AI usage threads going viral seemingly every few hours. Hype aside, there is some validity to the idea that RNDR could be used in AI graphic generation. Render now offers a feature called ""Stable Diffusion"" that allows users to create AI images through simple text prompt in the Render ecosystem: This expansion to include Stable Diffusion's easy prompt creation suite natively into the Render Network creator portal is the first of many future-facing steps into the AI space in the years to come. The reality is AI generated images and videos require rendering and as a cloud-based compute protocol, Render Network is an ecosystem that could benefit from a larger movement to AI-generated content. Thus, RNDR has been catching a bid over the last several weeks. Risks I think the most obvious risk with RNDR is that it is being driven more by hype than by fundamentals at this point. That's a valid concern if your time horizon is shorter. If you have a longer time horizon, RNDR might still be interesting at $2 as it is still 76% off its all time high of over $8 per coin back in November of 2021. Beyond the hype, the next biggest risk is Render Network had an ICO and raised roughly $50 million from various funding rounds . 65% of those funds are allocated toward growth phases and development: Token Sale Allocation (Render White Paper) The most recent round included investment from Alameda and the Solana ( SOL-USD ) Foundation. Interestingly, the Render Network community voted in favor of using the Solana blockchain rather than Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) during a recent improvement vote. One final risk to note, since Render did have an ICO, there is a significant risk of regulatory pressure as RNDR could be argued to be an unregistered security by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Summary Render Network is one of the most intriguing protocols in the crypto industry and by extension the RNDR token is also a very interesting. There is a clear utility that gives the token value and demand growth for the products that Render Network users are providing could dramatically increase if any number of outcomes play out. RNDR theoretically benefits from adoption of a decentralized metaverse. RNDR also benefits from adoption of AI image and video creation. I lean the latter is actually more likely than a widely adopted VR metaverse at this point but in either case HPC is necessary. RNDR is a speculative coin but it's one of my favorite plays in the crypto market at this point. While it hasn't played out exactly how I saw it going last August, it's still a coin that I plan to hold for a long time.",POSITIVE,ETH | ICO | RNDR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ICO | MARKET | RNDR,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4599313-render-token-possible-ai-crypto-winner?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12320458.jpeg

Previously, US lawmakers probed the crypto mining energy use and environmental impact. Biden’s administration is taking these concerns to another level. Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) announced a 30% digital asset mining tax to offset its environmental impact. The new tax rule tagged DAME will take effect after a phase-in period. Bitcoin Energy Consumption Attracts New Tax Rules Crypto mining electricity consumption and carbon emission have been a bone of contention in the United States over the past years. A recently published New York Times article claimed Bitcoin has a voracious appetite for electricity, sparking several reactions among crypto community members. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analysis: How To Prepare For Today’s FOMC Meeting The CEA announced plans to impose a 30% tax on all crypto-mining activities. The council believes the crypto mining industry’s operations negatively impact the environment and is ready to counter them. The proposed tax, tagged Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME), aims to make crypto mining firms take responsibility for their environmental impact. According to the CEA’s announcement, the new tax rules will have a phased-in period before taking its course. Under the new tax guidelines, all mining firms in the US would pay taxes on 30% of their total electricity usage. The CEA feels crypto miners must take responsibility for the environmental pollution they impose on the local community from the increased greenhouse gas emissions. Also, the CEA believes the crypto firms aren’t fully paying the cost of these pollutions, considering their energy consumption rate. The council cited the recently published New York Times (NYT) article, which criticized the digital asset industry for the environmental impact of its mining operations. Crypto Community Reacts To New Bitcoin Mining Tax The proposed DAME tax sparked reactions among members of the crypto community. Many tagged the tax as unfair, criticizing the government for the high tax without incentivizing clean energy usage. Pierre Rochard, Riot Platforms’ VP of Research, who previously criticized the NYT’s article, condemned the DAME tax.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) climbed on Tuesday, gaining more than 2% on signs the U.S. banking crisis isn’t yet over. Helping the bullish tone was the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which showed job openings declining to their lowest level since April 2021. Ether (ETH) also gained, climbing 1.5%. Bitcoin layer 2 Stacks (STX) outperformed the majority of crypto assets, soaring 13% over the last 24-hours. Last week, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance, announced it would support the network’s upgrade and hardfork. Stacks upgraded its network earlier today to fix a bug that was found in another recent upgrade. STX has surged 177% over the last 3 months, according to data from Messari.  Crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG) said Chief Financial Officer Michael Kraines stepped down in April, and revealed that it fully repaid a $350 million senior secured term loan during the first quarter. Kraines became CFO two years ago. DCG has engaged Heidrick & Struggles for a new CFO search, according to a letter to shareholders, while President Mark Murphy and Chief Strategy Officer Simon Koster run the finance department in the meantime. Also in the letter, DCG, which is CoinDesk's parent company, reported first-quarter revenue of $180 million, up 63% from the fourth quarter, thanks to rising crypto prices. First quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was negative $6 million.  Frenzied trading activity has pushed the newly-launched pepe token (PEPE) to garner trading volumes higher than those of dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) – which previously were biggest memecoins by trading volumes. PEPE trading volumes surged to over $250 million in the past 24 hours following a 100% price spike during a weekend rally. Over the same period, trading volumes on dogecoin stood at $225 million, while shiba inu volumes were only $100 million. Data from CoinGecko show crypto exchange OKX had over $76 million in trading volumes for PEPE tokens, followed by $43 million at the decentralized exchange Uniswap. The bulk of these volumes may have been generated by automated bots, which continually buy and sell tokens to generate trading activity and provide liquidity to investors in turn for a few dollars of profits.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price movements since the third mining reward halving, dated May 2020, look similar to the price action following the previous reward halvings.  If history is a guide, the path of least resistance for cryptocurrency is on the higher side.  The fourth halving, or programmed 50% reduction in per-block BTC issuance, is due next year.

42393596,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1BFj,1683115942,TrueUSD's Borrowing Rates Jumped to 100% as TUSD Soared to $1.20: Kaiko,"Traders quickly jumped in to take advantage of trueUSD’s (TUSD) depegging event Tuesday to capture a potential 20% gain – paying an outrageously large amount in fees to be able to do so.  Crypto analytics firm Kaiko said in a Wednesday newsletter that on-chain traders utilized Aave and Compound, two popular lending protocols, to borrow large amounts of TUSD and then quickly swapp these holdings for USD coin (USDC), another dollar-pegged token.  Such a move was to effectively short, or bet against, TUSD from its elevated price. However, neither Aave nor Compound had a large supply of TUSD, which caused borrowing rates to hit over 100% annualized on both protocols.  Kaiko said these token conversions appeared to be organic instead of driven by automated bots. The firm added TUSD’s depegging likely occurred due to the lack of liquidity backing its intended $1 peg.  “Binance has recently been promoting TUSD, making BTC-TUSD the only zero-fee pair on the exchange,” Kaiko wrote. “This quickly made Binance BTC-TUSD one of the highest-volume pairs in all of crypto despite TUSD being relatively unknown amongst stablecoins.”  “Additionally, TUSD liquidity has not kept pace with its volumes, making a depegging like this more likely,” it added.  Binance has shied away from Binance USD (BUSD), which it offered in association with crypto firm Paxos, since regulatory troubles earlier this year. Paxos said at the time it would stop minting new BUSD tokens at the direction of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  Traders have quickly adopted TUSD on Binance.

12319684,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4599305-big-problems-dogging-coinbase-aside-from-sec?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1683115892,Here Are The Big Problems Dogging Coinbase (Aside From The SEC),"Summary Recent coverage of Coinbase has centered almost entirely on its dispute with the SEC. We explore in this article whether or not Coinbase operates a quality business outside of its regulatory woes. We think there are major problems at the company that would keep us away even if the SEC wasn't in the picture. Background If the principal aim of Coinbase ( COIN ) executives were to avoid a high public profile, the past few weeks would be considered an abysmal failure. Coinbase has dominated headlines over the past several months with its vocal and aggressive engagement with the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] and the subsequent Wells notice that was delivered by the SEC to the company. The subsequent media circus surrounding Coinbase has generated some wildly heated debate amongst crypto skeptics and proponents alike--so much so that we believe that the question of whether Coinbase operates a quality business worthy of investment at all has been largely relegated to second place. We also believe that it is difficult for investors to find a dispassionate analysis of the company, since proponents and detractors of cryptocurrency often argue for or against Coinbase based on their view of crypto more broadly rather than on the merits of Coinbase as a business. In this article we'll attempt to do just that. Let's dive in. The Business Coinbase operates an online cryptocurrency exchange where profits are earned on a commission taken from customers for each trade executed, or through the company's subscription service, Coinbase One, where customers pay a monthly fee to trade up to a certain amount. Customers can do more than simply trade on the Coinbase platform. They can store their assets on the platform for free, and they can also engage in staking, which is essentially pledging one's assets in return for yield (Coinbase does a commission on all staking rewards received). The exchange business is very old and quite complex, but the basics are simple: exchanges can model their revenue as they like, taking either a flat fee per trade or a percentage of the amount of each trade. Coinbase takes the latter approach, charging a 1% fee for each trade made (meaning 2% per round trip) under $10,000, with the amount charged sliding down as trade amounts increase. Show Me The Money Coinbase's revenue, then, is highly dependent on two things: The price of various crypto assets, and Trading volume on its platform. Let's start with volume. According to crypto market data aggregator Coingecko , roughly 40% of Coinbase's transaction volume is in Bitcoin, with Ethereum coming in a distant second at 18%. Investors should know, then, how reliant Coinbase's earnings are on the price and trading volume of Bitcoin. This is why the collapse of FTX was such a drain on the company. As trust eroded throughout the crypto exchange ecosystem, volumes understandably decreased. Of course, crypto bulls have espoused that this fall in trading volumes is, at worse, a blip on the radar. Even on the latest conference call Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was touting an oft-quoted figure in the crypto world, that about 20% of American households have utilized or use crypto in some form, with the implication explicitly being that American adoption of crypto is expanding. It is surprising, then, that crypto trading volumes on Coinbase have been roughly flat to slightly down over the past year. Coingecko, accessed March 2, 2023 Looking back over the past year, trading volumes until November 2022 routinely come close to or pushed through the $2.5 billion mark. Since December 2022, only four trading days surpassed $2.5 billion traded on the Coinbase platform (January 12, January 14, March 13, and March 14). Regardless, the volume trend for Coinbase's exchange trade volume is, at best, flat, which is... not bullish. Coinbase's own disclosures in its 10K paint, arguably, an even worse picture of volume deterioration (keep in mind the Coingecko chart paints a picture of volumes up until May 2023, while the table below displays Coinbase data for the year ending 2022). Company Filings While verified users on the platform were up by 24% year over year, monthly transacting users (a measurement of overall user engagement with the platform), fell by 26%. Trading volume year over year was even worse, falling by 50%. Of course, the dollar volume traded is only part of the equation--the performance of the assets being traded matters, too. Unfortunately for Coinbase, the assets with the heaviest trading volumes on its platforms have had pretty negative years. Koyfin Excluding Tether (which seeks to maintain a 1:1 relationship with the dollar), only Litecoin (generally less than 5% of Coinbase's exchange volume) has turned in a positive trailing twelve months of performance, appreciating by 20%. Bitcoin, despite a rally in mid-2022, is down 27% on a TTM basis, with Ethereum down 32%. Solana and Dogecoin (each less than 5% of Coinbase's average exchange volume) are down 75% and 41%, respectively. The fact that prices are down is important, as it can have a chilling effect on potential investors and traders who may not be true crypto believers. Stock Based Compensation & A New Lawsuit This dissipation of trading volume and traded asset prices has taken a financial toll on Coinbase. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at only $604 million, compared with $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Shockingly, stock-based compensation has continued to climb at the company. Koyfin The above chart illustrates quarterly revenue (green bars) and stock based compensation (red bars) on a quarterly basis. Despite revenue falling off a cliff for the past three quarters, stock compensation has steadily risen-- reaching 71% of revenues in the fourth quarter. Of course Coinbase is no stranger to controversy when it comes to rewarding employees with stock--it was only today that a major, $1 billion lawsuit was dropped against the company alleging that executives and board members dumped shares ahead of Coinbase's direct listing, avoiding taking a share in the losses that followed said listing. The Bottom Line In this article we have avoided weighing in on Coinbase's ongoing dispute with the SEC, as there are plenty of good articles out there which opine on that issue. Our primary aim, instead, is to evaluate Coinbase's business model and its potential prospects. We caution investors against evaluating a business such as Coinbase through an emotional lens, or a lens of what one hopes for Coinbase to be--a vehicle to upend traditional finance, a world-changing company, et cetera. After all, if Coinbase proves to be those things, then in time the company will perform and there will likely to time to invest once things turn around. Today, however, does not appear to be that day. Since the company's exchange business shows clear deterioration, its traded assets are largely declining in value as of this writing, company insiders are actively rewarding themselves with what we consider to be exorbitant amounts of stock based compensation when compared to revenue, and the company appears to be under pressure from a new, large, serious lawsuit (oh, and we haven't even mentioned the SEC), we believe that investors should be aware of all the risks before buying into Coinbase at this time--if at all.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4599305-big-problems-dogging-coinbase-aside-from-sec?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12319684.jpeg

Although the general crypto market is volatile, STX shows positive moves on the price chart. STX increased progressively in 2023 despite some price pullbacks due to price volatility. It traded at $0.213 on January 1, 2023, and moved to the $0.3 price range on February 3. It increased to $0.6439 by February 19 and hit $0.9 on February 27 for the first time in 2023. STX reached $1.1762 on March 17 after some price fluctuations. However, the bears were still active in the market, forcing a retreat back to the $0.7 price in April and early May. However, its price action is still positive. Stacks (STX) Price Analysis STX is in the green today, forming a higher high on the price chart as the bulls seek to reclaim the earlier gains. The $0.6786 support acted as a price pivot as it approached its closest resistance level of $0.8238. Also, STX is trading above its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a bullish sentiment in the long term. Related Reading: Top 5 Cryptos To Watch This Week Amid US Banking Crisis However, STX is still below its 50-day SMA since its decline on April 13, 2023. This is a bearish sentiment in the short term that shows the bears are still active in the market. Also, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is slightly above its signal line and shows a negative value. It is also a bearish sentiment. However, the MACD’s histogram bars show a green bar forming, which indicates a positive trend reversal ahead. STX’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 51.59 in the neutral zone. Note that the indicator is moving upwards, signifying the possibility of an uptrend. Although it is too optimistic to expect the asset to return to the $1 price level, it is still a long-term possibility. Expect a break above the $0.8238 resistance in the coming days if the bulls sustain the current rally. Binance Announces Support For STX Network Upgrade The apex global crypto exchange, Binance, declared support for the STX network upgrade and hard fork. The upgrade and hard fork will occur at the Bitcoin block height of 787,651. Consequently, STX deposits and withdrawals will be suspended at the Bitcoin block height of 787,645. Related Reading: AVAX Smart Contracts Hit 6-Month High – What This Means For Its Price Binance stated that STX trading would not be affected by the network upgrade and hard fork. Additionally, it will not result in the creation of new tokens. The exchange hopes to reopen deposits and withdrawals once the network is stable, promising to alert its users when this happens. This upgrade is likely a result of a bug noticed on the network. Subsequently, the developers will likely incorporate more security features into the Stacks Bitcoin layer.

In a Tuesday filing, Mashinsky’s lawyers responded to claims by New York Attorney General Letitia James that he had misled investors about the now-failed crypto lender’s financial health while he was chief executive.  The complaint “parrots misinformation online about Mashinsky and Celsius Network, LLC … borrows others’ baseless conclusions” and “demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of Celsius’s business, and Mashinsky’s role therein,” said the filing, which seeks dismissal of the lawsuit.  The bankruptcy filing, made in July, was due to “calamitous, external events” that were outside the control of Celsius or its CEO, the filing added. It said James “cynically cherry-picks fragments of statements and sound bites” of YouTube videos made to reassure investors.  “The Earn accounts at issue were not securities under well-established law and the Complaint fails to plead adequately the existence of securities or commodities in Celsius’ business model,” the filing said. Mashinsky's filing also disputes James’ claims the company should have been registered with the state as a dealer in financial instruments.  In January, James said Mashinsky used “false and misleading representations” to induce customers to deposit billions of dollars, promising high yields from loans said to be of low risk, via YouTube videos and other promotional material.  Also in January, Shoba Pillay, an independent examiner appointed as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, found the company’s business model “differed significantly” from what it told customers, and that Mashinsky’s claim to always have 200% collateral was “far off the mark.”  Mashinsky resigned as CEO in September and is the subject of legal action to recover funds that Celsius and its creditors say were fraudulently transferred.

42393600,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1BfN,1683115200,Crypto Trading Platform Enclave Starts Fully Encrypted Spot Exchange,"Crypto trading platform Enclave Markets has started a fully encrypted spot exchange, Enclave Spot, because of continued interest from institutional investors, the company said on Wednesday.  “Spot trading is a popular form of trading across the entire financial ecosystem, thus the launch of Enclave Spot was the next clear step in the evolution of Enclave Markets,” Enclave CEO David Wells said.  Like a traditional exchange, Enclave Spot is intended to allow traders to buy and sell cryptocurrencies nearly instantly, but it differs in that it is hosted entirely within a secure enclave, a codebase that executes functions such as custody and trade execution. This ensures that no customer data can be leaked and used as an unfair advantage for some traders.  “The secure enclave environment is an important improvement from the existing exchange infrastructure, where information leakage enables preferential treatment for insiders,” Wells told CoinDesk.  The new platform is secured by independent attestors, including Blockdaemon, Ava Labs, Republic Crypto and Enclave, that oversee custody, review code updates and ensure that no entity has unilateral control.  Enclave Spot will be fully interoperable with Enclave Cross, the company’s previously launched trading platform that allows users to trade blocks of digital assets off-chain, similar to dark pool trading.  Enclave Cross surpassed 1.5 million transactions in the first few months after its launch in September, the company said, with its user base increasing more than 225% quarter over quarter.

12318615,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529636,1683112833,"New “Ethereum Killer” SUI Launches Today, What You Need To Know","Today is the day, the long-awaited launch of the next “Ethereum killer” SUI is taking place at 8:15 am EST (12:15 UTC). From a purely technical standpoint, SUI does a few things differently compared to Ethereum, and therefore the expectations are high. In addition to the bankrupt exchange FTX, the project has numerous notable backers, including Circle, Binance Labs, and Electric Capital. The designated proof-of-stake (dPoS) blockchain has an entirely new architecture that is supposed to outshine even the “high-speed” blockchain Solana. Many of Sui’s developers previously worked on the Meta (Facebook)-launched project Diem, which was scrapped some time ago due to regulatory headwinds. The developers behind Sui, Mysten Labs, are one of two spinoffs from Diem, the second being none other than Aptos, which celebrated its mainnet launch last October. The former Meta employees founded Mysten Labs back in 2021 to develop Sui. Why Sui Is Being Hyped One of the things that sets the Sui blockchain apart is its tremendous processing speed of data, which no other layer-1 blockchain can match. In testing, Sui already brought it to more than 300,000 transactions per second (tps). This far exceeds even Solana (65,000 TPS). Likewise, Sui has a big speed advantage in transaction confirmation time. While Solana needs around 20 seconds, Sui’s is only 450 milliseconds. In terms of scalability, Mysten Labs says that the system design is designed to allow horizontal scalability, which is not capped. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analysis: How To Prepare For Today’s FOMC Meeting In addition to Sui’s high throughput and low latency, the project also touts a third advantage: the ability to process arbitrary amounts of data on chain. To do this, SUI makes use of a storage fund that redistributes fees for past transactions to future validators. In other words, users pay upfront fees for both computation and storage. When storage requirements on-chain are high, validators receive additional rewards to offset their costs. Conversely, when storage requirements are low. These three benefits are meant to take the use cases of blockchain technology to the next level. Tokenomics While IOUs were already trading on smaller exchanges ahead of the official launch of the blockchain at 8 am EST (2 pm CET), well-known crypto exchanges such as Binance, OKX, KuCoin, and ByBit have announced the listing of the new token as soon as liquidity requirements are met. Binance, for example, said it expected to begin trading SUI/BTC, SUI/USDT, SUI/TUSD and SUI/BNB at 8:15 am EST. Related Reading: Top 5 Cryptos To Watch This Week Amid US Banking Crisis SUI’s token supply has a cap of 10 billion tokens. As stated by the Sui Foundation, a portion of the total supply is expected to be liquid when the mainnet launches today. The remaining tokens will be transferred or distributed as future reward grants for shares in the coming years. In the Sui economy, the token has four purposes. It can be used to participate in the proof-of-stake mechanism. It is the asset required to pay gas fees to conduct transactions and other operations. Furthermore, the token is an asset that supports the entire economy with its value. Ultimately, the token plays an important role in governance as it serves as the right to participate in voting on-chain.

42393608,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1CA9,1683112438,"Bitcoin, Ether Could Face Risks From Potential Short Squeeze in Dollar Index, QCP Capital Says","The top two cryptocurrencies by market value, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), have rallied 70% and 56% this year, outshining traditional risk assets by a significant margin.  However, the good times may stop rolling if the heavily shorted U.S. dollar, which has recently found a ""double bottom"" price floor against major fiat currencies, sees a short squeeze – a rally powered by an unwinding of bearish bets, as per Singapore-based options trading firm QCP Capital.  ""The biggest obstacle for crypto remains the USD – where we think the market is heavily positioned to the short side and vulnerable to a short squeeze, which could take BTC/ETH and gold lower in response,"" QCP's markets insights team said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  Bitcoin has historically moved in the opposite direction to the dollar index. The negative correlation between the two has recently strengthened, meaning a short squeeze in the dollar could weigh over the leading cryptocurrency and the broader market.  Shorting refers to taking bearish bets on an asset's price. A short squeeze occurs when the heavily shorted asset moves higher, forcing bears with open short positions to buy back the asset to cover losses. That, in turn, adds to upward pressure on prices.  The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, peaked at 114.78 in late September last year and has fallen over 13% since then on hopes the Federal Reserve will pivot away from interest rate hikes. According to Scotiabank data sourced from the Wall Street Journal, hedge fund managers' bets against the dollar rose to around $12.2 billion as of April 25.  Will the dollar see a short squeeze?  The greenback could see a short squeeze if Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell maintains a data-dependent policy stance on Wednesday, contradicting markets positioned for hints of a so-called dovish pivot in favor of renewed rate cuts.  ""Looking at the Fed pricing, you can certainly say the pivot is fully priced in. It is the U.S. banking crisis/debt ceiling/recession that is the beta for the [U.S. dollar] from here. We believe that the 12% drop in the USD is pricing in the more pessimistic scenarios on these three and which we believe make it ripe for a short-term squeeze,"" QCP's team told CoinDesk.  The CME FedWatch tool show traders expect the Fed to deliver its final 25 basis point rate hike later Wednesday and resort to rate cuts from July. The central bank kicked off its tightening cycle in March of last year, roiling risk assets including cryptocurrencies, and has raised rates by 475 basis points since then.  Double bottom in DXY  Two weeks ago, the dollar index bounced up from levels close to its February low of 100.82, confirming what is known as the bullish ""double bottom"" pattern in technical analysis.  The pattern tells us that buyers have held strong twice around the same area, creating a floor for a move higher in prices.  ""We note the positive divergence in RSI and MACD, and a potential double bottom at 101,"" QCP's insights team said. ""For the USD (DXY), the key level to the topside is 102.5, where we expect a break higher to lead to a sharp correction lower in crypto.""  The relative strength index is an indicator used to gauge overbought and oversold conditions, while the MACD measures trend strength and trend changes. A positive divergence occurs when the asset's price hits a new cyclical low while the RSI and/or MACD begins to climb, indicating an impending bullish shift in momentum.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/03/bitcoin-ether-rally-at-risk-from-potential-short-squeeze-and-double-bottom-in-dollar-index-crypto-options-trading-firm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b4f597a795d45ea5db4bcaf19efad1c8e5a0c27-1920x1465.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393601,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1BkV,1683111600,Blockstream Developer Neigut Expects ‘Cambrian Explosion’ of Bitcoin Layer 2 Protocols,"The Bitcoin ecosystem, derided in some crypto developer circles for its slow pace of technological advancement, is now on the verge of a layer 2 “Cambrian explosion.”  That’s according to Lisa Neigut, a Lightning Protocol engineer for the Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream, during her presentation on the “state of the chain” at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2023 conference last week.  The catalyst will be increased functionality from new features including covenants and script updates, according to Neigut. Covenants such as bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 118 (also known as SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, or APO for short) are Bitcoin smart contracts that put constraints on how a bitcoin (BTC) can be spent. Script updates include a proposal by Blockstream to introduce Simplicity, a new programming language for Bitcoin smart contracts.  The network is already in the midst of a technical renaissance attributable to the introduction of Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFT) via the Ordinals protocol. More than 3.3 million of these NFTs or “inscriptions” have been produced in under five months.  Bitcoin development tends to be slow and steady, but Neigut says the flywheel effect will be triggered once certain functionality is in place on the base layer.  “APO is going to, hopefully, unlock a Cambrian explosion with these script updates and new covenants,” Neigut said. “So I think a lot of new layer 2 stuff will come in the future.”  The world’s dominant blockchain already has one of the most diverse layer 2 ecosystems of any network. Bitcoin currently boasts six major layer 2 protocols – the Lightning payment network, the Liquid sidechain, the Fedimint and Cashu protocols, wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and Bitcoin statechains.  Bitcoin’s diverse layer 2 ecosystem  Lightning  The Lightning Network is a Bitcoin layer 2 scaling system, or more precisely a payment channel network, where a collection of interconnected computers route bitcoin payments off-chain.  Ryan Gentry, director of business development at Lightning infrastructure firm Lightning Labs, said during his own presentation at Consensus that Lightning is the only network of its kind in crypto. “Lightning is unique,” Gentry said. “There is not, to my knowledge, another widespread payment channel network in the whole crypto space. Lightning is the only one and it’s scaling really well.”  Lightning’s network capacity – the total amount of bitcoin in the system – is currently just over 5,425 BTC (almost $155 million).  Liquid  Blockstream published a white paper on sidechains as early as 2014. The firm currently has a fully functional Bitcoin sidechain – a secondary blockchain that interacts with a primary blockchain – called Liquid, that allows users to issue security tokens and other digital assets.  Fedimint and Cashu  Both Fedimint and Cashu are Bitcoin custody protocols. They borrow from a concept called “Chaumian mints,” originally conceived in 1983 by renowned computer scientist and cryptographer, David Chaum.  Chaumian mints use blind signatures to preserve user privacy. Blind signatures allow a sender’s message to be cryptographically blinded (or hidden) before being digitally signed by the recipient, thereby preserving the sender’s anonymity.  Fedimint goes a step further by combining Chaumian mints with multi-signature (multisig) capability and communities or federations that help their members with bitcoin custody to create a protocol that enables community-based custody.  Wrapped bitcoin  Wrapped tokens are synthetic (or tokenized) versions of crypto assets that are not native to the blockchains on which they exist.  Wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) is an ERC-20 token backed by 1 BTC and typically used in the Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  Bitcoin statechains  Bitcoin statechains are the brainchild of self-styled “Bitcoin Sorcerer” Ruben Somsen. Statechain users hold bitcoin in a 2-of-2 multisig wallet controlled by the user and some statechain federation (a group of entities). When the user wants to transfer funds, they simply hand over their private key (also called the transitory key) to the recipient.  Statechains offer a scaling benefit similar to Lightning because they are conducted off-chain.  What’s coming down the pike  Some Bitcoin layer 2s such as Lightning have been around for years. Others such as Cashu are still experimental. Neigut says new developments like Bitcoin’s “Inquisition Signet” testnet will not only help fast-track some of those experimental projects, but will also test the robustness of new proposals.  Some of those proposals may include things like validity rollups, first written about by Bitcoin researcher John Light. A validity rollup would combine large numbers of transactions off-chain, validate those transactions, then submit the validated batch as a single “rolled up” transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain.  “There’s a lot more that’s going on in Bitcoin,” said Neigut. “Miniscripts, which is a new way of expressing and writing Bitcoin contracts. CoinSwaps, which is a way of exchanging bitcoin in a way that makes it a lot harder for a third party to tell who sent coins to whom. I’ve just touched on the tip of the iceberg.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/03/blockstream-developer-neigut-expects-cambrian-explosion-of-bitcoin-layer-2-protocols,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52d0a6d35cea3f9a8b201906171bea8dde2f58ae-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ADA could decline further if there is a clear move below the $0.38 support. ADA price is struggling to gain pace above $0.40 and $0.415 against the US dollar. The price is trading below $0.400 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.398 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a decent increase if it clears the $0.400 resistance zone. Cardano’s ADA Price Faces Resistance This past week, Cardano’s price made a couple of attempts to clear the $0.415 resistance. However, the bulls struggled to gain strength for a sustained move above $0.415. As a result, there was a fresh decline toward the $0.38 support. A low is formed near $0.3800 and the price is showing a few bearish signs, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is now trading below $0.400 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.398 zone. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.398 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $0.4149 swing high to the 0.3800 low. The next major resistance is forming near the $0.400 zone or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $0.4149 swing high to the 0.3800 low is also near $0.4015. If there is an upside break above the $0.402 and $0.405 resistance levels, the price could start a decent increase. Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price could even surpass the $0.415 resistance zone. The next key resistance might be $0.432, above which it could test $0.45. More Losses? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.400 and $0.415 resistance levels, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.380 level. The next major support is near the $0.365 level. A downside break below the $0.365 level could open the doors for a fresh decline toward $0.350. The next major support is near the $0.325 level.

Senators appear to favor less restrictive measures than their counterparts in Paris’ National Assembly, who in March voted to effectively ban crypto ads by social media stars.  ​​The amendment, passed in committee and set to be discussed in the Senate plenary next week, would allow crypto companies to pay for publicity via influencers if they are either registered with or have a license from regulators.  The Senate plan aligns the bill with the existing French Consumer Code, according to an explanatory note by lead lawmaker Amel Gacquerre, a member of the Centrist Union party. The bill also clamps down on influencers advertising cosmetics and gambling.  The National Assembly previously took a tougher line, saying that influencers should only be allowed to promote products from crypto companies that have a license from the Financial Markets Authority – which, in practice, no firm has. In contrast, dozens of companies including Binance, Bitstamp and eToro have registered with the regulator, which confirms they meet money laundering and governance norms.  The bill would normally have to be agreed by both Senate and Assembly to pass into law. Industry lobby group ADAN, which has previously said the Assembly’s position could harm the country’s aspiration to be a crypto hub, tweeted on Wednesday that the committee's stance was “encouraging.”  French lawmakers have also tightened up registration conditions as they seek to prepare for new European Union rules known as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which sets tougher rules for stablecoin issuers, wallet providers and crypto exchanges.

The tokens, called inscriptions, function on the Ordinals Protocol, which allows users to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.  The jump follows the introduction of the Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC-20) token standard, allowing users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network. That spurred a collection of digital artwork and meme tokens built on Bitcoin. Market capitalization of the latter category jumped to $137 million on Tuesday.  Still, most inscriptions are text-based, data shows. These cost much less than digital art or meme coins because network fees are dependent on the amount of data inscribed.  Monday saw over 372,000 unique inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, of which 371,000 were text based. Just 316 image-based inscriptions were created, with the remaining being applications or tokens.  Creators paid a cumulative 28 bitcoin (BTC) in fees for making the inscriptions, adding to the nearly 284 bitcoin in lifetime fees generated from Ordinals activity. That’s over $8 million at current prices.  Meanwhile, tokens focused on Bitcoin’s ecosystem usage grew in price as inscriptions surged.  Stacks’ stx (STX) token gained over 12% in the past 24 hours, outperforming the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks the broader crypto market and gained just 1.2%.

Despite the obstacles, the blockchain platform’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, managed to hold its ground and even make some notable gains along the way. The recently released monthly report for April by Cardano has shed light on some intriguing developments regarding the network’s activity. The update offers insights into various aspects of Cardano’s performance during the month of April, presenting a comprehensive overview of the platform’s progress. Related Reading: Top 5 Cryptos To Watch This Week Amid US Banking Crisis Here’s what’s up with Cardano: Network Activity Shows Positive Growth Despite Challenges Cardano’s latest monthly report for April indicates that the network experienced a healthy uptick in transaction activity, with a 2.49% increase to 65.6 million transactions and a 1.19% growth in the number of wallets. The report reveals that simple transactions made up the majority, accounting for 49% of total transactions, while smart contract transactions grew by 30% and metadata made up the rest. The report suggests that Cardano’s increasing utility is driving significant growth. #Cardano On-chain Stats 🚀 Let’s keep growing #CardanoCommunity! 💪 pic.twitter.com/6Ct5iGW67k — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) May 1, 2023 However, despite the positive network activity, ADA’s price has seen a decline in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.3875, a drop of 0.34%. The cryptocurrency’s bearish performance has continued, with a further drop of 2.43% in the past seven days. It remains to be seen how Cardano’s growth in network activity will affect ADA’s price in the long term. ADA Positive April 1st Half Followed By Market Decline Meanwhile, aside from the network activity growth, Cardano’s monthly report also highlighted ADA’s impressive performance in the first two weeks of April, with a 23% price gain. However, the cryptocurrency then experienced a significant decline, losing almost all of the gains it had made.

The TVL did experience a dip in the latter half of the month, settling at $152.90 million, but remained above its April low. Its current TVL is at $149.72 million.

An unstable support level could lead to a retest of the mid-term support range of $0.35-$0.36.

The Nasdaq-listed miner and the government's commercial arm, Druk Holding & Investments, will establish a $500 million fund to raise money for the venture from international investors and expect fundraising efforts to start this month, according to an emailed statement Wednesday.  The funds raised will be used to construct data centers in the country. They will be powered by hydropower, which provides the country with virtually all of its electricity. Bhutan's goal for the venture is to ""accelerate the Kingdom's digital transformation and economic diversification by exploring emerging sectors.""  For Bitdeer, the partnership will ""mark a crucial expansion into Asia,"" the Singapore-based firm said. It currently operates six mining sites in Washington state, Texas, Tennessee and Norway.  Bitdeer listed on the Nasdaq last month through special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. Since listing, BTDR has fallen nearly 30%, trading at $7.19 at Tuesday's close.  Like almost all its peers, Bitdeer suffered a torrid 2022, incurring losses of $62.4 million compared with profit of $82.6 million the year before.

42420623,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqPhF,1683101741,Fed Preview: Crypto Observers Believe Bitcoin Rally May Stall if Powell Does Not Signal End of Tightening,"Bitcoin (BTC), the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market value and a macro asset that closely tracks U.S. dollar liquidity metrics, has seen a resurgence this year, with the price rising 70% since Jan. 1.  But the rally may run into a temporary roadblock if Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell does not signal a highly anticipated pause to the tightening cycle on Wednesday, according to some observers.  The Fed will announce its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET (18:00 UTC). Half an hour later, Powell will speak at the post-meeting press conference. The CME FedWatch tool shows traders expect the central bank to raise rates one final time by 25 basis points to the 5%-5.25% range, ending the so-called tightening cycle that roiled cryptocurrencies last year. Further, traders are pricing rate cuts starting in July.  Dovish expectations have strengthened as multiple uncertainties have recently risen in the form of the debt ceiling, recession fears, crisis at regional banks and bearish speculative fervor in banking stocks.  The aggressive pricing of pause and rate cuts means Powell needs to confirm the same during his presser, or else the Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar (USD) may bounce. An uptick in yields and the dollar has historically been bearish for bitcoin.  ""As the market is expecting a pause after this hike, we'll be looking for the sentence on 'additional policy firming may be appropriate' to be removed from the statement, replaced by more open-ended language leaving the door open for either more rate hikes or a pause, i.e., data-dependency,"" Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven crypto trading firm TDX Strategies, told CoinDesk.  ""We expect that Chair Powell may shy away from being definitive when it comes to a pause which may disappoint the market,"" Lo added.  Markets have seen a classic risk-on action since October 2022, mainly anticipating a dovish Fed pivot. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has declined by over 14% since early October. Meanwhile, Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index and bitcoin have rallied 25% and 50% over the same period.  Thus, the lack of conviction from Powell in signaling the pivot may disappoint markets, as Lo warned, triggering a recovery in the greenback.  Chris Weston, head of research at foreign-exchange brokerage Pepperstone, voiced a similar opinion on Twitter.  ""Sure, bank equity has been hit – but with nothing priced for June and cuts starting in July, if the Fed offers a lazy tightening bias (data dependent), it feels the risk [is] skewed on the hawkish side,"" Weston said.  Weston said the pre-Fed dovish pricing is similar to the setup seen before the Reserve Bank of Australia's recent rate decision. The RBA on Monday lifted rates by 25 basis points and warned of more tightening ahead, contradicting expectations for a continued pause and eventual easing later this year. The hawkish surprise prompted the Aussie dollar to surge across the board.  According to Weston, the post-meeting bounce in yields and the dollar, if any, could add to banking sector woes and will likely be short-lived. Bitcoin has performed positively during the recent banking turmoil, strengthening its safe-haven appeal.  ""I would assume this initial move [higher in USD] would be short-lived as any decent spike in bond yields would see bank equity take another leg lower and traders would simply reapply USD and crude shorts and buy gold and JPY as a hedge,"" Weston noted.  Some observers, however, do not foresee a sustained dollar rally, irrespective of what Powell says at the post-meeting press conference.  ""The U.S. dollar is unlikely to rally here as the expectations for an eventual dovish pivot by the Fed will be kept alive - no matter if the Fed hikes again or signals another hike,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said.  ""The stress is the banking sector is deflationary and energy costs have declined materially. The Fed is also seeing progress in their request for a higher unemployment rate and this should provide comfort that rate hikes are coming to an end. Bitcoin is likely to rally on a dovish pivot,"" Thielen added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/03/fed-preview-bitcoin-rally-may-run-into-a-hiccup-if-powell-sticks-to-data-dependent-policy-path-crypto-observers-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15eda0c4fd5e55b22dd8825ce9d01f811a64b659-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

12313603,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529602,1683097854,Bitcoin Analysis: How To Prepare For Today’s FOMC Meeting,"Today’s interest rate decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) and the following press conference by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) could make up for this year’s most important day so far for the Bitcoin price. In March, the Fed had raised the benchmark interest rate by another 0.25 basis points (bps). At the time, central bankers were leaving their next steps open. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell clarified that further rate hikes “may be appropriate” and that the decision “will be data dependent.” 25 Bps Expected Despite Strong Headwinds Most recently, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprised on the upside with an annualized decline to 5.0% (from 6.0%), but core inflation is proving to be very sticky. Nevertheless, the market expects today’s 0.25 basis point rate hike to be the last in this cycle. According to the CME’s FedWatch tool, 89% of market participants believe the Fed will make this move today, despite facing strong headwinds from U.S. politics yesterday. Democratic-led members of Congress called on the Fed to pause rate hikes. Ten senators and representatives, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, expressed concern about the Fed’s monetary policy strategy in a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday and urged avoiding “a recession that kills jobs and crushes small businesses.” Also arguing against continued aggressive policy is the fact that the fastest rate hike cycle in Fed history has caused deep cracks in the U.S. banking system. Following the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank, numerous other regional U.S. banks plunged deep into negative territory yesterday. US Regional Bank Stock This Year: 1. HomeStreet, $HMST: -75%2. PacWest, $PACW: -71%3. Metropolitan Bank, $MCB: -64%4. Zions Bank, $ZION: -51%5. Western Alliance, $WAL: -47%6. KeyCorp, $KEY: -45%7. HarborOne, $HONE: -39%8. Valley National, $VLY: -35%9. Truist, $TFC: -33%… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) May 2, 2023 In addition, the recent collapse of First Republic Bank exacerbates the credit crunch: a decline in bank lending due to a sudden tightening of bank deposits. As the AP reported yesterday, assets are worth less than liabilities at half of the 4,800 U.S. banks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Update: Up Or Down, What’s Next As Fed Rate Hike Looms? “It’s spooky. Thousands of banks are underwater,” said Professor Amit Seru, a banking expert at Stanford University. “We shouldn’t pretend this is just about Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. A large part of the U.S. banking system is potentially insolvent.” That’s another reason the market continues to call Powell’s bluff. According to CME FedWatch, the market believes the Fed will not only pause after today’s meeting, but also cut rates twice this year – unlike the Fed, which in its latest dot plot forecasts a terminal rate of 5.0% by the end of the year. Bitcoin Analysis: How to Prepare A 25 basis point rate hike is already priced in by the market and is not expected to hammer the Bitcoin price. When the interest rate decision is announced at 2 p.m. EST (8 p.m. CET), no major volatility should be expected, which will be coming with the press conference. The only exception is a big surprise: an early pause. However, this scenario seems extremely unlikely. Due to this, all eyes will be on the FOMC press conference at 2:30 pm EST (8:30 pm CET). Probably the most important statement from Powell will be whether the Fed will pause interest rates in June. If so, the Bitcoin market is expected to immediately react bullish. If Powell denies this statement or states that it depends on the data, it would be bearish. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Hurdle And Remains At Risk of Additional Losses Another focus will be on the question of interest rate cuts later this year. Especially if Powell emphasizes that the Fed will keep interest rates high until 2024, it would be rather bearish for Bitcoin. The question will be whether Powell or the market is wrong, and who will fold first. Other important statements are expected on the US banking crisis and expectations of a soft landing (recession). Both of these topics have the potential to move the Bitcoin price. Meanwhile, traders should be careful with the initial move, as it often initially goes in the wrong direction. As analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) explained, hedges are typically unwound shortly after the announcement. Usually there is a short impulse up/down when these positions are unwound, and then “real” move occurs when the positions are bought back, which is why the price then falls/rises again. Once the short interest is removed, the spot market takes control of the actual move. “This is where you want to follow what spot CVDs are doing, and if it’s different from how perps are moving. following the press conference we should be able to gauge things more clearly as hedges will be unwound,” advises Ted. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $28,623.

Pepe trading volume surged to over $250 million in the past 24 hours amid a 100% price spike over the weekend in a rally that reversed on Tuesday night. Over the same period, trading volume on dogecoin stood at $225 million, while shiba inu volume were $100 million.  Data from CoinGecko shows crypto exchange OKX had over $76 million in trading volume for pepe tokens, followed by $43 million at the decentralized exchange Uniswap.  A bulk of the volume may be generated by automated bots, which continually buy and sell tokens to generate trading activity and provide liquidity to investors in turn for a few dollars of profits.  As such, a trade of more than $100,000 can cause a 2% dip in the pepe price on OKX, the data shows. In comparison, the same dip would take a trade of $800,000 for dogecoin on OKX, owing to its higher market capitalization and overall liquidity.  Early pepe buyers are taking profits, meanwhile.  On Monday one trader took a 40% slippage haircut to exit a pepe position on Uniswap in one go, as some Crypto Twitter traders observed. An analysis of the wallet address showed the trader had turned an ether (ETH) – valued at $1,800 at the time – to over $3 million worth of pepe in just over two weeks.  DEXTools data shows sellers are routinely selling from one ether to over 7 ether worth of the tokens as of Wednesday morning, contributing to selling pressure. However, buying activity remains strong – with 6,500 buys compared to 3,300 sells in the past 24 hours, the data shows.

The market’s confidence has taken a major hit as a result of this major development, especially over the possibility of a dovish attitude by the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. As a result, investors’ nerves have been on edge, and economic analysts are keeping a careful eye on the situation to determine its potential impact.

Investors and traders alike reacted to this news by taking a more cautious stance in the market. Since yesterday, the cryptocurrency market has been down 1%, as reported by CoinGecko. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum both fell in value by a small amount, the impact on the altcoin market was much greater. Even if this is only a short setback, these top 5 cryptos are still highly recommended for investor portfolios. Top 5 Cryptos To Watch This Week PEPE Much like DOGE and SHIB, PEPE is based on a meme that first appeared in 2005. Despite being the new kid on the block, the token is firmly bullish, with PEPE up 24% in the past 24 hours. The token is still experiencing a strong surge in investor interest which will be beneficial in the short to medium term. With its low price of $0.00000134, investors and traders can cash in some gains before the price stabilizes. RNDR Despite taking a beating in this week’s market environment, RNDR is still among the top cryptos in the market. The latest market data shows that the token is up 19% since last week. With recent on-chain developments siding with the bulls, the token’s position in investor portfolios is safe.

CSPR The governance token of the L1 blockchain Casper Network, CSPR experienced a slight dip in price as most cryptos in the market slipped.

The future of blockchain is modular 🤸 Build with us: https://t.co/OtgItFPXc5 — Casper (@Casper_Network) April 30, 2023 The token’s bulls are trying to stabilize the price above $0.05782. If they are successful, CSPR’s path to $0.06371 is open for the taking. However, a bearish breakthrough on this level might bring the token back toward $0.04355 in the medium to long term. INJ INJ has been one of the top gainers this week as the market fell slightly. CoinGecko data reveals that the token is up 10% since last week, ranking top four in the top gainers list. This bullishness was caused by Binance enabling institutional lending for Injective, opening up a new batch of possible investors on the platform. The token might drop toward $6.904 in the medium to long term before stabilizing at this price point. If this is the case, investors should monitor INJ’s price movements in the short to medium term.

As part of a gaming guild, gamers can rent in-game assets from one another and pay for such rentals with money earned in-game.

The advisory board chairman said in a press release: “I have long believed that the concept of players earning a share of the profits through gameplay was the future of all gaming.” Since at least 2017, Burton has shown an interest in cryptocurrency on a professional level. His LinkedIn page says that he had served on the Board of Advisors for the cryptocurrency education platform BitDegree. The Lithuanian crypto game Engines of Fury, which is currently in beta and describes itself as a “MOBA RPG” (a hybrid of the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre and role-playing games (RPG), has appointed him as Chairman of the Board of Advisors. Meanwhile, P2Earn CEO Alex Lineton was ecstatic to have Burton on board before the official release of the P2Earn Gaming Guild. Lineton said: “Jeff’s experience and network are not only legendary in the industry, but also proving invaluable to us as we begin to enter the next phase of growth of our Gaming Guild.” Under Burton’s guidance, Lineton said he is excited to bring on more gaming industry experts to the advisory board. -Featured image from p2earncorporate.io/",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/eas-jeff-burton-joins-p2earn/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12311741.jpeg

ETH formed a base and recently started an upside correction above $1,850, similar to Bitcoin at $28,000. The price was able to climb above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key drop from the $1,940 swing high to the $1,805 low.

As East Asia begins its business day, bitcoin and ether continue to climb, buoyed by another chapter of banking unrest and cooler-than-expected jobs data. Bitcoin is opening at $28,644, while ether is up 2% to $1,869.  While crypto traders continue to eye U.S. economic data, a new narrative is forming in South Korea – and one usual metric has been thrown out of whack.  During a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV, Matrixport’s head of research, Markus Thielen, said that Korea’s retail-focused crypto market continues to be strong. Korean traders, in particular, are interested in gaming, altcoins and XRP, which continues to surge in Korea.  ""We have also seen this in the last bull market at the end of 2017, when [XRP] accounted for 50% of all the volume, and it was predominantly traded in Korea,"" Thielen said.  Thielen also notes that specific altcoins are surging in Korea, including mass vehicle ledger and serum.  Bitcoin, for its part, remains at 48% dominance.  Despite this, data from CryptoQuant shows that the Korean “kimchi” premium remains weak. Without the buying pressure on Korean exchanges, there doesn’t seem to be the same price premium as before. Perhaps because the market is now interested in things other than bitcoin.

But whether it continues this aggressive monetary policy or retreats remains uncertain, Rust wrote.  “With the U.S. banking sector suffering a credit crunch following recent bank failures, and a buyout of First Republic … only just secured by U.S. regulators and JPMorgan, the Fed will be weighing its rate decisions carefully from this point on,” Rust wrote. “However, if inflation refuses to budge, we could well see another hike, despite tighter credit conditions. It’s worth remembering that while a 5% inflation rate is lower than last year, it still points to rapid price rises from already elevated levels.  He added: “Even if this hike turns out to be the Fed’s last, we don’t expect rates to come down from these levels any time soon.”  Fed critics have accused central bankers of spurring the current banking crisis through overly hawkish monetary policies. They had been hoping the bank would suspend its diet of rate hikes.  But Rust noted that the Fed has likely felt compelled to raise the rate amid mixed signals that suggest the economy is still revving too hot, which would mean inflation is not under control. Most notably, despite an unexpectedly weak Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), the job market remains robust.  He added that inflation, which has steadily declined over the past six months to its current 5% is likely to reverse at least slightly amid OPEC’s cut in oil production and increased demand for energy from China, which has reopened its economy. “This increase is already being reflected in the prices of energy commodities,” he wrote.  Rust wrote that against the current backdrop, another 25 basis points rate hike from the Federal Reserve is all but inevitable. After that, the central bank is likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach to evaluate the economic impact of its decision. After all, rates will have increased by a whopping 500 bps since March 2022, which is a lot for any economy to swallow.”  Important events  MicroStrategy World 2023  Web Summit Rio 2023  8:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(12:15 UTC) United States ISM Services PMI (April)  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Bitcoin Falls Toward $28K After Volatile Price Moves; Korea's Crypto Market Trends  Bitcoin’s decline on Monday contrasted with the asset’s lack of movement over the past six weeks.

42420626,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqPjJ,1683074221,"Binance, Coinbase Endure $700M in Staked Ether Outflows as Decentralized Liquid Staking Protocols Gain","Centralized crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase have suffered large outflows of staked ether (ETH) since Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade as investors flock to decentralized rivals, blockchain data shows.  Coinbase’s staking platform has endured a $367 million net outflow of staked ETH since April 12, as withdrawal requests – including reward withdrawals and full exits – outpaced new deposits, according to a Dune Analytics data dashboard. The staking service of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has had a net outflow of $340 million.  Decentralized liquid staking protocols, on the other hand, have enjoyed a sharp rise in deposits. Frax Finance and Rocket Pool, the two of the largest gainers, have recorded net inflows of $56 million and $68 million, respectively.  The development has followed Ethereum’s highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade on April 12, which allowed investors to withdraw some $35 billion of tokens previously locked up in staking contracts. Analysts predicted that the event would be a major milestone for the $225 billion network, likely boosting staking participation, attracting institutional investors and reshuffling the competition between staking services.  The upgrade has been “a major catalyst” for decentralized liquid staking systems, Ahmed Ismail, founder and chief executive of liquidity aggregator platform FLUID Finance, said.  Liquid staking protocols issue a derivative token that represents the amount of locked tokens and lets investors access decentralized finance (DeFi) services such as lending and borrowing.  Boosted by new deposits, the amount of ETH staked on Frax and Rocket Pool has grown 32.5% and 31% in the past 30 days, respectively, according to DefiLlama data.  Lido Finance, the largest decentralized liquid staking protocol, with some $11 billion of deposits, has also booked some $28 million (15,208 ETH) more deposits than withdrawals since April 12.  Regulatory concerns, higher yields  Regulatory risks and aversion to centralized crypto platforms after last year’s bankruptcies are likely among the reasons that drive investors to decentralized staking protocols, Tom Wan, an analyst at digital asset investment firm 21Shares, said in a note.  This February, crypto exchange Kraken agreed to shutter its staking service in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged the exchange with offering unregistered securities. Liquid staking tokens surged following the settlement as the SEC appeared to come after staking service providers, benefitting decentralized liquid staking.  Regulatory pressure on centralized entities may continue, John “Omakase” Lo, head of digital assets at investment firm Recharge Capital, said.  “The uncertainty isn’t good for retaining deposits,” he added.  Investors could also be swayed by higher staking rewards that decentralized protocols can provide. Currently, Coinbase and Binance offer around 4% annualized reward for staking ETH, whereas decentralized protocols Lido Finance and Frax Finance provide 5% to 7%.  “Centralized liquid staking usually has a lower yield profile. Compliance and staffing all add up,” Omakase said.  Despite recent outflows, Binance and Coinbase remain among the largest ETH staking providers. However, Binance’s market share fell to 4.5% from 5.7% a month ago, while Coinbase’s share dropped to 12.3% from 13%.  The two exchanges face further outflows, data by blockchain intelligence firm Nansen shows. Coinbase has some $191 million of staked ETH waiting to be withdrawn, while Binance has $41 million in withdrawal requests in its queue.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | RPL,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/03/binance-coinbase-endure-700m-in-staked-ether-outflows-as-decentralized-liquid-staking-protocols-gain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/984ba9187bd8e821f0c063127713086e62dd33f1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
